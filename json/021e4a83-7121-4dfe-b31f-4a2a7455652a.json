No matter how long or how hard she struggled, Skye couldn\u2019t escape from the handcuffs.</p><p>Or from the basement that she knew would be her grave.</p><p>The place smelled of blood and death. Fear. Her fear.</p> <p>Skye\u2019s breath sawed in her lungs. Hunger gnawed at her, twisting her stomach. The darkness was so complete.</p><p>She was trapped there. Skye knew that she would die there.</p><p>\u201cWeston is dead.\u201d The brutal words came to her in the darkness.</p><p>Weston. Trace Weston. Her Trace.</p><p>He was gone, and, soon, she would be dying, too.</p> <p>Because there was no escape from the darkness. Or from the monster that waited there with her.</p><p>\u201cSkye! Dammit, wake the fuck up!\u201d Hard hands grabbed her. Shook her.</p><p>Tore her right out of the nightmare.</p><p>Skye Sullivan\u2019s eyelids flew open. Light surrounded her, flooding from the nearby lamp and spilling onto the rumpled bed.</p><p>Trace leaned over her. His hands were wrapped tightly around her upper arms. His blue eyes\u2014so bright that sometimes it almost hurt to look into them\u2014blazed down at her. \u201cYou come back to me,\u201d he demanded, his voice a low, deep growl. \u201cYou come back now.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded in a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She couldn\u2019t suck in a breath that was deep enough, and Skye realized that her cheeks were wet with tears.</p> <p>Because that hadn\u2019t just been a nightmare.</p><p>It had been a memory.</p><p>Four weeks ago, her ex-lover, Mitch Loxley had kidnapped her. He\u2019d kept her captive in a basement. Starved her. If it hadn\u2019t been for Trace, Skye knew that she would\u2019ve died in that stinking pit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d she said, but the words were hoarse, as if she\u2019d been screaming.</p><p>When Mitch had taken her, she\u2019d screamed for hours. Days? Until her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore,\u201d Trace said. The faint lines around his eyes tightened as his gaze swept over her face. \u201cBaby, that bastard is rotting in the ground. He won\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to Trace. Because Trace had killed Mitch.</p><p>Memories can\u2019t hurt you.</p> <p>Lately, that had become her mantra.</p><p>Trace bent his head. His lips brushed over her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want you crying because of that SOB.\u201d</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been crying for Mitch. She\u2019d been crying because...in that twisted memory, Trace hadn\u2019t come to save her.</p><p>Trace had been dead.</p><p>She wet her dry lips and stared into his eyes. In one way or another, Trace had been the central point of her life since she\u2019d been fifteen years old.</p><p>He\u2019d saved her the first night they met. Her foster brother had been attacking her. Skye had been so certain that no one would hear her cries for help.</p><p>Trace had heard her.</p><p>Without him, sometimes she feared that she would be lost.</p><p>And that scared her to death.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she said, the words coming out in that same hoarse, husky tone.</p><p>His hold tightened on her.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d Skye told him, and it was the truth. Trace was real and strong, and she wanted him to banish the fear that twisted within her.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>Her hands rose up. Her fingers sank into the thickness of his midnight black hair, and she pulled his head toward her. Her lips met his. Open. Hungry. Desperate.</p><p>She licked his lips. Licked his tongue.</p><p>They were in bed. She was naked, tangled in the sheets. She needed\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you anything you want, you know that,\u201d Trace said, biting off the words against her lips. Then he yanked the sheets away from her. Flesh met flesh. He was warm and hard, his body strong with muscles, and he was alive.</p><p>His fingers slid down her body. Parted her legs. His fingers stroked her. Eased up and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Skye was surprised by the clipped denial that broke from her, but she wasn\u2019t looking for seduction.</p><p>She needed pleasure. Release. Fast. Hard.</p><p>His jaw tensed.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Skye whispered. \u201cI need to feel you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands curved around his shoulders. Her short nails raked over his flesh. Down, down she went. Her hand slid around his sides, pushed across his rock-hard abs.</p><p>Then she was touching his cock. Heavy and full, thrusting toward her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d Skye said as she stroked him. \u201cI need you, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready, Skye.\u201d His words were a rumble.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d She arched toward him. \u201cTrace, please!\u201d She tried to urge him toward her, but Trace was too strong, and he pulled back.</p><p>Her heart stopped then.</p><p>\u201cNot like this,\u201d he said, the words hard and sharp and\u2014</p><p>He kissed her. Deep and long even as he caressed the center of her need. She pushed against him. Because she didn\u2019t want to go slow. She needed fast. One hundred miles an hour. Too fast to think. Too fast to do anything but feel\u2014</p><p>He thrust a finger into her. Stretched her.</p><p>Not enough. Not even close.</p><p>His mouth trailed down her neck. He kissed her throat. Licked her sensitive flesh.</p><p>His fingers kept stroking her. Desire built, pulsing through her. But the desire wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t going to be enough, not until he was in her. Skye arched toward him. Her legs wrapped around his hips.</p><p>But Trace\u2019s hands caught her legs and pushed them back down.</p><p>No, she wanted him.</p><p>Trace slid down\u2014</p><p>And he put his mouth on her.</p><p>Pleasure came then, surging through her and a moan broke from her lips.</p><p>\u201cMuch fucking better,\u201d Trace growled. \u201cNow, we do this.\u201d</p><p>He positioned his body and drove into her. Deep. So deep. She stared into his eyes, those bright, glittering eyes. Stared right into that blue even as the bed shook beneath her. He thrust, again and again. Harder.</p><p>There was no more thinking. Only feeling.</p><p>Meeting him. Thrust for thrust.</p><p>Sweat slickened their bodies.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away from his gaze.</p><p>His hands had locked around her hips. He lifted her up, holding her easily, as he thrust. Every muscle in her body tightened. She was so close to release. So close\u2014</p><p>Pleasure exploded. The release burst over her with an impact that took her breath away. She shuddered and quaked, and he was there. Trace stiffened against her. Held her even tighter. The hot surge of his release filled her.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>Tremors shook her sex. Shook her.</p><p>But the memories of fear and death were gone. Pleasure surrounded her.</p><p>Because Trace surrounded her.</p><p>In that moment, Skye could almost convince herself that she was safe.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>The thunder of her heartbeat slowly eased its mad drumming. She became aware of other sounds then. The rush of waves, the pounding of the water against the shore.</p><p>The scent of the ocean.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in Chicago. Not New York. They\u2019d escaped together, and Trace had taken her down to the Florida Keys.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to be cold there. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be afraid.</p><p>His lips feathered over her cheek. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead. I won\u2019t ever let anyone hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted, and she found herself staring up into Trace\u2019s eyes once more. She\u2019d always felt like Trace could see straight into her soul.</p><p>Past the pretenses that she gave to others.</p><p>Right to her core.</p><p>Trace Weston. His face was hard, strong. Slashing cheekbones. A square, tight jaw. Lips that were cut in the faintest of cruel lines.</p><p>One look, and a smart woman knew he was dangerous.</p><p>Skye knew, and she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He\u2019d killed for her. She probably should have been afraid of him. She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Because, deep down, Skye knew the truth.</p><p>I\u2019d kill for him, too.</p><p>With each day that passed, she was discovering a new darkness within herself.</p><p>Maybe that was why she\u2019d always been drawn to Trace. They were the same.</p><p>He slowly withdrew from her. Stood. He stared down at her, his legs brushing against the side of the bed. \u201cYou have to talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t. What she had to do was shove the memories into the deepest, darkest part of her mind.</p><p>And move the hell on.</p><p>That was what she\u2019d done before, when her parents had died. Burying the pain and the dark memories\u2014that was the way she survived. Her coping mechanisms had gotten her through life.</p><p>One stumbling step at a time.</p><p>\u201cThe nightmares aren\u2019t stopping.\u201d His hands clenched into powerful fists as he stared down at her. \u201cYou need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have what I need,\u201d she said, and she rose from the bed, too. Skye pulled the sheet with her, letting it cover her body. Trace had never cared for modesty. She shouldn\u2019t either, but Skye still found herself pulling the sheet closer. \u201cTalking to some shrink isn\u2019t going to magically fix me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>A loud, insistent ringing cut through his words.</p><p>Saved by the bell.</p><p>Skye glanced to the right. Trace\u2019s phone waited on the small nightstand.</p><p>\u201cIt can damn well wait,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou should\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d leaned forward to see the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s Reese. You\u2019d better talk to him.\u201d Because Reese Stokes was Trace\u2019s right-hand man. A bodyguard, a friend\u2014one of the few confidants that Trace actually had in the world.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Skye urged him. \u201cIt could be important.\u201d She headed for the bathroom. Took the silken robe that waited on the hook behind the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be outside.\u201d</p><p>The ringing stopped just as she opened the balcony door.</p><p>When she heard Trace answer the call, Skye stepped outside. The pounding of the surf was louder. The salty scent of the ocean filled her nose.</p><p>A private island.</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t do things half-way. Since the guy was a freaking billionaire now, he could have anything or anyone that he wanted...with just a snap of his fingers.</p><p>The wind blew her robe back against her, molding the silk to her body.</p><p>Skye headed for the churning waves. The light of the moon glinted off the water, making it look almost black.</p><p>She walked toward that beckoning darkness.</p><p>One foot, in front of the other.</p><p>These days, that was the only way she could get through life.</p><p>The waves hit her feet, and they washed away the foot prints that she\u2019d left behind.</p><p>\u201cReese, this had better be damn important,\u201d Trace Weston snarled as his fingers tightened around the phone.</p><p>He\u2019d jerked on a pair of jeans and then followed Skye out onto the balcony. He stood now, watching her as she walked along the shore. The waves crashed against her feet.</p><p>Skye. His beautiful, lost Skye.</p><p>The nightmares weren\u2019t stopping, and the pain in her green eyes seemed to be getting worse with each passing day.</p><p>The trip to the Keys had been designed to heal her wounds.</p><p>Not make them worse.</p><p>\u201cBoss, you\u2019re not going to believe who dropped by for a little visit today.\u201d Reese\u2019s voice flowed easily over the line.</p><p>Trace kept his eyes on Skye. Was she going into the water?</p><p>\u201cBen Sharpe was here, looking for you.\u201d</p><p>A hard breath blew from Trace. The name was from his past, a blood-soaked past that he\u2019d tried to bury. \u201cWhat the hell did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy said he had a message. One that he could only give to you.\u201d</p><p>Figured.</p><p>\u201cBut, there was...there was something about his eyes...\u201d Now hesitation had entered Reese\u2019s voice, and that in itself was damn unusual. \u201cThe man\u2019s been unstable for years, hell, I know that, but this was different.\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t take his eyes off Skye. Her scent was on him. She\u2019d marked him in ways that went far beneath the skin.</p><p>\u201cHe was afraid,\u201d Reese added. \u201cTerrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is afraid of something,\u201d Trace murmured. He\u2019d learned to fear recently. Before, he tried to fool himself into thinking that he was invulnerable.</p><p>Then a bastard had tried to take Skye from him.</p><p>No one takes her.</p><p>She\u2019d waded into the water. She looked so small out there.</p><p>And her robe was getting soaked.</p><p>\u201cHe came to the penthouse,\u201d Reese told him, \u201cnot the security agency.\u201d</p><p>Weston Securities wasn\u2019t just an agency. It was the biggest private security firm in the United States. Trace had built it with blood and sweat. And with the aid of secrets. So many deadly secrets.</p><p>\u201cTell me you have a man on him,\u201d Trace said. Because Reese would understand how important\u2014and volatile\u2014Ben could be.</p><p>Reese had been in hell with Trace. They\u2019d both survived.</p><p>As had Ben...</p><p>Well, Ben had mostly survived.</p><p>The waves crashed into Skye. She stumbled.</p><p>Trace surged forward.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a guy\u2019s on him,\u201d Reese said, sounding annoyed now. \u201cJeez, boss, what do you think this is? Amateur hour? I\u2019m calling because I thought you\u2019d want to know. I thought this news might make you get your ass off that island. You have to come back home sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did.</p><p>He\u2019d let Skye hide long enough.</p><p>The nightmares aren\u2019t going away. This place doesn\u2019t make her feel any safer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be coming back on the jet tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s breath rustled over the line. \u201cGood. Good, but...is she...okay?\u201d</p><p>The waves crashed into her again. This time, Skye didn\u2019t stumble. She stood strong. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to break.\u201d Because he wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p>I need her too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake sure the guards are in place,\u201d Trace directed. Because he wouldn\u2019t be taking any chances.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ready and waiting.\u201d</p><p>Good. Trace ended the call. He tossed his phone onto the hammock near the edge of the balcony, then he hurried down the wooden steps that would take him to the beach and to her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t turn at his approach. Trace wasn\u2019t even sure that Skye could hear him, not over the rough pounding of the surf.</p><p>Her long, dark hair trailed over her back. Her hands were lifted up, as if she\u2019d touch the waves. Her body was delicate, lithe, a true dancer\u2019s body, but she\u2019d become too fragile since her abduction.</p><p>\u201cSkye.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>He followed her into the surf, not caring that his jeans got soaked, but he did say, \u201cBaby, you\u2019re getting your robe wet, you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She glanced over her shoulder at him.</p><p>The moonlight fell on her face. Her high cheekbones. The gentle curve of her jaw. The straight line of her nose.</p><p>Her fuck-me lips.</p><p>The woman had a mouth that always made him think of sin. A mouth that made him need.</p><p>Her stare held his. It was too dark for him to see the green color of her eyes or to read any emotion in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going home, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Skye asked.</p> <p>Home. Back to Chicago. He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go out in style,\u201d she said, and she slipped off the robe.</p><p>\u201cSkye\u2014\u201d</p><p>She tossed the robe toward him. He caught it, his hands flying up in a reflexive action.</p><p>Skye\u2019s laughter teased his ears. He loved that sound. Happy. Free. She hadn\u2019t sounded that way in so long.</p><p>His fingers fisted in the robe.</p><p>Naked now, Skye dove into the waves.</p><p>He tossed the robe onto the beach behind him.</p> <p>\u201cCome and get me...\u201d Her words taunted him when she broke through the surface of the water.</p><p>That was exactly what he planned to do.</p><p>Trace stalked into the water.</p><p>She won\u2019t break.</p><p>Her laughter reached him once more, banishing the chill that had crept over him when he\u2019d awoken to the sound of her screams.</p><p>Skye was stronger than most people realized.</p><p>Her arms reached for him.</p><p>He held her tight and knew that he couldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>Ben Sharpe hunched his shoulders as he turned and hurried into the alley.</p><p>He knew he was being followed. He\u2019d known for a while now.</p><p>Death was coming. Stalking him with slow, certain steps.</p><p>He had a debt to repay before he died. His father had always taught him that a man had to pay his debts.</p><p>One way or another.</p><p>He owed Trace Weston. He\u2019d pay him.</p><p>Warn him.</p><p>The faintest shuffle of a footstep reached Ben\u2019s ears. His gaze flew to the mouth of the alley.</p><p>Death had been after him for years now.</p><p>After him. After Trace.</p><p>You could only run for so long.</p><p>The faint shuffle came again.</p><p>Before the past catches you...</p><p>His fingers curled around the knife that he always kept close. Death wasn\u2019t going to have an easy time taking him.</p><p>He planned to fight for every moment that he had left.</p><p>And if he had to, he\u2019d kill to keep living.</p><p>He knew how to kill. He was good at it.</p><p>Thanks to Weston.</p><p>And I\u2019ll repay that debt...</p><p>Even if it was the last fucking thing he did.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The limo pulled to a slow stop in front of the Chicago high-rise. The building stretched so far up that it seemed to blend with the clouds.</p><p>Skye glanced at Trace. \u201cYou just assumed we\u2019d be going back to your place?\u201d</p><p>He put down the papers he\u2019d been reading. Some thick manila file. His gaze locked on her. \u201cI want you to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to keep her face expressionless. \u201cAnd this is how you ask me? We were on a white sand beach for days, and you couldn\u2019t find some nice, romantic moment there to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at romance, Skye.\u201d He heaved out a hard breath and reached for her hand. His fingers smoothed over the big, gleaming diamond that she wore on her left hand. His ring.</p><p>He\u2019d asked her to marry him after he\u2019d saved her from Mitch. He\u2019d never said they would move in together before they got married.</p><p>\u201cSkye, look, we probably only have ten seconds before Reese opens that door and\u2014\u201d</p><p>They had less than five seconds. There was a soft click of sound, and Reese opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHis timing is shit,\u201d Trace muttered, sounding disgusted.</p><p>Skye climbed from the car. Reese was frowning at her, more than a hint of concern on his face. Reese\u2019s face was just as hard as Trace\u2019s\u2014maybe even harder. All angles and rough planes. Reese\u2019s hair was cut brutally short, and his dark eyes glinted. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>Skye looked up at the high-rise once more. Trace\u2019s penthouse waited all the way at the very top.</p><p>He\u2019d sure come a long way in the last ten years. Once, they\u2019d both barely had enough money for food. For clothes.</p><p>Now, it seemed that Trace could buy the whole world.</p><p>Is he trying to buy me? Sometimes she wondered if that could be the case. She was highly conscious of the weight of her ring around her finger.</p><p>\u201cHave the doorman get the bags, Reese,\u201d Trace directed as he exited the vehicle.</p><p>But Skye put her hand out, stopping Reese. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Because their living arrangements weren\u2019t settled. She straightened her shoulders. There was something about this city that got to Skye. Chicago was home for her. The noise. The people. The activity.</p><p>She was starting to feel stronger already.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>She turned to face Trace. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>Skye sighed. \u201cWhy do you want me to move in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, hell,\u201d she heard Reese mutter as the faint Alabama drawl in his voice deepened. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Shit for timing...\u201d He edged back.</p><p>Trace growled.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Trace demanded as his brows shot up. \u201cNow? This is where you want us to talk?\u201d</p><p>Cars honked around them.</p><p>\u201cYou picked the place,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cNow tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Trace was tall, easily hitting over six foot three, and his body seemed to dominate hers as he curled his hands over her arms. \u201cBecause I want you close. Always, right beside me.\u201d</p><p>And that was where she wanted to be. His answer was also the one that she\u2019d needed to hear.</p><p>\u201cThen you can have my things brought over,\u201d she told him as she turned away and headed for the building\u2019s gleaming entrance. The doorman hurried to meet her.</p><p>\u201cI already did,\u201d Trace said. His words followed her.</p><p>Froze her.</p><p>Skye glanced back at him. \u201cConfident, were you?\u201d</p><p>His head tilted as he seemed to assess her. Then, taking his time, Trace headed toward her. His hand lifted, and his fingers slid over her cheek. \u201cWhen it comes to you,\u201d his voice dropped. \u201cYeah, I am. Because you were either going to spend the night with me, or I was going to move in with you in that little apartment over your dance studio. Either way, we were going to be sleeping in the same bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>Blunt, wasn\u2019t he? But, that was Trace. Dominant, fierce. Always in control. Always\u2014</p><p>\u201cWeston!\u201d</p><p>Trace moved in a flash at that shout. He caught Skye and pushed her behind him. She saw Reese moving quickly, too. Reese had a gun in his hand in less than two seconds\u2019 time, and he lunged toward Trace.</p><p>No, not toward Trace. Toward the man who was rushing down the street and heading straight for Trace.</p><p>\u201cWeston!\u201d The guy cried out again.</p><p>His hair was long, brushing his shoulders, disheveled, and a dark beard lined his jaw. The man was tall, with broad shoulders. He ran toward them, his gaze intent on Trace.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d she heard Trace growl.</p><p>Reese lifted his weapon. \u201cYou need to stop right there, Sharpe.\u201d</p><p>The guy staggered to a stop. His jeans were dirty, torn. His shirt was black and ripped at the side. He ignored Reese and the weapon Reese had pointed at him. The man\u2019s eyes focused on Trace with a feverish intensity. \u201cI owe you,\u201d he mumbled, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m here to pay.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s heart raced in her chest.</p><p>\u201cReese,\u201d Trace\u2019s voice snapped out, \u201cI want you to take Skye inside.\u201d</p><p>The doorman peeked out at them, eyes wide. Henry. Skye had met him a few times before Trace had whisked her to the Keys. Henry was a nice guy, but totally not equipped to deal with the situation out there.</p><p>\u201cTake her inside and stay with her every moment,\u201d Trace ordered.</p><p>Reese glanced back at him, hesitating. \u201cYou sure, boss?\u201d</p><p>Skye wasn\u2019t sure what in the hell was going on. She reached for Trace. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Who was this guy\u2014this Ben?</p><p>At her words, the man\u2019s gaze jerked to her face and his stare locked on her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one,\u201d the stranger whispered. He shook his head, \u201cWeston, she\u2019s going to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Trace caught Skye\u2019s hand in his. \u201cGo to the penthouse. Unpack. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Reese hurried to her side. \u201cCome on, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She was just supposed to leave Trace there?</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The cry came from the other man as he leapt toward Trace. His fingers grabbed Trace\u2019s shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe out here. He\u2019s watching.\u201d</p><p>A chill skated down Skye\u2019s spine. She\u2019d been stalked before. Hunted. She knew just what it was like to feel as if someone was out there, watching.</p><p>Every minute.</p><p>She studied the man again. This time, she clearly saw the fear in his brown eyes. \u201cI think we should all go upstairs,\u201d she said, hoping her voice didn\u2019t show her own fear.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t just going to walk away and leave Trace alone in that street. Something was wrong, very wrong, and she didn\u2019t want to abandon him.</p><p>Trace\u2019s jaw locked, but, after a brief moment, he gave a hard jerk of his head.</p><p>They all headed for the gleaming doors. The doorman\u2019s eyes were huge as he studied them all. \u201cUh...Mr. Weston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave all the bags brought up.\u201d Trace had an unbreakable grip on Skye\u2019s arm. He barely spared the doorman a glance but he did push a very nice tip toward him.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the tip would help Henry get over the fact that he\u2019d just seen Reese draw his gun.</p><p>The doorman\u2019s gaze flickered to Skye. \u201cGood to see you, Ms. Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Henry,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>They all loaded into Trace\u2019s private elevator. It seemed to fly up to the penthouse. She tried to glance over at the man Trace had called Ben, but Trace had put his body in front of hers. Shielding her or blocking her view\u2014she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what his intent was.</p><p>The ride was over quickly, and the group strode toward the penthouse door. Trace led her inside, but then, before the others could follow, he spun back around. \u201cI\u2019ll be needing your knives, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Wait, knives? Plural?</p><p>The man bent and pulled a knife from his right boot. Then his left. He put them in Trace\u2019s open palm.</p><p>\u201cAll of them,\u201d Trace snapped.</p><p>Ben pulled another knife from his waist. The sheath had blended perfectly with his belt, and Skye would\u2019ve never even noticed the weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou remembered,\u201d Ben said, giving a little nod. \u201cCan\u2019t stop being a soldier, can you?\u201d</p><p>Reese took the knives and shoved them all inside a drawer in the den.</p><p>Skye stood there, uncertain, as the others filed into the den.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t watch us up here,\u201d Ben said as he glanced over at the large windows that overlooked the city. \u201cFuck me...\u201d he marched toward the glass on the right. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn rich bastard now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s fingers brushed against Skye\u2019s jaw and she jumped. She hadn\u2019t heard him move toward her. Sometimes, he did that\u2014moving so soundlessly that she didn\u2019t know he was there until he touched her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long flight,\u201d Trace said, his gaze searching hers. \u201cWe\u2019re all secure up here. You should go rest, baby. I know the trip back wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d</p><p>Because she was still afraid of flying. No, it wasn\u2019t so much fear as the fact that she just hated it.</p><p>While there might have been a hint of sympathy in Trace\u2019s eyes, she knew he wasn\u2019t just trying to get her in the bedroom because she was tired.</p><p>Trace wanted to get rid of her. Too bad. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to be dismissed. If Trace was in some kind of danger, she wanted to know about it.</p><p>She glanced over at Ben once more. His gaze was on her. That brown stare was unnerving. The fear was gone but...</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>I know that look.</p><p>She knew that look because she\u2019d seen it in her mother\u2019s eyes before.</p><p>Insanity.</p><p>Skye instinctively took a step back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the reason, you know...\u201d Now Ben seemed almost musing, but his eyes burned with an intensity that frightened her. \u201cYou revealed too much with her. The story was splashed in all the papers. It was on all the TVs. She\u2019s your mistake, and she\u2019s going to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, Trace was across the room. He\u2019d shoved Ben back against the big, picture-frame window behind the couch. \u201cYou sure as hell had better not be threatening her.\u201d His forearm thrust under Ben\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d She rushed forward, but Reese stepped in her path. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot...me...\u201d The words wheezed from Ben.</p><p>Trace lifted his arm.</p><p>Ben sucked in a deep gulp of air.</p> <p>Trace\u2019s shoulders tensed. \u201cI let you up here because of the past. Reese told me you\u2019d come by before. That you had a message for me. Deliver it, now.\u201d</p><p>A rough bark of laughter escaped Ben as the redness slowly faded from his cheeks. \u201cThe past...that\u2019s what we have to worry about. It\u2019s not dead. It\u2019s coming back, and it\u2019s going to burn us all.\u201d</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t making any sense.</p><p>But Reese\u2019s body had turned to stone beside her. So maybe the cryptic words made sense to him.</p><p>Skye could be the only one in the dark.</p> <p>\u201cDo you believe in ghosts?\u201d Ben asked as he blinked up at Trace.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Trace\u2019s response was instant. \u201cThe dead are in the ground. They can\u2019t hurt us anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too sure.\u201d Ben\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cYou took from him, and now he knows what to take from you. He\u2019s coming after us all, and he won\u2019t stop, not until he\u2019s destroyed us...the same way we tried to destroy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen...\u201d Now Trace\u2019s voice had roughened. Deepened. \u201cHave you been taking your meds?\u201d</p><p>At that question, Ben\u2019s eyes flashed angrily. \u201cI don\u2019t need them! I don\u2019t need the fuckin\u2019 things!\u201d He shouldered past Trace and staggered across the room. \u201cI know what\u2019s happening. He\u2019s here. Watching. I know!\u201d</p><p>Skye bit her bottom lip to hold back the instinctive cry that wanted to break free. The way this Ben was acting...it\u2019s so familiar.</p> <p>\u201cHave you been hearing the voices again?\u201d Trace asked.</p><p>Tears stung Skye\u2019s eyes. This was too much like her own past.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Ben said, his voice hoarse, as he turned back to stare at Trace. \u201cBut they\u2019re just trying to warn me. Death is coming for us, Weston! We have to be ready.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cKill or be killed. Just like in the old days.\u201d</p><p>Trace hadn\u2019t told her about his \u201cold days\u201d in the military. He hadn\u2019t talked about the military at all.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take your medication,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Her heart was aching.</p><p>Trace paced steadily toward Ben.</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cIt makes me...weak. Dulls my senses. I have to be ready.\u201d He jabbed a finger toward Trace. \u201cYou have to be ready. He\u2019s gonna make you suffer more. You\u2019re the one who killed her. I-I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Her?</p><p>Trace put his hands on Ben\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re confused again. The past is over. You need to let it go.\u201d</p><p>Ben sucked in a sharp breath. Then he jerked away from Trace. His accusing finger pointed right at Skye. \u201cShe\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>This was not the homecoming that Skye had anticipated.</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t.\u201d Trace was certain. \u201cBecause I will destroy anyone who ever tries to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose onto Skye\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cAnd that includes you,\u201d Trace told the man. \u201cDon\u2019t ever come near her again, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Ben blinked. \u201cI-I was warning you.\u201d Confusion seemed to thicken his words. \u201cPaying my debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it paid.\u201d Trace\u2019s gaze flickered toward Reese. \u201cNow Reese will escort you out. He can take you back home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a home. Don\u2019t got nothing.\u201d Again, a lost tone had entered Ben\u2019s voice. \u201cMaybe...you ever think you should\u2019ve just let me die? Instead of dragging me out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese will make sure you get set up at a hotel tonight. We\u2019ll contact the VA.\u201d Trace\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cThey\u2019ll get your meds going again.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be a dead man.\u201d He turned on his heel. Hurried for the door.</p><p>Reese was right behind him.</p><p>But, before Ben left, he cast one last glance toward Skye. \u201cYou still look the same,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust like the picture Weston kept. An angel in hell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Skye began.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t die,\u201d Ben said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming and you need to be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d Trace snarled, his patience seemingly gone.</p><p>And...just like that...the mysterious Ben was gone. Reese followed him out, and Trace secured the door behind them.</p><p>Skye was left alone with Trace.</p><p>Only...</p><p>Trace was different.</p><p>He stalked toward her, his steps sure, but his eyes shone with an emotion that she couldn\u2019t decipher.</p><p>\u201cWh-what was that about?\u201d She hated the stutter in her voice as much as she hated the nervousness twisting her guts in knots.</p><p>\u201cBen Sharpe had a...hard time during his enlistment. The last mission went wrong, and he came back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken?\u201d Skye finished because that was how the man had looked.</p><p>And it\u2019s the way my mother had appeared. So many times. There\u2019d been no mistaking the look in Ben\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the same,\u201d Trace said instead. Then he rolled his shoulders, as if trying to push the past away. \u201cReese will see to it that he\u2019s taken care of. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ben said someone was watching him.\u201d And, not too long ago, she\u2019d gone to Trace and told him the same thing. Someone is watching me. She\u2019d been afraid that Trace wouldn\u2019t believe her. The cops sure hadn\u2019t bought her story.</p><p>But Trace had.</p><p>He\u2019d protected her. Saved her life.</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s off his meds, Ben has hallucinations. He talks to people who aren\u2019t there. He sees people who aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Just like her mother. Skye swallowed. \u201cBut are you sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. His lips\u2014so warm and sensual\u2014pressed to hers. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to fear from Ben.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Ben that she was afraid of. It was his warning that wouldn\u2019t stop playing through her mind.</p><p>He\u2019d said death was coming. \u201cAre you safe?\u201d Skye asked Trace, lifting her lashes to look into his bright gaze.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he told her, and she wanted to believe him.</p><p>After all, Trace wouldn\u2019t lie to her...</p><p>Would he?</p><p>His hands closed around her shoulders. He seemed so warm and solid, so incredibly strong before her. \u201cI don\u2019t want that part of my life ever touching you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work. We can\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p><p>Trace stilled.</p><p>\u201cNo secrets,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it needs to be. You know everything about me...\u201d Every fear she had.</p><p>Every desire.</p><p>He let her go. \u201cThere are some things that you\u2019re better off not knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand. \u201cLet it go, baby. Just...let it go. The past is buried, and all I care about is my future with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s crazy!\u201d Trace exploded.</p><p>She flinched. Not because of the anger in his voice, but because his words hit far too close to home. \u201cAnd what if I am, one day? What if\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get to say more. Because Trace had her in his arms, holding her so tightly that she knew she might bruise, but Skye didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t. You won\u2019t ever be.\u201d</p><p>So easy for him to say.</p><p>But Trace hadn\u2019t lived in a home with a mother who lost her hold on reality a little more each day. A woman who talked with people who weren\u2019t there. A woman who hurt her daughter and never remembered doing it.</p><p>The doctors said her mother had been psychotic. Sometimes, too many times, Skye wondered if there was a ticking time bomb within herself.</p><p>That\u2019s why I won\u2019t go see the shrinks. I don\u2019t want to know...</p><p>\u201cYou survived that sick bastard\u2019s kidnapping. You\u2019re the strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He\u2019d lifted her up against him and buried his face in the curve of her neck. \u201cI know crazy, Skye, and it\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>She could barely breathe in his grasp. Skye pushed against him, and Trace let her toes touch the floor once more. \u201cI came to you,\u201d she said, searching his eyes, \u201cwith the same story that Ben just told. Someone was watching me. You believed me.\u201d What if he hadn\u2019t? \u201cAre you so certain that man wasn\u2019t telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen...he has a problem with reality. For the last few years, he\u2019s been convinced that someone was after him.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cHe thought his past was chasing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it is?\u201d He\u2019d seemed so desperate.</p><p>Her mother had been desperate that way, once.</p><p>Her desperation had led her to take her own life\u2014and to take the life of Skye\u2019s father in the process.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have another talk with him, okay?\u201d Trace said. \u201cIf he\u2019s being hunted by anything other than his own demons, I\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Relief had her shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cYour heart\u2019s too soft,\u201d he growled, and Trace sounded angry. Odd, he didn\u2019t usually get angry with her.</p><p>Everyone else? Oh, yes, but not her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be so trusting, Skye.\u201d He let her go and stalked across the room. The marble floor gleamed beneath his feet. He stopped at the bar. A bar that took up half the left wall. Trace grabbed the decanter of whiskey and poured a sloshing glassful. \u201cThat trust can get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>Even though he wasn\u2019t looking at her, Skye\u2019s chin hitched up. \u201cTrouble? You mean the kind where I trust the wrong man and nearly get killed because of it?\u201d</p><p>He whirled around. \u201cSkye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d she snapped at him. Her hands fisted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, this is one hell of a moving-in party.\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel and marched down the hallway. Her heartbeat sounded like drums in her ears and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...want it touching you.\u201d</p><p>Skye paused a few steps away from their bedroom. Then, crap, she found herself storming back toward him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He drained the glass. Slammed it back on the bar. \u201cI\u2019ve done things that weren\u2019t good, Skye. Things that\u2014if you knew about them\u2014they\u2019d give you even more nightmares.\u201d</p><p>He headed toward her with slow, determined steps. A predator, stalking his prey.</p><p>I\u2019m the prey.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to know about the things I did while we were apart. I want us to go forward. Fuck the past.\u201d He stopped just a foot away and gazed down at her. She couldn\u2019t read the expression in his eyes. \u201cWhat we have is good. I\u2019d damn well die for you, and you know that.\u201d</p><p>She did. She also knew...</p><p>He\u2019d kill for me.</p><p>The world saw Trace Weston as a suave businessman. A charmer who\u2019d exploded onto the security scene. He\u2019d amassed billions in record time.</p><p>But no one knew about his past.</p><p>Once, Skye had thought that she knew everything about him.</p><p>Now she was realizing that Trace had secrets he didn\u2019t intend to share with her.</p><p>\u201cNothing can come between us now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Why did she feel like he was making a vow?</p><p>Trace smiled. The smile that had always made her breath come a little faster.</p><p>He advanced toward her. \u201cYou were right when you said this wasn\u2019t the way to celebrate your moving in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d scooped her into his arms. He carried her to the bedroom. The room was dark. The sun was setting, and the light barely spilled through the curtains and onto his massive bed.</p><p>But...something was shining on his bed.</p><p>Skye glanced over, frowning, even as her arms tightened around Trace\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your welcome home present.\u201d He kissed her and slowly lowered Skye to her feet.</p><p>Then his hands went to the back of her dress. A flick of his fingers unhooked the button near her nape, and the dress slid to the floor with a soft slither of sound.</p><p>She was left in her high heels, her black panties and her matching bra.</p><p>Trace was fully dressed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Then he reached around her, and, yes, the sparkle on the bed seemed even brighter now.</p><p>Diamonds. A necklace full of glittering diamonds.</p><p>He put the diamonds around her neck. They were cold, and she let out a little gasp.</p><p>A fortune. That\u2019s what he just put around my neck.</p><p>She knew exactly how much those diamonds had cost him. In another life, she\u2019d been a prima ballerina in New York. Before her car accident and her stalker, before the nightmares\u2014</p><p>\u201cSkye.\u201d Her name was a sharp demand.</p><p>Her gaze flew to his face.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>He always knew what she was thinking.</p><p>But do I know him?</p><p>The diamonds chilled her skin.</p><p>He lifted her hair, brushing it back over her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>And he was the only man she\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>At fifteen, he\u2019d burst into her life, saving her from an attack. He\u2019d been her hero then.</p><p>Her world.</p><p>But he\u2019d left her. Gone away, and for ten years, they hadn\u2019t seen one another.</p><p>What happened to him during those years?</p><p>He lowered his head and he kissed her neck. Her breath rushed out because that spot was so sensitive, and Trace knew that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as he knew everything about her.</p><p>He lowered her onto the bed.

She expected him to, but he didn\u2019t. His hands became harder, rougher on her. He pulled her to the edge of the bed.</p><p>His fingers slid between her legs. One yank, and her panties were gone.

Put his cock right at the entrance of her body. Trace leaned over her. \u201cForever, Skye.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes locked with his. Her hands grabbed him, and her nails dug through the fabric of his shirt, sinking in with a sensual bite.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she agreed, and her hips surged toward him just as he thrust into her.</p><p>She lost her breath then. He stretched her, filled her so completely. He tried to pull back, to go easier.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t break,\u201d she said, panting out the words. \u201cFaster, Trace, harder.\u201d Because it was what she needed.</p><p>His gaze never left hers. He gave her what she wanted.</p><p>Fast.</p> <p>Hard.</p><p>But he was in control. Every moment. She could feel it in the tight movements of his body. See it in the hard clench of his jaw.</p><p>She wanted him out of control. Wild.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t letting go.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d His name was a demand.</p><p>His head bent. He jerked her bra out of the way and put his mouth on her breast. Licked. Kissed.</p><p>She felt the light edge of his teeth on her.</p><p>Skye erupted. Pleasure blasted through her, and she held him as fiercely as she could.</p><p>His movements roughened. His hips pistoned against her. Close\u2014close\u2014he was almost losing his control. Skye just needed to push him over that edge.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around him.</p><p>He came with a shout. His eyes flashed, seeming to go blind for an instant. He shuddered, his body curving over her. He was still standing at the edge of the bed.</p><p>Still dressed.</p><p>Still holding all the control, even in his moment of release.</p><p>Skye stared up at him, lost.</p><p>She\u2019d been lost with Trace from the beginning.</p><p>There was no going back. Not for her.</p><p>Not for him.</p><p>He pressed a tender kiss to her lips. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be gorgeous in diamonds.\u201d</p><p>The diamonds were beautiful, but Skye didn\u2019t care about them. I only care about him.</p><p>He withdrew from her. Tenderly took care of her and even tucked her under the covers.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t join her.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest,\u201d he told her, voice gruff. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, and you\u2019re home.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cOur life is just starting...\u201d</p><p>His life was ending.</p><p>Ben Sharpe ran down the busy Chicago street. Rain beat down on him, the storm erupting suddenly from the sky.</p><p>Weston hadn\u2019t taken his warning seriously.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to help the man, but Weston hadn\u2019t wanted to hear his words.</p><p>Weston hadn\u2019t wanted him there at all.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want me near her.</p><p>It was just as bad as Ben had feared. Weston\u2019s weakness was right there, and the man didn\u2019t even realize it.</p><p>Skye Sullivan would be his downfall. Weston needed to protect himself, to back the hell away from her.</p><p>Before it was too late.</p><p>Trace shut the bedroom door.</p><p>He could smell Skye\u2019s scent on his skin. Sweet vanilla. He could feel her silken flesh beneath his fingers.</p><p>He wanted to go back in that room, to wrap his arms around her and hold her through the night.</p><p>But first, he had to take care of some unfinished business. Business that would not be allowed to touch Skye.</p><p>He hurried down the hallway. Grabbed his phone. In seconds, he had Reese on the line. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d Trace demanded.</p><p>Lightning flashed outside of his windows. The storm had come up so suddenly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s about to hop the train. I tried to get the guy to stay at a motel.\u201d Disgust and anger thickened Reese\u2019s voice. \u201cBut the fool took a punch at me.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s back teeth clenched. \u201cKeep your eyes on him until I can meet up with you. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d He glanced toward the hall. Skye\u2019s soft heart would be a problem. Because she looked at Ben Sharpe, and she saw her own mother.</p><p>But Skye\u2019s mother had been dangerous.</p><p>And so was Ben.</p><p>You won\u2019t get near Skye again.</p><p>Reese was still talking, giving Trace intel about the train and Ben\u2019s location.</p><p>Trace left the penthouse. The elevator descended quickly to the parking garage.</p><p>Once upon a time\u2014a lifetime ago\u2014he\u2019d saved Ben Sharpe\u2019s life.</p><p>Once upon a time...</p><p>Thunder crashed.</p><p>Skye jerked up in bed, her heart racing.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her call.</p><p>She rose, grabbed for her robe.</p><p>She still had on the diamonds. They still felt too cold.</p><p>Her fingers closed around the bedroom doorknob. She twisted it, and the door opened with a creak of sound. \u201cTrace?\u201d She tip-toed down the hallway.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Lightning flashed just outside of the windows, long jagged streaks of light.</p><p>Trace wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Skye stopped in the den, then she turned to the big-picture window, and she watched the storm rage.</p><p>Another alley.</p><p>Ben ran forward, his boots hitting the rain puddles and sending mud flying around him.</p><p>He\u2019s tracking me. The bastard is coming after me.</p><p>He had to run faster.</p><p>His breath sawed from his lungs. For an instant, the buildings around him vanished.</p><p>When the thunder rolled, he heard it as gunfire.</p><p>Another place, another time.</p><p>He looked down, and the mud was gone. The pot-hole filled alley was gone.</p><p>He saw snow. Blood. Death.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d</p><p>The voice whispered from the darkness.</p><p>His head jerked up. He reached for the knife at his belt.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>Weston had taken the weapon. He hadn\u2019t given it back.</p><p>Ben reached for his ankle sheath.</p><p>Fuck me, gone! He\u2019d left Weston\u2019s place without his weapons. Stupid, stupid mistake.</p><p>Ben straightened. \u201cI-I was trying to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>A blade shoved into his chest. \u201cYou should have stayed away.\u201d</p><p>Rain pelted down on Ben.</p><p>And his blood dripped into the mud around him.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d</p><p>Trace glanced up at the soft question. Skye stood just inside the kitchen, staring at him with her deep green eyes. She had on yoga pants and a loose top.</p><p>She looked sexy as sin.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d She lifted a dark brow.</p><p>He put down his coffee. \u201cYou want something for breakfast? I have a chef on call here, and I can get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know where you were last night.\u201d She walked toward him. Skye had a soft, graceful stride. She\u2019d been made to dance. And even though she didn\u2019t want the stages of New York anymore\u2014</p><p>\u201cTrace.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, enjoying the bite in her voice. \u201cI had business to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness...like with that man, Ben?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cHe won\u2019t be bothering you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never bothered me. What bothered me was you. Or, more specifically, you not telling me about your past.\u201d</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t tell her. Trace forced a careless shrug. \u201cThe past is dead and buried. I told you before, I only care about our future.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. The woman had gorgeous lips. Full and red, and so wonderfully soft. He could kiss her for hours.</p><p>For a moment, he thought she\u2019d argue with him. Skye braced her delicate shoulders and she said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to my dance studio today.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Ah, tricky lady. She\u2019d thrown him off. But he nodded. \u201cOf course, Reese can drive you and stand guard while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was flat and adamant. \u201cI can get to the studio by myself, and I don\u2019t need any sort of guard.\u201d</p><p>His hands braced against the table. \u201cAfter what happened to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who was stalking me is dead. I don\u2019t have to worry about him anymore.\u201d Her slightly pointed chin kicked up into the air a notch. \u201cI don\u2019t need a guard, Trace. What I need is to be able to lead my life on my own terms.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d suspected this was coming. He\u2019d dreaded this confrontation for days. \u201cWhat about the press?\u201d</p><p>Her laughter held a bitter edge. \u201cWe ran away from them. Wasn\u2019t that the point of our trip to the Keys? To hide out there until the reporters moved on to the next juicy story.\u201d</p><p>A prima ballerina who\u2019d been abducted and held captive for days by her ex-lover definitely counted as a juicy story. Her face had been splashed on all the papers in the country, and her story had been broadcast again and again on the TV news shows.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to normal. I need normal.\u201d Then she shook her head. \u201cAnd I need my dancing.\u201d</p><p>She always had. Dancing had gotten Skye through some of the darkest moments in her life. Dancing had also taken her from his life.</p><p>\u201cI want you to keep a guard with you,\u201d he began.</p><p>Skye opened her mouth to argue.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Trace said, the word grating from him. \u201cAt least for the first few days, just until we make sure the reporters aren\u2019t going to swarm like locusts on you.\u201d He closed the space between them. Caught her wrist in his hand. Such a fragile wrist. The black bruises from the handcuffs no longer marked her.</p><p>That bastard Mitch had kept her handcuffed for days. He\u2019d starved her. Tried to take her away.</p><p>But the bruises had faded.</p><p>She\u2019d healed.</p><p>Trace hadn\u2019t forgotten the fear.</p><p>\u201cLet Reese stay with you,\u201d he said, as his fingers smoothed over her wrist. \u201cJust for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-fine. Just at first, okay? Because I won\u2019t be kept prisoner by anyone. Not even you, Trace.\u201d She pulled away from him. \u201cI have to get back to my routine. I want to open that dance studio, and I will do it.\u201d</p><p>Skye. Always so determined. Her determination was one of the things he loved about her.</p><p>He watched her for a moment longer as she puttered around the kitchen. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the diamonds.\u201d He\u2019d been worried about that. Skye wasn\u2019t the type for flash, but he wanted to shower her in diamonds.</p><p>She glanced back at him in surprise. \u201cOf course, I did. They\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>He had the feeling she was just saying those words to make him happy. The woman didn\u2019t get it. Everything he did was for her. If she didn\u2019t like diamonds, then he\u2019d get her rubies. He\u2019d buy her anything and everything that she wanted.</p><p>But, well, he knew that what she wanted\u2014Skye wanted to head back to her dance studio and work herself down to the bone again.</p><p>Trace cleared his throat. \u201cI took the liberty of having some...upgrades made to the studio while we were away.\u201d He figured he might as well tell her about those additions now.</p><p>Before they\u2019d left town, Skye had rented an old fire station and she\u2019d planned to convert the place into her new dance studio. He\u2019d...helped...with those conversion plans.</p><p>\u201cUpgrades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity. Cameras. Alarms.\u201d Because he wouldn\u2019t put her at risk. \u201cI knew you\u2019d want to go back.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd I needed you to be safe when you did.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tilted up and her eyes seem to warm. \u201cI love you. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He did. Skye\u2019s love was his certainty in life.</p><p>Sometimes, he felt like it might be his only one.</p><p>He smiled back at her. \u201cOf course, you do. What\u2019s not to love?\u201d</p><p>And she laughed. A true, beautiful laugh. Light and free. He could see it then\u2014see her coming back to him. Skye was pushing past her fear and trying to be happy once again.</p><p>He would do anything, everything, to make sure that she stayed happy.</p><p>\u201cArrogant,\u201d she teased.</p><p>His head tilted in acknowledgment. He was. Arrogant. Controlling. Trace was well aware of his many faults.</p><p>And Skye still loved him? He was a lucky bastard, and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re sexy,\u201d she said, giving him a wink. \u201cSomething has to balance that arrogance.\u201d And she left him, giving a saucy roll of her hips as she walked away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. Just watched. Enjoyed the view.</p><p>I will always love you, Skye. Always.</p><p>When she gazed at him, love was in Skye\u2019s eyes, too. Yet Trace couldn\u2019t help but wonder...if she ever learned the full truth about him and all the things he\u2019d done, would Skye still look at him the same way?</p><p>Trace had done more than a little bit of work at the fire station. \u201cUpgrades, my ass,\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>He\u2019d completely renovated the place.</p><p>Skye stepped inside the converted fire station, her gaze darting to the left and the right.</p><p>The hard-wood floors gleamed. Barres had been placed to run the length of the right wall. Floor to ceiling mirrors circled the main room, throwing her reflection back at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there were\u2014there were even storage lockers down the narrow hallway that snaked back from the main room. Shining, silver lockers for her students to use.</p><p>When she actually got her students to start attending her new dance studio.</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d installed new security here,\u201d Skye said.</p> <p>\u201cUh, well, you know the boss,\u201d Reese replied from beside her. \u201cThe guy doesn\u2019t believe in doing things half-way.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe knew you\u2019d want to come back here,\u201d Reese continued. \u201cAnd he told the crew that everything had to be ready for you.\u201d He walked forward and motioned to the speakers that had been mounted on the ceiling. \u201cSurround sound, you know, for that full dance experience.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d come in, ready to get her hands dirty and her muscles aching, as she tore this place into shape.</p><p>But, in true Trace fashion, he\u2019d done it for her.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re pissed or pleased,\u201d Reese said, his drawl deepening as he scratched his jaw. \u201cKinda hard to determine from your expression.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. \u201cI think I\u2019m both.\u201d Pissed because he\u2019d done all of this without her input but pleased because he\u2019d cared enough to try and give her the dream she wanted.</p><p>Pissed or pleased?She still wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Skye turned around and marched out of the main studio room. Trace\u2019s crew had knocked out some walls, opening up the space. Columns secured the ceiling. The place looked huge.</p><p>\u201cHe left the fireman\u2019s pole,\u201d Reese said as he followed after her.</p><p>She glanced to the right. The fireman\u2019s pole gleamed.</p> <p>\u201cThe boss thought you might like it so he left strict instructions for the workers.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze followed that pole upstairs. \u201cWhat about the apartment up there?\u201d Her hands had come to rest on her hips. Had Trace organized the apartment, too? Or had he been so sure that she\u2019d move in with him that he hadn\u2019t even bothered to touch that place?</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Reese coughed. \u201cSecurity was set up there, but I don\u2019t think much else has been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, giving a firm nod. Because that upstairs area was still hers. She might be living with Trace, but she could use the upstairs apartment area as a refuge from the dance studio. She\u2019d decorate every inch of it herself.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Her attention shifted to Reese. He shrugged. \u201cTrace...you know the boss doesn\u2019t think like most people. He knew if you came back here, the way this place was...you\u2019d work like a fiend to get it in shape. He wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace likes his control.\u201d Even in the bedroom. \u201cBut this time, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Because the studio\u2019s condition meant that she could get her business up and running faster. She already had clients scheduled from weeks ago. She could contact them and get this place going\u2014</p><p>And then she\u2019d pay Trace back for the work he\u2019d done. Every cent.</p> <p>Because the studio is mine. She needed it to be.</p><p>Skye rolled her shoulders. This was going to happen. A smile spread over her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll count this as a tentative pleased,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the main door. Skye turned, frowning. She hadn\u2019t told any of her students-to-be that she was back in town yet.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Reese said. He directed her to what had previously been a closet, but when she opened the door, she saw the area had been expanded. Four television screens were mounted on the wall. One showed the rear exterior of the old fire station, two showed the sides of the building, and the largest screen showed the entrance\u2014and the man who stood there.</p><p>\u201cLike the boss said,\u201d Reese told her, \u201che upgraded your security.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward the big screen. \u201cThat\u2019s Alex\u2014Detective Griffin.\u201d The one cop who\u2019d finally believed her story about a stalker.</p><p>She turned away from the screen and hurried toward the front door. She hadn\u2019t seen Alex in weeks. Before my abduction.</p><p>Because Mitch had taken her to New York, the NYPD had taken over the case. They\u2019d closed the file on Mitch Loxley.</p><p>After quickly unbolting the door, Skye swung it open. \u201cDetective Griffin!\u201d A broad smile split her face. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her, and an answering smile slowly stretched across his handsome face. Alex Griffin was just a little shorter than Trace, and his shoulders weren\u2019t quite as wide, but the cop was fit and smart. And he\u2019d been there for Skye when she\u2019d been at the end of her rope.</p><p>Sunlight glinted off his blond hair, and his gaze swept over her. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d He surprised her by pulling her into his arms and giving her a big hug. \u201cDamn good. Because the last time I saw you...\u201d A rough sigh broke from him as he eased back a bit and stared down at her. \u201cYou were lying unconscious in a hospital bed.\u201d</p><p>That response surprised her. \u201cYou came to see me in New York?\u201d The time after her abduction was a blur for her. She\u2019d gone too long without food. Spent too much time in the darkness.</p><p>She\u2019d come too close to death.</p><p>Alex nodded. \u201cI needed to see for myself that you were all right.\u201d Now he frowned. \u201cWeston didn\u2019t tell you I was there?\u201d</p><p>No. He hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Alex dropped his hold. Stepped back fully. This time, when his gaze swept over her, his attention locked on her left hand.</p><p>Or, more specifically, on the ring there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure...\u201d Reese cut in, clearing his throat from behind them, \u201cthat Trace was more concerned with Skye here healing...and not giving her a full visitor listing.\u201d</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t glance at the other man. \u201cShould I congratulate you, Skye?\u201d</p><p>Her throat felt dry. There was something about his tone. A hard edge that worried her. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, straightening her shoulders. \u201cTrace and I\u2014we\u2019re together now and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if he\u2019d have it any other way.\u201d Alex\u2019s growled words definitely held anger.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Reese warned him. \u201cCop or no cop, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alex shook his head and kept staring at Skye. \u201cAs good as it is to see you\u2014awake, aware, and not looking like death anymore\u2014I\u2019m actually here on business.\u201d</p><p>They were still standing in the doorway. Skye backed up and bumped into Reese. \u201cWhat kind of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI transferred to homicide.\u201d</p><p>Uh, okay. She circled around him and shut the door. Her fingers flipped over the lock.</p><p>\u201cThought it was time for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d That was the right response, wasn\u2019t it? From the sound of things, he\u2019d taken a new job, so she was supposed to congratulate him.</p><p>Just as he should have congratulated her.</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze cut to Reese. \u201cCan your guard give us a minute? We need to talk, alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Reese said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Reese.\u201d She walked toward him and patted his arm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go and\u2014well, take a few moments to relax?\u201d Right, like the guy ever relaxed. She\u2019d sure never seen it.</p><p>One brow lifted, but Reese gave a curt nod. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll be close.\u201d Then, after one last, measuring glance at Alex, he was gone.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t speak, not at first. After a few tense moments, he exhaled and asked, \u201cStill under guard duty?\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d thought the exact same thing, Skye\u2019s words held bite as she told him, \u201cIt\u2019s just a precaution, only for a few days. We just wanted to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble from the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the fact that Weston has a shitload of enemies? Deadly enemies? That has nothing to do with the bodyguard detail?\u201d</p><p>His tone was scaring her. \u201cYou said you had business to talk about...\u201d And he was homicide now. Oh, damn, this couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cDoes the name Ben Sharpe mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Ben. The man\u2019s face flashed before her. The feverish intensity of his eyes. The certainty in his voice.</p><p>He\u2019s here. Watching. I know!</p><p>\u201cYou know him,\u201d Alex said, apparently reading the truth on her face.</p><p>\u201cWe met last night,\u201d she said as she rubbed at the knot of tension in the back of her neck. \u201cBriefly.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer to her. \u201cAnd was Weston there for this little meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. He was. Trace and Ben knew each other from\u2014\u201d</p><p>The front door swung open with a creak. Her gaze flew to the door. She\u2019d been sure that she locked it\u2014</p><p>Trace stood in the doorway.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d have his own key.</p><p>\u201cGriffin.\u201d Trace bit out the cop\u2019s name. \u201cYou moved fast.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cGuess you heard, huh? Or did the bodyguard call you and tell you to haul ass over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just a few blocks away. I didn\u2019t have to haul ass that much.\u201d Trace closed the distance between them. He put his body next to Skye\u2019s but kept his attention on the detective. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be questioning Skye. She doesn\u2019t even know Ben.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s brow shot up again. \u201cReally? Because she was just telling me that she did. Skye said that she met him last night, with you.\u201d</p><p>The tension between the two men was palpable.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Skye demanded as she threw her hands up in the air. \u201cWhy are you asking these questions about Ben?\u201d</p><p>But she already knew. The twist in her gut told her the truth, and she didn\u2019t really want to hear it. She didn\u2019t want to hear Alex say\u2014</p><p>\u201cBen Sharpe\u2019s body was found this morning, tossed away like garbage in an alley.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fell to her sides.</p><p>So it would seem that Ben hadn\u2019t been so crazy after all. \u201cHe said someone was watching him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDid he now...?\u201d Alex drawled.</p><p>Her knees were trembling. \u201cHow did you know we were connected to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty easy to follow the dots.\u201d Alex inclined his head toward her. \u201cThe guy had a picture of you\u2014some grainy shot torn from a newspaper\u2014in his pocket.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s your mistake, and she\u2019s going to destroy you. Ben\u2019s words replayed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, there was the business card.\u201d Now Alex\u2019s attention shifted to Trace. \u201cYour business card, Weston. A card that was gripped tightly in the dead man\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced in her chest. \u201cWh-when did Ben die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medical examiner says it was last night, sometime between midnight and two a.m.\u201d</p><p>Trace had been gone after midnight.</p><p>\u201cNow...see...that\u2019s not really the question that I expected you to ask,\u201d Alex said, and his gaze was right back on her. \u201cMaybe something like...how did he die? But jumping straight to when...that\u2019s not what most folks usually do. Unless, well, unless they\u2019re trying to work out an alibi.\u201d He paused a beat. \u201cAre you doing that, Skye? Are you trying to work out some kind of alibi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she isn\u2019t,\u201d Trace snarled. His fingers caught hers. Twined with them. Squeezed lightly. \u201cWe appreciate you notifying us of Ben\u2019s death, Detective Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the bull,\u201d Alex suddenly demanded. \u201cYou and I both know I\u2019m not here for some kind of notification.\u201d He advanced on Trace until the men stood toe-to-toe. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here, man? Did you have something to do with the guy\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Skye sucked in a sharp breath. Trace glanced back at her. He stared into her eyes, then he lifted her hand. He brought it to his lips and lightly kissed her knuckles. Her ring caught the light, gleaming even brighter.</p><p>Trace was still looking at Skye when he said, \u201cNo. I had nothing to do with Ben\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>She had the feeling he was trying to convince her of that fact, not Alex.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know how he died?\u201d Alex pushed.</p><p>Trace kept his hold on Skye\u2019s fingers, but he looked at Alex once more. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d Trace asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone carved him up with a knife.\u201d</p><p>Skye flinched. Instinctively, she tried to jerk her hand away from Trace. He didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was the guy doing in that alley?\u201d The question erupted from Alex. \u201cWhy was he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen Sharpe was a very disturbed individual. He suffered from severe PTSD. He had hallucinations, delusions.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cAnd I\u2019d recently learned that he had stopped taking his medications. My card...\u201d He exhaled on a hard breath. \u201cHe had my card because I wanted to help him, not because I was the man who took his life.\u201d</p><p>It felt like her thundering heartbeat was shaking Skye\u2019s entire chest.</p><p>The floor creaked behind her, and she turned to see Reese standing there, watching them.</p><p>\u201cAnd Skye\u2019s picture?\u201d Alex asked as he glared suspiciously at Trace. \u201cWhy\u2019d he have that?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s fingers tightened on hers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Ben would need to be the one to tell you about that.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s your mistake, and she\u2019s going to destroy you.</p><p>Alex watched them in silence. It was the thick and hard and uncomfortable type of silence.</p><p>Finally, Alex said, \u201cLet\u2019s just get this out of the way. I\u2019m going to assume you were both together last night? She can alibi you, Weston?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Trace said. \u201cI was home with my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The lie rolled so easily off his tongue.</p><p>But even as Trace said the words, Alex\u2019s gaze was on Skye\u2019s face.</p> <p>Did I flinch? Did I show any sign that Trace just lied?</p><p>Alex inclined his head. \u201cThen I guess that will be all...for now.\u201d He stepped back. Paused. \u201cIt is good to see you again, Skye.\u201d His gaze seemed to warm. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me in that hospital, and I\u2019m damn glad you survived that bastard\u2019s attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Trace motioned with his hand. Immediately, Reese advanced and escorted the detective back outside.</p><p>Skye waited a few seconds, making sure that both Reese and Alex were out of ear shot. Then she jerked free of Trace\u2019s hand and rushed into the main studio. Her reflection stared back at her\u2014eyes too wide, skin too pale.</p> <p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>She turned to confront him. \u201cWhat in the hell was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a robbery.\u201d He shook his head. The faint lines near his eyes had deepened, making him appear grim. \u201cBen was in the wrong place and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to Alex.\u201d</p><p>At her words, every bit of emotion vanished from Trace\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up last night. You were gone. That\u2019s what I mean.\u201d And she was shaking. Nausea tightened her stomach. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t go after Ben. Tell me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He shot forward and grabbed her forearms. \u201cI wanted to help him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear this. Hadn\u2019t she just said for him to tell her that he didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cI found Ben. I tried to get him to come with me so that I could help him, but the guy refused. He ran away from me. He left, and I went back home, to you.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt was storming and the lightning lit up the bedroom.\u201d His pupils expanded, swallowing some of the bright blue in his gaze. \u201cYou were wearing the diamonds and the black robe I bought for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d fallen asleep in that robe, and she\u2019d kept the diamonds on\u2014for him.</p><p>\u201cYou were curled up in my bed, looking so sexy you made me ache. I climbed into that bed with you. I held you because I didn\u2019t want you to have another nightmare. I wanted you to know that you were safe with me.\u201d His voice thickened. \u201cI was with you. When Ben was killed, I was with you.\u201d</p><p>There was a raw edge to his voice. Almost a desperation, but there was still no emotion on Trace\u2019s face. She searched his gaze and believed him. \u201cFind out who killed him.\u201d Trace could do it. His company, Weston Securities, had nearly limitless resources.</p> <p>Trace had found her when she\u2019d vanished.</p><p>He could find Ben Sharpe\u2019s killer.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised her, and he let her go.</p><p>Her heartbeat was starting to slow down. The ache in her chest had eased.</p><p>Trace glanced around the studio. \u201cAre you pissed?\u201d</p><p>What? She blinked. He was going to ask that now?</p><p>\u201cWe can change it.\u201d He straightened his tie. Not that it needed straightening. \u201cAnything that isn\u2019t right, the designers can fix. I just wanted the place to be ready for you. A-a wedding present.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cBut Reese called me...said you were angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Not any longer. \u201cI like my present.\u201d</p><p>The tension eased from him. She could see it vanish.</p><p>\u201cBut next time,\u201d Skye added, \u201cask first.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>He started to walk away. Skye wasn\u2019t having that. She grabbed Trace and pushed him back against the mirror.</p><p>His gaze widened in surprise.</p><p>Ah, there it was. Real emotion.</p><p>She pressed up onto her toes and leaned into him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you lying to me.\u201d Her voice was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you and me. Us. Forever. No secrets and no lies.\u201d</p><p>His hands closed around her hips. Now he was the one holding her in place. \u201cWhat happens when you don\u2019t like my secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I\u2019ll like?\u201d Her voice had gone husky.</p><p>He was too controlled, even then. There was a wall between them, one that she was determined to break. Skye wanted it to shatter, just like the mirrors around her could shatter.</p><p>One hard punch\u2014shatter.</p><p>\u201cI know who you want me to be.\u201d The words seemed torn from Trace. \u201cLet me be that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d Good and bad and everything in between.</p><p>In her darkest moment, he\u2019d been there for her.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t he see that she wanted to be there for him?</p><p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d Trace said. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Then he moved, lightning fast. He spun them around, switching their positions so that she was the one penned against the cold pane of the mirror. And his mouth was on hers, crushing down.</p><p>Not with careful restraint. Not with studied passion. But with wild, driving lust. His mouth was hard. His kiss demanding. His tongue thrust into her mouth and took.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t treating her like a delicate china doll\u2014the way he\u2019d been treating her since the attack. Wasn\u2019t holding her carefully.</p><p>The fire was there, exploding between them. The fire that she needed and wanted so badly.</p><p>She\u2019d been cold, until then.</p><p>Lost, until then.</p><p>He lifted her up, holding her easily and pressing her back even harder against the mirror\u2019s surface. His tongue thrust into her mouth again. His arms and scent and body surrounded her.</p><p>She wanted him naked.</p><p>Wanted to take and take until they were both lost.</p><p>Wanted everything\u2014</p><p>Then she heard it. The shattering of glass.</p><p>One hard punch\u2014shatter.</p><p>Her eyes flew open even as Trace jerked her away from the mirror.</p><p>\u201cFuck! Skye!\u201d</p><p>The mirror had shattered behind her. No, not behind her, but beneath Trace\u2019s hand.</p><p>He\u2019d hit the mirror? She hadn\u2019t even realized\u2014</p><p>His hands were running all over her now. \u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d A feverish intensity thickened the words. \u201cI see the blood. Tell me where, baby, tell me-\u201d</p><p>Skye caught his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not my blood. It\u2019s yours.\u201d She turned over his right hand, showing him the knuckles and the red slashes courtesy of the broken mirror.</p><p>He stilled. Stared down at the blood.</p><p>Skye licked her lips, and she tasted him. \u201cThey\u2019re just scratches. We\u2019ll go wash the blood off and get you cleaned up.\u201d She tried to tug him toward the bathroom.</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI want you so much.\u201d</p><p>His deep, growling words made her heart jump.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I can\u2019t control myself. I\u2019m strong\u2014too rough for you. If I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019ll break you, the same way I broke the mirror.\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t listening. Trace had pulled away from her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you,\u201d he said, but he wasn\u2019t looking her in the eyes. \u201cAnd I was about to take you. I was so rough I broke the damn mirror.\u201d He stormed away.</p><p>She stood there, staring after him, aching.</p><p>He\u2019s leaving.</p><p>\u201cYou broke the mirror, but you didn\u2019t break me!\u201d Skye called.</p><p>Trace stilled.</p><p>Okay. She sucked in a couple of deep breaths. \u201cI\u2019m not a mirror or a doll or anything\u2014I\u2019m a woman.\u201d Your woman. \u201cBut you keep seeing me as a victim, and it has to stop.\u201d The words were pulled from deep within her.</p><p>And they were true.</p><p>She was trying to heal.</p><p>He was still seeing her as the broken woman that he\u2019d carried from the basement.</p><p>Shaking his head, Trace looked back at her. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it? \u201cThen lose control with me. Stop holding it so tightly.\u201d She stepped forward and the broken mirror crunched beneath her feet. Screw the mirror. \u201cI don\u2019t want the fancy tycoon. I don\u2019t want the suave gentleman.\u201d She\u2019d seen him play those roles too easily. \u201cI want the man beneath the mask you wear.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in Trace\u2019s jaw. \u201cBe careful what you wish for, baby.\u201d</p><p>Another step. The mirror crunched again and\u2014</p><p>He had her in his arms. \u201cThe mirror could cut through your shoes. You could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He was always protecting her.</p><p>Even from himself.</p><p>He put her down a few feet away. \u201cI\u2019ll send a crew over for repairs.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at the mess. His blood had dripped onto some of the broken shards.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back to study him.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not a fucking victim. I know...\u201d He put his forehead to hers. \u201cThat you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Alex Griffin eased into his car. His gaze locked on the old fire station just across the street. Skye\u2019s studio.</p><p>Reese Stokes stood outside, a guard who was watching Alex with an avid stare.</p><p>There was no sign of Skye or Weston.</p><p>Alex\u2019s fingers drummed on the steering wheel.</p><p>Trace Weston was a very dangerous man. He was also a man used to being in total control\u2014both of himself and of those around him.</p><p>When Weston had said that he had an alibi, that he\u2019d been with Skye, those words had rolled so easily from the man\u2019s mouth. His expression had been set. Seemingly open.</p><p>But Skye...her eyes had widened. A small movement, but one that Alex had caught because he\u2019d been watching her so closely.</p><p>When it came to lying, Skye wasn\u2019t as good as her lover.</p><p>In Alex\u2019s experience, there was only one reason a man lied about an alibi.</p><p>Because the man was guilty as sin.</p><p>His gut had told him that Trace Weston was a threat, right from the very first moment that they\u2019d met.</p><p>But Weston had saved Skye so he\u2019d thought...</p><p>Screw what I thought.</p><p>He was going to keep following this case. He\u2019d see where the evidence took him. And if he found out that Trace Weston was responsible for Ben Sharpe\u2019s death, he would take the man down.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care how much money Weston had.</p><p>Justice came to everyone, and the guilty\u2014they paid.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Trace stared down at the bandage on his right hand. Skye had insisted on bandaging him up. Hell, he guessed it was a good thing that he\u2019d told his men to stock a first aid kit at the dance studio.</p><p>She\u2019d carefully applied the bandages, her fingers so soft against his hand.</p><p>No one else had ever cared about him, not the way that Skye did. Hell, his mother had spent more time inside a bottle than out in the real world with him.</p><p>He\u2019d bounced from foster home to foster home. He hadn\u2019t felt any connection with anyone. He\u2019d wondered if he could even connect.</p><p>Then he\u2019d met her.</p><p>Trace stared at the stark white bandages. He\u2019d lost control for a moment. Wanted her so badly...</p><p>He\u2019d driven his hand right into the mirror.</p><p>Shattered it. But I won\u2019t shatter her.</p><p>\u201cAh...boss?\u201d</p><p>Trace stood just outside of Skye\u2019s studio. The sunlight glinted down on him, and Reese waited a few feet away, studying him with cautious eyes.</p><p>Trace strode toward the other man. Skye was still inside. The clean-up crew would be arriving there soon.</p><p>\u201cIs the cop gone?\u201d Trace asked, getting right to business.</p><p>Reese nodded. \u201cHe just left but, you should know, I don\u2019t think he bought your alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s not going to be able to tie me to Ben Sharpe\u2019s murder.\u201d Ben, why the hell did you seek me out? Why didn\u2019t you just stay hidden? You could have stayed alive then.</p><p>\u201cThe detective\u2019s gonna dig.\u201d Reese thrust his hands into the pockets of his pants. \u201cAre you worried about what he\u2019ll find when he starts poking around in Sharpe\u2019s past?\u201d</p><p>Sharpe\u2019s past was linked to Trace\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019ll see the official records, nothing more.\u201d Because there were things that Uncle Sam wanted covered up, too.</p><p>Some blood and death didn\u2019t need to ever see the light of day.</p><p>\u201cYou went after Sharpe.\u201d Reese\u2019s voice was hesitant. \u201cIs the ME gonna find anything on his body that will link back to you?\u201d</p><p>Trace remembered the instant back at his penthouse when he\u2019d shoved his forearm under Ben\u2019s jaw. Rage had burned through him in that moment, and he\u2019d reacted purely on instinct. \u201cI think I\u2019m clear.\u201d</p><p>Trace glanced back at the fire station\u2014no, it was a studio now, her studio. \u201cStay close to her.\u201d He pulled out his keys.</p><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Reese.</p><p>\u201cThere something that you want to tell me?\u201d Reese\u2019s gaze was steady. \u201cYou pulled me off Sharpe\u2019s detail last night. Told me that you could handle things.\u201d</p><p>Reese thinks I killed him. Trace shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else you need to know. Not yet.\u201d Not until Trace had done some digging of his own.</p><p>Reese gave a grim nod.</p><p>Trace looked down at his hands. The tanned flesh. The callused fingertips. Sure, he wore the thousand dollar suits. He sat in the boardrooms. He played the games.</p><p>But there was more to him than that. And there would always be blood on his hands. One way or another.</p><p>Alex Griffin paused outside of the nondescript apartment. He heard the rumble of the train outside the building, the scream of sirens.</p><p>He was following a hunch that he sure hadn\u2019t shared with his new captain. Because when it came to Trace Weston, the captain would let fear rule him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fear of money and power. Alex had seen that same shit go down before. It wasn\u2019t happening again.</p><p>Alex raised his hand and pounded against the door. He had little to lose\u2014so why worry about fear?</p><p>Footsteps shuffled toward him, then the door opened, and a man stared out at him with bleary eyes. Thick stubble lined his jaw, and his eyes, a muddy brown, widened as he took in Alex.</p> <p>\u201cYou again?\u201d the man demanded as he shoved back his dirty blond hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Parker, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d The guy definitely didn\u2019t sound happy to see him, but Parker Jacobs backed up and let Alex into his apartment.</p><p>The place was a dump. Not because of its location, but because Parker Jacobs was a slob. Half-eaten food and old newspapers littered the area. A pile of dirty clothes hid the couch.</p><p>Parker shoved the dirty shirts and jeans away and slumped on the faded cushions. \u201cWhy the repeat visit?\u201d Parker ran a hand over his face. \u201cI told you everything I knew about Trace and Skye last time.\u201d</p> <p>Alex didn\u2019t sit. He crossed his arms and stared down at Parker, carefully studying the other man. There was a heavy bump in the middle of Parker\u2019s nose, from an old break. A break that Alex knew Trace Weston had caused.</p><p>\u201cYour parents took in Trace and Skye as foster kids when you were sixteen,\u201d Alex said. He figured it was better to start back at the beginning.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Parker exhaled heavily. \u201cIf we\u2019re going over all of this crap again, then I need a drink.\u201d He lunged up from the couch.</p><p>Alex shoved him back down. He\u2019d already smelled the alcohol on the guy\u2019s breath. His breath, his clothes, his skin. The guy reeked. \u201cYou\u2019ve had more than enough already.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s eyes narrowed into angry slits.</p><p>He\u2019d heard this story before, but Alex needed to hear it again. So he said, \u201cThey took them in, but the first night Trace Weston was there\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe asshole attacked me!\u201d Parker\u2019s trembling hand slid over his nose. \u201cHe pounded my face, again and again. The jerk is crazy. Fuckin\u2019 insane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why did he attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you last time, when you came sniffin\u2019 around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me again.\u201d He kept his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cBecause that slut Skye was playin\u2019 us both! He caught us together and freaked the hell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying you both,\u201d Alex repeated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t buy her innocent act.\u201d Now disgust thickened Parker\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. She wanted me, and she came after me.\u201d</p><p>Alex cocked his head. \u201cIf Trace had just arrived at the house, then how was Skye playing him? How did she\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think he knew her from before. He had to.\u201d Parker\u2019s breath blew out on a hard sigh. \u201cThe way he looked at her. The way he acted...it was like she was already his. I should\u2019ve read the signs. I should\u2019ve stayed away from that cock tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d Alex murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd he nearly beat me to death.\u201d Fury was there. Reddening Parker\u2019s cheeks and snapping in his words. \u201cTrace deserves payback, that\u2019s what he deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he stop?\u201d</p><p>Parker shook his head. His hair was thick and matted, and it sagged over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he kill you, Parker? Why did Trace Weston let you live?\u201d</p><p>Parker seemed to think about that. Thinking didn\u2019t exactly look easy for the guy. \u201cBecause...because Skye told him to stop.\u201d The memory was there. Alex could see it on Parker\u2019s face. He also saw the flash of rage that followed that memory. \u201cHe always has been her dog, tied on her leash.\u201d</p><p>Alex hated talking to the jackass, but Parker Jacobs was the one person who was actually linked to Skye and Weston. He knew their past\u2014and he was willing to talk about it.</p><p>Now, with calculation, Alex threw out, \u201cBoth Trace and Skye told me that you were a liar. That you fed me a story of bull about what really happened that night.\u201d</p><p>Parker glared up at him. \u201cWhat happened...I kissed his precious Skye. He went psycho, and I wound up in the hospital.\u201d Once more, his fingers slid over his nose, as if checking the old wound. \u201cWhen it comes to Skye, Trace isn\u2019t exactly the controlled kind of guy. Some women are like that, you know. They can push a man too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Skye push you too far?\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The faster breathing. The gaze that darted nervously around the room.</p><p>\u201cDid she push you,\u201d Alex asked softly, \u201cand you decided that you just had to take what she was offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just kissing her\u2014\u201d</p><p>And Alex took a stab in the dark. \u201cThen why\u2019d she cry out for help?\u201d</p><p>Parker jumped to his feet once more. \u201cBecause she wanted to set me up! She was a cock tease, I told you! She wanted me to kiss her, but when things got rough, she started crying and begging me to stop. I had to put my hand over her mouth, but it was too late. Trace had heard and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Parker grabbed him and shoved the guy against the nearest wall. \u201cSo that\u2019s what the truth sounds like from you.\u201d</p><p>When Skye had been stalked, Alex had questioned the guy. Cleared him because the man had plenty of people to back up his alibis. And Parker had been too happy to tell him about Weston\u2019s dark side.</p><p>No wonder Weston attacked you. You were hurting Skye.</p><p>Alex had come to realize that Weston didn\u2019t let anyone hurt Skye. The last man who had\u2014the bastard who\u2019d kidnapped her\u2014Weston had sent him to hell.</p><p>Alex\u2019s muscles were hard with his own fury. \u201cYou were hurting Skye, and Trace stopped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to beat me to death!\u201d Parker heaved against him.</p><p>Alex just tightened his grip. \u201cYet you\u2019re still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because of Skye. She pulled off her attack dog, that bitch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds to me like you should be grateful to her, instead of calling her a bitch.\u201d He stared into the man\u2019s eyes, and Alex saw his own past.</p><p>His sister...she\u2019d been hurt. She\u2019d trusted the wrong man and\u2014</p><p>\u201cTrace Weston is psychotic.\u201d Spittle flew from Parker\u2019s mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s a ticking time bomb, and that man\u2019s gonna explode.\u201d</p><p>Alex sucked in a deep breath. Then another. And he forced himself to back away from Parker. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw either Trace Weston or Skye Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen them in years.\u201d Parker\u2019s thumb jerked toward the TV set. \u201cExcept on the screen. Their faces have been splashed plenty there.\u201d</p><p>Yes, they had.</p><p>Alex had one more question for the asshole. \u201cWhat do you know about Trace Weston\u2019s time in the military?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. I was hoping the guy would get his ass blown to hell.\u201d Parker rolled back his shoulders. \u201cInstead, he came home to a freakin\u2019 fortune.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had.</p><p>Ben Sharpe had been in the military, too. When he\u2019d been found dead, the man had still been wearing his dog tags.</p><p>He suffered PTSD. That had been Weston\u2019s line.</p><p>Just what had happened to Sharpe during his days in the military?</p><p>Weston and his secrets...the man was going to drown in them.</p><p>Alex marched for the door.</p><p>\u201cBut at least the bitch got hers, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Now there was smug pleasure in Parker\u2019s voice. \u201cThat doc took her and held her in that basement. I bet he did all kinds of things to her...all kinds...\u201d</p><p>Alex slowly turned back to stare at Parker. \u201cYou\u2019re a sick fuck.\u201d</p><p>Parker smiled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say that the first time we met, Detective Griffin. Back then, you were so eager to find out dirt on Trace. You keep digging, and you\u2019ll find plenty.\u201d</p><p>He was already staring at dirt. \u201cSkye should\u2019ve pressed charges against you when you tried to rape her.\u201d</p><p>Parker flinched.</p><p>Sonofabitch\u2014that\u2019s exactly what he had done.</p><p>Alex\u2019s hands fisted so hard they ached.</p><p>But Parker...he recovered fast and his smile grew.</p><p>Alex knew he was staring right into the eyes of a monster.</p><p>She danced until her muscles trembled. Until her calves clenched and the balls of her feet knotted.</p><p>Then Skye danced some more.</p><p>Sweat gleamed on her body. Her hair was in a bun, but loose tendrils had escaped\u2014they were slick and clung against the side of her face.</p><p>The music kept pounding.</p><p>She flew up onto her toes. Grabbed the barre. Stretched\u2014</p><p>And saw Trace\u2019s reflection behind her.</p><p>He stood there, just watching her. For an instant, Skye faltered.</p><p>He\u2019d left over eight hours ago. Left after making her ache\u2014and leaving her unfulfilled. Reese had been keeping guard from the other room. Her music had driven him away.</p><p>And the music had covered Trace\u2019s entrance.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d She didn\u2019t hear those words from him, but she saw his lips move and form them.</p><p>Her breath eased from her. Skye lifted her hands over her head, stretching. Her left leg came up, moving easily, fluidly, despite the injury that had sent her running from dance.</p><p>An injury that had changed her life.</p><p>She\u2019d been in a car accident one rainy night after a performance. For hours, she\u2019d been trapped in that car. Her leg had been savaged.</p><p>But she\u2019d recovered. One painful step at a time.</p><p>She\u2019d walked again. She\u2019d danced.</p><p>She turned then, fully facing Trace. Her eyes locked on his face. My spotting place. He would be her constant as she danced. It was a trick most dancers used. Focusing on one object to maintain control and balance during turns.</p><p>He is my constant.</p><p>Skye straightened her shoulders, balanced, focused on him\u2014and she turned. Once. Twice.</p><p>Her gaze locked on his.</p><p>Again.</p><p>His face.</p><p>She spun, moving fast and furiously so that her body would almost appear to be a blur, and he was what she saw. He was her only focus.</p><p>Always.</p><p>He was\u2014</p><p>Trace caught her, stopping her spin. Bringing her close against him.</p><p>\u201cI-I thought you wanted me to dance,\u201d she whispered as her breath blew out in a frantic gasp.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI never understood how you could spin that fast, that much, without getting dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d her voice was soft, breathless. \u201cI just look at you.\u201d</p><p>His pupils expanded, the darkness covering more of that amazing blue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my center. My focus. For every spin, a ballerina needs a focus.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t just talking about dancing.</p><p>They both knew it.</p><p>She glanced down at their bodies. She was covered in sweat and his suit, well, she didn\u2019t even want to know how much it cost. Hurriedly, Skye backed away from him. \u201cI-I need to shower real fast and get changed. Give me just a minute.\u201d</p><p>The music had died away. The end of her routine. The spin was the end.</p><p>Her steps were soundless as she walked across the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t limp.\u201d</p><p>Her stride faltered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you carefully for weeks now, and I never see you limp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I hadn\u2019t been doing much dancing during those weeks, either. After today, my muscles will feel it.\u201d Particularly the muscles in her left calf. Her left leg would always be weaker. Her constant reminder of the life that was gone now.</p><p>But I don\u2019t miss the bright stages or the crowds. The stage hadn\u2019t actually ever mattered to her. Neither had the crowds. It was the dancing that she loved.</p><p>\u201cYou left New York because you didn\u2019t think you could dance as well again. Not after the crash.\u201d</p><p>Skye glanced down at her leg. Her tights covered the scars there. Her leg had needed surgery\u2014so many surgeries\u2014to recover. She\u2019d been in therapy for months.</p><p>The scars were still there. They always would be. And her dancing...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dancing for the stage anymore. That\u2019s over. I\u2019m dancing for me.\u201d She\u2019d said good-bye to her life in New York. She\u2019d come back to Chicago to start over.</p><p>And she\u2019d found Trace.</p><p>Her head lifted and she glanced toward the now-repaired mirror. She could see Trace\u2019s reflection. He stared at her and said, \u201cI think you\u2019re the most amazing dancer that I\u2019ve ever seen. When I watch you, I forget everything else. You...make me forget.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her hands around her stomach. \u201cI should...I\u2019ll be just a moment.\u201d Then she fled.</p><p>Skye stripped and hurried into the shower area. The water blasted onto her, and she glanced down at her body once more. Without the clothes, the tights, there was no hiding.</p><p>Her gaze hit her left leg. The scars weren\u2019t an angry red any longer. Pale, white. Twisting on her skin.</p><p>Before the accident, her dancing had lit up the stage. Prima ballerina. She\u2019d worked toward that goal for years.</p><p>After the crash...she\u2019d had nothing. All of her money had been used to pay the medical bills, and the first time she\u2019d tried to dance\u2014</p><p>I fell. Again and again, I fell.</p><p>Her hand flew out, and she jerked off the water. She shivered, standing there, dripping wet, with the past around her.</p><p>Maybe Trace was right. Maybe looking at the past was wrong.</p><p>She grabbed a towel. Dried off. Dressed as quickly as she could. Jeans. A loose top. Sandals. She hurried back to Trace. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d Skye called out. \u201cWe can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in the studio. The lights were on, but there was no sign of Trace.</p><p>She made her way to the front of the building. Skye found him, sitting in one of the new chairs that had been brought over. His gaze was directed out of the window, staring at the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I came out here,\u201d he said, not glancing her way, \u201cI figured I\u2019d be less likely to jump you in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved at that. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have minded a little jumping.\u201d</p><p>She saw his hands tighten along the arms of the chair. \u201cMy...self-control isn\u2019t what it needs to be tonight. Not for you.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d better not be back to that.</p><p>He rose then and offered her his arm. \u201cI want to get you home.\u201d</p><p>Home. She liked the way he said it. Did Trace realize that the only home she\u2019d really had, since she\u2019d been fifteen\u2014well, it had been with him? Trace was her home.</p><p>They left the studio. The streetlights were on, spilling light onto the pavement. There was no sign of Reese, but Trace\u2019s dark Jag waited near the corner of the street.</p><p>He led her to the passenger side door. Started to open it, then stopped.</p> <p>She looked up, wondering what was wrong, and Skye saw that he was staring across the street. Trace was looking at the figure that stood\u2014waiting, watching\u2014just beneath the street light.</p><p>A baseball cap was on the man\u2019s head. His shoulders were hunched, so Skye couldn\u2019t see him clearly. He had on jeans, and, even though the weather had warmed, he wore a light coat.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d Trace ordered her. In a flash, he\u2019d yanked the door open. Pushed her into the seat.</p><p>And then he rushed across the street.</p><p>What the hell? Skye jumped from the car and ran after him. \u201cTrace, stop!\u201d</p><p>The man in the baseball cap was lifting something from his coat. Something small and dark.</p> <p>A gun. Dear God, what if it\u2019s a gun?</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d Skye yelled.</p><p>He leapt up onto the curb. Grabbed the man\u2019s hand. Light flashed. The guy screamed. His baseball cap slipped to the ground.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d The streetlight fell on his face.</p><p>An angled jaw. A hawkish nose. High forehead.</p><p>A stranger. Skye had no idea who this man was.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t attack me, man!\u201d The fellow snarled. \u201cI\u2019m Press! I\u2019ve got rights, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The flash of light. Skye glanced down and saw the shattered remains of the camera on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cThis-this is assault,\u201d the guy sputtered. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was cold and hard. \u201cWant to know what I\u2019ll do next?\u201d His hand shoved into the man\u2019s pocket, and Trace yanked out a wallet. He flipped it open, thumbing through the contents.</p><p>\u201cStop! What. The Hell!\u201d</p><p>She saw that Trace had found the guy\u2019s ID.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call your boss, Clyde Jones. I\u2019ll get your ass fired.\u201d Trace tossed the wallet back at the man. \u201cBecause what kind of Press hides in the shadows, stalking a woman? What were you going to do if she\u2019d come out alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-just take some pictures.\u201d Clyde swiped the broken camera from the ground. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been an exclusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the exclusive,\u201d Trace spat. \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d He caught Skye\u2019s hand, linked his fingers with hers, and marched back across the street.</p><p>A few moments later, he spun out of the lot with a squeal of the Jag\u2019s tires.</p><p>Adrenaline beat in Skye\u2019s blood. \u201cI-I couldn\u2019t tell that he had a camera. I thought it was a gun.\u201d</p><p>The Jag\u2019s motor revved. \u201cAnd you still chased after me, knowing the jerk could have a weapon?\u201d Trace spared her a glittering glare. \u201cI told you to get in the car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t feel like waiting for you to fight my battles!\u201d The words burst from her.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d The scent of leather filled the car\u2019s interior. \u201cGiving me guards. Trying to protect me, twenty-four, seven. You can\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve told you already, I won\u2019t live in a prison. Not even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you safe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee of safety. Not for any of us.\u201d Ben Sharpe had discovered that truth. \u201cThe guy on the street was a reporter. He would have taken some pictures and been done. He\u2019s not going to be the only one who comes wanting a story, and you can\u2019t attack reporters every time they show up.\u201d</p><p>He slowed at a red light.</p><p>\u201cHe could press charges against you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLet him try.\u201d</p><p>The wildness was there again. In the slightly cruel curve of his lip. In his eyes as he glanced over at her.</p><p>Trace was balanced on a razor\u2019s edge\u2014he\u2019d been that way for weeks, and Skye couldn\u2019t help but wonder what would happen when he fell over the edge.</p><p>Her hand lifted and curved around his. His fingers were clenched tightly along the wheel. \u201cYou saved me, Trace.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids flickered.</p><p>\u201cYou got me out of that basement. I\u2019m alive. You\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>A car horn honked behind them.</p><p>Swearing, Trace accelerated.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>\u201cEverything is going to be okay,\u201d she told him. She wanted to soothe him, to just hold him.</p><p>But Trace gave a hard shake of his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know...\u201d His words faded into silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it that I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your nightmares. I have mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens in your nightmares?\u201d</p><p>He was staring straight ahead, at the dark road. \u201cI don\u2019t get to you in time.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to stop.</p><p>\u201cAnd without you, I go fucking insane.\u201d</p><p>Every man had a strength.</p><p>And every man had a weakness.</p><p>When it came to Trace Weston, the man\u2019s greatest weakness was Skye Sullivan.</p><p>From the shadows, he watched as the reporter stomped away. The guy was clutching his camera. Muttering about lawsuits.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>He crept up behind the man. He\u2019d overhead their conversation easily enough. Trace had been so focused on Clyde Jones that he\u2019d never looked around for another threat.</p><p>His mistake.</p><p>No, his weakness. The woman seemed to consume Weston, and when a man fell that hard\u2014</p><p>It was the perfect moment to strike.</p><p>He pulled out his weapon, and his fingers curled around the handle of his knife.</p><p>It would be so easy to take out Clyde Jones. A fast swipe of his knife. The guy was a leech. A vulture who made his living by feeding off the pain of others.</p><p>If he killed Jones, then he\u2019d probably be doing the world a favor.</p><p>But he\u2019s not my target.</p><p>Jones swore and headed toward the busy intersection. \u201cTaxi!\u201d Jones shouted.</p><p>He put up his knife. He\u2019d learned to control his impulses long ago. Jones could keep breathing.</p><p>But Weston? Soon enough, he\u2019d be dying.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>He grabbed her, his fingers closing tight around her arm. Trace yanked Skye against him, and her eyes flew open. She couldn\u2019t see anything, it was too dark, but she knew his touch.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d She whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t let go...\u201d His fingers bit into her as he muttered those words.</p><p>Skye tried to shift toward him. They were in bed. It was the middle of the night and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want to...kill...\u201d</p><p>His rasped words stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cSo...fucking sorry...have to do it...\u201d</p><p>And his hands lifted\u2014to her throat.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d She screamed his name as real fear pulsed through her.</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>The only sound then was their breathing\u2014both ragged. Panting.</p><p>\u201cSkye?\u201d Confusion thickened his voice.</p><p>His hands pulled away from her. He pulled away. Trace rolled to the side of the bed and flipped on the lamp. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Trace demanded as his gaze swept over her. \u201cDid you have another nightmare?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t moved. She couldn\u2019t. His hands had been going for her throat as if\u2014as if he would kill her.</p><p>Trace would never do that.</p><p>She licked her lips. Every single bit of moisture in her mouth seemed to have vanished. \u201cYou were the one having the bad dream.\u201d</p><p>Shadows were all around them. The lamp spilled a small pool of light onto the bed. Everything else\u2014darkness.</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it. I\u2019m...sorry if I woke you.\u201d</p><p>Those words jerked Skye out of her stupor. She sat up, letting the sheet fall away. \u201cI\u2019ve woken you up nearly every night for the last month. Don\u2019t talk to me about sorry.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cSomething scared you. You said...you said you didn\u2019t want to kill, but you had to do it.\u201d Her stomach was in knots. \u201cIt\u2019s because of me. You killed to save me, and now the memory is there, tearing you apart\u2014\u201d</p><p>His laughter stopped her. Cold. Bitter laughter. \u201cThat particular memory has nothing to do with you.\u201d He leaned toward her, caging her with his body. \u201cYou think I regret what I did to Mitch Loxley?\u201d</p><p>She tried to search his gaze. There wasn\u2019t enough light.</p><p>\u201cNot for an instant. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead. I just wish I\u2019d made him suffer more before I sent him to hell.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. \u201cThen what gives you nightmares?\u201d Her question was a hoarse whisper.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cOne secret.\u201d Skye grabbed his shoulders, desperate. \u201cThat\u2019s what we can start with. That\u2019s what I want from you, Trace. That\u2019s what I think I deserve.\u201d No, Skye actually thought that she deserved all of his secrets. And she\u2019d get them. Sooner or later.</p><p>His hand came up to her throat. His fingers lightly caressed the flesh. This touch was so different from the one that had come before. \u201cYou were choking me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He flinched.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you weren\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d screwed that up. In his dream, his memory, he\u2019d been attacking someone else. \u201cYou went to touch my neck...you said you had to kill, and I called your name.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her. Sat on the edge of the bed with his head hanging down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Scaring you is the last thing I ever wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him and pressed a kiss to his broad back. He was so tense beneath her lips. So warm and hard and strong. \u201cOne secret at a time.\u201d Would that be so hard? They had to start somewhere. \u201cI\u2019ve told you about my nightmares. Tell me yours. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>She needed to help him. Couldn\u2019t he see that?</p><p>His head lifted. He stared straight into the darkness. She didn\u2019t think he was going to speak at all, but then he finally said, \u201cIt was right after I left the military. I\u2019d gone...independent with some friends. One of my teammates\u2014the person wasn\u2019t who we all thought. A traitor. Leading us straight to hell. I had one chance to stop things. Kill or be killed.\u201d His voice was wooden.</p><p>\u201cYou killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turned out I was good at killing. Maybe too good.\u201d</p><p>She rose onto her knees and wrapped her arms around him, pulling his back against her breasts.</p><p>Trace\u2019s attention seemed to shift as he stared down at his hands. He\u2019d taken off the bandages she\u2019d applied so carefully before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d killed before, but that was in the line of duty. When I was following orders. This time, it was different. It was my friend. And I let my emotions get in the way.\u201d He drew in a ragged breath. \u201cI have a lot of memories that won\u2019t let go of me. I went Black Ops six months after my enlistment. I did things...\u201d His muscles were rock hard against her. \u201cI wish I could forget them.\u201d</p><p>Because the memories haunted him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry this alone.\u201d She pressed a kiss to his neck, just below his ear. \u201cI\u2019m here, Trace. I want to help you.\u201d She wanted in.</p><p>\u201cYou helped me back then.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but knew he couldn\u2019t see her face.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I hunted, every time I killed, every time I thought I\u2019d never taste anything but blood and death and the sand that got between my teeth or the snow that froze my bones...I\u2019d see you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms tightened around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d imagine you dancing, up on stage, with all the lights around you. I\u2019d see you, and the hell around me would vanish for a few seconds. You were my dream, when I was in a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Her lips feathered over his throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have nightmares about that time...at least, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said, sounding angry now. \u201cNot in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then Ben Sharpe came back.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBen worked with me in Black Ops. I saved his ass a few times\u2014that tends to make a man loyal.\u201d</p><p>But demons had started to chase Ben, even then.</p><p>\u201cAfter I got out of the military, I brought Ben onto the independent team with me because I wanted to help him. He\u2019d come to me, desperate, but working with me just made things worse.\u201d</p><p>Because of the traitor?</p><p>\u201cBen brought them back,\u201d Trace said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll forget them again. I\u2019ll shove the memories into the back of my head and lock the damn vault shut on them.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t looked at her while he\u2019d spoken. Maybe it was easier for him not to see her when he saw the past.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what? Scaring you? That\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor giving me the first secret.\u201d A glimpse into his hell.</p><p>He turned then, caught her, and rolled so that Skye was beneath him in bed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told her, voice gruff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you, I would\u2019ve been as lost as Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him back with all of her passion, all of her love. She wanted to show Trace that she was with him, through good and bad, and everything in the middle.</p><p>His tongue slid over her lips. His hands trailed over her body. He knew where to touch her. Where to stroke and caress so that she arched eagerly toward him. Wanting all that he had to give her.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t thrust into her.</p><p>Not even when she begged.</p><p>Instead, he put his mouth between her legs. He licked her. He tasted her. He drove her into a frenzy.</p> <p>She came against his mouth. With her hands in the thickness of his hair. With her hips arching toward him.</p><p>Skye came that way, and she wanted more.</p><p>But Trace was the one in control. That fierce control that she wanted to smash into a million pieces.</p><p>He brought her to the brink of another release. Tears leaked down her cheeks. She cried out for him. Wanted more. \u201cTrace, now, I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from her. Stood. His erect cock thrust out toward her, and Skye wanted it buried in her core.</p><p>She reached for him.</p> <p>He backed away.</p><p>\u201cT-Trace?\u201d</p><p>His eyes squeezed closed. \u201cHave you ever wanted something so much...so badly...but you were afraid you\u2019d destroy that one thing if you actually took it?\u201d</p><p>Her thighs quivered. Soft contractions still pulsed in her sex. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me.\u201d</p><p>His smile came then. Sad and cruel. \u201cOh, baby, you shouldn\u2019t be so sure. Tonight, I\u2019m weak, and you don\u2019t want me without my control.\u201d</p><p>This was the moment that mattered.</p><p>Skye slid from the bed. Her knees sank onto the lush carpet. \u201cI want you every way.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t he understand that?</p><p>She opened her mouth and tasted him. It was her turn to lick, to stroke, to enjoy the hot and hard length of his cock in\u2014</p> <p>He jerked her up. Spun her around. Pushed her onto the bed and lifted up her hips. Her stomach hit the mattress even as her hands fisted in the sheets. She heaved up and tried to glance over her shoulder at him.</p><p>Trace sank into her. A deep, hard thrust. There was no holding back then, he drove into her in a plunge that took her breath.</p><p>His hands were tight bands around her hips. He withdrew, thrust. Again and again. Each thrust was harder than the last.</p><p>She tried to arch back against him, but he was moving too fast, too fiercely.</p><p>The rhythm was wild and rough. Not like the controlled lovemaking that he\u2019d shown her in the last few weeks. He was plunging so deeply\u2014rubbing inside of her. She was slick and swollen from her release.</p><p>\u201cGive to me,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cWant...everything...\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.</p><p>\u201cMine...\u201d His left hand freed her hip. Slid around her body. Closed around her breast. Stroked the nipple. Palmed her breast. \u201cEvery inch.\u201d</p><p>In and out...in and out...</p><p>His right hand moved then. Went around her hip and his fingers found her clit. He wasn\u2019t gentle. Rough, demanding\u2014</p><p>And she exploded, bucking against him as the release slammed into her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was on her shoulder. She felt the faint sting of his teeth.</p><p>And the hot surge of his release as he came inside of her.</p><p>He was around her, surrounding her, and she couldn\u2019t stop the waves of pleasure. They came and came. Hollowing her out and leaving Skye limp.</p><p>She sagged beneath him.</p><p>Trace without his control...</p><p>\u201cI warned you.\u201d His voice was different. Stilted.</p><p>She found the strength to turn her head a few inches and look back at him. His face appeared leaner, harder.</p><p>\u201cNext time...\u201d Skye heard herself say, \u201cfuck me harder.\u201d</p><p>His body tensed. \u201cSkye.\u201d And he started to fuck her again.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t treating her like a delicate doll or like a victim\u2014and she wanted every single thing he had to give her.</p><p>A moan slipped from her.</p><p>Fuck me harder.</p><p>She was lost.</p><p>Trace stared down at Skye while she slept. The covers pooled around her, and Skye\u2019s hand was out, reaching toward his pillow.</p><p>As if she were reaching for him in her sleep.</p><p>After last night, she still wants me?</p><p>Talk about a miracle.</p><p>He\u2019d given her a taste of the darkness that lived inside of him last night. She hadn\u2019t been afraid. Despite everything, Skye hadn\u2019t hesitated.</p><p>She\u2019d given him pleasure. Demanded her own.</p><p>Fuck me harder.</p><p>His cock twitched just thinking about those words.</p><p>Was it any wonder that other women had left him cold? They\u2019d never been enough for him, because they weren\u2019t Skye.</p><p>His fingers lifted and brushed lightly over her cheek. He wanted to let her sleep, but if he did, Trace knew Skye would be pissed.</p><p>She wanted to go to her studio. She wanted to start seeing her students.</p><p>And he wanted her happy.</p><p>He bent and brushed his lips over hers. \u201cWake up, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blinked open. For an instant, she seemed lost, then Skye focused her gaze on him. A soft smile curved her lips.</p><p>She was the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And he had to leave her.</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cI have to go in to the office today. Reese will to take you to the studio.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cMore guard duty? But I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me, just a little longer.\u201d Until he could get a better grasp on just what was happening in this town. Sharpe had spoken of a ghost and of the dead coming back. Trace had tried to tell him that the past was dead and buried but...</p><p>Was that past coming back?</p><p>She\u2019ll destroy you.</p><p>The hell she would.</p><p>\u201cTonight...\u201d His fingers brushed down her arm. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to attend a charity auction and ball. It\u2019s something I agreed to attend months ago.\u201d Before Skye had walked back into his life. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ditch because the money\u2019s going to the Children\u2019s Home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to attend,\u201d Skye said immediately.</p><p>He nodded. They\u2019d both been through the foster system. Cast out. They knew what it was like to need a stable home.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go with me?\u201d And, yes, he was actually holding his breath as he waited for Skye\u2019s reply. But he knew that she hadn\u2019t been to a big public event, not since before her car crash in New York. There would be plenty of reporters waiting outside of the hotel because so many of the city\u2019s elite would be attending, and Skye might not want to walk right into that feeding frenzy but\u2014</p><p>\u201cOf course, Trace, you know I\u2019d go anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>His heart ached at her words.</p><p>She pushed up, leaning toward him. \u201cI\u2019ll always go where\u2014\u201d</p><p>Skye broke off when he caught her arms. Carefully, very carefully, he lowered her back onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cTrace? What is it?\u201d</p><p>He pushed the covers out of the way.</p><p>And hated himself.</p><p>He could see his fingerprints\u2014dark smudges, brown bruises, on her waist. He\u2019d held her hips so tightly last night that he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>He\u2019d always known that he had to take care with Skye. She was too delicate. Too breakable for him. \u201cI hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze followed his. She stared at the bruises on her flesh. Markings. My mark.</p><p>The ache in his chest grew worse. He\u2019d never wanted to do this. Never\u2014</p><p>Skye laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Obviously, you didn\u2019t see the claw marks I left on your back.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up at her words.</p><p>A smile lit her face. Made her eyes shine. She was more than just beautiful.</p><p>She was every hope and dream that he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>She squirmed against him, and he let her. Skye immediately wrapped her arms around him and brought her mouth close to his. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice, what with all the moaning and panting I was doing last night, I like things a little rough with you. I like it when you lose control.\u201d</p><p>She just didn\u2019t seem to realize that when he lost control, dangerous things happened.</p><p>\u201cA few bruises aren\u2019t going to kill me,\u201d Skye told him, voice soft. \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel you holding me that tightly last night. I was focused on, you know, other things.\u201d She licked his lower lip. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be focused on those other things again soon.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she would be.</p><p>He kissed her. Not hard and wild. But deep. Using every bit of sensual skill that he had.</p><p>Did Skye want him as much as he wanted her? Did she crave him?</p><p>More than breath?</p><p>\u201cWear the diamonds tonight,\u201d he said against her mouth. \u201cAnd if you need to buy a dress, use my card\u2014our card\u2014and get anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have what I want.\u201d Her eyelashes lifted to reveal the gorgeous green of her eyes. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p>He should back away. And, slowly, Trace made himself do just that. It just took a huge effort.</p><p>But her words echoed in his ears. I have what I want.</p><p>He had exactly what he wanted, too. And no one would ever take her from him again.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t buy a dress. She still had a few dresses left from her New York days.</p><p>Skye went with a black dress. You can\u2019t go wrong with black, right? The dress was a form fitting bit of silk that clung to her like a second skin. The front collar scooped around her breasts and the back\u2014well, there wasn\u2019t a back. It plunged to the base of her spine, then the skirt fell, swirling around her feet.</p><p>She\u2019d worn the dress once before, to a post-dance party after she performed as a particularly wicked witch. She\u2019d thought the dress fit her character.</p><p>Daring. Dark.</p><p>Skye stared at her reflection in the mirror as she secured the diamonds. They were still cold against her skin.</p><p>Cold and glittering.</p><p>A fortune.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to wear them.</p><p>But she did, for Trace.</p><p>The floor squeaked behind her. She turned at once, and her gaze caught his.</p><p>He was dressed in a black tux. One that made his shoulders look even wider. One that she knew had been cut just for him.</p><p>She stared at him and thought of sex. Temptation.</p><p>Because he looked good enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you...\u201d Trace asked as his gaze glided over her. \u201cThat you\u2019re the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d</p><p>He was lying. She knew she wasn\u2019t the most beautiful. She\u2019d followed his exploits over the years. The man had kept company with supermodels. She was too thin, her breasts were too small. Her chin too pointed. She was\u2014</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSkye, what have I told you about leaving me?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>He was right in front of her. The guy sure moved fast.</p><p>\u201cBe with me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Inches away.</p><p>\u201cAnd believe me when I tell you...to me, you are the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Her breath slid out in a soft sigh. She believed him.</p><p>Skye smiled up at him. Fear had been trying to take root inside of her, but it vanished, drifting right away.</p><p>Trace reached for her hand. He lifted it up, and the diamond on her finger gleamed in the light. \u201cEveryone will know you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been yours since I was fifteen.\u201d The truth was there between them. They had no room for pretense. \u201cI just had to wait for us to be together again.\u201d</p><p>She saw the flare of longing in his eyes. \u201cYou make me want to tell the rest of the world to screw off.\u201d He kissed her knuckles. Lightly licked the skin.</p><p>A hot spike of arousal fired her blood. \u201cWe have to go, but we don\u2019t have to stay there forever,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>He smiled. Such a gorgeous, sexy smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been yours, too,\u201d he told her, voice rumbling. \u201cSince the moment I first heard you call for me. You got to me, when no one else could.\u201d Then he eased back. His gaze swept her once more. \u201cEvery man in the room will want you.\u201d</p><p>She doubted that. \u201cYou\u2019re the only man I\u2019ll leave with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said.</p><p>Skye nodded.</p><p>Always.</p><p>A sea of reporters greeted them the instant the limo\u2019s doors opened. Reese hadn\u2019t driven them, not to this event. A posh limo escorted Skye and Trace toward Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile and deposited them right at the red carpet that led to the entrance of the illustrious Bartley Hotel, an icon that had been in the city since the early 1930s.</p><p>Trace exited first. She heard the reporters shout his name.</p><p>He ignored them and turned back toward her. Bending, he offered Skye his hand.</p><p>She put one high-heeled foot out. Then the other.</p><p>When she rose, there was a moment of silence. Perfect, complete silence.</p><p>Then the questions exploded.</p><p>\u201cSkye! Skye Sullivan! Can you confirm the rumors that you and Trace Weston are planning to marry?\u201d</p><p>She thought her ring confirmed that rumor.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sullivan! Is it true that you\u2019ve been offered a spot as lead in Robert Wolfe\u2019s next ballet?\u201d</p><p>That question made her falter. Robert had been her choreographer for years when she danced in New York. When it came to the top echelon of the New York ballet, Robert was the man in charge.</p><p>Skye found herself shaking her head. There was no return for her. Robert certainly hadn\u2019t come to ask\u2014</p><p>\u201cIs it true that you were in a mental facility for the last three weeks because you had a breakdown?\u201d</p><p>Skye stiffened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Trace growled in her ear. \u201cIgnore them. Put on your killer smile and lift your head up, baby. Walk like they don\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t. You matter. Only you.\u201d</p><p>He was wrong.</p><p>Skye turned to the reporter. A curvy blonde with hard eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break down,\u201d Skye told her simply. \u201cI survived.\u201d</p><p>And she walked away. With her head up. With a false smile on her lips. She took the steps past the swarm of reporters, and then she and Trace were heading into the Bartley.</p><p>Guards were stationed at the doors, and they made absolutely sure that the reporters didn\u2019t follow Skye and Trace inside.</p><p>Her heels tapped on the gleaming marble floor. From overhead, glittering chandeliers poured light down on her.</p><p>The other ball attendees headed forward, moving and laughing easily. They\u2019d enjoyed their time in the limelight. Skye hadn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t care about photo opportunities or getting her name in the papers. If she had her way, she\u2019d prefer to never see another paper or magazine with her face splashed on the cover.</p> <p>Breakdown. Thanks, bitch.</p><p>Trace wrapped his hand around Skye\u2019s waist. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Glanced up at him.</p><p>\u201cFor a minute there, I was sure you were going to tell the blonde to fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. The laughter escaped her, before she could even think to stop it. A light, quick bubble of sound.</p><p>Trace\u2019s face froze. \u201cThere it is,\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>And he kissed her. A deep, sensual kiss that made her knees jiggle.</p><p>\u201cWell, well...I guess this is how the mighty fall.\u201d</p><p>Skye pulled away from Trace with a little gasp, but he didn\u2019t let her go far. He kept a hold on her wrist as they both turned to face the man who\u2019d closed in on them.</p><p>Tall, muscled, with wide shoulders that stretched the perfectly tailored tux he wore, the man stood just a few feet away. His hair was dark, nearly the same shade as Trace\u2019s, and his eyes were a burning, deep gold.</p><p>Those eyes were on Skye, assessing her with a fierce intensity. \u201cThe reporters could see the kiss, you know,\u201d the man murmured. There was a faint accent in his voice. Texas? \u201cBut maybe that was the point, right, Trace?\u201d And his gaze trekked to Trace. \u201cTo stake the claim in front of them all. In case any of the blind fools missed the giant rock on her finger.\u201d</p><p>She expected Trace to fire an angry retort, instead, he laughed.</p><p>Laughed.</p><p>Skye glanced over at him in surprise.</p> <p>\u201cNoah,\u201d Trace murmured, \u201cI\u2019d heard you made a new acquisition in town.\u201d His eyebrows rose as he took in the hotel. \u201cNice. You\u2019ve done well for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs have you.\u201d That golden stare was back on Skye. Still too intense. \u201cVery well,\u201d the man added as his voice deepened.</p><p>Trace wrapped his arm around Skye. \u201cYou said yourself, I\u2019ve already staked a claim.\u201d</p><p>Skye licked her lips\u2014and tasted Trace.</p><p>\u201cSkye Sullivan, I want you to meet Noah York. Noah is...an old friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>The name clicked for Skye. York Towers. The guy had hotels all over the United States. Those Towers were usually in the biggest cities, but they were also found in some secluded, high-end getaway locations. Near pristine beaches. Cradled amid mountaintops.</p><p>Noah reached for her hand. He bent his head. \u201cIt\u2019s great to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>Finally?</p><p>He released her and eased back. \u201cI figured nothing would keep you away from this event, Trace.\u201d His shoulders straightened. \u201cNot when we both know what it\u2019s like to be those kids.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze sharpened on Noah.</p><p>Then someone called his name. Noah sighed. \u201cBusiness.\u201d He pointed at Trace and Skye. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be seeing you both later.\u201d Another nod, and then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cWe should go inside. The auction will be starting soon,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>She started walking automatically, but her fingers reached out to touch his arm. \u201cTrace, what did he mean when he said it was finally good to meet me?\u201d</p><p>His stride never faltered. \u201cNoah and I go way back. Surely you realize that I\u2019ve talked about you before?\u201d He gave her a fast glance. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d</p><p>His words were easy. The explanation was simple, but a knot had formed in Skye\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s go bid a ton of money, baby. We\u2019re supposed to have fun tonight.\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, they were.</p><p>They slipped into the ballroom. A stage had been set up for the auction. Business first, then Skye knew that the band would begin playing for the dancers.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a night about fear.</p><p>This was about the future.</p><p>Starting fresh. Giving the children a future.</p><p>Once, Skye had been a lost teen. So scared. Alone. From beneath her lashes, she watched Trace. Then she\u2019d found him, and everything had changed for her.</p><p>Noah had almost fucked up.</p><p>Trace kept his arms around Skye, moving fluidly with her as they danced across the ballroom. Her face was lit up, her eyes shining.</p><p>Skye loved dancing.</p><p>And she loves me.</p><p>Noah would have to be careful. Trace planned to catch the man alone at the earliest opportunity. Noah would understand\u2014as many couldn\u2019t\u2014just how important some secrets were.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized that Noah was already back in town. If he had, Trace would\u2019ve talked with him sooner.</p><p>It was just a little slip. Skye believed what I told her.</p><p>Lying to Skye wasn\u2019t something that Trace enjoyed doing. She had so much faith in him. The lies he told her ate at his soul.</p><p>But he wanted her protected.</p><p>I have to make sure she doesn\u2019t find out.</p><p>The music ended. Because he knew that she liked it, Trace dipped Skye. Her cheeks flushed. More of that sweet, wonderful laughter slipped from her.</p><p>He eased her back to her feet, keeping a light grip on her. He hadn\u2019t noticed any weakness in her injured leg, but, when it came to Skye, Trace didn\u2019t want to take any chances.</p><p>The band announced that they\u2019d be taking a short break.</p><p>Trace glanced over and saw Melanie Petrie, the organizer of the charity event, as she talked quietly with two of her staff members. \u201cCan you excuse me for just a moment?\u201d Trace asked Skye. \u201cI need to speak with Melanie.\u201d Because he wanted to make a substantial donation, one that would be in Skye\u2019s name. He\u2019d tell her later, when they were alone.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to be alone with her again.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She gave him an easy smile. \u201cI wanted to step out on the balcony anyway. I\u2019ve heard the fountains in the courtyard are quite incredible.\u201d</p><p>They were. Trace also knew that they were well guarded. The event had a ton of security in place. And I have my own men here, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you there,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>Trace watched her walk away. He couldn\u2019t take his gaze off her back. All of that beautiful, silken skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one lucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head at Noah\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cIs there a particular reason you were giving me a go-to-hell look earlier?\u201d Noah asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than the fact that your eyes were looking at Skye far too damn much?\u201d Trace turned toward him. His back teeth had clenched, and Trace had to force his jaw to relax. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about my past. I want it to stay that way.\u201d</p><p>Noah whistled. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying her, and she doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many women know about your past, Noah?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brows climbed.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I want is for her to fear me,\u201d Trace said. \u201cEspecially after everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I...I read the stories. Was it as bad as they said?\u201d</p><p>For an instant, Trace remembered the basement. The darkness. The fear that had eaten at him.</p><p>She\u2019d looked so beaten. Skye hadn\u2019t even believed that he was really there, not at first. She\u2019d thought that she was seeing a ghost. He\u2019d had to convince her...</p><p>I found you. You\u2019re going home with me. You\u2019re going to dance, and we\u2019re going to fuck and laugh and be happy. Do you understand?</p><p>Trace cleared his throat. \u201cIt was even worse.\u201d</p><p>Noah swore.</p><p>\u201cSkye doesn\u2019t need any more fear,\u201d Trace told him, needing Noah to get the message.</p><p>His old friend nodded.</p><p>Noah started to walk away. Trace moved, blocking his path. \u201cI want you to come to my office tomorrow. We have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen Sharpe was murdered.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s lips parted in surprise. \u201cThe hell he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died right after he came to visit me, telling me that the past was coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe past is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I said, too. Then Sharpe wound up butchered in an alley.\u201d</p><p>Noah backed up a step. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, man.\u201d</p><p>Good. Because Noah had been in on the mission that went to hell. A mission that cost a teammate his life.</p><p>And taught them all the truth about just how deadly an innocent face could be.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The fountains were amazing. The water flew into the air, twisting and turning in a rhythm that perfectly matched the soft tunes that drifted from the outdoor speakers.</p><p>Lighting effects drifted over the water. Soft pink, light blue.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>She turned and found a waiter at her elbow. The balcony was well lit, gleaming with candles. The waiter offered his tray of champagne. She took a glass, nodding her thanks.</p><p>Skye lifted the glass to her lips.</p><p>Then she stopped. Because she\u2019d just caught sight of a man standing below. He had a hood over his head, and he was partially hidden by the shadows.</p><p>Her heartbeat kicked up. Her left hand pushed against the hard marble column of the balcony as she leaned forward, trying to get a better glimpse of the figure.</p><p>The glass tipped in her right hand and began to fall.</p><p>Long, masculine fingers caught the glass, and only a few drops of champagne dripped to the ground.</p><p>Skye looked into Noah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014\u201d Skye shook her head, unnerved by the intensity that seemed to cloak him. Trace carried that same, dark intensity, but she didn\u2019t fear the danger that clung to him.</p><p>Noah York was another matter.</p><p>\u201cI saw someone,\u201d Skye finally said, pointing over the balcony. \u201cDown there, in the shadows.\u201d</p><p>Noah followed her stare. \u201cWhat was this person doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a man. I-I think. He was...staring up. Looking toward me.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She squinted as she stared out at the fountains, but Skye couldn\u2019t see any sign of the watcher now. \u201cHe was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said he wasn\u2019t.\u201d Noah put the champagne on the balcony and pulled out a phone. With his eyes on her, he said, \u201cDale, Jonah, do a perimeter sweep near the south-side fountains. Make sure that no uninvited guests slipped past security.\u201d He pushed the phone back into the inner pocket of his tux. \u201cSome reporters can be very determined.\u201d</p><p>Reporters. Right. Her breath panted out too quickly. It had just been a reporter out there, waiting for a scoop. She had to stop looking at the shadows and seeing danger.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Skye murmured, embarrassed now. \u201cI\u2019d better get back inside and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace won\u2019t be much longer.\u201d Noah leaned back against the broad column and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a few minutes to talk?\u201d</p><p>Once more, she glanced back down toward the fountains. Now she saw two men\u2014both wearing suits\u2014heading toward the shadows.</p><p>\u201cThose are two of my men,\u201d Noah said, not sounding particularly concerned. \u201cIf anyone else is down there, I\u2019ll know shortly.\u201d</p><p>There was just something about him that reminded her so much of Trace. Guessing, she said, \u201cThe two of you served together, in the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did a stint in the military, yes.\u201d</p><p>That was a vague answer.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she studied him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for what you had to endure, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed to ease her suddenly dry throat. \u201cPlenty of people endure worse all the time. I\u2019m just lucky I survived.\u201d</p><p>Silence, then, \u201cI don\u2019t think luck had much to do with it, but I agree, you are a survivor.\u201d</p><p>The candle light fell on his face, half revealing, half concealing. \u201cHow much do you know about me?\u201d Skye asked him.</p><p>\u201cI know that we share a similar past. You, Trace, and I\u2014life wasn\u2019t always easy for us when we were younger, but we didn\u2019t let our pasts stop us. A past should never get in the way of your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you and Trace, I never knew them. Not my real parents, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him.</p><p>He laughed softly, but the sound held no humor. \u201cThis is the point where most women would say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or \u2018Their loss.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Skye rolled her shoulders. \u201cBut like you said, we share a similar past.\u201d</p><p>His head inclined. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know if I deserve sympathy or envy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an unusual man, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Skye Sullivan, are not at all what I expected.\u201d He paused. \u201cI wish that I\u2019d had the pleasure of seeing you dance on stage. According to Trace, you\u2019re quite phenomenal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was,\u201d Skye said. \u201cOnce upon a time...\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cBut life is about change, isn\u2019t it? Moving forward.\u201d Always, forward.</p><p>He stepped away from the column. Stalked closer to her. \u201cDo you love Trace?\u201d Noah asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to not love him.</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, he\u2019s one lucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the ballroom then, as a shiver of awareness slid down her spine. The band had started to play again\u2014and Trace stood inside the open doorway.</p><p>How long had he been there? Listening? Watching?</p><p>She slipped around Noah and went to Trace\u2019s side. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready to leave.\u201d Seeing the reporter had rattled her, and she\u2019d overdone at her studio earlier that day. Her legs were aching.</p><p>No, admit it\u2014you just want to escape.</p> <p>There were too many people in the ballroom. Too many eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Trace told her. His arm wrapped around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure to meet you, Skye,\u201d Noah called out to her.</p><p>She glanced back. \u201cAnd it was very interesting to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. This time, there seemed to be real humor in that laughter.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon, Trace,\u201d Noah said. \u201cVery soon.\u201d</p> <p>They moved easily through the cluster of people in the ballroom. The dress that had felt so beautiful against Skye\u2019s skin suddenly seemed too revealing.</p><p>She looked to the left and found gazes on her.</p><p>To the right\u2014she saw two women whispering and glancing her way.</p><p>Too exposed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want all of the attention. She\u2019d thought she could hold it together but\u2014</p><p>Trace stopped. Right there, in the middle of the ballroom. He turned and pulled her into his arms. He stared down at her. \u201cYou are the most beautiful woman here. If eyes are on you, it\u2019s because no one can look away. If people are talking, then it\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand how an asshole like me got lucky enough to be with someone as perfect as you.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything to fear. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p> <p>Skye nodded. She had to stop jumping at shadows. Straightening her spine, she met his stare directly. \u201cWe\u2019re both safe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>They walked slowly from the ballroom. She kept her shoulders squared all the way. Kept her chin up. When they exited the hotel and the cameras flashed once again, she didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>Skye just smiled.</p><p>Then she was in the back of the limo. They were cruising away from the hotel. Trace\u2019s arms were around her.</p><p>The fear leaked away.</p><p>Noah York watched the limo pull away.</p><p>Trace Weston...the man was in deep.</p><p>And they were all in danger.</p><p>He pulled out his phone. Dialed a number that he should have forgotten years ago. Even at the late hour, his call was answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Noah said. A deadly one. \u201cAnd we need to act.\u201d</p><p>Trace brushed back Skye\u2019s hair. Her head was on his shoulder, and his arm was around her, holding her. Holding her was the most natural thing in the world for him.</p><p>She fit against his body. In bed. Out.</p><p>When he wasn\u2019t with her, he felt empty. Hell, he\u2019d been lost all of those years that they\u2019d been apart.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t planning to ever be lost again.</p><p>\u201cThe two of you were together during your time in the military.\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t let his body stiffen when he heard her soft words. \u201cIs that what Noah told you?\u201d He\u2019d asked the man to stay quiet.</p><p>Trace hadn\u2019t worried when Skye had gone out on the balcony. He\u2019d had a guard watching her. Actually, he had a guard always watching her...just as a precaution.</p><p>But when he\u2019d seen Noah head toward her, he hadn\u2019t been able to get back to her soon enough.</p><p>Then he\u2019d heard Noah ask Skye if she loved him.</p><p>\u201cThe two of you...you sort of remind me of each other,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>That response surprised him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019ve both spent too much time staring into the darkness.\u201d Her left hand entwined with his.</p><p>The limo slowed. Trace figured they must be at a red light because they hadn\u2019t traveled far enough to be close to his penthouse, not yet. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at the dark any longer,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her head turned. A soft light came from the back of the limo, giving him a perfect view of her face.</p><p>She started to smile.</p><p>The limo accelerated.</p><p>Trace bent his head toward hers.</p><p>The impact caught him off-guard. Metal screamed, glass shattered, and Trace felt his body flying forward. He grabbed for Skye, holding her as tightly as he could as the limo shuddered\u2014and seemed to rip apart.</p><p>They hit the floor, and he did his best to shield her, but Trace still heard Skye cry out. Glass cut into him as the right side of the vehicle surged toward him.</p><p>Not Skye. Not Skye...</p><p>The scream of metal seemed to go on and on and\u2014</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d Soft hands feathered over his face. \u201cTrace, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He heaved his body up. Glass rained off his back. Something wet dripped into his eye. Blood.</p><p>Rage built within him, but he kept a chain on the beast. He knew better than to let his fury out, especially with Skye so close. His hands slid over her, checking for injuries, making absolutely sure that she was safe and whole.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d Her voice held definite bite now as she grabbed his hands. \u201cStop it and tell me\u2014are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Nothing that a few stitches wouldn\u2019t cure. \u201cYes, baby, I am.\u201d And so was she. He had to remember that.</p><p>\u201cMr. Weston!\u201d The frantic shout reached him. \u201cMr. Weston! I\u2019m coming to get you out!\u201d</p><p>Trace lifted his head. He glanced over and saw that the right side of the vehicle was a tangled mess. The door was twisted. The windows shattered.</p><p>But a groan of sound heralded the opening of the door on the left-hand side of the vehicle.</p><p>The driver\u2014a young guy named Matt Norris\u2014peered in and, with a shaking voice, he asked, \u201cPlease, sir, please, tell me you\u2019re okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d It was Skye who responded.</p><p>Trace helped her to slide out, and he followed right behind her. As soon as they were clear of the wreckage, he grabbed Matt. His fingers fisted on the man\u2019s jacket. \u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s not my fault! I-I waited for the light to change, but the other car came out of n-nowhere!\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s head turned to study the scene. They were in the middle of an intersection. It was close to midnight, and the dark road was eerily silent. Glass littered the ground. Chunks of metal from the crash were scattered across the street.</p><p>A blue BMW had smashed right into the side of the limo. The driver\u2019s side door hung open, swaying slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the driver?\u201d Skye asked.</p><p>\u201cH-he ran off,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI called out for him to stop, but he kept going.\u201d</p><p>A siren echoed in the distance. Trace shoved Matt away from him.</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve been drunk,\u201d Matt told them. \u201cHe ran cause...cause he knew the cops would realize it, right? They\u2019d be able to tell that he\u2019d been drinking.\u201d</p><p>Fury tightened Trace\u2019s body.</p><p>Another car braked near the scene. A man poked his head out. \u201cDear God, is everyone all right?\u201d</p><p>Trace stared at the wreckage. A hit and run. A drunk driver?</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d Skye\u2019s hand wrapped around his shoulder. \u201cYou lied to me.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cSkye, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wiped the blood from his face. \u201cYou are hurt. You need stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been worse,\u201d he told her, and the words were true. So terrifyingly true. Because what if she\u2019d been hurt?</p><p>The siren was coming closer. Someone, somewhere had called for help. Maybe one of the folks in the apartments down the road. Lights gleamed from those buildings.</p><p>Or maybe the call had even come from the SOB who\u2019d hit them and fled.</p><p>His gaze tracked around the scene. Lifted. He stared at the red lights.</p><p>And at the cameras mounted near them.</p><p>A grim smile curved Trace\u2019s lips.</p><p>I\u2019ll find you, asshole.</p><p>Because no one hurt him and just walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d Noah demanded as he stepped into Trace\u2019s office. Then his lips twisted. \u201cWait, let me guess, a fight with the little ballerina?\u201d</p><p>Trace glared at him. He\u2019d gotten the stitches only because Skye insisted. The cut was high on his forehead, deep and, yeah, he knew it would scar. He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders, trying to push away the tension he felt, and said, \u201cOn the way home last night, some asshole drove right into the side of my limo.\u201d</p><p>That wiped the grin right off Noah\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding.\u201d</p><p>When had he ever?</p><p>Trace motioned to the empty chair near his desk. \u201cHe left the scene, ran away on foot.\u201d But the guy wasn\u2019t escaping. Trace had already pulled some strings, and he\u2019d be getting that video footage from the crash scene any minute. He\u2019d see the man who\u2019d walked\u2014ran\u2014away.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s related to Sharpe\u2019s death?\u201d Now Noah\u2019s voice was cautious.</p><p>Exhaling slowly, Trace decided to put all of his cards on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell to think of Sharpe\u2019s case. I got the autopsy report.\u201d He nodded toward the manila file that sat on the corner of his desk. Getting a copy of that report had been easy enough. Just a matter of pulling more strings. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a robbery. Sharpe was homeless. He had nothing to take.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabbed the file. His fingers flipped through the pages. \u201cA knife thrust straight to the heart...and a slice right across his jugular.\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded. \u201cThere were no signs that Sharpe even had the chance to fight back.\u201d That worried him. \u201cSharpe was crazy, but he was a fighter. He wouldn\u2019t just stand there and let some SOB kill him.\u201d And, shit, he\u2019d been the one to send Ben away from the penthouse\u2014without weapons. Yet even without his knives, Ben knew a dozen ways to defend against an attack. Provided, of course, that he\u2019d had the chance to use his skills.</p><p>Noah glanced up. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the time to fight, that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get the drop on someone like that,\u201d Trace pointed out. \u201cYou could get close enough to kill without making a sound. By the time the victim realized it, the knife would be in his heart.\u201d Because it was true. Noah might pretend to be the elegant businessman, but that fa\u00e7ade was a lie.</p><p>It was the same lie that Trace presented to the world.</p><p>\u201cAnd so could you,\u201d Noah retorted, voice hardening. \u201cWe had the same training. Same missions.\u201d</p><p>Trace tapped his fingers on the desk. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cNeither did I. So we just need to figure out who the hell did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharpe said the past was coming back.\u201d This was the part that Trace needed to reveal. \u201cThat Skye was going to be my destruction.\u201d</p><p>Now Noah\u2019s face showed his concern. \u201cA woman nearly destroyed us before.\u201d</p><p>An innocent face...to hide deadly intentions. \u201cThey both died.\u201d</p><p>They...</p><p>The woman who\u2019d tried to betray his team. And her lover.</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell seemed like they did,\u201d Noah agreed as he tossed the folder aside.</p><p>\u201cThen why was Sharpe so afraid?\u201d</p><p>Noah held his gaze. His lips tightened, then he said, \u201cThere\u2019s something I should tell you.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be good. The man\u2019s tone told him that.</p><p>\u201cLast night, right after you left, I called Drake.\u201d</p><p>Trace tensed.</p><p>\u201cIf the past is coming back, he needs to know, too,\u201d Noah snapped. \u201cLook, the threat isn\u2019t just to you. If someone is striking at us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Drake in the city?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded.</p><p>Great. Drake Archer wasn\u2019t exactly a safe fellow to have around.</p><p>And Drake and Trace hadn\u2019t ended their partnership on the best of terms. Mostly because Drake had been spiraling, and Trace hadn\u2019t been able to help him.</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t want help. He wanted to implode.</p><p>A knock sounded at Trace\u2019s door. He glanced over, frowning. \u201cCome in...\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and his assistant, Sara, poked her head inside. \u201cThe video footage should appear in your Inbox within the next five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Good. Grim satisfaction filled him. He might not have a handle on Sharpe\u2019s killer, not yet, but he would be taking down this asshole.</p><p>\u201cSo just how much longer are you going to be playing guard duty?\u201d Skye asked Reese as she slanted a glance at him.</p><p>Reese gave her a smile. \u201cLast night\u2019s crash put the boss on edge.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like she\u2019d missed the frantic intensity that filled Trace.</p><p>But she was tired of being in his cage.</p><p>This morning, she\u2019d started to feel as if she were suffocating.</p><p>\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cDespite what Trace wants, he can\u2019t protect me from everything. The world is too unpredictable for that.\u201d</p><p>Reese reached for his coffee. Two PM, and she knew that he was hitting his fourth cup of the day. \u201cYou know Trace. Control matters to him.\u201d</p><p>It mattered to her, too. And she was done with the cage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The nightmares had come back last night. She\u2019d been trapped in that basement once more, and Skye had woken up gasping. Even the walls of the penthouse had seemed to close in on her.</p><p>She needed freedom.</p><p>Not a constant guard, even if that guard was her friend.</p> <p>\u201cMy classes start tomorrow,\u201d she said. Excitement slipped through the words. She had full classes\u2014every single one. Sure, some of those students might just be coming because they were curious about the prima ballerina who\u2019d been splashed across all the papers.</p><p>But they\u2019d see the truth soon enough. The classes weren\u2019t about sensationalism. Skye meant business. The studio was about the dance. About what she could teach her students.</p><p>And I\u2019ll teach them plenty.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes on Reese. \u201cI don\u2019t want my students nervous, so the bodyguard bit is ending.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted.</p> <p>\u201cNot that I don\u2019t love you, but I think your time can be better spent on activities that are a little more...dangerous.\u201d She used the word deliberately because Reese did enjoy his danger. \u201cNow I\u2019m going outside\u2014alone\u2014to get a few minutes of fresh air.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d taken four steps when Reese called out, \u201cI love you, too, Skye...and that\u2019s why I\u2019m playing guard duty. The last thing I want is for you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>A lump rose in her throat, but she kept going. Reese had gotten underneath her skin. In the weeks that she\u2019d known him, he\u2019d become her friend. She didn\u2019t have a lot of friends.</p><p>He and Trace made her feel less alone in the world.</p><p>She grabbed her bag and then headed onto the sidewalk in front of her building. The air was warm, but not hot. Summer would be there soon enough.</p><p>Skye stared up at the sky. Blue, bright blue, like Trace\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>A car horn honked in the distance. It was lunch time, so, of course, the street was busy.</p><p>Tomorrow, she\u2019d open her dance studio. Her students would come.</p><p>Her gaze drifted around the street.</p><p>Tomorrow...</p><p>A man with a hood covering his head stood across the street. Half-hidden by the shadows as he stood under the awning of another office.</p><p>He lifted an object.</p><p>Snapped a picture.</p><p>Her breath sawed out. A reporter. Again.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t have the reporters bothering her students.</p><p>And I can\u2019t hide forever. Straightening her shoulders, Skye headed for the cross-walk.</p><p>Trace clicked the file and watched the image load onto his screen.</p><p>\u201cThe city needs to invest in some better quality equipment,\u201d Noah muttered as he leaned over Trace\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBecause that image is crap.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was. Trace leaned forward. He hit the button to advance the footage.</p><p>The limo was there, waiting at the light.</p><p>And, just down the road, the BMW waited, too.</p><p>Waited.</p><p>When the limo accelerated, the BMW raced toward it.</p><p>\u201cShit, he\u2019s aiming for you,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Yes, yes, he damn well was.</p><p>The phone on Trace\u2019s desk rang. He picked it up, still staring at the footage. \u201cWeston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Weston, it\u2019s Joseph Hadden. I\u2019m at the police station...\u201d</p><p>There was a buzz of activity in the background. Joseph Hadden was one of Trace\u2019s agents. A guy on the rise who always got the job done. Trace had sent him down to the PD because he wanted to know exactly what was happening with the investigation.</p><p>Trace paused the video. The screen froze on the image of the BMW slamming into the side of the limo.</p><p>\u201cThey brought in the owner of the BMW,\u201d Joseph told him. \u201cBut that guy swears he hasn\u2019t driven the ride in months. He\u2019s claiming that someone must have stolen it. Says he didn\u2019t even notice it was gone until the cops started asking questions.\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowing, Trace hit the button to advance the video.</p><p>Glass shattered. Metal bent.</p><p>And the driver of the BMW jumped out. He didn\u2019t immediately run. He stopped. Stared at the wreckage.</p><p>It was too dark to see his face clearly, but Trace could see his body. Tall. Narrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the owner look like?\u201d Trace asked, fighting to keep all emotion from his voice.</p><p>\u201cAlan Brenthouse is sixty-four, he uses a cane and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s not the asshole who ran us down.\u201d Trace rewound the video. \u201cStay down there. Keep digging.\u201d He slammed down the phone.</p><p>Hit play once more.</p><p>The BMW waited.</p><p>The limo advanced when the light turned green.</p><p>The BMW raced forward.</p><p>The crash was brutal. Hard. Deliberate.</p><p>The driver got out. Stared at the limo.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to kill you,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Yes, he had. \u201cHe should\u2019ve tried harder.\u201d Because now, bastard, I\u2019m coming after you.</p><p>The reporter spun on his heel. He yanked down his camera and hurried away from her.</p><p>Oh, no, he was not just going to run.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Skye called out as she hurried behind him.</p><p>He still had his hood up. Maybe it was the one who\u2019d been there to catch her picture last time. Clyde. That had been his name. \u201cClyde!\u201d</p><p>The reporter kept going. He turned, darting down an alley.</p><p>She pumped her legs, going faster\u2014</p><p>Another man suddenly appeared before her. Tall, with wide shoulders, and dark blond hair. His green eyes glinted down at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to do that.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled to a stop. And, instantly, her hand dove into her bag. Skye had brought the bag along for a reason. She wrapped her fingers around her pepper spray that she kept in her bag. \u201cYou need to step away from me!\u201d Who was he? Why would\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I was on guard duty for you, Skye, but I doubt the rules have changed much.\u201d His lips hitched up into a faint smile as he gazed down at her. \u201cTrace would never want you following some stranger into a dark alley.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been a while since I was on guard duty for you...</p><p>She backed up a step. The street was busy. Plenty of people were around. I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m safe. The mantra repeated through her mind.</p><p>The blond shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cEspecially not if Sharpe was right...well, Trace sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want you following strange men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, buddy, I don\u2019t know who you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake Archer.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but I was following a reporter,\u201d she finished angrily.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a reporter. That was a man who seemed far, far too interested in you.\u201d His head tilted as his gaze swept over her. \u201cHe was so interested in you that I was able to get a good, up-close look at him.\u201d</p><p>In that instant, the sunlight that poured down on her seemed hotter.</p><p>Skye still had her grip on the pepper spray.</p><p>\u201cCaucasian male, late twenties, a nose that looked like someone broke the hell out of it, blond hair\u2014hair in need of a serious cut, and brown eyes. He was about six foot two, and as thin as he was long.\u201d</p><p>Her breath came a little faster. \u201cSeems you did get plenty of time to study him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of time,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSeeing as how he was outside of your place for the last hour.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted back across the street. \u201cJust how long were you outside of my place?\u201d Her stare returned to him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cLong enough. Trace is slacking. He needs to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>She could only shake her head and back away. Her stomach had clenched with fear. \u201cLook, Mister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, my name\u2019s Drake Archer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that name means nothing to me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Now he blinked. \u201cTrace didn\u2019t mention me? And to think, the guy was once my friend. But I guess the friends you make in battle and blood don\u2019t always want to claim you later.\u201d</p><p>Skye stopped her retreat. \u201cYou served with Trace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace. Noah. Ben.\u201d He gave a little salute. \u201cOnce we were unstoppable.\u201d He took a slow, gliding step toward her. \u201cWe were really damn good at killing. Too good. But from that little group of ours, I have to confess, your lover was the best. No one could be quite so efficient when it came to killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s voice thundered behind her.</p><p>\u201cAh, so there\u2019s the guard. A bit late, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Drake shook his head. The sunlight gleamed off his hair. \u201cI mean, if I\u2019d wanted, I could\u2019ve killed you by now.\u201d</p><p>This guy terrified her.</p><p>\u201cArcher.\u201d Fury burned in Reese\u2019s voice. \u201cYou get away from her.\u201d</p><p>Drake tossed a smile Reese\u2019s way. \u201cWhile you were sleeping on the job, I was keeping our girl safe. Just like the good old days, right?\u201d He turned away.</p><p>Oh, hell, no.</p><p>Skye grabbed his arm. \u201cJust which good old days are you talking about?\u201d Ice had encased her skin, and she made herself say, \u201cBack in New York?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>The ice grew thicker.</p><p>Reese swore.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was dancing...\u201d Skye continued. \u201cYou were sent to watch me then?\u201d</p><p>Another slow nod. \u201cYou were important. Guess you could say that Trace has always had a bit of an obsession...\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. This wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cWe should go back,\u201d Reese said. He was trying to pull Skye away from Drake.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood to be pulled. \u201cHow long did you watch me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes heated. \u201cUntil old Trace felt like I might be getting too attached.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he pulled off all the guards\u2014that must\u2019ve been when you were hurt in that crash. Bet that drives him crazy. If he\u2019d just kept the crew in place\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun away from him. \u201cTaxi!\u201d Skye yelled.</p><p>Reese tried to block her path. \u201cSkye, just slow down. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d already heard plenty.</p><p>A taxi braked in front of her. She jumped in the back. \u201cTake me to Weston Securities. Now.\u201d Because she had to see Trace.</p><p>And she had to stare into his eyes.</p><p>How long has he been lying to me?</p><p>The ice around her thickened.</p><p>The taxi roared away from the curb.</p><p>Trace\u2019s phone rang again. Only this time, it was his personal cell. Not the desk phone.</p><p>He picked it up. \u201cWeston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble, boss, big damn trouble.\u201d Reese\u2019s voice was shaking.</p><p>Trace surged to his feet. \u201cSkye? Is she all right? Is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming in hot, boss. Hot and pissed. Drake Archer was here. He got to her. Told her about his time in New York.\u201d</p><p>Trace squeezed his eyes closed. A frantic pounding began behind his temples.</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did they talk?\u201d Trace gritted out the question.</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Too long, but surely not long enough for Drake to reveal everything? \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d The last thing he needed was for that guy to be loose in the city.</p><p>\u201cHe took off, jumped on a motorcycle and got the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>But Trace would be seeing him again. He was sure of it. \u201cMake sure her studio is secure, then cut out for the night. I\u2019ll take care of Skye.\u201d He hoped. Trace dropped the phone onto the desk.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Noah asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d He was surprised that his voice came out sounding so calm. He stalked to the window and stared out at the city. \u201cYour friend Drake just got to Skye. I don\u2019t know how much he told her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecrets have a way of coming out.\u201d</p><p>Trace whirled to face him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it! Skye is my one thing\u2014the only thing\u2014that is any good in my world. Everything else is built on death and blood. She matters. She makes me feel like I matter.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cShe\u2019s not just going to desert you, man. The woman loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she?\u201d And this was the part that tore him up. That made him unable to sleep late at night. \u201cOr does Skye love the guy that she remembers? The one who actually saved her when we were kids?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to stare out at the city. Once, he\u2019d been down in the streets. Penniless, desperate. His clothes had been torn, his pockets empty. He\u2019d fought his way out of that poverty.</p><p>Now he had the world at his feet.</p><p>He put his hands on the cold glass.</p><p>And I could be about to lose everything.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>No one got in her way. The suits at Weston Securities took one look at her, and they backed up.</p><p>She knew that Trace had probably told them she was coming. By the time the cab turned the corner, Reese would\u2019ve been on the phone with Trace.</p><p>Alerting the boss.</p><p>\u201cUh, he\u2019s waiting for you, Ms. Sullivan,\u201d the man to her right said as he indicated the private elevator in the lobby. \u201cYou can go right on up.\u201d</p><p>Jaw locking, she did. With every floor that she ascended, her heart seemed to race faster.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to believe that man\u2014the stranger on the street. But Reese\u2019s reaction to the guy\u2019s claims had scared her.</p><p>I want Drake to be lying.</p><p>She wanted anyone to be lying. Anyone, but Trace.</p><p>The elevator gave a soft ding. The doors opened.</p><p>Noah stood before her.</p><p>Noah?</p><p>He winced when he saw her. \u201cMaybe you can think about going easy on him?\u201d</p><p>Was Noah insane? Were they all?</p><p>\u201cFind out his reasons, okay?\u201d</p><p>She stalked from the elevator. \u201cDid you watch me, too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you watch me?\u201d Her voice rose. \u201cHow many guards did I have? How many eyes have been on me?\u201d For how long? She couldn\u2019t suck in a deep enough breath. She couldn\u2019t breathe at all\u2014</p><p>\u201cSkye.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice. Quiet. Calm.</p> <p>He shouldn\u2019t be calm. Not when she felt as if she were about to explode.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll, um, give you two some privacy.\u201d Noah backed away. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find Drake.\u201d He edged away a few more steps then muttered, \u201cAsshole that he is.\u201d</p><p>Skye focused on Trace. Sara, Trace\u2019s assistant, wasn\u2019t at her desk, and the woman was usually close. Maybe Trace had ordered her to clear out\u2014the better for Sara not to catch the show that was coming.</p><p>Trace lifted a hand toward her. \u201cCome into my office. We can talk.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to scream. Instead, Skye walked forward. When he tried to stroke her shoulder, she jerked away from him. An instinctive move. She just couldn\u2019t be touched right then. An explosion was too close to the surface for her.</p> <p>She\u2019d first walked into this office just weeks before. Back then, she\u2019d been terrified. Desperate. Skye had known she was in danger, and Trace had been her only hope.</p><p>The door shut softly behind her, with the faintest of clicks. She stood in front of Trace\u2019s desk and braced her hands on the surface. Part of her didn\u2019t want to know the truth. Part of her wanted to pretend everything was okay.</p><p>But hiding does no good.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and turned around to face him. \u201cI met Drake Archer today.\u201d</p><p>Trace gazed back at her. His blue eyes were unreadable.</p><p>\u201cHe told me...he said that he\u2019d been one of my guards, back when I was in New York.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cTell me he\u2019s wrong.\u201d Did it sound like she was begging? Skye was very afraid that it did.</p> <p>Because she was begging, and it felt as if her heart was breaking.</p><p>But Trace didn\u2019t tell her anything. He just kept looking back at her.</p><p>\u201cTrace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a time, Drake did watch you.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to keep you safe.\u201d The words were said softly, but she saw his hands clench into fists.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even talk to me for ten years! You left me, you joined the military. You vanished from my life, until I came looking for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You already know I came to see you dance in New York.\u201d A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cI could never stay away from you.\u201d</p> <p>She whirled away. Her movements were jerky as she headed toward the massive window on the right side of his desk.</p><p>His desk. She looked down and saw the framed photograph there. The only photograph.</p><p>One of her. Smiling.</p><p>He\u2019d taken that while they were in the Keys.</p><p>Pain rose and threatened to choke her. \u201cHow long did Drake Archer watch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. \u201cThen you sent someone else, right? You kept sending someone, to watch\u2014\u201d Skye broke off. She started to laugh then, but the sound was brittle. \u201cOh, dear God, that\u2019s why you looked so shocked when I came to your office that first time.\u201d She forced herself to turn back and stare at him, even though looking into his glittering stare just seemed to hurt her more. \u201cWhen I came to you and said, \u2018Someone\u2019s watching me,\u2019 your whole body stiffened.\u201d She hadn\u2019t put the pieces together then, how could she? \u201cYou thought that I\u2019d found out about your guards, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have guards on you then,\u201d he snapped out the words from behind clenched teeth. \u201cMaybe if I had, then you would\u2019ve been safe. That bastard doctor would never have gotten so close.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted but she had no words. He hadn\u2019t just said that. He couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cI have enemies.\u201d He took a step toward her. When she stiffened, he froze. \u201cDangerous enemies who would like nothing better than to hurt me. But you see, for some men, just hurting isn\u2019t enough. They like to destroy people. Wreck them completely.\u201d</p><p>She was as frozen as he was. The ice was back, thicker than ever.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what would destroy me?\u201d Trace asked her.</p><p>Skye wasn\u2019t sure if anything could.</p><p>\u201cIf someone hurt you, if someone killed you, that would fucking end me.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cSo you put guards on me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed, Skye. For my country. For you.\u201d His shoulders rolled back, and he gestured to his plush office. \u201cYou think this place didn\u2019t come at a price? It\u2019s built on secrets. I learned plenty on a battlefield of blood and death. I learned to hunt my enemy, any place, any time. And I learned that, sometimes, you even have to be willing to fight the people who are closest to you...because those people can be the most dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of secrets.\u201d Her voice was thick with tears that she wouldn\u2019t shed. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me. It was my life. Mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you want me to do? To take you off the stage, away from the lights you loved, and tell you that my enemies might be after you? That there could be a man out there who wanted to hurt you, torture you, because of something I\u2019d done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never loved the lights.\u201d The words were a whispered confession.</p><p>He frowned, then Trace gave a hard, negative shake of his head. \u201cI put protection on you until the threat was gone. I just wanted you safe.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t getting it. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the thing that matters most to me!\u201d Trace leapt forward. His hands caught her shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you afraid. Not of me, not of the men that could come after you. I made a mistake. A stupid mistake, and I put you on their radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mistake?\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers. \u201cI took you with me. Fuck me, I took you.\u201d</p><p>That made no sense to her. It didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour picture. I needed it, Skye. I needed you. But I should have left you behind, because by taking it, they knew my weakness. They knew that hurting you would break me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is \u2018they\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Skye yelled at him. \u201cStop keeping me in the dark and just tell me! Why do you think I can\u2019t handle this? I survived a freak who kept me locked in a basement without food for days. I survived.\u201d</p><p>His lashes lowered, concealing his eyes. \u201cSome were traitors to our country. I worked Black Ops, Skye. It\u2019s off the books, things too classified for most people to ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not most people. I\u2019m the woman you kept in a cage, only I didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. She\u2019d hurt him. In that moment, Skye actually thought...good. Now he felt some of the pain that was ripping her apart.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem fair that she should be the only one who felt as if her heart were being torn out. \u201cHow many guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>He still wasn\u2019t telling her.</p><p>\u201cHow long? Months? Years?\u201d</p><p>His hands shoved into his pockets, but he didn\u2019t back away from her. \u201cOnly when I received intel to indicate that you might be in danger.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d taken her choice away. By not telling her... \u201cJust what did they watch?\u201d All of her personal moments? Her failures? Her successes? Her intimate time with friends...with lovers? Had eyes been on her then?</p><p>\u201cThey watched enough to make sure you weren\u2019t going to be hurt. When the threats were gone, they pulled back.\u201d</p><p>Fury seemed to choke her. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have a normal life! I didn\u2019t want you to be afraid all of the time\u2014like you are now!\u201d</p><p>Her breath sucked in. The pain hit her, even sharper than before.</p><p>\u201cNo, Skye.\u201d Now he did back up, frantically, and his blue eyes widened with an expression of horror. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nightmares,\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>His right hand raked through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was afraid last night at the party. You were constantly keeping me close, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Her brows lowered as she thought about the ball. \u201cEven when I was on the balcony, you had a guard on me. That\u2019s why Noah was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah wasn\u2019t the guard, but...\u201d His chin notched up as he gave a grim nod. \u201cYes, I had protection on you.\u201d</p><p>Every breath she took was cold. Ice coated her body and froze her lungs. Trace didn\u2019t think that he was doing anything wrong. To him, she was the wrong one. The one who was afraid. The one who always needed protection.</p><p>Sharpe had said that Skye was Trace\u2019s weakness.</p><p>Because I am weak?</p><p>Because she couldn\u2019t survive in the dangerous world that Trace lived in?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Trace told her. His voice had softened. \u201cSo I had protection on you a few times. I was looking after you, the way I always have. My feelings for you are the same. And your feelings\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the door, cutting through his words.</p><p>Trace snarled, \u201cNot fucking now!\u201d</p><p>But a voice\u2014Noah\u2019s voice?\u2014called back, \u201cOh, I think you\u2019re gonna want this fucking now.\u201d A pause. \u201cDrake\u2019s here, and you need to listen to what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to smash his damn face in...\u201d Trace whirled and headed for the door.</p><p>Wait, he just\u2014he went for the door. What. The. Hell?</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Skye yelled at him.</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>\u201cIn case you didn\u2019t notice, we\u2019re in the middle of something that is pretty important here.\u201d</p><p>And he was\u2014what? Choosing to go and talk with Drake while she stood there and felt as if her world were splintering?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Skye!\u201d Noah shouted. What, was the guy eavesdropping through the door? \u201cDrake says you need to know who\u2019s been following her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hasn\u2019t been?\u201d Skye snapped.</p><p>Trace opened the door.</p><p>Both Noah and Drake stood there. Noah was glowering. Drake was smiling. And Sara was behind them, watching nervously.</p><p>\u201cUh, Trace?\u201d Sara called, her voice hesitant. She craned her head around Noah and Drake. The light glinted off her blonde hair, and her blue eyes showed more than a hint of nervousness. \u201cI know you said Mr. York was clear, but, um\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sara,\u201d he said. \u201cI can handle them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Sara nodded quickly. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just leave you to all of...that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld buddy,\u201d Drake murmured as soon as Sara had slipped away, \u201cit\u2019s been too long.\u201d His lips twitched.</p><p>Trace threw a hard swinging punch that caught Drake in the jaw and sent him stumbling back. \u201cNot long enough.\u201d</p><p>Drake fell into the hallway.</p><p>Sara gasped.</p><p>Trace followed Drake out and drew back his fist to punch again. \u201cYou went to Skye.\u201d</p><p>Skye leapt forward, racing across the room.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would happen.\u201d Noah sounded disgusted.</p><p>\u201cYou told her\u2014\u201d Trace continued.</p><p>Skye grabbed his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t! Just\u2014stop!\u201d His muscles were tight beneath her grip.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the lady,\u201d Drake rasped. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to him. Trace had busted Drake\u2019s lower lip, and blood dripped down onto his chin, heading for the faint cleft there.</p><p>\u201cWe all need to calm down,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cTh-that sounds like a plan,\u201d Sara echoed. She\u2019d jumped behind her desk.</p><p>Trace turned his head and his gaze met Skye\u2019s. \u201cYou already look at me differently.\u201d</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t sure that she knew him at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only guy from the past tracking your Skye,\u201d Drake said. \u201cHas she already told you about her near-miss today?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s eyes sharpened on her. \u201cWhat near miss?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t important. \u201cA reporter\u2014\u201d Skye began.</p><p>\u201cA white male in his late twenties. Broken nose. Shaggy blond hair.\u201d Drake seemed to be ticking off the description one point at a time. \u201cAbout six foot one, lean, wearing a hoodie, and focusing only on your lady there.\u201d</p><p>Trace dropped his fist.</p><p>Drake slowly rose to his feet. He swiped his hand over his bleeding lip. \u201cStill got that killer hook, huh, Trace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still have a death wish,\u201d Trace threw right back at him.</p><p>\u201cGuess some things never change,\u201d Noah added. \u201cLook, can we cut through the bull and get down to business?\u201d He marched past them and headed back into Trace\u2019s office. \u201cBefore we give Sara there a heart attack, let\u2019s bring the party back inside.\u201d</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t want them inside. She needed to finish talking to Trace. He couldn\u2019t just blow her off.</p><p>But Drake had sauntered inside too.</p><p>Trace stood there, staring at her.</p><p>And Sara\u2019s gaze was filled with fear.</p><p>Right. Skye gave the other woman a little nod and marched back into Trace\u2019s office. He followed on her heels and secured the door.</p><p>\u201cNow, isn\u2019t that better?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cWe can tear each other apart in private...or, if we\u2019re feeling sane, we can actually talk.\u201d</p><p>Trace folded his arms over his chest and focused on Drake. \u201cTell me more about the guy at Skye\u2019s place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drake swiped away more blood. \u201cI saw the same guy, yesterday, just hanging near her studio.\u201d Drake\u2019s words were musing. \u201cOnly then, he drove off in a blue BMW. There was no sign of that ride today.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s whole body stiffened.</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d Skye whispered.</p> <p>\u201cBroken nose,\u201d Trace repeated. \u201cBlond hair...six foot one...Sonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>Drake glanced at him with a raised brow. \u201cSo you know the jerkoff in question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blue BMW crashed into Trace and Skye\u2019s limo last night.\u201d Noah was somber now. \u201cFrom your description, it sounds like our guy...\u201d</p><p>Trace grabbed his jacket. Actually started rushing back toward the door.</p><p>She put herself right in his path. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He couldn\u2019t be leaving.</p> <p>Trace\u2019s body vibrated with fury. \u201cDon\u2019t you get who did this to us? Who tried to kill us both last night? The broken nose, Skye. The blond hair. The build\u2014don\u2019t you see who this is pointing to?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to see. \u201cThat was a long time ago. Do you really think a man would hold a grudge for that many years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a man can want revenge forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, who are we talking about here?\u201d Noah wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cA jerkoff named Parker Jacobs,\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was clipped. His gaze didn\u2019t leave Skye\u2019s face as he said, \u201cI knew I should\u2019ve done more than just beat the shit out of him back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that it was Parker,\u201d Skye said. This was crazy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll know,\u201d Drake offered, sounding all helpful. She wanted to punch him. \u201cShow me a picture of this Parker Jacobs, and I\u2019ll tell you in an instant if it\u2019s the man I saw at her studio.\u201d</p><p>Skye hadn\u2019t seen Parker in years. She hadn\u2019t wanted to see him.</p><p>He\u2019d nearly raped her when she\u2019d been fifteen years old. If Trace hadn\u2019t been there...</p><p>Her hero.</p><p>And he\u2019d almost killed Parker that night.</p><p>Trace headed back to his desk with slow, measured steps. He bent over his computer. Tapped quickly on the keys, and then straightened. \u201cIs that the man?\u201d</p><p>Drake leaned in close to stare at the screen. \u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s the guy I saw jump into the BMW yesterday\u2014and he\u2019s the one who was watching Skye today.\u201d</p><p>She had to stop this. \u201cWe need to call the cops. If Parker did hit us last night, then let\u2019s get them to handle it. Let\u2019s call Alex. Detective Griffin can\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I\u2019m going to do right now is pay our old foster brother a visit. Ask him a few questions.\u201d All of the emotion had vanished from his face and voice. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt him. Just talk to the bastard.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him. Skye shook her head. \u201cCall the cops,\u201d she said again. \u201cDrake can tell them what he saw. I don\u2019t want you anywhere around Parker, do you understand me?\u201d Because she was scared, so very scared, about what Trace might do.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to just be a killer.</p><p>And Skye was already afraid there might be too much blood on his hands.</p><p>Everyone waited in that room. Waited.</p><p>The tension thickened.</p><p>Then Trace reached for his phone. \u201cGet me Detective Alex Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201cFor you, Skye,\u201d Trace said as his gaze lifted to meet hers. \u201cOnly for you.\u201d</p><p>The office door closed softly behind Skye.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re just turning that guy over to the cops, knowing that he might have tried to kill you last night?\u201d Drake demanded. His voice was thick with disgust. \u201cWho the hell are you and when did you become so whipped?\u201d</p><p>Trace offered him a grim smile. \u201cI put in a call to the detective. I left the information that I had with the desk sergeant. Now, if the powers that be at the Chicago PD can actually find Alex Griffin and relay that information before I get to my dear ex-foster brother, then good damn deal for them.\u201d</p><p>Noah whistled. \u201cYou\u2019re still going after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Skye was gone. Before she\u2019d left, Skye had promised that they\u2019d talk at home.</p><p>Where Noah and Drake weren\u2019t watching.</p><p>\u201cI told Skye I would call the authorities. I did. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have my own share of questions for Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just what did you do to this guy?\u201d Drake asked. \u201cDid you work your usual charm? Did that piss him off enough to make the fellow want to take you out?\u201d</p><p>Drake was still his charming asshole self. \u201cI caught him trying to rape Skye, and I beat the shit out of him.\u201d</p><p>Noah rocked back on his heels. \u201cThat would do it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, if you will both excuse me, I need to make sure that Parker stays the hell out of my life.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the door.</p><p>\u201cBy any means necessary?\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s question didn\u2019t stop Trace.</p><p>\u201cThat is your way, isn\u2019t it? Our way,\u201d Drake added.</p><p>When it came to Parker Jacobs, it was the only way.</p><p>Don\u2019t think of Skye. Don\u2019t think of the pain in her eyes. Don\u2019t focus on that now. His fingers tightened around the doorknob. He owed Drake for what he\u2019d done with his shit-for-timing revelations to Skye, but now wasn\u2019t the time to repay that debt. He had to handle one SOB at a time.</p><p>When Skye had walked out of that elevator, all Trace had wanted to do was take her into his arms. To try and make her understand.</p><p>But Trace wasn\u2019t sure there was any understanding. He\u2019d put guards on her. Kept secrets.</p><p>I\u2019m still keeping them.</p><p>\u201cSkye isn\u2019t going to like this,\u201d Noah said quietly as he came toward the door. \u201cNot when she finds out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Parker is trying to hurt her, I have to stop him.\u201d They didn\u2019t get it. Noah and Drake had never cared about anyone the way he did for Skye. They didn\u2019t have the connection. The need.</p><p>The vulnerability.</p><p>They fucked their women, and then they walked away.</p><p>No emotions. No weaknesses.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t live that way.</p><p>\u201cNow, gentlemen, get the hell out of my office.\u201d Because I have an old enemy to hunt down.</p><p>There was no sign of any cops at Parker\u2019s apartment. Good. Trace lifted his hand and slammed his fist into the door.</p><p>He heard a muffled curse from inside. The shuffle of footsteps headed toward him, then the door opened, just a few inches. \u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d Parker\u2019s muddy brown eyes widened. \u201cYou!\u201d He tried to shove the door closed.</p><p>Trace shoved right back. Wood splintered and Parker stumbled away.</p><p>\u201cY-you can\u2019t be here!\u201d Parker yelled at him. \u201cGet out of my place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see you remember me.\u201d Trace said as he straightened his coat. \u201cAnd I definitely remember you, Parker.\u201d</p><p>Parker gulped. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \u201cWh-what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo know why you tried to kill me last night.\u201d</p><p>Parker shook his head, a frantic gesture. \u201cI didn\u2019t! I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you see...\u201d Trace stepped toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly believe that. You and the truth don\u2019t have the best history together.\u201d</p><p>Parker spun away and grabbed a baseball bat that had been propped up against the wall. He swung it at Trace.</p><p>Trace ducked, then he drove his fist right into Parker\u2019s ribs. All of the breath left Parker with a whoosh of sound. The bat dropped from his limp fingers.</p><p>Trace punched him again. Again.</p><p>Parker fell to the floor. \u201cY-you\u2019re gonna get my blood on your fancy suit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I give a damn,\u201d Trace muttered. He grabbed Parker\u2019s shirt and hefted the guy up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching Skye.\u201d</p><p>Parker spat at him.</p><p>Wrong move.</p><p>Trace drove his fist into the man\u2019s face. Parker howled at the impact.</p><p>\u201cRight, I can break that nose again. I can do it in an instant. So start talking. Why were you following Skye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he-he made me realize how much the two of you had messed up my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Trace caught immediately on that point.</p><p>\u201cHe made me realize...it\u2019s all screwed because of you. You and your rich ass!\u201d Parker smiled at him. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get mine, and I\u2019m about to get it right now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get any damned thing,\u201d Trace promised him. \u201cNothing, do you hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeston! Let him go, now!\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s smile widened.</p><p>The authoritative shout had come from behind Trace. It was a voice that Trace easily recognized. Detective Alex Griffin\u2019s voice.</p><p>Hell. I left the door open. He\u2019d shoved his way inside and had left the door ajar behind him. He\u2019d been busy with other things, like getting the truth from Parker, and he\u2019d made an amateur mistake.</p><p>But it will be my only mistake.</p><p>\u201cTrace,\u201d a softer cry sounded then. Feminine. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Skye.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d Parker cried suddenly. \u201cThis man just broke into my apartment, he attacked me! Help!\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch. But did Parker really think he wasn\u2019t prepared for this situation? He\u2019d known it was possible that the message he\u2019d left actually would get to Alex.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t count on Skye being here.</p><p>Trace stepped back. His control was in place. Holding steady. \u201cI came here to talk with Parker. H-he jumped me right after I knocked at his door.\u201d Trace rolled his shoulders, wincing a bit as if he were in pain. \u201cI had no choice but to defend myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Parker screamed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what fuckin\u2019 happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Trace murmured, \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, Alex, I\u2019ll step back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe attacked me!\u201d Then Parker leapt at Trace.</p><p>Trace took the punch. Because he knew the game.</p><p>\u201cStop! Step back!\u201d Alex\u2019s cry.</p><p>Then the cop was between them, shoving Parker away.</p><p>Alex had his weapon out and it was locked right on Parker. Go ahead. Pull that trigger, Alex. Do us all a favor.</p><p>But Alex was showing no signs that he\u2019d be ending Parker\u2019s life.</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>Skye wrapped her arms around Trace and pulled him back beside her. \u201cYou said you\u2019d let the authorities deal with him.\u201d</p><p>Why was she here?</p><p>\u201cAnd you said you were going home,\u201d Trace told her, his voice grim. \u201cI suppose that means we both lied.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hold.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell are you all here?\u201d Parker demanded. \u201cGriffin, get them out! Wait, arrest him for assault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker...\u201d Alex sighed his name. \u201cDo you know anything about the hit-and-run on Mayer Boulevard last night?\u201d</p><p>Parker shook his head, but his eyelids flickered.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because the driver of a blue BMW got cut at the scene of that accident. His blood is in the car. That means we have his DNA.\u201d</p><p>Parker blanched.</p><p>\u201cIt was you,\u201d Skye said. \u201cYou came after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you kept sending the cops after me!\u201d This time, Parker lunged for her.</p><p>The hell he did.</p><p>Trace drew back his fist, more than ready to break Parker\u2019s nose again and do a whole lot more.</p><p>But Alex caught Parker in a steely grip. He spun the guy around. Slammed him into a wall, and cuffed him.</p><p>\u201cParker Jacobs,\u201d Alex stated, voice biting, \u201cyou\u2019re under arrest. You have the right to remain silent...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Parker howled. \u201cIt should be him! Not me! Trace attacked me!\u201d</p><p>Alex kept right on going, reading the struggling Parker his rights even as Parker shouted.</p><p>Then Alex hefted Parker around and marched him toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d Parker growled as his gaze darted from Trace to Skye. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>Trace leaned toward him. \u201cFor you, it\u2019s over.\u201d His words were a promise.</p><p>But Parker laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t see him coming. I told him. Told him everything. And you won\u2019t be able to stop him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d Alex barked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll take what you value most\u2014and then he\u2019ll destroy you!\u201d Parker was still laughing.</p><p>Skye shivered and followed Alex into the hallway.</p><p>Trace glanced around Parker\u2019s apartment. The place was a mess. It was\u2014</p><p>A glinting object caught his eye.</p><p>Trace bent over the couch, and snatched up the object.</p><p>Small, rectangular.</p><p>A military issued dog-tag.</p><p>His fingers smoothed over the ID.</p><p>His ID.</p><p>\u201cWeston, get out of there!\u201d Alex called.</p><p>Trace pocketed the dog-tag. The last time he\u2019d seen that dog-tag, he\u2019d been fighting for his life.</p><p>He\u2019d survived the battle.</p><p>His best friend hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Or at least that was what I thought.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The penthouse was silent when Trace opened the door.</p><p>Skye was there, he knew she waited inside, but no sound alerted him to her presence.</p><p>He dropped his briefcase to the floor. \u201cSkye?\u201d He was ready for the fireworks that he was sure would be coming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid toward the floor to ceiling window on the right. She stood in front of the glass, staring back at him. She was dressed in jeans and a tight t-shirt. Her hair was swept back, accentuating the high cut of her cheekbones. Her face was scrubbed free of makeup, and she looked so incredibly lovely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But sad.</p><p>I did that. I hurt her.</p><p>Jaw clenching, he headed toward her. \u201cI hate you found out this way\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs opposed to what?\u201d Skye asked as she slowly advanced to meet him. \u201cContinuing to not know? Letting you keep your secrets?\u201d When she was close enough, Skye paused and tipped her head back to gaze up at him. \u201cIs that the way you wanted things to be? You controlling everything while I wandered around in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, Skye, I just\u2014\u201d He broke off, yanking his temper back in check. She deserved her fury. He just had to find a way to get her calm again.</p><p>\u201cI can see it, you know.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted.</p><p>\u201cRight now, you\u2019re trying to figure out how to handle me. I\u2019m a problem, and you want me fixed.\u201d</p> <p>Trace shook his head. \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re not a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you are.\u201d And she pushed by him.</p><p>That was when Trace noticed the little bag that rested at the end of the couch. A small, overnight bag.</p><p>His heart stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d No, no, she couldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cI need some space. This place...\u201d Skye waved her hands. \u201cI see you everywhere. I feel you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move toward her. If he did, Trace was afraid that he\u2019d grab her and hold on tight.</p> <p>\u201cI need to think, and I can\u2019t do that when I feel like you\u2019re surrounding me.\u201d</p><p>Right then, he could barely think. Just breathing was a monumental effort.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave before you got back, because I knew you\u2019d just worry about me.\u201d</p><p>He forced his back teeth to unclench. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe studio. I have the apartment upstairs there, and I\u2019ve been working on it for the last few days, getting it set up.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cYou knew you\u2019d leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A sharp shake of her head. \u201cI just wanted to have a place set up, just for me. We all need our refuges.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t supposed to need a refuge when it came to him. He wanted to be her refuge.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave me.\u201d The words felt torn from him. Because they were.</p><p>She glanced down at the bag. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d Her laughter was soft. Even sadder than her eyes. \u201cYou know what I really want to do? I want to act as if nothing has happened. As if you didn\u2019t keep guards on me for years. As if you didn\u2019t lie to me. I want to sweep it all under the rug and just be with you.\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes. He closed in on her. \u201cThen do that. Nothing has changed. Not the way I feel about you. Not the way you feel about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Her whisper sank into his skin. \u201cLoving you is as natural as breathing for me, and I\u2019m afraid. So afraid.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to fear him.</p><p>That was why she still didn\u2019t know his darkest secrets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t watch myself, I\u2019d forgive you for anything.\u201d Her lashes lifted. Her eyes held his. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose myself in you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a response for that. His gaze fell on her left hand, on the ring that still gleamed there. She hadn\u2019t taken it off.</p><p>She\u2019s just asking for a night.</p><p>He swallowed the lump in his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll have a car take you to the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll have a guard watch me all night?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cNo guards. I need to live the way everyone else does. I want to be on my own. I want to be able to face the darkness and not always need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d he finished gruffly.</p><p>Skye stared back at him, but then she nodded. She bent and her fingers curled around the handle of her bag. Then she was walking toward the door with her usual, graceful stride.</p><p>Was she just going to leave without looking back?</p><p>She paused. Stared straight ahead. \u201cThere are more secrets, right?\u201d</p><p>Yes, there were.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want secrets between us. I want all of you. Good and bad. And when you don\u2019t tell me everything...\u201d Her shoulders hunched. \u201cThat says that you think I\u2019m weak. That I can\u2019t handle you as you really are.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t like that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want secrets. And if you only give me part of yourself...\u201d She drew in a deep, shuddering breath, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be enough for me.\u201d Tears thickened her voice.</p><p>He stood, rooted to the spot, as she left him.</p><p>The door closed softly behind her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t run after her. Skye had never expected Trace to do that. He wasn\u2019t the running sort.</p><p>She managed to keep her tears back until she was in the elevator. Then they slid down her face.</p><p>The overnight bag dropped from her hand.</p><p>Leaving him felt so wrong.</p><p>I need a night. Just a night to think.</p><p>Because if she stayed, Skye had no doubt that they\u2019d wind up in bed together. The need and lust always seemed to burn between them, surging strongly no matter what else was happening.</p><p>How many lies has he told me?</p><p>The elevator doors opened. She wasn\u2019t particularly surprised to find Reese standing on the other side of those doors. Without a word, he bent and scooped up her bag.</p><p>She swiped away her tears and crossed the lobby.</p><p>They rode in silence to her studio.</p><p>Reese parked, then came to open her door.</p><p>When she rose, his fingers slid around her wrist. \u201cYou know he\u2019s not an easy man. He just...he just wanted to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>This was the part that Trace didn\u2019t seem to understand, either. \u201cFor ten years, I thought he\u2019d forgotten me. Just left me. I ached for him, and he was gone.\u201d His choice. \u201cNow I learn that for the whole time, he had guards on me. He sent them, but he never said a word to me.\u201d Inside, she felt a seething mix of pain and betrayal. She looked up, but the darkness concealed Reese\u2019s expression. \u201cYou know more of his secrets than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know he\u2019s afraid?\u201d Reese asked. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to forgive everything? Live with his secrets?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Skye took her bag from Reese and went into her studio.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe and sound, boss.\u201d</p><p>Trace stared down at the bed. Without Skye there, it seemed too big and too damn empty. \u201cThanks, Reese.\u201d Her sweet vanilla scent drifted in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stay here? Keep an eye on the place tonight?\u201d</p><p>Skye wanted her solitude. And she wanted her guards gone. I\u2019m the woman you kept in a cage, only I didn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cIf she\u2019s in the studio, then you\u2019re done.\u201d The place was wired with a top of the line security system. His system. She\u2019d be safe.</p><p>\u201cAll right...but...are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Trace said as he stared at the bed. He ended the call.</p><p>And he threw the phone across the room. \u201cNever. Fucking. Better.\u201d</p><p>The little ballerina had left Trace Weston.</p><p>The move was unexpected.</p><p>Infuriating.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to leave him. She was supposed to stay with Trace. To make him weak.</p><p>Did she leave you? Or did you tell her to leave? It was so hard to be certain. Trace was good at driving people away from him.</p><p>Nothing would work if Trace wasn\u2019t tied to the woman. He couldn\u2019t suffer if he didn\u2019t love.</p><p>And he\u2019d been so convinced that Trace loved her.</p><p>Lights glowed from the second floor of the converted studio.</p><p>All alone.</p><p>He could get to Skye Sullivan right then. He could kill her easily, but if Trace was severing ties with her, what would be the point?</p><p>Wait...wait and see...</p><p>This game was all about Trace Weston. About him paying for the crimes he\u2019d committed and the lives that he\u2019d stolen.</p><p>And it\u2019s about me getting what I deserve.</p><p>The lights flashed off.</p><p>Sleep well, ballerina. I\u2019ll join you soon enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean...Parker made bail?\u201d</p><p>Trace glanced up from the pile of papers on his desk. He\u2019d been at the office since 4 a.m. Sleep hadn\u2019t exactly been happening at home, not without Skye there, so he\u2019d escaped to the office.</p><p>Alex Griffin shifted uneasily before him. \u201cThe judge granted bail. Fifty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Trace surged to his feet. \u201cAnd where did Parker get that kind of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d</p><p>Parker was out. On the streets. \u201cHave you told Skye?\u201d Trace demanded.</p><p>\u201cI called her.\u201d Alex inclined his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t overly worried that she\u2019d go out and beat the crap out of the guy, though. I figured that was more your department.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I warranted the private visit.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze dipped to Trace\u2019s hands. \u201cI can\u2019t help but notice that nice bruising you got on your knuckles. You know, Parker never stopped spinning the story about you breaking into his place and assaulting him.\u201d</p><p>Trace forced himself to take slow, easy breaths. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going after the guy again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you needed a warning. Watch yourself, Weston. A jerk like Parker isn\u2019t worth the trouble you can find heading your way.\u201d Then Alex gave him a little salute and turned for the door.</p><p>But Trace wasn\u2019t done. \u201cWhy did you bring Skye to Parker\u2019s place yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Alex glanced back at him. \u201cBecause she called me. She wanted to confront Parker, and she wanted me at her side.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s heart raced faster.</p><p>\u201cShe was afraid of what might happen if you got to him before the cops did.\u201d One brow crooked up. \u201cSeems she knows you pretty well.\u201d</p><p>She knew I was lying to her.</p><p>\u201cHave you learned anything else about Ben Sharpe\u2019s death?\u201d Trace asked the cop.</p><p>\u201cAh, you mean since I\u2019m actually a homicide detective now?\u201d Alex gave him a grim smile. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a robbery gone wrong. The killer worked fast, and he worked efficiently. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t his first kill. First kills are sloppy, unorganized.\u201d</p><p>Trace waited.</p><p>\u201cThis kill was planned and deliberate. Someone wanted Sharpe out of the way.\u201d A low sigh. \u201cAt least Sharpe didn\u2019t suffer long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Trace said, glancing over at the photograph on his desk. \u201cHe suffered for years, but his pain is gone now.\u201d</p><p>He kept staring at that photograph, long after Alex left.</p><p>Alex had been watching him with a too-careful stare. You think I might have killed Ben Sharpe?</p><p>Did Alex realize that his alibi was bull?</p><p>Maybe...</p><p>His hand pushed into his pocket and he pulled out the dog tag. There should\u2019ve been two tags. There always were.</p><p>He\u2019d found one.</p><p>Where was the other?</p><p>Time to find out just where Parker had gotten this one.</p><p>Parker glanced over his shoulder as he hurried down the street. Were the cops still following him? He hoped that he\u2019d given them the slip.</p><p>Bail. Freaking-A. He couldn\u2019t believe that someone had actually ponied up the money for him.</p><p>He rounded the corner, and saw his benefactor waiting on him. Parker smiled. \u201cSure am glad to be seein\u2019 you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that Trace Weston would never give up his dancer.\u201d</p><p>Parker blinked. The guy sounded angry. He took a quick step toward him. \u201cWeston\u2019s been obsessed with her for years. No way will he ever walk out on her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to kill them the other night.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s lips snapped closed.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got pissed, okay? Seeing them on the TV, all the freakin\u2019 time. Why does he get so much attention?\u201d While Parker had nothing. \u201cTrace is trash. He should be the one in the gutter.\u201d Instead, Parker had to fight for every single thing that he had.</p><p>Life hadn\u2019t been easy. No damn way. After Trace\u2019s attack, it had been so tempting to just pop those little pills that would take his pain away. Again and again, he\u2019d taken them.</p><p>Then he\u2019d taken other things.</p><p>Trace Weston had risen, and Parker had fallen.</p><p>\u201cYou want him to lose everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Parker nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d do anything to see him fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything...\u201d Parker immediately swore.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>His partner\u2014because they were partners, right? Partners in the destruction of Trace Weston\u2014stepped away from the wall. The sounds of the city were muted there, barely trickling past the thick brick walls of the alley.</p><p>Parker smiled at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s our next step? What do we need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A blade shoved into his chest.</p><p>A gurgle slipped from Parker\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou need to die, and the world needs to start seeing Weston for the monster that he truly is.\u201d</p><p>Parker felt his blood spurt from his chest when the knife jerked back. \u201cY-you...\u201d</p><p>The knife slashed toward his neck. Parker tried to lift up his hands, but it was too late.</p><p>He fell to the ground, unable to scream, as the blood poured from him.</p><p>\u201cYou should die happy, you know. You will help to destroy Weston.\u201d</p><p>Then he dropped something onto Parker. But Parker didn\u2019t feel the object connect with him. He didn\u2019t feel much of anything then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dancers collected their gear. They were soaked with sweat as they filed out of the studio.</p><p>Skye watched them go, smiling and waving even as the sweat dried on her skin. That had been an incredible class. Phenomenal.</p><p>I\u2019m going to make it.</p> <p>The smile wouldn\u2019t leave her face. She needed to call Trace and tell\u2014</p><p>Her spine straightened. She would be calling Trace, but not yet.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your students are happy.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the front door. Noah stood there, watching her carefully.</p><p>She\u2019d had the door open, and unlocked, all morning.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to live her life under lock and key, not anymore. The studio had to be open during the day so that her students could come and go as they pleased.</p><p>\u201cThey are happy.\u201d She flashed her smile once again. \u201cEven though I just worked their asses off.\u201d And her own. Her tights and her leotard clung tightly to her skin.</p><p>Noah\u2019s lips stretched in a half-grin. She saw a dimple flash in his left cheek. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling you could be a drill sergeant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can be.\u201d When it came to dance, that was her domain. She walked toward him, aware of a faint pull in her lower left calf. The leg had been doing so well lately, but she\u2019d sure pushed hard during the morning class.</p><p>Don\u2019t limp.</p><p>The old mantra slipped through her mind.</p> <p>His gaze slid over her body. Lingered a little too long on the expanse of her legs. She shook her head at him. \u201cYou know, I am engaged to Trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you? I wasn\u2019t sure, not after that scene yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. \u201cI can be pissed and still love him.\u201d</p><p>He edged closer to her. \u201cI envy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you envy anyone.\u201d Were billionaire bad boys supposed to envy other people?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always had you, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Noah glanced away from her. \u201cDo you ever wonder what he\u2019d be like if you weren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t always had me.\u201d She picked up a towel. Swiped it over the sweat on the back of her neck. \u201cWe were together when we were teens, then apart for a decade. I don\u2019t think that counts as always.\u201d She looked up and found his gaze back on her.</p><p>His head was tilted to the right as he studied her. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, it had been. She sucked in a deep breath. She was furious with Trace, but not with this guy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve been nothing but kind to me, and you don\u2019t deserve for me to be snapping at you.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flickered over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She forced a laugh. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m not usually a mega-bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were.\u201d</p><p>Skye wondered just what he had thought. He opened his mouth as if he\u2019d ask her a question, but then his lips clamped together.</p><p>Her hands tightened around the towel. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew your parents, right? You didn\u2019t join the system until you were much older.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The system. The trail of foster homes that she\u2019d visited over the years.</p><p>Skye pulled on a loose sweatshirt and a pair of jogging shorts. She felt too...exposed talking to Noah in just her leotard and tights.</p><p>\u201cI never knew my birth parents.\u201d Anger slipped through his voice. Pain. \u201cI always wondered...where did I come from? Who the hell am I, really?\u201d</p><p>Skye tossed aside the towel. She slid off her ballerina slippers and put on her tennis shoes. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, my mother was amazing. She was the center of my life. We baked cookies. Read stories together at bedtime. Played hide and seek for hours.\u201d The memories were there, warming her heart as they always did. Skye tied her shoe laces and then straightened. \u201cBut then she...got sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mind wasn\u2019t right.\u201d Such simple words to describe the psychotic episodes that had started to plague her mother. \u201cShe killed my father one night. They were driving home. People saw them. She was at the wheel. He was trying to grab it, to take control, but she drove them straight to their deaths.\u201d</p><p>And they left me alone.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my past. I know where I came from, and each day, I wonder...is that where I\u2019m going? Will I wind up like her?\u201d</p><p>He swore.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, not knowing isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d She said this with a certainty that came from her soul. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know, then you can think the best.\u201d She gazed into his eyes. \u201cYou were given up because your family wanted you to have a good life. They wanted you to thrive.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his hands. \u201cI did. For the first thirteen years, my adoptive parents were my world.\u201d</p><p>The first thirteen...\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey loved to sail.\u201d His breath blew out slowly. \u201cTheir boat sank when a storm came up. The winds were so strong. I tried to save them, but I just wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched. He\u2019d watched them die.</p><p>\u201cI kept my mother up the longest. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t let go, no matter what happened.\u201d Pain darkened his eyes. \u201cAnd I was still holding her, when the rescue teams finally came in. They pulled her from my arms, and I realized then that she\u2019d been dead for hours.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t just stand there. Not with that much pain in his voice and his eyes. Skye stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>At first, Noah didn\u2019t move. He seemed stunned.</p><p>\u201cI know, I probably stink to high heaven,\u201d she said, trying to lighten that pain, \u201cbut sometimes, we just need a touch.\u201d To say that we\u2019re not alone.</p><p>His arms lifted and closed around her. \u201cI envy him,\u201d he said again. His voice rumbled against her. Then he let her go, and he headed for the door.</p><p>When Noah was gone, Skye glanced around her studio.</p><p>Noah was lost. She\u2019d been that way once. So scared and alone. Then she\u2019d found Trace.</p><p>Or had he found her?</p><p>Rolling her shoulders, she turned away from the wall of mirrors. Another class would be there in a few hours. She needed to get ready to go for them.</p><p>And she needed to figure out what she was going to say to Trace when she saw him again.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t slept the night before. Just been in the dark, in that narrow bed, thinking about him.</p><p>Her phone rang then, the soft tone instantly alerting her because it was his ring tone.</p><p>Skye hurried over to the desk she\u2019d set up. She grabbed the phone. \u201cTrace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs you.\u201d</p><p>The voice was low and raspy. Definitely male. But...it didn\u2019t sound like Trace. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to help him?\u201d</p><p>Despite the sweat still drying on her, Skye felt chilled.</p><p>\u201cThe alley is just a few blocks away from you. Hurry. Go fast. Maybe you\u2019ll save him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cIs this some kind of joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook for the art. He had a killer view.\u201d</p><p>The call ended.</p><p>Skye pulled the phone from her ear. This was crazy. She immediately tried to call Trace back.</p><p>She just got his voice mail.</p><p>So she dialed his office. A direct line that should\u2019ve connected her to him.</p><p>Voicemail.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Maybe you\u2019ll save him.</p><p>Skye grabbed for her bag. Her pepper spray waited inside.</p><p>She rushed from the studio. Glanced to the left, then the right.</p><p>There was an art shop just four blocks away. She took off running. Maybe this was just some ridiculous prank.</p><p>Or maybe Trace needed her.</p><p>Her feet pounded over the cement. She dodged some pedestrians, barely paused at the stop lights, then, finally, she could see the sign for the art shop.</p><p>And, just beyond the shop, she glimpsed the little alley on its right.</p><p>Her hand dove into her bag. Her fingers closed around the pepper spray. Armed, Skye crept into the alley.</p><p>The scent hit her. Old garbage. Rotten food. And\u2014something else. Something that sent an instinctive shudder through her.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d Skye called. \u201cTrace, are you there?\u201d</p><p>Her phone rang then, vibrating\u2014and peeling his ring tone.</p><p>She jerked and her left hand drew the phone out of her pocket. All the while, she kept a steady hold on her pepper spray. Her fingers swiped across the phone\u2019s screen. \u201cListen,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trace voice. Distinct. \u201cSkye, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alley.\u201d Her words were quiet. She took another step forward.</p><p>She saw the foot then. A sneaker clad foot on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat alley? Why are you there?\u201d Trace demanded. Then, almost instantly, \u201cSkye, get out of there, now.\u201d</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Because she\u2019d seen the foot, and she could also see the blood.</p><p>Bile rose in Skye\u2019s throat as she stared down at Parker. His shirt was soaked a dark red, and his neck bulged open, a gaping smile of red where his throat should\u2019ve been.</p><p>He was dead. She knew he was dead, but Skye still found herself dropping to her knees beside him. \u201cParker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trace\u2019s roar.</p><p>She dropped the phone. Skye leaned toward Parker. His eyes were closed. His face was ashen. And that terrible smell...</p><p>Gulping, she tried again, saying, \u201cParker?\u201d</p><p>Then she saw that...something...was on his chest. Something small. Metal. Silver?</p><p>Right in the middle of all that blood.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on the object.</p><p>It looked like a military dog tag. She inched closer and noticed the outline of the letters.</p><p>W-E-S-T-O-N.</p><p>\u201cSkye?\u201d</p><p>The shout came from the entrance of the alley.</p><p>Her hand swiped out. She grabbed the dog tag and shoved it into her pocket.</p><p>Footsteps thundered toward her.</p><p>She glanced up and met Alex\u2019s shocked stare. Two uniformed officers stood behind him.</p><p>Those officers had their guns drawn and pointed straight at her.</p><p>Skye lifted her hands, holding her palms up. \u201cI found him like this.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze was on the dead man. \u201cThat\u2019s Parker Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lifted to study her hands. Crap. Had she gotten blood on her fingers when she snatched up that dog tag? \u201cI-I saw him and tried to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no helping the dead.\u201d</p><p>No, there wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Maybe he isn\u2019t the one I was sent to help.</p><p>Skye rose, slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not a threat.\u201d</p><p>Alex frowned.</p><p>\u201cTh-the guns,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked back. Swore. \u201cDrop the weapons!\u201d Alex ordered, his voice snapping with command. \u201cAnd call the ME. We\u2019re gonna need the wagon for this one.\u201d</p><p>He advanced toward her. Skye realized that she\u2019d dropped her bag and her phone. They were still on the ground near the body.</p><p>And, of course, her phone would begin to vibrate and ring right at that exact moment.</p><p>An image of Trace filled the phone\u2019s screen.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Police cruisers blocked the mouth of the alley. Trace jumped from his vehicle and rushed forward, but a uniformed cop held up a hand, blocking his way. \u201cSorry, sir, but you need to step back.\u201d</p><p>What he needed was to find out what the hell was happening.</p><p>As if on cue, a dark van pulled up behind him. The side of the van held two simple words written in garish yellow: County Coroner.</p><p>Then he saw her. Trace caught a glimpse of Skye\u2019s dark hair as she bent near the side of a patrol car. She was climbing into the back seat of that cruiser.</p><p>Being arrested?</p><p>He lunged toward her. \u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>Her head turned at his call, and the man next to her straightened. Trace wasn\u2019t particularly surprised to see Alex Griffin there.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Trace demanded. He wanted to reach for Skye and pull her into his arms, but after the scene last night, he didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d react to his touch. To him.</p><p>\u201cI found Parker\u2019s body.\u201d Her voice was low.</p><p>His heart wouldn\u2019t slow down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d been stabbed. And his throat was slit.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d seen that.</p><p>He glanced away from her too pale face and found Alex watching him. The suspicion was obvious in the man\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI just got here,\u201d Trace growled at him. \u201cGo talk to your uniforms. They saw me arrive.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d raced like hell across town. When Skye\u2019s phone had cut out, and she hadn\u2019t answered his calls back, Trace had panicked.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely be talking to the uniforms.\u201d Alex focused his attention back on Skye. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you were in that alley.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. Cut her gaze away from Alex. Looked at Trace. Then back to the cop.</p><p>A sign she\u2019s lying.</p><p>\u201cI was taking a break between my classes. I-I wanted some air so I went for a walk,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>\u201cInto an alley?\u201d The detective was obviously doubting her answer. He knows that she\u2019s lying, too.</p><p>\u201cI was looking at the art in the window.\u201d She pointed to the shop on the corner. \u201cThen I\u2014I thought I heard someone calling for help in the alley, so I went-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen who\u2019ve had their throats slit don\u2019t usually call for help,\u201d Alex pointed out, voice flat.</p><p>She jerked, but her gaze kept meeting the cop\u2019s. \u201cThen I guess I imagined the voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you did,\u201d Alex muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No way. Screw this. Trace stepped forward. He caught Skye\u2019s hand. Threaded his fingers through hers. Together, they faced the cop.</p><p>\u201cA slit throat. A knife wound directly to the heart. This sure does seem familiar.\u201d Alex\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cIs it seeming familiar to you, too, Weston?\u201d</p><p>Sharpe\u2019s murder. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s familiar.\u201d So why bullshit when they could cut right to the chase? \u201cTwo similar kills in the same city. Looks like you\u2019ve got someone hunting here, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p> <p>Trace shifted his gaze to Skye. \u201cBut it\u2019s not her, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sure?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was. \u201cWounds like you\u2019re describing...I know what they can do.\u201d Too well. \u201cWhen Parker\u2019s throat was cut, there would have been spray. The blood would have gone straight toward the attacker. Gotten on the skin. The clothes.\u201d He tightened his hold on Skye. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a drop of blood on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did...Skye had a few drops on her fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I tried to help him!\u201d Skye said. \u201cI told you that already!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou knew he was dead from the first glance, Skye.\u201d Alex fired back at her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make sense to save the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does if you\u2019re desperate.\u201d</p><p>Alex slapped his hand against the top of patrol car. \u201cYou hated the man. You think I don\u2019t know that? After what he did? Look, when I found out, I wanted to beat his ass, too. But you know what you don\u2019t do? You don\u2019t try to save the man who nearly raped you. The man tried to run you down and kill you. No one does that shit so stop lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Trace told the detective, his voice hard and grim. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk to her like that. No one does.\u201d And sure as hell not in front of him. \u201cSkye\u2019s answered your questions. You can see clearly that there is no arterial blood spray on her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s brows shot up.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t kill him. Now you can back off. Any other questions can be handled through my attorney, Craig Guthrie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never thought she\u2019d killed him,\u201d Alex snapped back. \u201cThe guy\u2019s head was nearly severed, and she sure doesn\u2019t look like she has the strength to do that. But you...\u201d Now his stare swept over Trace. \u201cI think it would be easy for you to do something like that. Especially if rage was pumping through you. Making you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should leave,\u201d Skye said. She shifted from her right foot to her left.</p><p>\u201cYou killed for her once before, right, Weston?\u201d Alex was still pushing. Pushing. \u201cDid you do it again? You were furious when I told you that Parker had made bail\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes, he had been. \u201cBecause he could\u2019ve come after Skye again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace.\u201d Skye\u2019s voice was urgent.</p><p>\u201cAnd you had to stop him, right? Had to make sure that he never had the chance to get at her again.\u201d</p><p>Trace lifted his hands, and Skye\u2019s hand rose with him because he wasn\u2019t loosening his hold on her. \u201cDo you see blood on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you were out changing. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t find you at the crime scene.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood luck proving that.\u201d</p><p>The body was loaded into the back of the coroner\u2019s van. Covered in a black bag, zipped up, then shoved in the rear of the vehicle.</p><p>Probably not the ending that Parker had expected.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know to come down to this alley?\u201d Alex demanded. Suspicion filled his gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019re such an innocent guy, Weston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for Skye. When I got to the street, it was rather damn hard to miss the flashing lights.\u201d</p><p>Alex advanced until he and Trace nearly stood nose to nose. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you are?\u201d Alex whispered.</p><p>\u201cI think you have no clue.\u201d The noise around Trace dimmed. \u201cAnd believe me, you don\u2019t want to push me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see right through the veneer you wear. You\u2019re a killer. Through and through.\u201d</p><p>Trace smiled.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Skye demanded. \u201cJust...stop!\u201d Then she shoved between them. \u201cIf you want me to come down to the station and answer more questions, Alex, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith our attorney,\u201d Trace threw in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not our attorney. He\u2019s yours. And I don\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d Her breath heaved out. \u201cNeither does Trace. He wasn\u2019t even here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where was he?\u201d Alex queried. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sure he has an alibi. Just like last time, right?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly. \u201cI was in my office. Working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd someone can verify that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my assistant, Sara, can.\u201d Like she\u2019d ever go against anything he said. Sara owed him.</p><p>\u201cRight. Your assistant.\u201d Alex\u2019s lips twisted.</p><p>\u201cI-I have a class to teach.\u201d Skye suddenly blurted. \u201cI have to go. It starts at two.\u201d</p><p>Now that seemed to surprise Alex. \u201cSkye, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just going to leave my students.\u201d She was adamant. \u201cIt\u2019s four blocks away. If you need me, you know where to find me.\u201d Then she marched away from the detective, and she kept her grip on Trace, pulling him with her.</p><p>Alex\u2019s glare followed them.</p><p>A crowd had gathered to watch the scene. Curious folks who were whispering about the murder that had happened so close to them. There were a lot of murders in that city each year\u2014too many\u2014but when the crime was fresh, the fear struck everyone the strongest.</p><p>Skye was silent as they walked down the street. Trace noticed that she had her left hand shoved into the pocket of her sweatshirt. Her right hand held his. But, after a few more feet, she pulled away from him.</p><p>\u201cSkye,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>Trace had to strain to hear her words.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Skye added.</p><p>He frowned at that response.</p><p>Then they were back at her studio. A few dancers were waiting outside, their gear bags at their feet. Skye pasted on a smile for them, welcoming each person.</p><p>She unlocked the door. Waved them inside.</p><p>When the dancers slipped in to begin their stretches, Skye turned back to him. She seemed to brace herself in the doorway. Her eyes searched his. \u201cYou\u2019re glad he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>He saw no point in lying about that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you found him. I wish you\u2019d never seen him that way.\u201d</p><p>A laugh\u2014no, a sob?\u2014trembled from her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to say. He was butchered in that alley and thrown away.\u201d</p><p>He braced his hand up on the door frame. \u201cTell me the truth, baby. Aren\u2019t you glad he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>The little bit of color in her cheeks bleached away.</p><p>Trace tensed. \u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I have to take care of my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d Because she looked so fragile.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her immediate denial. \u201cI-I\u2019ll come to you when I finish today. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found a dead body. Do you really think I\u2019m just going to walk away and leave you on your own?\u201d When it looked like she could shatter any minute?</p><p>\u201cI want you to walk away now, Trace. I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p><p>Something was off. \u201cWhy were you in that alley?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over his shoulder. He didn\u2019t even need to turn his head in order to see the uniform who waited on the other side of the street. Trace had been aware of the guy following them from the crime scene. No doubt, on Alex\u2019s orders. \u201cI went for a walk,\u201d she said, her voice wooden.</p><p>Lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to you.\u201d Then she left him as she went inside her studio.</p><p>Trace turned around slowly. His eyes locked with the cop\u2019s.</p><p>First, Sharpe had been killed.</p><p>Now Parker.</p><p>Who would be next?</p><p>I won\u2019t risk her. With his eyes on the cop, Trace pulled out his phone. Two seconds later, Reese was on the line. \u201cI need you to guard Skye.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d be furious when she found out what he\u2019d done, but she\u2019d be alive.</p><p>Skye had made it through the day. Her muscles ached, her stomach was tied in knots, and she was limping.</p><p>For the first time in ages, that damn limp couldn\u2019t be controlled.</p><p>She pulled on her sweatshirt and shorts. Grabbed her bag. And when she went outside, Skye wasn\u2019t even mildly surprised to find Reese waiting on her. After what had happened, she\u2019d known Trace would be back to his old routine.</p><p>Reese focused on her face. \u201cNot gonna yell at me for doing my job, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo tired to yell. Well, at you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>His lips hitched up into a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cTake me to him,\u201d Skye said as she climbed into the back of the car.</p><p>Reese nodded and closed the door behind her.</p><p>When the car eased down the street, her gaze found the alley and the line of bright, yellow police tape that sealed it off. She couldn\u2019t get the sight of Parker\u2019s body out of her mind. His neck...I will never forget that image. She could still smell the blood, too. Blood and garbage and death.</p><p>She\u2019d hated Parker.</p><p>But had the man deserved to die like that? Did anyone?</p><p>Her hands tightened on her bag. Life wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be so afraid.</p><p>And she sure wasn\u2019t supposed to fear the man she loved.</p><p>All too soon, they were pulling up to the curb. She didn\u2019t wait for Reese to come back to her. Skye jumped out of the car. Henry was waiting at the door. He frowned at her. \u201cMs. Sullivan, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She was far from that. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She didn\u2019t slow down because she didn\u2019t want Henry looking too closely at her.</p><p>When the private elevator doors closed behind her, Skye exhaled in relief. Goosebumps covered her whole body.</p><p>Parker\u2019s head had nearly been severed from his body.</p><p>Was that what it had been like for Sharpe, too? Had that poor man been attacked so viciously?</p><p>Only a monster would kill like that.</p><p>The elevator stopped its ascent. Skye crept out and made her way inside the penthouse.</p><p>The door squeaked open.</p><p>Trace sat on the couch, waiting. He was leaning forward, his hands between his knees.</p><p>His eyes locked on her.</p><p>For an instant, she thought about turning and running.</p><p>\u201cSkye?\u201d</p><p>She shut the door behind her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, but he watched her with the gaze of a predator. Part of her wondered if he was about to pounce.</p><p>\u201cI realized today...\u201d She took a step toward him. \u201cI would do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I would do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would never hurt me. I\u2019m certain of that. Not physically, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He jerked as if she\u2019d struck him.</p><p>\u201cBut there are other ways to hurt,\u201d she whispered. Another step brought her closer to him. Her fingers were tight on the straps of her bag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the guards,\u201d he said, swallowing. She heard the faint click of his throat. His hair was tousled, as if he\u2019d plunged his fingers through it over and over again. \u201cI\u2019ve told you about my enemies...\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told her enough. \u201cSharpe was here. He threatened me.\u201d</p><p>She remembered that instant so clearly. She couldn\u2019t forget how Trace had reacted. Are you threatening her? She glanced to the left. Trace had put his forearm under the man\u2019s throat. Right there. In that exact spot.</p><p>She wet her lips. \u201cAnd Parker tried to kill us both.\u201d Her gaze turned back to him. \u201cBoth of those men...they threatened me, and they wound up dead.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou think I killed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you killed to protect me before.\u201d But this...this wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cBut Sharpe\u2014he never so much as touched me. He needed help, Trace. He needed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace shot to his feet. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you asked me if I killed them?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers shook, fumbled, and dove into the bag. She found what she needed and she lifted the object, her hand a fist around it. \u201cI found this on top of Parker\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the dog tag onto the end table.</p><p>\u201cYour name, Trace. Your tag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>She felt the same way.</p><p>He lifted his hands, as if he\u2019d touch her, but then he hesitated. \u201cThey\u2019re not my kills.\u201d</p><p>She studied his eyes, searching desperately. She\u2019d been able to see his lie before, but this time, Sky just wasn\u2019t sure. He\u2019s too good at hiding from everyone, even me. \u201cI can\u2019t tell when you\u2019re lying or when you\u2019re telling the truth. There should be some sign, right? I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied about your alibi at the time of Sharpe\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I was back here. You were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...I tried to call you before I found Parker\u2019s body, but you didn\u2019t answer me. Not on your cell, not on your office\u2019s private line.\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t in your office, Trace.\u201d That had been another lie.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the alley killing Parker!\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to the dog tag. \u201cI didn\u2019t hesitate. When I saw that on him, right in the middle of all that blood, I took it.\u201d Her arms wrapped around her stomach. \u201cWhat does that make me?\u201d</p><p>The violent image was there again, rising fast in her mind. Parker\u2019s head, sagging back against the dirty ground. The blood thick around him. A twisted smile where his neck should have been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I touched him. I took the tag from the hole above his heart.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, but the image wouldn\u2019t fade. Nausea built, and she tried to fight it. Again and again and again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Skye ran for the bathroom. Trace called her name, but she slammed the door shut behind her.</p><p>Trace stood in front of the bathroom door. \u201cSkye?\u201d He jiggled the knob. She\u2019d locked it. \u201cBaby, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d Her voice was soft.</p><p>\u201cI want to help you.\u201d Trace felt as if he were tearing apart.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Trace. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He backed away. Forced his gaze off the door.</p><p>The damn dog tag waited. Trace grabbed it, smoothing his fingers over the letters of his name. This tag should\u2019ve been in an icy grave.</p><p>Maybe I should\u2019ve been in that grave with it.</p><p>The tag wasn\u2019t buried, and neither was his past.</p><p>He heard the rush of running water. His shoulders tensed. Skye would be coming back.</p><p>I have to tell her.</p> <p>His fingers were trembling. That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. He was always rock-steady. Never hesitating.</p><p>He\u2019d been dead-on in battle. In the boardroom.</p><p>His business was secrets. Protecting them. Exploiting them.</p><p>He\u2019d kept his own secrets so well over the years. But Trace knew with utter certainty that if he didn\u2019t tell Skye everything, he would lose her.</p><p>The dog tag was a message.</p><p>The bathroom door opened. Light spilled behind Skye. \u201cI wash and I wash my hands,\u201d she said, sounding a little lost. Not at all like Skye. \u201cBut I just can\u2019t seem to get all the blood off.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the tag. Went straight to her. He caught her soft hands in his. \u201cThere\u2019s no blood on you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted back. Her hair had come loose from the knot at the base of her neck. \u201cIf it\u2019s on yours, then it\u2019s on mine. What touches you...\u201d Her smile broke his heart. \u201cIt touches me, too.\u201d</p> <p>I realized today...I would do anything for you.</p><p>The smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI thought you\u2019d killed Parker, and do you know what my first instinct was? To protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that say about me? If I\u2019d steal evidence from a dead man\u2019s body, then what else would I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Everything.</p><p>The answer was there, stark and chilling between them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live like this.\u201d Grim finality had entered her voice. \u201cYou were right. I-I should\u2019ve seen someone after the attack. My mind\u2019s jumbled. The nightmares won\u2019t stop, and I\u2019m not even sure who I am anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d The only woman he\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>No, no, she had to do this. But she was walking away from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good at killing, Skye.\u201d Those weren\u2019t the words he\u2019d meant to say. They sure as hell weren\u2019t words that were going to reassure her. \u201cThe military taught me how to be good. How to get close to the enemy. How to take out my prey swiftly and silently. My main job was infiltration. Infiltration and hostage rescue.\u201d</p><p>Rescue of military personnel who\u2019d been taken by the enemy. Rescue of dignitaries. Of rich corporate CEOs who\u2019d been taken because they\u2019d been at the wrong place. Because they\u2019d trusted the wrong men.</p><p>Some of those rescued men had been grateful. They\u2019d remembered him when he left the military. They\u2019d jumped at the chance to use Weston Securities for their corporations.</p><p>He\u2019d kept their secrets.</p><p>But he was spilling his own.</p><p>\u201cI saved lives, but I took lives, too. The lives of the enemy, the captors who\u2019d taken the hostages.\u201d Tell her. \u201cAnd the lives of-of those on my team who turned against us.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, she faced him again.</p><p>He hated the strain on her face. His past had done this to her. \u201cI thought it was better if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d He looked at his hands. \u201cI still have the blood here, and you know the only time I ever feel clean? It\u2019s when I\u2019m touching you. You make me feel like I can be someone else.\u201d And not just the lie that he presented to the world.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, hard, and the last of her hair broke free from the knot, tumbling around her shoulders. \u201cFirst I get that crazy phone call. I-I thought it had to be Reese, wanting me to help you, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>He zeroed right in on that. \u201cWhat phone call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI race to that alley. I find him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat phone call?\u201d Trace snarled.</p><p>She stumbled back a step.</p><p>\u201cSkye.\u201d He tried to soften the harshness of his tone. He failed. \u201cPlease. What phone call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour number. It was your ring. Your number on the caller ID. But the voice didn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d</p><p>Fear was a living monster inside of Trace.</p><p>\u201cHe told me to go to that alley. That you needed me. That I had to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you went?\u201d Claws ripped at his insides.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call you back first. But I couldn\u2019t get you, and I was so afraid something had happened. I knew Parker was out\u2014\u201d</p><p>I knew I\u2019d do anything for you.</p><p>\u201cSo I ran to the alley.\u201d A sad shrug of her shoulders. \u201cAnd I stole evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your phone.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t wait for her to comply. He rushed to her discarded bag. He searched fast and yanked out the phone.</p><p>He scanned through her received calls list. Saw his name. His number. \u201cI didn\u2019t call you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese was visiting his girlfriend earlier today. They have a standing lunch date each week.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hacked into my account.\u201d Smart SOB. \u201cAnd he called you.\u201d She could have walked straight into a slaughter. Her own. Trace wouldn\u2019t have been able to do damn thing to save her.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Skye was beside him now. \u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><p>Tell her everything.</p><p>There would be no going back now. \u201cAfter a while, after we\u2019d served our tours, the team knew we were good at what we did. Very damn good. We started our own rescue service. That\u2019s what Weston Securities was, in the beginning.\u201d And it still was, when the situation demanded it. \u201cI tried to get Reese to join me back then, because he\u2019d served with us, but he wanted to come home. He\u2019d said that he\u2019d had his fill of blood and death.\u201d</p><p>Smart bastard. Reese hadn\u2019t joined them, but later Trace had told his friend all about the nightmare that had destroyed the team.</p><p>Trace continued, because there was no stopping now. \u201cSo when the team started, there were five of us. Noah, Drake, Ben, Tucker, and me.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulder brushed against his. \u201cTucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker Hawk.\u201d Tucker had always seemed to be the most easy-going of the group. The one who\u2019d laughed the easiest. Loved the easiest. \u201cTucker had a girl. Anna Jean. She\u2019d just finished a tour with the Air Force, and she wanted to join our team. She could fly like a dream, so I knew she\u2019d be useful.\u201d Back then, he\u2019d always thought in terms of usefulness. \u201cBut Anna had other plans. On our last run together, she decided she could get more money by playing both sides. She set us up, telling the enemy our extraction plans. Telling them our weaknesses. Telling them everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you made it out. You survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen was hit hard. Drake...Drake was captured. Tortured. I carried Ben out and left him at the chopper with Noah. Then Tucker and I fought like hell to get Drake out.\u201d The gunfire had blasted. A continuous thunder that shook his world.</p><p>\u201cWe killed every man between us and Drake.\u201d He couldn\u2019t look at her as he revealed this. \u201cBlood soaked me, and I just wanted to get out of there. I wanted to get home again.\u201d His eyes closed. \u201cI wanted you.\u201d</p><p>She twined her fingers with him.</p><p>\u201cWe got to Drake. Pulled him out. We were almost home free, then Anna Jean appeared. She\u2019d slipped up behind Drake, and she was about to shoot him.\u201d There\u2019d been a knife in Drake\u2019s hands. His only weapon.</p><p>\u201cDrake spun to attack. He stabbed her, and she fell back.\u201d But they just hadn\u2019t counted on one thing... \u201cYou can know some people are evil. You can know that they\u2019ve betrayed you, but if you love them, if you really fucking love them beyond reason, then, sometimes, I don\u2019t think you care about what they\u2019ve done. You only see them. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>That was the way it had been for Tucker.</p><p>\u201cHe screamed,\u201d Trace recalled. \u201cWhen Drake\u2019s knife went into her chest, Tucker cried out her name. He blasted two bullets into Drake, and Tucker ran for Anna Jean.\u201d That anguished scream had frozen them all.</p><p>Tucker had known than Anna Jean betrayed them.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t cared.</p><p>She\u2019d been what mattered most to him, and when he lost her... \u201cHe broke right before my eyes,\u201d Trace said. Tucker had fought, shot, attacked\u2014and gotten to Anna Jean on that snow covered field.</p><p>They\u2019d been in Russia. So far from home. Cold. Frozen. The white snow had been stained red.</p><p>Skye watched him with her big, solemn stare. He didn\u2019t want to see himself reflected in that stare. Because the part that was coming...</p><p>Man up and tell her everything. \u201cDrake needed medical attention. We had to get out of there, but Tucker wasn\u2019t just going to let him walk away, not after what he\u2019d done to Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was protecting himself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. Anna Jean died in Tucker\u2019s arms, and the man he\u2019d been before vanished. He attacked Drake. Tucker shattered Drake\u2019s wrist and took Drake\u2019s knife. Then Tucker went in for the kill.\u201d</p><p>Trace had shouted then. Yelled for Tucker to stop. \u201cI could\u2019ve taken a shot at them, but they were so close. Tucker and Drake were fighting, rolling around in the snow. So I ran forward. I grabbed Tucker, and I pulled him off Drake.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze seemed to see straight into Trace\u2019s soul. You won\u2019t like the darkness there, baby. \u201cTucker had his knife. I had my gun. I told him to stand down. To get his control back.\u201d</p><p>Even as he\u2019d said the words, Trace had known that wouldn\u2019t happen. If I\u2019d lost Skye, I would\u2019ve reacted the same way. \u201cShe was everything to him, and Anna Jean was dead at his feet.\u201d The blood had spread beneath her in that snow, looking like bloody angel wings.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been an angel.</p><p>Tucker hadn\u2019t cared.</p><p>\u201cHe said Drake had to die. Tucker lunged at me. He wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>The memories were so sharp.</p><p>Tucker, stand the hell down! We\u2019re your friends!</p><p>But Tucker had stared him straight in the eyes. You\u2019re dead men. Every single one of you. You did this\u2014you could\u2019ve brought her in alive. You. Did. This!</p><p>\u201cThe last time he came at me, I fired.\u201d Close-range, one shot right to the chest. \u201cHe grabbed my dog tags, and when he fell back, they were still in his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t even get to bring his body home. Anna Jean\u2019s reinforcements arrived. Blasting from the east. I could\u2019ve carried Tucker\u2014he was still alive then\u2014or I could\u2019ve gotten Drake out of there. I made the choice.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled around his. \u201cWould Tucker have been able to survive his wounds?\u201d</p><p>That was the same damn thing he\u2019d asked himself that day. And every day that followed. \u201cI thought I\u2019d hit his heart.\u201d He should have hit it. That close... \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t exactly time to stand there and do an exam. I grabbed Drake. Threw him over my shoulder, and I dodged fire as I ran. Noah brought the chopper in because without an aerial extraction, we were dead.\u201d He stared down at their hands. His looked big, rough.</p><p>Hers were so delicate.</p><p>\u201cHeavy snow started falling. In that part of Russia, the snow can drop from the sky for days. It can bury everything and everyone in its path. I thought...I thought the snow became their graves.\u201d After Ben and Drake had been secured and patched up, he\u2019d gone back to try and retrieve the bodies, but it had been hopeless. He\u2019d searched, nearly getting hypothermia, but there had been nothing to find.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this sooner?\u201d</p><p>Trace knew his laughter held a bitter edge. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I tell you that I shot my best friend and left him to die in the middle of a snowstorm? Maybe because I didn\u2019t want you thinking I was a cold-blooded killer.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Her hands pulled from his.</p><p>Oh, right. \u201cBut then, you do think that now, don\u2019t you? So confessing to my kill in the past hardly matters at this point.\u201d</p><p>Trace turned away from her and paced toward the window. The glittering lights of the city stared back at him. At least it wasn\u2019t snowing. He hated the snow. Every time he saw it, he thought of blood.</p><p>\u201cTucker is the one who attacked,\u201d Skye said, voice soft. She hadn\u2019t followed him to the window. \u201cYou were protecting yourself. Your other teammates.\u201d</p><p>The lights were so bright. \u201cI understood, that\u2019s the worst part. I knew exactly how he felt. He loved her so much that nothing else mattered, and without her, there was no control for him. He was desperate, hurting, and I left him there.\u201d</p><p>Only the ghosts from his past had come back to wreck his life. \u201cTucker liked the up-close attacks. They were his specialty.\u201d His...and Trace\u2019s. \u201cHe could get close to anyone without his prey ever knowing. Slip right up and slip his knife into his enemy\u2019s heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard her sharply indrawn breath.</p><p>\u201cA-a knife to the heart?\u201d Skye asked. \u201cJust like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Sharpe and Parker? Yes.\u201d And there was more. \u201cSlicing the throat is a personal way to kill. We saw attacks like that during our time together. When you wanted to send a message, when you wanted to be sure that your prey\u2014and their family\u2014didn\u2019t talk, the killers slit their victims\u2019 throats.\u201d</p> <p>In the glass, he saw her reflection. Skye walked\u2014very tentatively\u2014toward him. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that my dog tags should\u2019ve still been in a grave outside of Siberia. But I found one in Parker\u2019s apartment, and you found the other on his dead body. When it comes to messages, I think that\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d He faced her. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t leave a dead man out there after all. Maybe Tucker survived, and now he\u2019s come back to make sure that I suffer for what I did to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think...you believe he\u2019s going to kill you?\u201d</p><p>His hand lifted, and he stroked her cheek. Such smooth, silken skin. \u201cI told you that I understood how he felt.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cKilling me would be too easy. Death won\u2019t be quick for me. He\u2019ll want me to suffer.\u201d He and Tucker had been too alike, in many ways. \u201cAt the end, he made me a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019ll know...you\u2019ll lose...all.\u2019\u201d And Trace knew exactly what Tucker meant. Tucker had wanted Trace to feel the same agony that he experienced.</p><p>\u201cH-how will he do that?\u201d</p><p>Trace stared back at her, and he forced himself to tell her the terrifying truth, \u201cBy hurting you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Alex Griffin shone his flashlight to the left. Then to the right. He was in another alley. One that reeked of piss and garbage.</p><p>He had a small team of uniforms with him. Grumbling rookies who weren\u2019t happy to be on the backstreets of Chicago searching through dumpsters.</p><p>Like he gave a damn if they were happy or not.</p><p>Trace Weston hadn\u2019t needed to carry on about the arterial spray from Parker Jacobs. Alex had seen the splash of blood before at crime scenes. He knew how death worked. His job gave him an up-close and personal look at death each day.</p><p>Even before Weston had spoken, Alex knew that Parker\u2019s killer would\u2019ve been hit by the spray of blood.</p><p>And I also knew that the killer would need to ditch his clothes.</p><p>Because when you walked around, covered in blood, peopled tended to notice.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have gone back to the main street, not right after the kill,\u201d Alex said.</p> <p>The uniform closest to him, Sean Coleman, gave a quick nod. \u201cSo he ran away through the alleys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a panicked run.\u201d Alex stopped next to another big, green dumpster. \u201cI think he planned to kill Parker all along, and I think he had back-up clothes waiting.\u201d The better to blend in with everyone else.</p><p>Sean raised his brows and glanced at the dumpster. \u201cHell, another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp and in,\u201d Alex told him, shining the light.</p><p>Sean hefted himself into the dumpster. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding a microscopic needle in a\u2014\u201d Sean broke off.</p><p>Alex grabbed the side of the dumpster. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Sean rose. His gloved hands held a shirt, and when Alex\u2019s light hit that shirt\u2014blood. \u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Alex whispered. That shirt was his key. The techs could scan it for DNA, for evidence...this was it.</p><p>He was going to stop the killer. No more victims would fall on Alex\u2019s watch.</p><p>The shower water thundered down on Skye. After Trace\u2019s confession, she hadn\u2019t exactly been sure what to say.</p><p>She\u2019d survived the attack of one maniac before. Now she was supposed to just wait, knowing that some other crazy jerk wanted to come after her?</p><p>Sometimes, life could just be a hard kick in the face.</p><p>You think you\u2019re happy. You think you have a chance...</p><p>And then the chance is ripped right from your hands.</p><p>She leaned forward, putting her face under the spray. All of the blood was gone now. It should be. She\u2019d scrubbed herself until her skin felt raw.</p><p>Tendrils of steam floated in the air around her. The glass that surrounded the walk-in shower had completely fogged over.</p><p>She put her hand on the glass. It was hard. Cool.</p><p>The water pounded down.</p><p>Her fingers swiped over the glass. She cleared a small section so that she could see\u2014and, through that glass, Skye saw Trace.</p><p>Standing on the other side. Watching her.</p><p>She opened the door. The shower had been so loud that she hadn\u2019t heard him come inside the bathroom.</p><p>He was still dressed. In his too expensive designer pants and the shirt that she knew must\u2019ve been cut just for him.</p><p>The faint lines on his face were deeper. The shadows under his eyes were darker.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you just standing there?\u201d Skye asked him. She didn\u2019t try to cover her nudity.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you wanted me with you.\u201d</p><p>Ah, that was the part he just didn\u2019t seem to get. \u201cI always want you.\u201d That was the problem. She lifted her hand to him, inviting him closer.</p><p>He took a fast step forward, then stilled. \u201cI don\u2019t want any more secrets. If you stay with me, I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a promise you can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it. I swear.\u201d</p><p>She kept her hand up. \u201cTell me that you didn\u2019t kill Parker.\u201d Skye hadn\u2019t asked for the words before because she\u2019d been afraid of his answer. But now...</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Parker.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled, then curved. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Skye thought he would strip before he joined her. The clothes had to be worth a small fortune but\u2014</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t strip.</p><p>He came straight into the shower, the water\u2014pumping from two shower heads\u2014poured down on them. His mouth took hers. The kiss was deep and hard. Consuming.</p><p>Exactly what she wanted.</p><p>Her hands closed around his shoulders. The water soaked his shirt, making the fabric cling to him. Her bare breasts pressed against his shirt-front, her nipples pebbling.</p><p>Trace.</p><p>Only Trace.</p><p>He was the one man who\u2019d always been able to get past her defenses. The one man who could make her want and need more than anyone else.</p><p>His fingers slid down to her waist and he lifted her up against the marble wall of the shower. His mouth didn\u2019t leave hers. His tongue thrust past her lips, and Skye arched toward him. In that moment, she was greedy and desperate for all that he\u2019d give to her.</p><p>He was aroused. Trace\u2019s thick cock pushed against the front of his pants, and she felt the ridge against her. She wanted that ridge in her.</p><p>Her hands shoved between them. She unhooked his belt. Fumbled enough to get the button and zipper undone, and then that thick, strong cock spilled out.</p><p>Two seconds later, his cock was just where she wanted it to be. Driving deep inside of her.</p><p>She cried out when he filled her because it felt so good. He thrust deep, as far as he could go. His hips pinned her, her legs clasped his hips, and his hands caught hers.</p><p>He pushed her hands back against the marble. Lifted them up high and held her prisoner while he thrust.</p><p>The pleasure built. She clamped down her inner muscles, holding him as tightly as she could. Faster, faster, harder, deeper...she was chanting and she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Trace was fucking her, and this moment\u2014this\u2014was what she needed to banish the hell around them.</p><p>She came with a fury, exploding hard and fast as the orgasm rocketed through her. It took her breath. Made the world grow dim for an instant, and she reveled in it.</p><p>He came right after her. Another hard thrust, then he was pumping within her. He kissed her while he came, and Skye was sure that she could taste his pleasure.</p><p>There was no room for doubt. It was just her. Just him.</p><p>Slowly, her feet slid from his hips and she\u2014</p><p>Laughter escaped Skye. The water was still just as warm. Jetting down just as powerfully. And... \u201cYou left your shoes on.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. One of his real, rare smiles. The kind that made the dark, cold places inside of her feel a little bit warmer.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid that if I stopped to take them off, you\u2019d change your mind.\u201d</p><p>His words, so gruff, had her pressing a fast kiss to his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t run when I confessed. You believed in me,\u201d Trace rasped the words against her lips. \u201cI had to have you.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d needed him the same way.</p><p>He turned off the spray of water. Tossed away his soaked clothes. Ditched the Italian shoes.</p><p>He\u2019d been wearing his shoes!</p><p>Then he wrapped her in a towel. So carefully. They went into his bedroom. Their bedroom. The darkness surrounded them as they slid into the bed. She put her fingers over his heart, reassured by the steady beat. Then her fingers trailed to the right, just a few inches. To the thick, red scar that marked his chest.</p><p>Trace had been shot by the bastard who\u2019d abducted her. Skye tried not to think about what could have happened if Mitch Loxley had been a better shot.</p><p>I can\u2019t think about that. She bent and put her head over his heart, needing to hear that strong beat.</p><p>His fingers brushed back her wet hair. \u201cYou are the most important person in my life.\u201d His words rumbled beneath her. \u201cI will do anything it takes in order to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut because that anything\u2014it was what she feared most.</p><p>Skye was in the basement once again. Handcuffed to the pole that wouldn\u2019t move. She\u2019d screamed and she\u2019d screamed, but no one had come to save her.</p><p>She knew that she was going to die in that pit.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d His name was a desperate cry from her. He would be the last person that she thought of. The last man that she\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call for him?\u201d The voice drifted from the darkness. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and yanked harder on the cuffs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting, you\u2019re dying for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Skye begged. \u201cJust let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then she saw the glinting flash of a blade. The knife slashed down toward her chest.</p><p>Skye screamed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Trace said, his arms strong and warm around her. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath expelled in heaving pants. Her gaze flew around the room. Sunlight slipped through the curtains.</p><p>\u201cThe dreams will stop,\u201d he said, as his fingers stroked reassuringly down her arm. \u201cOne day, the memories will fade.\u201d</p><p>Only this hadn\u2019t been her usual bad dream. A new, terrifying twist had slipped into her nightmare.</p><p>\u201cYour memories haven\u2019t faded any,\u201d she told him, too aware of the drying tears on her cheeks. \u201cHow long has it been since you watched Anna Jean die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d</p><p>She had that to look forward to? Years of nightmares and memories that haunted her? Great.</p><p>But at least I\u2019m alive.</p><p>Yet that time period also gave her pause. She turned in his arms and stared up at him. \u201cIf Tucker really survived, then don\u2019t you think he would\u2019ve come after you by now?\u201d</p><p>A dark growth of stubble lined his hard job. \u201cSharpe was right when he said that you were my weakness. The whole world knows how I feel about you.\u201d He brought her hand to his lips. Lightly kissed her ring finger.</p><p>\u201cBecause you killed to keep me alive,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI kept your picture with me back then, just like I told you. Tucker saw it. All of my teammates did. So did my enemies.\u201d His fingers kept stroking her. \u201cOnce I fell behind enemy lines on a retrieval mission that went south, and I was tortured for hours.\u201d</p><p>She hated the thought of him in such pain.</p><p>\u201cThey were good, I\u2019ll give them that. Never left a sign on me. But then, that\u2019s what water boarding is all about, right? Destruction on the inside.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never realized he was in such danger. He\u2019d been in the military, she\u2019d worried for him but\u2014I never knew this.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t let herself think the worst.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake by having your picture with me. My captors took it. Taunted me. Told me that they\u2019d find you. Rape you. Kill you.\u201d His voice was so wooden that he chilled her. \u201cBut they were the ones to die. Most of \u2018em, anyway. A few slipped away. I got out, thanks to Noah and Tucker. And when I was free, Tucker gave your photo back to me.\u201d His eyes blazed down at her. \u201cHe knew, even then, how much you meant.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known.</p><p>\u201cBut when I came back to the U.S., I didn\u2019t go to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just sent guards instead.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey\u2019d threatened to hurt you. They knew what type of missions I\u2019d completed. I\u2019d attacked their allies before. The men who escaped could\u2019ve come after you. They could\u2019ve told others...I just couldn\u2019t risk anything happening to you.\u201d</p><p>Except he\u2019d missed one huge basic step. She lifted her hand and cupped his jaw. She loved the slightly rough feel of his stubble against her palm. \u201cNext time, tell me. We\u2019re partners, so that means you can\u2019t leave me in the dark.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019d...if I\u2019d come to you then, what would you have done?\u201d But then he shook his head, as if he regretted the question. \u201cYou were with the choreographer then, so you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The choreographer. Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou knew exactly when I was sleeping with Robert?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I knew about the Brit.\u201d Anger hummed in his voice and his face had tightened.</p><p>Well, hell. Back when they\u2019d been trying to figure out who might have been stalking her, Trace had demanded a list of her lovers. \u201cWhy did you want me to tell you about my lovers if you already knew them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know them all.\u201d Ah, definite anger vibrated in his voice. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t like I wanted to hear you talk about those assholes. I\u2019d rather never hear about them again if I had the choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hear about them.\u201d She pressed an open-mouthed kiss to that delectable stubble. \u201cBecause I certainly don\u2019t want to hear about any of your ex\u2019s.\u201d Quickly, Skye rolled away from him and hopped from the bed. \u201cNow come on, we need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before, they were all you.\u201d He was looking straight at her. \u201cIn the dark, that\u2019s all they were. And come dawn, I couldn\u2019t stand to be with them any longer because the light showed that they weren\u2019t you.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cI was seventeen, and you destroyed me for everyone else.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d felt that way before...destroyed. Skye grabbed for her robe and belted it quickly. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go get some breakfast together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the chef,\u201d Trace said at once. \u201cI\u2019ll have him prepare anything you want.\u201d</p><p>There he was\u2014being too eager. When she\u2019d been held captive, Skye had been starved for days. Trace was still overcompensating for that, seeming to be there, every instant when she so much as suggested hunger. They both needed to get past that. \u201cI thought we\u2019d try baking breakfast together. You know, the way most couples do.\u201d</p> <p>For an instant, an expression of absolute horror slipped over his face. \u201cYou want me to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll burn the eggs together just fine.\u201d She had to laugh because the horrified expression on his face was just so not Trace. Then Skye hurried from the room, her heart feeling lighter. In that moment, she had hope for them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t necessarily have hope for the eggs.</p><p>Her feet thudded as she hurried down the hallway, and in moments, she was in Trace\u2019s crazy, glorious kitchen. Normally, his chef Collins would come up and work his magic.</p><p>Today wasn\u2019t about working magic. It was just about the two of them.</p><p>She grabbed for pans. Got the butter. Hmmm...they could use cheese, too. She cracked the eggs and was starting to scramble them when Trace\u2019s arms wrapped around her. He nuzzled her neck. Licked her.</p> <p>\u201cTrace!\u201d His name came out as a yelp. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me destroy breakfast before I even really get started.\u201d</p><p>His mouth rose to her ear. His lips pressed against the delicate shell. \u201cFuck the breakfast,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Oh, he tempted. Carefully, she turned in his arms. \u201cI\u2019d rather fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Skye pressed up onto her tip-toes. The better to get into kissing position.</p><p>There was a sharp, hard pounding at the penthouse\u2019s front door.</p><p>Skye put her hands on his shoulders. \u201cAre you expecting company?\u201d At barely 7 a.m.?</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cUnexpected company doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d</p><p>Not with the security he had in check. The staff downstairs would never let anyone access his private elevator. Not unless...</p> <p>Trace rushed from the kitchen. She turned off the burners and followed quickly behind him. Trace glanced through the peephole on the main door.</p><p>When he shot her a fast glance, she caught the worry in his stare. His body was tense. He\u2019d donned a pair of black pajama pants, but his muscled chest was bare. She could see the tautness in his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Skye asked, frozen five feet from him.</p><p>Trace opened the door.</p><p>Alex waited on the other side. He had his badge clipped to his waist. Two uniformed officers were behind him.</p><p>No, most people wouldn\u2019t have been able to get past security and get up to the penthouse. But a detective wasn\u2019t most people.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, sir!\u201d A voice called out, and she saw John Ford, the building manager, as he peered around the cops. \u201cI had no choice but to bring them up because they have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warrant,\u201d Alex finished. He pulled out a folded piece of white paper. \u201cI\u2019ve got a search warrant for your penthouse. So, Weston, step outside and let us do our job.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to be good. Trace knew the truth, even before the uniforms called for back-up and more techs swarmed his penthouse.</p><p>They were tearing his life apart, one piece at a time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Skye said. Alex had given her a chance to dress. A fast few minutes in the bedroom. Trace still wore his pajama pants\u2014is that supposed to bother me, Alex? Cause it doesn\u2019t. Trace didn\u2019t give a damn what he wore or didn\u2019t wear.</p><p>Skye was a different matter. If the cops hadn\u2019t given her time to dress, Trace would\u2019ve had every single one of them pulling traffic duty by the end of the day.</p><p>But Alex hadn\u2019t hesitated with Skye. She now wore a pair of form fitting yoga pants and a loose top. Her hair was pinned up. She looked beautiful and worried and too good for me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to lie to her anymore. He wouldn\u2019t. \u201cYou know he found something to tie me to Parker\u2019s death already, or else no judge would\u2019ve given him a warrant.\u201d The judges in this town should have been too afraid to issue those warrants under any circumstances.</p><p>Milligan. Vermont Milligan. He\u2019d been the judge to issue this warrant, and Trace\u2019s lawyer was out earning his retainer right then as he attempted to figure out just what the hell was happening.</p><p>What did Alex find that led him back to me?</p><p>But then two of the techs spilled out of the penthouse. They were carrying several clear, plastic bags. Trace saw a few of his shirts in those bags.</p><p>Alex exited behind them.</p><p>Trace lifted a brow. \u201cLooking for some new apparel, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I found some recently.\u201d Alex sauntered toward him.</p><p>The building manager was huddled in the corner, watching nervously.</p><p>Skye was still at Trace\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI went dumpster diving earlier. Not my favorite sport. Well, technically...\u201d Alex looked over his shoulder. One of the uniformed cops had just come to join them. \u201cIt was Officer Coleman here who had the honor of that first retrieval.\u201d</p><p>Skye stepped in front of Trace. \u201cJust what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found a shirt\u2014a shirt very similar to the others that Weston owns\u2014thrown in a dumpster a few blocks away from the Parker Jacobs crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>\u201cThe shirt was covered in blood.\u201d Alex\u2019s eyes looked over Skye\u2019s head, at Trace. \u201cArterial spray will do that, you know. Cover an attacker in his victim\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Parker,\u201d Trace snapped. \u201cI told you that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you told us that you were at your office, working, but your assistant spun a different story. When I interviewed her, Sara Kramer told me that she came into your office, wanting to talk with you, but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Trace kept his expression blank.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t like turning on her boss, but when I showed her the crime scene photos, when I let her know just what type of man she was dealing with, Sara was fast to tell the truth.\u201d Alex\u2019s gaze flickered down to Skye. \u201cSome women can see the monsters in front of them. Others stay blind.\u201d</p><p>Skye reached back and took Trace\u2019s hand. \u201cTrace told you he didn\u2019t kill Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that what he told you, Skye? Or, when you were alone, did he tell you the truth? Did he tell you a story about how he worried for you? How he just couldn\u2019t keep on knowing that Parker was out there, that he might hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Parker would\u2019ve hurt her, but Trace hadn\u2019t killed the bastard. He\u2019d had other plans for Parker. Plans that involved a jail cell.</p><p>\u201cTrace didn\u2019t tell me any story about that. He just said that he didn\u2019t do it. I believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Flat. \u201cHe has no alibi, and I\u2019m betting the bloody shirt we recovered\u2014hell, I could tell it was one of those fancy-ass, too expensive shirts like Weston wears from the first glance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you and your fashion eye,\u201d Trace muttered.</p><p>Alex glared at him. \u201cI bet it\u2019s yours. I bet you left your DNA on it. A strand of hair. A drop of your blood that you don\u2019t even remember losing when you were slashing out with that knife. Something will tie back to you.\u201d Alex\u2019s glare gave way to a shark\u2019s smile. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re done, man. You won\u2019t be on the streets anymore.\u201d</p><p>He was supposed to be afraid. Only this cop didn\u2019t scare Trace, not after all he\u2019d seen and done. \u201cI get that you\u2019re trying to do your job, and I even understand why.\u201d</p><p>John Ford had crept closer. No doubt, the better to overhear. Trace figured that the building manager\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t get much bigger before they exploded from his head.</p><p>The uniform, Coleman, also leaned toward them.</p><p>\u201cI know what happened to your sister,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze cut to Skye.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me. I have a damn security company. I can learn anyone\u2019s secrets, just with the press of a few buttons.\u201d</p><p>Fury blazed in Alex\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t save her,\u201d Trace said and he meant those words. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the bastard who hurt your sister. And no matter how many times you try to put me away, it won\u2019t bring her back.\u201d</p><p>Alex stumbled back a step.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s something else for you to think about,\u201d Trace added, voice low and rumbling. \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted Parker Jacobs dead, I could\u2019ve just made the man disappear. No evidence would have ever been left behind. He would\u2019ve vanished in an instant.\u201d Trace snapped his fingers. \u201cJust like that because that is the kind of power I have. A sloppy kill wouldn\u2019t be my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did get sloppy,\u201d Alex snapped. \u201cYou screwed up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Skye\u2019s certain voice captured everyone\u2019s immediate attention. \u201cSomeone is trying to set him up, don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>A furrow appeared between Alex\u2019s brows. \u201cWhy the hell would anyone want to do that? We\u2019re talking about murder here. Two murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has enemies,\u201d Skye said. \u201cAnd some men will go to anything in order to get their vengeance.\u201d</p><p>The other uniform appeared then. It looked as if the guy had collected every single knife that Trace owned. Seriously? Did Alex truly think he could be such an amateur that he\u2019d kill with his own knives? And Trace had already taken the liberty of ditching the knives he\u2019d taken from Ben.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you would\u2019ve sent a flunky after Parker,\u201d Alex said, giving a sharp nod to the uniforms. The two men\u2014and the techs\u2014headed for the elevator. John rushed forward to use his keycard for them. \u201cI think, for a job this personal, you wouldn\u2019t mind getting your hands dirty.\u201d Alex\u2019s eyes were narrow slits of suspicion. \u201cThat dirt is gonna come back and bite you in the ass. Our lab techs are going to scan all the evidence we\u2019ve got...\u201d</p><p>He followed the others.</p><p>Skye laced her fingers with Trace. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d she called out.</p><p>She sounded so confident.</p><p>The elevator doors closed and their uninvited guests were gone.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Skye whispered as she pushed her hand into the loose pocket on her top. When her fingers came back out, she was holding the dog tags.</p><p>And one of those tags would have definitely tested positive for Parker\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cI took a minute to pick these up as soon as I saw who our guests were.\u201d</p><p>Protecting him. Covering for him.</p><p>He took the tags from her. It was time he made them vanish. Then Trace cupped her chin in his hands and leaned toward her. \u201cI\u2019ll make this end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Skye was adamant. \u201cWe will. We\u2019re in this together, Trace.\u201d</p><p>Together.</p><p>Because death wasn\u2019t about to part them.</p><p>When she heard the knock, Sara Kramer hurriedly opened her apartment door. Her lover waited in the hallway, and Sara threw her body against his. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Because she\u2019d been afraid, for hours.</p><p>Trace would know that she\u2019d talked to the cops. What would he do?</p><p>Fire her, no doubt. But what else? He\u2019d helped her before, when she\u2019d been desperate, and turning on him now seemed so wrong.</p><p>\u201cShh. Easy, my love.\u201d His hands were so gentle on her. He was always gentle. \u201cI told you that I\u2019d take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her face against the front of his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should\u2019ve talked. I-I don\u2019t know Trace did this and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand slid between them. He tipped back her chin, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Her heart finally stopped racing. Sara pulled back from him. \u201cCome inside.\u201d She wanted him to stay with her. No, after everything that had happened, she needed him.</p><p>He shut the door. Locked it.</p><p>Sara dropped her robe. She wasn\u2019t wearing anything beneath it. The robe pooled at her feet. She gave him a smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to make me forget why I was so afraid?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been the one to convince her that she couldn\u2019t protect her boss. Trace had lied. A man was dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t know Parker Jacobs. She\u2019d never seen him in her life, not until Detective Griffin had shown her photos of the dead man.</p><p>The photos had brought back too many dark memories for Sara.</p><p>So much blood.</p> <p>She\u2019d been afraid. If Trace was a killer, if he\u2019d done that...then I didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>She took a step toward her lover. She\u2019d kept on her heels, for him. He liked her in heels and nothing else. \u201cPlease make me forget,\u201d she said, and Sara hated that a pleading note had entered her voice. She\u2019d meant to sound seductive.</p><p>He bent toward his boots. Lifted up the left leg of his pants.</p><p>Sara frowned. What was he\u2014</p><p>A knife was strapped to his ankle.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said as he rose, that knife gripped easily in his hand. \u201cSoon you won\u2019t need to forget anything.\u201d</p><p>No, no. This was not happening.</p><p>\u201cY-you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Her voice shook. Her whole bodyshook. \u201cIs this some kind of game? Because I don\u2019t like it.\u201d Not with her past.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very serious.\u201d The blade gleamed. He stepped toward her. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked with Trace for several years now. You\u2019ve been his confidant.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the robe. Yanked it over her shoulders. Her gaze flew around the room. She had to find a weapon. Had to run.</p><p>\u201cSo I think you should be the one to call Trace. Who knows...maybe he\u2019ll even get here in time to save you.\u201d</p> <p>She was crying. The tears had leaked from her eyes and fallen down her cheeks. That terrible image of the dead man\u2014his slashed throat, his bloody chest\u2014flashed through her mind once more. \u201cIt was you.\u201d Why?</p><p>\u201cSometimes you think you know someone.\u201d He looked down at the knife. \u201cBut you only know what that person shows you. The deepest, darkest parts of ourselves are always hidden.\u201d</p><p>She spun to run.</p><p>Sara made it two feet when he grabbed her. He yanked her head back, gripping her hair tightly, and he put the knife to her throat.</p><p>Sara whimpered.</p><p>\u201cListen carefully,\u201d he whispered into her ear. \u201cBecause I need you to relay a very specific message for me.\u201d</p><p>The cops had tossed his place, and they sure appeared to have enjoyed the job.</p><p>Someone\u2019s ass is going to get burned because of this.</p> <p>\u201cAre they supposed to leave it wrecked like this?\u201d Skye asked as she bent to grab some fallen couch pillows.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Trace growled. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201d Alex was playing out of his league, and the detective was about to get slapped back into his normal game position. He reached for his phone.</p><p>It rang, vibrating as it gave a quick peal of sound. Trace glanced at the flat surface of the phone\u2019s screen and saw Sara Kramer\u2019s face. Frowning, he answered, \u201cSara? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>At first, he only heard silence. Then...</p><p>A gasp?</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d</p><p>Skye glanced up at the sharp bite in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou n-need to know...\u201d Sara said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Sara, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou n-need to know what it feels like...\u201d Sara was whispering. And crying?</p><p>\u201cSara, are you alone?\u201d Because he was afraid that she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>A sob. Choked off. Then, \u201cYou\u2019ll know what it-it feels like to...lose it all...\u201d</p><p>His blood chilled.</p><p>\u201cTake care of my sister,\u201d Sara gasped out. \u201cPlease!\u201d Then she cried, \u201cMy apartment\u2014\u201d</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>Trace tried to call her back. The phone just rang. Trace ditched his pajama pants and dressed in an instant. Then he ran for the door. Skye rushed after him, but he spun, throwing up his arms and blocking the elevator before she could come with him.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s him,\u201d he said, the words too quiet.</p><p>Skye\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? I thought you were talking to Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has her.\u201d That message had been too deliberate. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get to her, she\u2019ll be dead.\u201d Hell, it might already be too late. Trace pushed the button on his phone that would connect him to Reese. \u201cStay here,\u201d he told Skye as he backed into the elevator. \u201cI\u2019ve got to help her.\u201d</p><p>Skye watched him with troubled eyes. The elevator doors began to close.</p><p>Reese answered on the second ring. \u201cYeah, boss, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Skye jumped into the elevator.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to do that! \u201cGet to Sara\u2019s place,\u201d Trace told Reese. \u201cAs fast as you can. I\u2019m sending a full team behind you.\u201d He glared at Skye.</p><p>She punched the button for the lobby.</p><p>\u201cI think...I think the killer\u2019s after Sara. Get there. Get there. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d He ended the call. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Trace asked, trying to choke back his fear and fury. \u201cYou can\u2019t come. It\u2019s too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous? Yes, it sounds that way. Dangerous for Sara and for you, and there is no way on earth that I\u2019m just going to sit in the penthouse while you rush off to face whatever is happening at her place.\u201d She gave a firm nod. \u201cTeam, remember? That\u2019s what we are. Now call more of your men and tell them to get their asses over there.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened.</p><p>Trace got more of his men on the line.</p><p>He and Skye rushed through the lobby. Henry hurried to open the door for them. The bright light hit them outside and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Alex demanded, hands on his hips as he whirled toward them. \u201cNot making a run for it, are you, Weston?\u201d</p><p>Before Trace could do more than snarl at the man, Skye told the cop, \u201cHis assistant just called. Trace thinks that she\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d</p><p>Trace ended the call. Tried Sara\u2019s line again. It just kept ringing. \u201cThe killer is at her apartment. I know he is. My men are on their way to her place and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alex pointed to his car. \u201cGet your asses in there, and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to waste, and Trace knew a cop would get them there hell fast.</p><p>They got their asses in.</p><p>\u201cI-I did what you wanted...\u201d Sara\u2019s whole body shook. \u201cPlease...let me go.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he spun her around to face him. \u201cWhat the hell was that about your sister?\u201d</p><p>Claire. Claire would be alone if anything happened to her. Sara had been desperate when she\u2019d made that plea. She\u2019d promised her parents that she\u2019d always look after her sister...</p><p>Trace will take care of Claire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t hold that against you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWeston is coming. We have to give him something to find, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>No, they didn\u2019t. \u201cLet me go. I won\u2019t tell anyone. I swear, I won\u2019t ever tell them who you are.\u201d</p><p>His gaze searched hers. \u201cYou know, I think I believe you.\u201d He pulled the knife away from her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t originally intend to bring you into this, but you were so close to Weston. And I promise, it\u2019s not personal.\u201d</p><p>Fucking her hadn\u2019t been personal?</p><p>Beneath Sara\u2019s fear, anger boiled. The lamp on the end table was just four feet away. She could lunge for it. Throw it at him. Maybe gain enough time to make it to the bathroom. Then she could lock the door and stay barricaded inside until help came.</p><p>She knew Trace would get to her as fast as he could.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he told her, \u201cand you were so useful.\u201d</p><p>Her breath heaved out as she understood. She\u2019d been useful because of her access to Trace\u2014and Trace\u2019s office. She was the only person at Weston Securities who had free access to Trace\u2019s inner domain. She\u2019d let him in just days before, when Trace had been out. She\u2019d thought nothing of the encounter until now.</p><p>\u201cPasswords, files...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou gave me everything I needed. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He still had the knife. Sara knew, with utter certainty, he\u2019s not going to let me go.</p><p>So she could die easily or she could fight.</p><p>Sara dove for the right, surging toward that lamp. Her fingers stretched. She almost had it. Almost\u2014</p><p>His body collided with hers, and she fell to the floor. They hit the end table on their way down, and the impact sent the lamp crashing down with them.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, sweet Sara,\u201d he whispered to her.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream.</p><p>His left hand clamped over her lips and his right\u2014his right drove the blade of the knife into her heart.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>They arrived on the scene silently. No siren. No screeching brakes. Skye knew that they were trying not to alert the killer who could be waiting with Sara.</p><p>Alex and Trace jumped from the car. Skye hurried right after them. Two more vehicles pulled up behind Alex\u2019s car, braking to a quick stop. Black SUVs. Three men and two women in suits climbed from those vehicles and immediately headed toward Trace.</p><p>Trace\u2019s agents.</p><p>\u201cCover the back stairs,\u201d he said, pointing toward half of that new group. \u201cThen you guys cover the front.\u201d</p><p>The remaining agents nodded.</p><p>Trace glanced at Alex. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to want to lead the charge inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you right behind me, huh, Weston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d a sharp voice called out. Skye turned to see Reese rushing toward them. \u201cWith us right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Alex pulled out his gun. He nodded and took off.</p><p>Skye hesitated. What was\u2014</p><p>Trace caught her fingers in his. \u201cYou came here, and I\u2019m damn well not leaving you alone for a second. That SOB could be watching us right now, waiting for another attack.\u201d</p><p>They hurried inside the complex. An old converted warehouse, the place was now full of high-end condos. Trace got them immediate access to that building. He had Sara\u2019s key code, and that code opened the entrance gate in seconds.</p><p>They hurried up the stairs. Stopped on the second floor.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s number two-oh-six,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Alex stopped in front of the indicated door. That door was ajar, open just a few inches.</p><p>Alex and Trace shared a hard look, then the detective rushed inside. \u201cSara Kramer!\u201d</p><p>There was no answer. There was only thick silence, then, Alex snarled, \u201cDammit, no!\u201d</p><p>Trace leapt inside. Skye and Reese were with him, and they only had to take a few steps before they saw Alex. He was bent on the floor, crouched over the prone body of Sara Kramer.</p><p>Skye\u2019s hand flew up to cover her mouth, an instinctive reaction. Blood soaked Sara\u2019s robe. And there was a big, gaping wound where her throat should have been.</p><p>Just like Parker.</p><p>Sara\u2019s throat had been slit open, a wound that stretched from ear to ear.</p><p>Alex yanked out his phone. As he surged to his feet, she heard him say, \u201cThis is Detective Alex Griffin, badge number four\u2014one\u2014one\u2014eight. . I\u2019m at a murder scene. Brighton Condominiums, number two-oh-six.\u201d</p><p>A soft knock sounded at the door behind them.</p><p>Skye whirled around.</p><p>The unlocked door swung open. A woman stood there. A woman with hair the same light blonde shade as Sara\u2019s. Her eyes were like Sara\u2019s, too\u2014a deep blue.</p><p>The woman hesitated as she stood there. \u201cI, um, I\u2019m looking for my sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>No, dear God, no. Skye rushed toward her, trying to grab the woman before she could see the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Sara Kramer,\u201d the blonde continued, stepping forward, \u201cand she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Skye shoved the woman back toward the door. A hard shove that sent the other lady stumbling with a yelp. \u201cNo!\u201d Skye snapped. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d The blonde demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Where is Sara?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s dead on the floor. And you don\u2019t need to see her that way. You don\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Skye said, dropping her voice. \u201cSomething has happened.\u201d</p><p>The blonde grabbed Skye\u2019s hands. \u201cTo Sara?\u201d</p><p>Trace came to stand behind Skye. \u201cYou\u2019re Claire. Sara told me that you were coming to town.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned at him, then her eyes widened with recognition. \u201cYou...you\u2019re Mr. Weston, Sara\u2019s boss, right?\u201d Claire appeared to be about twenty-five or twenty-six. She was slender, her skin a soft gold, and her expression was slowly becoming terrified. \u201cPlease tell me what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Sirens screamed from outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Skye whispered. Claire was still holding her hands in a tight grip. Claire\u2019s gaze was now full of fear and desperation. Tell her. \u201cYour sister is dead.\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA detective is in there now. More police are coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go downstairs,\u201d Skye said. \u201cThe apartment...it\u2019s a...crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Claire tried to lunge past Skye, but Trace caught her, stopping her before she could burst back into Sara\u2019s place. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see her like that,\u201d he told her, voice soft, sad. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara!\u201d Claire screamed.</p><p>Then the tears broke from her.</p><p>Trace stood in his office, his gaze on the city that spread out before him. Noah and Drake were seated behind him. After Sara\u2019s death, he\u2019d had to call them both in.</p><p>\u201cHe used Sara,\u201d Trace said, his shoulders stiff. \u201cIn order to get close to me. He gained access to my personal phone line.\u201d He turned toward them. \u201cThe SOB hijacked the line to make a call to Skye. He could\u2019ve lured her any place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah swiped a hand over his face. \u201cAnd you think he might be using people at my organization, too? Doing the same damn thing to me?\u201d</p><p>It was a definite possibility. \u201cThe guy sure as hell seems focused on me right now, but the two of you needed to be warned. If he hasn\u2019t already gone after you, he will.\u201d</p><p>Drake gave a grim nod.</p> <p>\u201cI think he stole my shirt right out of the office.\u201d The back-up clothing that he normally kept at the office was gone, so there really wasn\u2019t any thinking about it. Now he knew how his shirt had wound up at Parker\u2019s crime scene. You wore it while you killed him, didn\u2019t you, bastard? \u201cI\u2019m sure he used Sara to get access to the clothing.\u201d</p><p>Poor Sara. She\u2019d been caught in a battle for nothing. Used. Thrown away.</p><p>\u201cYour security footage got his face, right?\u201d Noah said as he leaned forward. \u201cI mean, this is Weston Freaking Securities that we\u2019re talking about. This place is wired from the floor to the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>It was, but... \u201cSara Kramer had access to all the security information here. She was my right hand.\u201d Grief was there, painful, twisting grief that clawed inside of him. Sara had been a friend. \u201cI trusted her, and it looks like, a few days ago, she took the security offline for fifteen minutes. The whole building went dark.\u201d</p><p>Drake swore.</p> <p>Yes, that was just how Trace felt. He\u2019d been distracted\u2014the security breach had happened right after the car crash. He\u2019d learned that his team had reported the problem right away, only they\u2019d reported to Sara, not him because he\u2019d been getting stitched up at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re saying a dead man is doing this?\u201d Noah surged up from his chair. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t believe that crap. No way. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were flying the chopper that got us out of there,\u201d Trace told him. Because that had been Noah\u2019s job that day. Trace had barely made it to the rendezvous point. \u201cThe snow was coming down hard, and you could barely get the bird back in the sky.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced over at Drake. \u201cI was convinced he\u2019d die before we got him to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze strayed to the window. \u201cDo you two ever think...maybe I should\u2019ve been the one to die? Maybe Trace made the wrong choice out there. He grabbed the wrong friend.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes narrowed to chips of golden fire. \u201cStop being a dick, Drake. You both told me what went down out there. Tucker turned on you. He would\u2019ve killed you both in an instant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInstead, I thought that I killed him.\u201d Trace flattened his hands on the desk. \u201cBut if he\u2019s dead, then how\u2019d my dog tags wind up in Chicago? How\u2019d Parker get them? They should\u2019ve been frozen in Siberia, with Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Anna Jean,\u201d Drake said, his voice tight.</p><p>Trace frowned at him. There had been a different note in Drake\u2019s voice then. Pain.</p><p>Anger?</p><p>Well, the guy was entitled to his anger at Anna Jean. She\u2019d tried to kill him. She\u2019d screwed them all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best shot I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Noah said, as he braced his legs apart and studied Trace. \u201cFrom what you told me all these years, it was a point blank shot.\u201d</p><p>Trace inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cSo how would you miss?\u201d Noah demanded. \u201cYou hit his heart. You know he was dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone found the body,\u201d Drake said as he straightened. \u201cThe snow melted. Someone was digging\u2014the damn bodies were found, and with them, the dog tags.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s lips curved in a mirthless smile. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t consider that? If that were the case, I figure that I would\u2019ve gotten a blackmail threat. Not this...the kills are personal.\u201d They all had to see that.</p><p>\u201cPersonal,\u201d Noah agreed. \u201cFor you. Sharpe came to you, tried to warn you, and he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker Jacobs wasn\u2019t interested in warning me about anything. He was more interested in destroying me,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why he was used.\u201d Noah was speaking faster now. \u201cSara was used, too. Both of them were pawns in the game.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s hands clenched on the leather arm-rests of his chair. \u201cSo this is all just a game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo someone, yeah, it is,\u201d Noah agreed. \u201cWe just have to figure out who that someone is, because I\u2019d bet my life that it isn\u2019t Tucker. He\u2019s dead and gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about Tucker\u2019s family?\u201d Drake asked as a furrow appeared between his brows. \u201cMaybe one of them found out what happened. Maybe one of them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker was an only child. His mother died before he enlisted, and his father is still living down in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuint Hawk is disabled, living on a fixed income, and the man sure doesn\u2019t have the physical strength needed to commit these crimes.\u201d Trace\u2019s breath whispered out. \u201cAnd as soon as this mess started, I had an agent head down there and verify that Quint was still at his old ranch.\u201d</p><p>Trace hadn\u2019t seen Quint in person, not since the day of Tucker\u2019s funeral service. He and Quint had been the only two there that day, standing in the rain, mourning the life that was gone.</p><p>A life I took.</p><p>\u201cThen what about Anna Jean?\u201d Noah said, giving a quick jerk of his head.</p><p>Because Trace was watching Drake so closely, he saw the other man flinch at Noah\u2019s question. Taking his time, Trace slid around the edge of his desk and closed in on Drake. Considering now, Trace said, \u201cWhen we came back, we all dealt with the past differently. Noah there...he slept with every woman he could find, and he made sure that he never saw the same woman twice. I figured he was trying to make sure he never fell into the same trap that Tucker did. He didn\u2019t want to latch on to one woman and become\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak,\u201d Noah said. But his voice was hesitant.</p><p>\u201cYou...you Drake, at first, you seemed solid. You were the one who nearly died. You and Ben. Ben wasn\u2019t the same, though, we all could see that. The demons chased and chased him, but you...\u201d Trace exhaled. \u201cYou seemed stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong enough that you sent me to New York to keep an eye on the woman you loved.\u201d Drake pushed from his chair. \u201cAnd then I walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Drake was holding back on him. He knew it.</p><p>Trace had kept tabs on the man over the years. Drake had returned to his home in the south, right along a strip of Mississippi Beach. He\u2019d opened three casinos down there. He\u2019d started two more in Vegas. Drake seemed to spend his days and nights surrounded by power players.</p><p>But Trace knew just how deceptive appearances could be.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have trusted me,\u201d Drake said. \u201cIf you knew...you\u2019d never have sent me after her.\u201d Drake spun and marched toward the door. \u201cIf Tucker really is back from the dead, he\u2019ll kill me long before he takes his knife to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d Noah snapped.</p><p>Drake paused at the door. He glanced back with a sardonic smile on his lips. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m the one who fucked Tucker\u2019s girl. I screwed Anna Jean, and the blind fool never even realized it. None of you did.\u201d He yanked open the door and stormed out.</p><p>Well, well...</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Now Noah sounded musing. Trace glanced at him. Noah shrugged. \u201cI guess that explains why Anna Jean tried so hard to kill him. She didn\u2019t want to take any chances on Tucker finding out that she\u2019d been screwing around with his friend.\u201d Noah exhaled heavily. \u201cTalk about twisted shit.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was.</p><p>Noah crossed to Trace and slapped him on the shoulder. \u201cBut, look at it this way, if the guy wasn\u2019t just BS\u2019ing right then, you have some extra time. Because, hell, yeah, Tucker would go after the man who screwed Anna Jean. He\u2019d destroy the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake didn\u2019t exactly look scared to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s because I\u2019m pretty sure the guy is insane. He doesn\u2019t have the sense to be scared.\u201d</p><p>No, Trace didn\u2019t think that was the case at all. \u201cHe\u2019s got a death wish.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flashed on Noah\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to be punished. He\u2019s wanted that for years.\u201d But the problem was that if you wished for death too long...</p><p>Death would come for you.</p><p>Noah\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cYou know, you never did answer my question about Anna Jean\u2019s family. They could be looking for some payback, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean\u2019s parents are dead. She had one half-sister, Piper. A school teacher in Atlanta.\u201d He\u2019d checked on her after he\u2019d come back from Russia. Made sure that Piper\u2019s college was covered. Then he\u2019d stayed the hell out of her life. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to have her sister\u2019s killer instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, if you ask me, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Noah shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cBut it sure seems to me that someone out there has got that instinct, and that person is closing in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any place to stay.\u201d Claire sat on the couch in the penthouse, her fingers twisted in front of her. Discarded tissues formed a pile around her. \u201cI was supposed to be moving in with Sara. I-I just got into town a few hours early. She was going to help me find a job here.\u201d A silent tear tracked down her cheek. \u201cShe can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d Her voice was hoarse. \u201cSara can\u2019t do anything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here tonight,\u201d Skye said immediately. \u201cThere is plenty of room in this place.\u201d</p><p>But Claire glanced around the penthouse, fear flashing in her gaze. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Whispered. \u201cI just...can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Skye frowned at her. \u201cWe have an extra bedroom.\u201d Four of them. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t really...I\u2019ve heard stories about Mr. Weston\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe scares me. I used to ask Sara if he scared her.\u201d Her lips twisted into a sad smile. \u201cShe said, \u2018Every day. But that\u2019s half the fun.\u2019\u201d Claire laughed then, and the sound was heavy with tears. \u201cBut Sara was lying to me, you see. I don\u2019t think she was ever really afraid of anything. She isn\u2019t like me.\u201d Claire\u2019s shoulders hunched.</p><p>Skye gazed at her, her heart aching. There was something about Claire that reminded her...</p><p>Of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a hotel. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Claire stood up. Squared her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an apartment over my dance studio,\u201d Skye said, rising with her. \u201cYou can stay there. No one will bother you.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s lips trembled. \u201cTh-thank you.\u201d Then she paused. \u201cI...know about what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Skye was sure most of the world did. She lifted her chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurviving is hard, isn\u2019t it? But at least you know he\u2019s not out there anymore, watching you.\u201d Claire licked her lips. \u201cThat part is the scariest.\u201d</p><p>Skye felt her heartbeat race. She\u2019s speaking from experience.</p><p>\u201cNever knowing...it\u2019s the hardest.\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes squeezed shut, then she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault that Sara is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Skye shook her head and then realized that Claire couldn\u2019t see the move. \u201cNo, no, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s body trembled. \u201cHe killed my parents, and he killed her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Skye snapped out her name. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lover,\u201d she said as her eyes opened. \u201cMy one and only. He said I was his forever, and he\u2019s made sure that I am.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on Skye\u2019s arms.</p><p>I see me in her. The same fear. The terror that lurked in Claire\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d escaped, just like you had. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d More tears slid down Claire\u2019s cheeks. \u201cAnd Sara is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of you.\u201d Skye wanted to shake the other woman. So she did. Hard.</p><p>Claire blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to your parents or what happened to you, but Sara\u2019s death isn\u2019t on you.\u201d Skye sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cSomeone is killing in this city. This is his third attack. The crimes are all the same. The victims are all\u2014\u201d Skye broke off, not wanting to reveal the gory details to Claire.</p><p>\u201cTh-third attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo men were killed before Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s the same killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Because the killer was from Trace\u2019s past.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would he go after my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think...\u201d It was so hard to say this as she stared into those tear-filled eyes. \u201cWe think the killer was using her in order to get at Trace. And after he\u2019d gotten what he needed from Sara...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed my sister.\u201d Hollow words. Words that matched the look in Claire\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Skye nodded. Claire deserved the truth, and she was determined to give it to her.</p><p>One survivor to another.</p><p>\u201cI need to see her,\u201d Claire said. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>The body had been transferred down to the coroner\u2019s office hours before. Skye knew the ME wouldn\u2019t be finished with the exam, not yet.</p><p>\u201cI need to do it. I\u2019m all that Sara has.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Alex.\u201d The detective might be able to arrange something for them.</p><p>At least Claire wouldn\u2019t be seeing her sister\u2019s body, soaked in blood. They could get the ME to only show her face to Claire. They could do something.</p><p>Because if they didn\u2019t, Skye was worried that Claire might just break apart.</p> <p>When his phone rang, Trace snatched it up immediately. \u201cReese? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Reese had orders to stick close to Skye. She was not going to end up like Sara.</p><p>\u201cUh, boss, they\u2019re heading to the ME\u2019s office. Skye and Sara\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>The ME\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cJust thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d He stood. \u201cNoah, start checking your personnel. I\u2019ve already got a team backtracking through the last few weeks of Sara\u2019s life. Someone saw the guy. Somewhere, sometime.\u201d They just had to talk to the right person. The one who remembered the SOB.</p> <p>Noah nodded and walked to the door with him. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should come in with you,\u201d Reese said as they stood in front of the police station. \u201cI can help.\u201d</p><p>Claire wouldn\u2019t look straight at Reese. Skye had noticed that Claire also stiffened her body whenever Reese got too close to her.</p><p>\u201cAlex is waiting for us inside.\u201d Skye gave Reese a wan smile. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His gaze drifted to Claire. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your sister. Sara was a good woman. She didn\u2019t deserve an end like that.\u201d</p> <p>Claire pulled in a rough breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They hurried inside. The steps they climbed seemed huge, but then they were past the swinging glass doors and in the lobby of the Chicago PD. The Medical Examiner\u2019s office was located just behind the PD, but in order to gain access, they had to make sure they had Alex with them.</p><p>Skye signed in, then asked to be directed to Detective Alex Griffin\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>Skye looked up. Alex marched toward them, the lines near his mouth making him look grim. Tired.</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze slid from her to Claire. \u201cMs. Kramer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see my sister.\u201d Claire\u2019s hands had fisted.</p><p>\u201cThe ME isn\u2019t...ah, the autopsy hasn\u2019t been completed.\u201d</p> <p>Based on what she\u2019d seen, Skye was pretty sure what the cause of death would be.</p><p>\u201cI have to see her.\u201d Desperation filled Claire\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Alex promised. \u201cFirst, we need to talk.\u201d His hand lifted and his fingers pressed into Claire\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Claire flinched and pulled away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t like being touched.\u201d Flat. Hard.</p><p>But Claire hadn\u2019t objected at all when Skye touched her.</p><p>Skye saw the flash of understanding in Alex\u2019s eyes. After the things he\u2019d experienced in his own life and the darkness he saw each day, Skye realized that he understood Claire perfectly. \u201cOf course. My apologies,\u201d Alex said as he dropped his hand.</p><p>Claire\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking. I have to see my sister.\u201d</p><p>The glass doors swung open again. Skye glanced back and saw Trace striding determinedly toward them.</p><p>Of course, he walked as if he owned the place.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Yet.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s a party,\u201d Alex muttered.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Trace said, obviously catching the detective\u2019s comment. \u201cI think you were about to escort us to the ME\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Alex leaned toward Trace. \u201cIt\u2019s better, but she\u2019s not...she\u2019s not exactly show ready yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBut I have to know for myself. I have to see...that it wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s head jerked up. Alex\u2019s gaze snapped to instant attention. \u201cHim?\u201d Alex repeated.</p><p>Trace stepped toward Claire. Unlike Alex, he didn\u2019t make the mistake of touching the other woman. \u201cClaire,\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was low, soothing. \u201cEthan Harrison is still locked up. He had nothing to do with your sister\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Trace knows about her past.</p><p>And he also knew to treat Claire very carefully. He glanced over at Alex. \u201cShe just needs to see Sara\u2019s face. Give her that.\u201d</p><p>Alex nodded, but then he said, \u201cYou tell me what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Trace murmured.</p><p>Alex waved toward Skye and Claire. \u201cYou two wait in the conference room, and we\u2019ll get things ready.\u201d</p><p>The conference room door closed with a faint click. Skye sat down at the narrow table. Claire didn\u2019t. Claire wrapped her arms around her stomach and stood near the right wall.</p><p>Skye reached for the coffee pot that someone had conveniently set up for them. \u201cLet me get you a cup of coffee. It might make you feel a little better.\u201d Right. Like coffee would fix what was wrong with Claire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not asking about Ethan.\u201d The words were sharp, accusing.</p><p>Skye shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIs it because you already know? Did Trace tell you? Do you know all about my breakdown?\u201d</p><p>At that, Skye flinched. \u201cNo,\u201d she said softly and she put the coffee aside. Definitely won\u2019t help. \u201cI don\u2019t, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must think I\u2019m so weak.\u201d Claire swiped at her tears. \u201cYou survived. I read your story\u2014he had you for days. You made it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe each have our own hell.\u201d Skye was coming to realize that statement was true more and more each day.</p><p>Claire rocked back on her heels. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known you\u2019d be showing up, Weston,\u201d Alex muttered. \u201cWhere Skye goes, you follow.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d just left the main PD building and were taking the stairs that led to the ME\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI need to see the other bodies,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Alex glanced back at him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just going to give you access to them because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause after what happened to Sara, you have to know that I\u2019m not the killer. She was still warm when we got there.\u201d Trace had touched her skin. He\u2019d hoped that maybe\u2014</p><p>Too much blood.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her, but that doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t take out the others. And maybe you just sent someone else to kill Sara. After all, she blew your alibi to hell and back and you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing me the bodies won\u2019t make me any less or more guilty. But maybe... maybe I\u2019ll be able to see something,\u201d Trace said, his words rolling over Alex\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d Alex parroted as he squared off with Trace. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have an ME for. To find that \u2018something\u2019 left behind by the killer.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to grab the detective and toss him against the nearest wall. \u201cListen. The killer is playing a game with me. You\u2019ve got to see that. He might\u2019ve left a message for me in the damn kills themselves. Just let me see the bodies, okay? I won\u2019t touch anything. You can stand there the whole time and watch me.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cOne condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trace snapped.</p><p>\u201cSave me some time. I can go and dig into Claire\u2019s past and find out who this Ethan Harrison is, or you can tell me now.\u201d</p><p>Trace raised a brow. \u201cSo I\u2019m doing your detective work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a dick. You already did the work, tell me\u2014and we both know I\u2019m going to research later to make sure you\u2019re not just blowing smoke up my ass.\u201d</p><p>Fine. \u201cEthan Harrison is Claire\u2019s ex-boyfriend. She met him when she was a junior in high school...\u201d</p><p>So young to meet such evil.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of money growing up.\u201d Claire\u2019s blue gaze seemed focused on the past. \u201cBut that never seemed to matter. So my clothes weren\u2019t new. So I didn\u2019t go on big vacations. My family was happy. I was happy, and then I-I met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the most handsome boy I\u2019d ever seen. The first time he smiled at me, I swear, I felt that smile go straight through me.\u201d</p><p>Skye knew exactly what Claire meant. She felt that way when she got Trace\u2019s rare smiles.</p><p>\u201cI worked at a diner in town, and he came in there one day. Everyone was whispering about him. His dad was a senator, and Ethan...he drove this cherry-red convertible. All the other girls wanted to ride with him.\u201d Her voice dropped. \u201cThey wanted to do everything with him, but Ethan seemed to only want me.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the pain in the other woman\u2019s voice, Skye hurt for her.</p><p>Claire\u2019s lashes lowered as she stared at the floor. \u201cI hadn\u2019t dated before Ethan. I was nervous and scared, but he seemed so patient with me. He sent me flowers. Waited for me after work. He seemed so perfect.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to realize that perfect was just a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months after Sara came to work for me, she told me about her sister.\u201d Trace remembered the way Sara had approached him. She\u2019d been so hesitant. So protective.</p><p>\u201cClaire had a boyfriend when she was a teen. He was charming to Claire and her family, at first, but the deeper the relationship went, the more his real side started to show.\u201d</p><p>Alex cursed. \u201cLet me guess, that real side was ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Claire was late for a date, he thought she was cheating on him. He started by yelling at her, threatening her, and then...he hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d Trace heard the fury humming in the one snarled word.</p><p>Trace nodded. Yes, Ethan Harrison was one sick bastard. \u201cClaire was scared. She broke things off with him. Her parents sent her out of town because they wanted her away from the guy.\u201d Trace\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cHe had connections, you see. To an Alabama senator. That was his old man, and the punk was used to getting authorities to look the other way whenever he got a little rough with his girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>Red stained Alex\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBut something was different this time. Ethan didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer. Not when it came to Claire. He went to see Claire\u2019s parents, and when they wouldn\u2019t tell him where she was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed them,\u201d Claire whispered. \u201cOne shot to the head each. First my mother. Then my father. Th-the police said that based on the blood...they were probably kneeling. He made them kneel, right in front of him, then he shot them.\u201d</p><p>Skye jumped from her chair and hurried to Claire. She opened her arms, then stopped.</p><p>I don\u2019t like to be touched.</p><p>\u201cHe found me,\u201d Claire said, still staring into her past. \u201cRight after that. I think he must have searched the house until he found a note that I\u2019d sent to them. He came looking for me at the cabin. He had the gun with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know they were dead when he arrived. I\u2019d been trying to reach them, but no one answered my calls. He was walking toward me on the dock.\u201d She gave a sad shake of her head. \u201cIt was an old, rickety dock at my grandfather\u2019s fishing cabin. Ethan\u2019s convertible stood out there like a sore thumb. But he didn\u2019t care who saw him. He didn\u2019t care what anyone said. He was coming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t get you,\u201d Skye said, her voice hard. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Claire blinked. She seemed to see Skye once more. \u201cHe did get me that day. He found me on the dock. He put the gun to my head. He made me get on my knees.\u201d</p><p>Dear God.</p><p>\u201cAnd he pulled the trigger. He laughed when I screamed and he told me that he\u2019d already used those bullets.\u201d</p><p>On Claire\u2019s parents.</p><p>\u201cHe told me that I could be his or I could be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe senator couldn\u2019t cover up two dead bodies. The cops started a manhunt, and they found Ethan two days later\u2014he was in the woods with Claire.\u201d</p><p>Trace could still see Sara in his mind. She\u2019d stood in front of his desk, her voice soft, emotionless, as she\u2019d told him this tale.</p><p>\u201cA sniper shot Ethan in the leg. The cops got Claire away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe leg?\u201d Alex\u2019s eyes turned to slits. \u201cHe should\u2019ve aimed higher.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he should have. But the senator had been standing behind the sniper, and it had been his call.</p><p>\u201cThey took Ethan in and that\u2019s when the SOB got real creative. His daddy got him the best lawyers he could, and they claimed that Claire was the mastermind. That she was the one who\u2019d seduced Ethan and pressured him into killing her parents. He was just an innocent boy who\u2019d been led astray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the jury didn\u2019t buy that bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire tried to kill herself during the trial.\u201d</p><p>Alex tensed.</p><p>\u201cShe was admitted to a psychiatric ward, and she stayed there for five months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSonofa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jury didn\u2019t buy his story. They found Ethan Harrison guilty of both murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope they scheduled him an appointment with the needle or shoved his ass in the electric chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe judge gave him two concurrent life sentences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2014the asshole could be out in fifteen years, provided he has good behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was almost out three years ago,\u201d Trace said. Sara\u2019s image was crisp in his mind. I know I don\u2019t have the right to ask, but I need help. And I swear, I\u2019ll work off the money. I will. \u201cHis daddy was still throwing his money around, and he hired new lawyers. An appeal was going up before the court.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m guessin\u2019 this is where you come in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara thought it was a matter of money. Convincing the right people that Ethan Harrison needed to stay in jail. But, of course, bribery is against the law. You know that well, Detective.\u201d</p><p>Alex held his gaze. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about power. And we both know you have too damn much of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople believed him when Ethan said I told him to kill my parents. I could see it...people who\u2019d known me for my entire life were suddenly doubting me. Strangers called me a whore. Men on the street shouted that I should die. So...I thought maybe I should.\u201d Claire glanced down at her wrist. Skye saw the faint, white line there. \u201cI\u2019d almost bled out by the time Sara found me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so glad Claire didn\u2019t see Sara covered in all of that blood.</p><p>\u201cI got better,\u201d Claire said with grim pride. Then she whispered, \u201cBut the nightmares never stopped.\u201d</p><p>They were about two feet apart. Claire was a few inches taller than Skye. A little younger. But, on the inside, Skye felt as if they were the same.</p><p>\u201cI have nightmares, too.\u201d Skye said. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019re memories. Other times, they twist. They become something else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when I wake up each day, those nightmares fade away.\u201d That was the way it had been when her parents died, and that was the way it happened for her now. \u201cBecause nightmares can\u2019t hurt us. We\u2019re alive. We\u2019re getting through this world, one step at a time, and it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else says or what anyone else calls us.\u201d Skye willed Claire to believe what she was saying. \u201cAll that matters is that we know...we\u2019re survivors.\u201d</p><p>Claire rubbed at her eyes, obviously trying to stop the tears. \u201cHe almost got out a few years back. On some kind of-of technicality.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cBut Sara fixed that for me. She had connections, see. She used them. They sent him back. She told me that Ethan would never hurt me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was protecting you. Sara sounds like one incredible sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. I just-I wish I could\u2019ve protected her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your deal, Weston?\u201d Alex demanded. He jabbed his index finger into Trace\u2019s chest. \u201cYou know I want to hate you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Trace replied, \u201cI got that clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twisted. I can feel it in you. I know because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when you look at me, you see the same darkness that stares back at you from the mirror each day?\u201d</p><p>Alex clamped his lips together and yanked his hand back. He stomped down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDammit to hell.\u201d Alex\u2019s growl.</p><p>Trace lifted a brow that the detective couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Alex snapped. \u201cYou can see the other two bodies, but you so much as touch them, and I\u2019ll have you in a cage.\u201d He threw a glare over his shoulder. \u201cUnderstand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Trace told him.</p> <p>More red heated Alex\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd that \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019\u2014it was actually for me not going straight to the DA and demanding that your ass get yanked to traffic duty after that little stunt you pulled with the search warrant.\u201d As if Trace had forgotten about that incident. He took his time heading down the hall. \u201cYou were right when you said I had plenty of power. Remember that the next time you feel the urge to get...overzealous with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door...\u201d Alex huffed out the words, \u201cis to the damn left.\u201d</p><p>Trace inclined his head. Then he opened the door. Inside, the temperature was a good five degrees cooler, and the room smelled of bleach.</p><p>And death.</p><p>A tall, curvy redhead appeared. She pushed her glasses higher on her nose and frowned at Trace. \u201cCan I help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Dulane,\u201d Alex said as he followed Trace inside, \u201cwe need to see the three stabbing victims.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Dulane shook her head. \u201cBut I was just finishing some work on the female\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara,\u201d Trace forced the name out. \u201cHer name is Sara Kramer.\u201d</p><p>Sympathy flashed over Dr. Dulane\u2019s face. \u201cAre you family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Alex added, \u201cHer family\u2019s outside. Her sister needs to see the body. Get her...presentable, would you, doc? Face only. The woman out there needs some closure.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Dulane pulled on a pair of latex gloves. \u201cSeeing the dead here never gives them closure.\u201d She inclined her head. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d Her gaze flashed back to Trace. \u201cCome with me, and I\u2019ll show you the others.\u201d</p><p>She led them into the back.</p><p>When Trace saw Sara, he stumbled to a stop. Her body was drained of color now. Her hair spread behind her. The blood had been washed away. She looked\u2014</p><p>Broken.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, Sara. I will find him. I will make him pay for what he did.</p><p>Trace jerked his gaze off her, and he found Alex staring straight at him. \u201cWatching my reaction?\u201d Trace growled at him.</p><p>\u201cYour reactions are always off, unless Skye is close. That\u2019s the only time you ever seem even half-way normal.\u201d</p><p>Well, when he was with her, those were the only times he felt normal, too. Alive. Instead of feeling as if he were just going through the motions. Mimicking everyone else around him.</p><p>\u201cHer attacker drove a blade into her heart,\u201d Dr. Dulane said. \u201cBased on the size of her injury, I think it was the same type of blade used on the other two victims. But this time...there were defensive wounds.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back the sheet and pointed to Sara\u2019s wrists. \u201cThe bruising is coming through. It looks like he had to restrain her.\u201d</p><p>Take care of my sister. \u201cSara had something to fight for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she get the perp\u2019s DNA?\u201d Alex asked. \u201cTell me you found it under her fingernails.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Dulane shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThere were no signs of forced entry at Ms. Kramer\u2019s house,\u201d Alex said. \u201cAnd she was...dressed provocatively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was sleeping with the man who killed her.\u201d Trace had already figured that part out himself.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t sleep with him the day she died. There was no sperm,\u201d Dr. Dulane said with a shake of her head. \u201cNo sign of any sexual penetration.\u201d</p><p>So the guy hadn\u2019t fucked her before he killed her. Was that supposed to be some kind of mercy act?</p><p>Trace wanted to destroy the bastard.</p><p>\u201cShow us the other bodies,\u201d Alex directed.</p><p>Dr. Dulane headed toward a wall of vaults. She bent. Swung open one door, and pulled out a slab. A black body bag filled the space. The hiss of the zipper seemed too loud as Dr. Dulane revealed the body.</p><p>Sharpe\u2019s body was ghost-white. His eyes were closed. His muscles tight and frozen in death.</p><p>\u201cA two-sided blade went into his chest here,\u201d Dr. Dulane said, tapping her gloved fingers near the wound. \u201cThe assailant knew exactly what he was doing. The attack was dead-on.\u201d</p><p>Trace had already reviewed the report, so he knew about the type of blade used.</p><p>Tucker had always carried a two sided weapon. Always. \u201cThere were no signs of struggle?\u201d Trace asked. There had to be something there. If the killer had left Trace\u2019s dog tags with Parker, then some sort of message had been left with Sharpe.</p><p>Trace just had to find the message.</p><p>\u201cNone. The fact that Mr. Sharpe didn\u2019t have time to struggle is a good thing. It meant he probably didn\u2019t have long to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve wanted to fight.\u201d Dying easily hadn\u2019t been Ben Sharpe\u2019s style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned. You have an idea who the killer is, don\u2019t you?\u201d Alex suddenly demanded.</p><p>Trace looked over his shoulder at the detective. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze called Trace a liar.</p><p>\u201cNothing else was found with the body?\u201d Trace asked. He had to be missing something.</p><p>But then his gaze fell on Sharpe\u2019s throat. On the wound there. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Alex pressed closer. \u201cYeah, getting your throat sliced open is wrong and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean the wound looks wrong.\u201d His stare flashed to Dr. Dulane. \u201cI need to see Parker\u2019s body. Now.\u201d</p><p>She opened the next vault. A burst of cold air drifted out, rising as the body bag appeared.</p><p>The zipper hissed down. Trace leaned forward, studying the knife wound at Parker\u2019s throat. Parker\u2019s throat had been sliced clean, from ear to ear.</p><p>But with Sharpe...</p><p>\u201cThe wound stopped half-way across.\u201d He could see the jagged V where the knife had lifted out of Ben Sharpe\u2019s throat for an instant. \u201cThen the killer finished the job.\u201d</p><p>Not a defensive wound.</p><p>A hesitation?</p><p>Why? The kill had already been complete by that point.</p><p>Then, understanding came. You didn\u2019t want to cut his throat.</p><p>He whirled around and rushed back to Sara\u2019s body. He stared at her throat and saw that same V notch on the skin. Just a jagged tear, but Trace knew exactly what he was staring at. You didn\u2019t want to cut her throat, either. But you did.</p><p>\u201cThe killer hesitated with her, too,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>\u201cI-I made note of the injury pattern in the file,\u201d Dr. Dulane said, sounding a bit offended. \u201cI measured the wound and included that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say the killer hesitated,\u201d Alex snapped.</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t know that for sure! Maybe the blade slipped. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he hesitate with Parker?\u201d Alex asked, focusing on Trace.</p><p>Trace knew the answer, and that made this dangerous game even more complicated. \u201cBecause he thought Parker deserved to die.\u201d</p><p>And if that were truly the case, then it meant that the killer had been watching him\u2014and Skye\u2014very closely.</p><p>For a long time.</p><p>You know about our pasts. And you\u2019re using them against us.</p><p>Claire edged carefully into the morgue. Skye was at her side. Skye had only been in a morgue once before. When she\u2019d gone to identify the bodies of her parents.</p><p>The smell was the same. The cold chill\u2014one that reminded her of death\u2014it was the same, too.</p><p>A redhead in a white lab coat stood near the door. \u201cMs. Kramer?\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded.</p><p>Alex appeared beside the redhead. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Claire shuffled forward. Skye hesitated. This was private. She shouldn\u2019t go in.</p><p>But Claire turned toward her. \u201cCome with me?\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. She entered the viewing room with her chin up.</p><p>Sara was on the table. Her body was covered with a sheet, all the way up to the top of her neck. Only her face was visible. Her face was perfect. No wounds. No pain.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him,\u201d Claire whispered. \u201cH-he always shoots in the head. It wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>Then Claire grabbed Skye and held onto her tightly.</p><p>Skye stared over Claire\u2019s shoulder. Her gaze locked with Trace\u2019s. He\u2019d been there, watching them all along. His eyes glinted.</p><p>No, a monster from Claire\u2019s past hadn\u2019t committed this crime.</p><p>Sara had just gotten caught in someone else\u2019s battle.</p><p>Who else did the killer plan to hurt?</p><p>Drake Archer drained the whiskey and slammed the glass on the bar. The liquid barely burned as it slid down his throat.</p><p>Once, he\u2019d turned to drinks too much. To try and shut up the ghosts in his head. But then he\u2019d realized that the booze didn\u2019t stop the voices.</p><p>The alcohol just made them louder.</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d The bartender asked.</p><p>Drake shook his head and tossed some cash onto the bar. He rose, aware of the looks that were tossed his way. He\u2019d come to the darkest, roughest bar he could find. He liked places like this dive. Places that often let him fight and push out some of the wildness that lived within him. Places that reminded him of exactly where he\u2019d come from.</p><p>But there were no fights to be found tonight. The others eased away from him as he headed toward the door.</p><p>Darkness waited outside for him. Drake rolled back his shoulders and stalked down the street.</p><p>He\u2019d been in a thousand towns. Walking. Fighting. Fucking. They all blurred together during the night, and when dawn came...</p><p>I\u2019m always alone.</p><p>He turned off the main strip. The sounds were muted now. The horns distant. The growl of car engines barely discernible.</p><p>He\u2019d rented a place close by. Coming to the city had been a mistake. But when Noah had called him...</p><p>Noah and Trace were the only friends I ever had.</p><p>Friends, enemies. Same damn thing some days.</p><p>He halted and heard the faint rustle of a footstep behind him.</p><p>Such a soft sound. One that he could\u2019ve imagined but\u2014</p><p>In instant, he\u2019d yanked out the knife that he kept tucked in his boot. Ben Sharpe had been the one to get him hooked on that particular habit.</p><p>Drake whirled around. \u201cWho in the hell is there? Show yourself!\u201d</p><p>But only an empty street stared back at him. An empty street, and the ghosts in his head.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with me,\u201d Trace said, his voice and eyes tense as he gazed down at Skye.</p><p>They\u2019d just dropped Claire off at the studio. Skye had made sure that Claire was settled in the upstairs apartment. She\u2019d hated to leave Claire, but she\u2019d realized that the other woman needed time alone.</p><p>Sometimes, you needed to grieve in private.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Skye asked him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTexas.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at that terse response. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where Tucker grew up. I need to take another look at that town, at the people there. I could send some more agents but...it\u2019s personal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI-I have my studio. Classes will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Sunday. You don\u2019t have any classes scheduled then, and we\u2019ll be back Sunday night.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cPlease, Skye. I don\u2019t want to leave you here while I\u2019m gone. I need you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese will keep watch on her. Hell, I\u2019ll call Noah, too. They\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>His breath expelled in a fast rush. \u201cThank you, baby.\u201d His fingers slid up to cup her chin. \u201cI need you close right now. I think about what happened to Sara\u2014that can\u2019t happen to you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a quick kiss to his lips. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t happen to you.\u201d Her vow.</p><p>The plane rose higher and higher into the air. Trace kept his gaze locked on Skye as they ascended.</p><p>Her eyes were currently squeezed tightly closed. Skye hated flying.</p><p>The light flashed indicating that he could unbuckle his seatbelt. He did, then slid forward and pressed a quick kiss to her lips.</p><p>Skye\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cTrace\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her again. Her lips had parted, and he was able to easily slide his tongue right into her mouth. \u201cDo you remember the first time we made love on this plane?\u201d</p><p>She gave a little gasp at that question, and he drank it up greedily.</p><p>Then his mouth moved down to her neck. He knew she liked it when he licked her there. \u201cYou surprised the hell out of me then. And I\u2019ve been wanting to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>Lucky for him, she was wearing a skirt. He pulled up the loose fabric of her skirt, edging higher and higher. And her thigh highs. Fuck, yes. His fingers slid up her thighs and found the silk of her panties. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said.</p><p>She arched against him.</p><p>\u201cI get to give you pleasure,\u201d he told her, \u201cand I get to make you forget all about your fear.\u201d His fingers slid under the edge of her panties. He found her sweet flesh\u2014warm and wet. He stroked her, loving the way her breath caught in her throat, and she tipped her hips toward him.</p><p>Skye\u2019s response always made him hot.</p> <p>Made him want to take her endlessly.</p><p>He pulled her panties down. Thrust his index finger into her.</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be afraid. I don\u2019t want you to feel anything but pleasure.\u201d Because he hated it when her green eyes shone with fear.</p><p>He pushed a second finger into her. Her teeth sank into her lower lip. His thumb began to massage her clit, rotating in slow circles.</p><p>He licked her throat again. Bit her lightly.</p><p>Withdrew his fingers. Thrust. Again.</p><p>Worked her clit.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d</p><p>Her body was tight against him. So damn tight. He loved it. He wanted nothing more than to drive into her as deeply as he could go.</p><p>And that was why he didn\u2019t.</p><p>This is just for Skye. She needed to know that he could put her first.</p><p>She came with a gasp. Her inner muscles clenched around his fingers as she rode out her orgasm. So beautiful.</p><p>So perfect.</p><p>His Skye.</p><p>He held her while she shuddered. Then he slowly withdrew his fingers. Positioned her skirt once more.</p><p>Kissed her soft lips again.</p><p>Her hand grabbed his forearm. \u201cTrace, you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a selfish bastard most days. Hell, we both know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, with certainty, \u201cyou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>But Trace knew the truth. \u201cI am with you. I see you, and all I want to do is take.\u201d His heart raced in his chest. \u201cSo this time, this once, just let me give.\u201d He had to look away from her because while he was talking a good game...</p><p>I want in her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know how I see you?\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded.</p><p>\u201cI see a man who is sexy as sin. He\u2019s strong and he\u2019s powerful, and sometimes, he drives me absolutely crazy because he tries to control everything.\u201d</p><p>Trace winced.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s the man who\u2019s saved me\u2014twice\u2014in my life. He was the first man to give me flowers. The only man to ask me to marry him. He\u2019s the man right there beside me when my nightmares come to haunt me.\u201d</p><p>She was the only woman he\u2019d ever dreamed about.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t talk about him as if he\u2019s a selfish SOB. I can do that,\u201d Skye said, her voice rough. \u201cBut no one else gets to say a word about him, got it? No one, not even you.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. His gaze came back to her. The lust was still there, always there, but so was something else. \u201cI love you, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Weston was out hunting. The guy thought he was such a security expert. That he could catch any criminal. That he could save the day.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t going to be anything left for him to save this time.</p><p>Weston\u2019s empire would crumble. So would he.</p><p>One loss, for another.</p><p>The killer gazed across the street and up at the lights that burned on the second level of Skye Sullivan\u2019s dance studio.</p><p>Sara Kramer\u2019s sister was there. He knew that.</p><p>Just as he knew everything.</p><p>Did the sister know about him? Sara and Claire had been so close, and they\u2019d talked frequently. When the grief eased, would Claire remember some half-forgotten conversation?</p><p>Will she remember me?</p><p>It was a chance he couldn\u2019t take. Claire shouldn\u2019t have come to town. Sara hadn\u2019t told him about her sister\u2019s arrival.</p><p>If she had, he would\u2019ve planned his attack better.</p><p>Too late for regrets.</p><p>Claire was in the game now.</p><p>Until death.</p><p>The plane touched down on the runway. A small, narrow patch of concrete in the middle of Piedmont, Texas.</p><p>The town was a dot on the map. Tucker had talked often of the place. He\u2019d said that it let him breathe. That he could see for miles and miles there.</p><p>That the place made him feel free.</p><p>Trace walked away from the plane, his hand locked with Skye\u2019s. He\u2019d come to this town because he needed to see one person. A phone call wouldn\u2019t have done the job.</p><p>The light of dawn rose on the horizon. Trace climbed into the rental vehicle that waited. Arranging for the SUV had been easy enough.</p><p>The meeting that was coming?</p><p>Not so damn easy.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a plan,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>He did.</p><p>\u201cWant to share it with me?\u201d</p><p>He drove away from the little landing strip. He\u2019d been in Piedmont twice before. Once with Tucker.</p><p>Once when he\u2019d come to bury Tucker. Only...Tucker hadn\u2019t been in that empty grave. It had just been a ceremony. A headstone with no casket in the ground.</p><p>\u201cTucker\u2019s father still lives in the area. I have some more questions for him.\u201d Because if Tucker truly had somehow made it out of that frozen hell, he would\u2019ve come home. Tucker had been so close to his father.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell his father you were coming?\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t exactly like me, Skye. The man blames me for his son\u2019s death.\u201d His fingers tightened around the wheel. \u201cWith damn good reason.\u201d But Quint Hawk just thought Trace hadn\u2019t done a good enough job of covering Tucker\u2019s ass on the mission.</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize that Trace had been the one to fire the shot that ended Tucker\u2019s life.</p><p>They rode in silence. The miles drifted past. They turned off the pavement and fish-tailed down a long, dusty dirt road. The road ended in front of a ranch house. Two dogs ran out to meet them, barking excitedly.</p><p>Trace killed the engine. Stared at that house. Tucker had grown up there. Laughed and lived.</p><p>The front door opened. Quint appeared, holding tight to his cane.</p><p>Trace climbed from the SUV. He hurried around to Skye\u2019s side, but she\u2019d already slipped out.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Quint demanded. \u201cAnd what are you doin\u2019 on my property so damn early?\u201d</p><p>Bracing his shoulders, Trace advanced. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Mr. Hawk.\u201d He took a few more steps. The dogs bounced around him, their tongues hanging out as they panted. \u201cTrace Weston.\u201d</p><p>Quint shuffled forward. Tap. Tap. His cane hit the wooden floor of the porch. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 back here?\u201d His eyes narrowed as he glanced over Trace\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd who\u2019s she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my fianc\u00e9,\u201d Trace said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here because I need to ask you a few more questions about Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to say.\u201d Quint pointed a bony finger at Trace. \u201cNow load up your pretty girl and get the hell off my property.\u201d</p><p>Right. That was the reception he\u2019d expected and why he hadn\u2019t just called. \u201cI can\u2019t leave. No, I won\u2019t leave.\u201d Trace strode toward the house. \u201cNot until we talk. I know you blame me for Tucker\u2019s death. And you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a fianc\u00e9, too,\u201d Quint suddenly said, cocking his head. \u201cI got his last letter to me. A week after I buried him, I got that letter.\u201d</p><p>Trace tensed. He looked over his shoulder and saw that Skye had come closer to him. Then he focused on Quint. \u201cDo you have that letter, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I have left of him.\u201d Quint\u2019s hold on his cane tightened. \u201cWhen I got it, I thought\u2014them bastards were wrong. My boy\u2019s alive.\u201d He stared down at the porch. \u201cThen I realized...he\u2019d just sent it to me before he died. Mail is so slow...so slow...but for a moment there. A moment...I had my boy back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019d really like to see that letter.\u201d A fianc\u00e9? Tucker had never said that he and Anna Jean were getting married.</p><p>\u201cHe did some bad things.\u201d Now Quint\u2019s shoulders stooped. \u201cI know that now.\u201d His gaze found Trace\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s what killed him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cTucker was a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, he was.\u201d His knuckles whitened around the cane. \u201cIf I let you see the letter, I never want you comin\u2019 back, understand? You...\u201d His voice thickened. \u201cYou remind me too much of what I lost.\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d Beside him, Skye was silent.</p><p>Quint disappeared into the house. Tap. Tap.</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t follow him.</p><p>\u201cDid you know about his engagement?\u201d Skye asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you...do you think there were some other things that you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Tap. Tap.</p><p>Quint pushed open the door. Crept onto the porch. His fingers were shaking as he handed Trace an envelope. \u201cTake it, then burn it.\u201d</p><p>Trace frowned. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was better off not gettin\u2019 that note.\u201d Quint leveled a hard stare at Trace. \u201cAnd, son, you\u2019re better off not readin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Quint turned away. Stopped. His back was to Trace as he said, \u201cMy debt is paid to you, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never owed me a debt.\u201d Trace carefully held that envelope.</p><p>\u201cI was losin\u2019 this place. The bank was gonna take it from me. Then...one day...I come out here to see the deed in my mail box. Paid in full.\u201d Tap. \u201cI know what you had to do to my son. But you don\u2019t owe me anymore. And I don\u2019t owe you. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>The door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>He knows.</p><p>Trace jerked his head toward the SUV. The dogs were still barking like crazy. \u201cLet\u2019s get back inside.\u201d</p><p>After Trace shut the passenger-side door behind Skye, he walked back around the vehicle. He paused in front of the SUV. The sun was rising. He glanced at the old, wooden fence on the right. For an instant, he could imagine Tucker there. Laughing.</p><p>Then the image of Tucker was gone.</p><p>Trace climbed back into the SUV and slammed the door behind him. He stared down at the old envelope. The handwriting had faded some but he still easily recognized it as Tucker\u2019s writing. The stamp had torn, but he could make out the post date\u2014a week before Tucker had died.</p><p>He opened the envelope. Pulled out the paper. He could feel Skye\u2019s eyes on him, but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Trace unfolded the paper.</p><p>Dad,</p><p>I know I don\u2019t write enough, and I\u2019m sorry about that. I think about you. About mom. I still miss her so much.</p><p>I\u2019m in love. I always wanted to find someone to love the way that you loved mom. So completely.</p><p>We\u2019re going to get married. We have plans to start a new life, just me and my Anna Jean. But we have a job to do first. And it\u2019s a job that I hate.</p><p>I always tried to do the right thing. But doing right doesn\u2019t always give you the reward you need. Anna Jean has a deal set up for us. It\u2019s a one-time shot. We do this, and there are no more battles. No more crawling on my belly through the mud or the snow or the blood.</p><p>I\u2019ll be free.</p><p>There\u2019s a price to pay for freedom. I\u2019m not proud of what I\u2019m doing, but I want to give Anna Jean the life she deserves.</p><p>I won\u2019t be coming back. With what we\u2019ve planned, I can\u2019t.</p><p>You were a good father.</p><p>I wish I\u2019d been a better son.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch,\u201d Trace whispered. His head lifted. He turned and met Skye\u2019s worried stare. \u201cHe was in on it. Tucker was working with Anna Jean. He betrayed us all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire Kramer tip-toed down the stairs, her bag clutched tightly in her right hand. She didn\u2019t head into the main studio. She already felt like more than enough of an intruder in that place.</p><p>Her fingers slid over the knob at the back door. She opened it and eased outside as the alarm gave a reassuring beep. She took two steps\u2014</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere, Ms. Kramer?\u201d</p> <p>Claire screamed\u2014and then she threw her bag at the tall, dangerous looking man who had been waiting for her.</p><p>The bag bounced off his shoulder, and Claire tried to yank open the door and rush back inside. But his palm flattened against the door, and his body slid behind hers. \u201cEasy.\u201d He wasn\u2019t touching her, but he surrounded her. Too big and muscled. Fear and fury battled within her.</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting for me.</p><p>Claire sucked in a deep breath. Then she attacked. Her elbow slammed into his solar plexus even as her fist flew up in a backhanded snap move. Her knuckles should\u2019ve collided with his nose, giving a nice, satisfying crunch as the cartilage broke on impact.</p><p>But he caught her hand.</p> <p>Claire stomped down with her left foot. He grunted.</p><p>That\u2019s right. I\u2019m not easy prey. Not anymore. She\u2019d spent years learning how to protect herself.</p><p>Claire spun around now, yanking her wrist free of his grip. She had keys in her left hand, and she brought them up, ready to shove those keys right into his eye\u2014</p><p>He caught that hand, too. He didn\u2019t hurt her. He just held her, his strength undeniable. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d he said, flashing a golden eyed stare at her. She planned to seriously damage those golden eyes. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m a little bit better.\u201d</p><p>Those words infuriated her. He dared to taunt her? Hell, no.</p><p>Not again. Not again. The words rang in her head. They were Claire\u2019s vow to herself. She\u2019d never be a victim again. She wouldn\u2019t be hurt.</p> <p>He would.</p><p>Claire jerked up her knee, intending to hit him in the groin as hard as she could.</p><p>He pushed her back, flattening her against the door. A strong, muscular thigh pushed between her legs. \u201cI think you need to settle down before someone gets hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>She head-butted him.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>His lip was bleeding.</p><p>Claire gave him a grim smile. \u201cLooks like someone just got hurt. And guess what? More pain is coming.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, freeing her and swiping at his bleeding lip. \u201cYou?\u201d He tossed that out as if he were shocked. She\u2019d shock him again with a punch to the face if he so much as inched toward her again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the grief-stricken sister that I\u2019m supposed to be watching? I thought you needed a guard. No one told me you were so...\u201d He waved his hand and drops of his blood fell on the pavement. \u201cViolent,\u201d he finished.</p><p>You needed a guard.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Claire asked him.</p><p>\u201cNoah. Noah York.\u201d One dark brow rose as his eyes swept over her. His eyes unnerved her. She\u2019d never met a man with golden eyes before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the enemy, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her spine snapped straight at that.</p><p>\u201cDelicate flower, my ass,\u201d Noah muttered. \u201cTrace has you pegged all wrong. You\u2019d think by now he\u2019d be smart enough not to get fooled by a pretty face.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and realized that she was choking back her fear. \u201cTrace sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He had to leave town. Took Skye with him. Because you know, he can\u2019t breathe without her or some shit.\u201d Then he muttered, \u201cLovesick idiot that he is.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was starting to slow down, but she didn\u2019t trust the stranger. Not yet. \u201cGive me proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m Noah York!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to mean something to me?\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped. That bottom lip of his\u2014a sexy lip, despite the blood dripping from it\u2014caught her attention.</p><p>Her gaze swept slowly over his face. The guy was handsome, and that put her on edge. She\u2019d learned how dangerous handsome, lying men could be. His cheek bones were high, his nose a sharp blade, and his jaw was perfectly square and hard.</p><p>Too perfect.</p><p>Not for me.</p><p>He stared at her a moment, gazing deeply into her eyes, then he smiled. A dimple flashed in his cheek.</p><p>Not. For. Me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI don\u2019t think the name should mean a thing to you.\u201d He rolled his shoulders. \u201cTell you what, I saw Reese parked in front of the building. I\u2019m guessing you met him already right? Trace\u2019s driver-slash-guard?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she remembered Reese.</p><p>\u201cHe can tell you that I\u2019m safe. Then maybe you\u2019ll stop trying to attack me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down the length of the building. They were in the narrow back alley. It would only take a few moments to race to the front of the building and check out the guy\u2019s story.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t move. \u201cWhy would Trace tell you both to guard me?\u201d Suspicion had her eyes returning to Noah.</p><p>\u201cI know, sounds like overkill, right? That\u2019s Trace.\u201d His smile invited her to smile back with him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>His smile slowly faded. \u201cI see it,\u201d he said and his voice was grim now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Claire instantly demanded.</p><p>\u201cYour pain, sweetheart. I see it in your eyes.\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d She\u2019d seen pity more than enough times in the eyes of people she met. Pity. Anger. Hate.</p><p>Been there, done all of that.</p><p>She usually got those stares from most people, sooner or later. Except Skye hadn\u2019t looked at her that way. Skye hadn\u2019t judged her.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he snapped right back at her. \u201cBecause you\u2019re getting it. I didn\u2019t know Sara, not personally, but I\u2019ve heard she was one hell of a woman. I\u2019m sorry the world lost someone like her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stung. \u201cR-Reese is around front?\u201d She needed to verify who this guy was and get away from him, no matter what. Her stomach was in knots. Her heart twisted, and each time she looked into those golden eyes, Claire just felt...off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d he said, his voice soft but deep. A rumble that got beneath her skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better that way, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not about to turn my back on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019m the one who has to show trust.\u201d</p><p>He marched ahead, moving easily through the narrow space.</p><p>She didn\u2019t follow, not at first. She let him get a few feet in front of her, then Claire scooped up her bag.</p><p>He rounded the corner and Claire quickly darted after him. Her gaze scanned the area. Sure enough, Reese was waiting by the studio\u2019s front door. He was leaning against his parked car.</p><p>When Reese saw them, he quickly straightened. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Reese demanded as he hurried toward Noah.</p><p>\u201cGuard duty,\u201d was the instant reply, \u201csame as you.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you bleeding, man?\u201d He advanced on Claire. \u201cAre you okay, Ms. Kramer? Were you attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was the one doing the attacking,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes widened, but he seemed to recover from his surprise quickly. \u201cGood, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Skye Sullivan.\u201d The voice\u2014a woman\u2019s smooth, cultured voice\u2014cut through Reese\u2019s words.</p><p>They glanced to the right and saw a redhead standing there. Her eyes were hidden by dark sunglasses, but her head was tilted toward them, and Claire could feel the weight of the woman\u2019s stare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Skye,\u201d the woman said, as if dismissing Claire instantly. \u201cI was told this was her studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye Sullivan\u2019s not here now,\u201d Reese said. \u201cSomething I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>The redhead laughed. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t help me at all. I\u2019ll come back for Skye.\u201d Then she turned. She had on shoes with three-inch heels. Claire wasn\u2019t even sure how the woman managed to walk in them.</p><p>Frowning, Claire looked away from the redhead. Her gaze focused on her real problem\u2014Noah.</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze was still on the other woman. His eyes were narrowed.</p><p>Right. Cue the lady in the tight skirt and low-cut shirt, and, of course, that guy would be all over her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s familiar,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The woman lifted her hand. A taxi jerked to a stop just two feet away from her.</p><p>\u201cThe nose is different...the lips are fuller. Hair\u2019s red, not blonde...\u201d It sounded like Noah was just muttering to himself.</p><p>Claire rubbed her temples. They were throbbing again.</p><p>\u201cMs. Kramer?\u201d Reese asked. \u201cWere you going somewhere?\u201d His eyes were on the bag that she still held.</p><p>\u201cA hotel,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cI just can\u2019t impose on Skye. I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all different,\u201d Noah snapped. Still talking to himself? \u201cBut the walk is the fucking same.\u201d</p><p>He pushed past them, his arm hitting Claire\u2019s as he raced toward the taxi. He reached the curb just as the taxi sped away. His fists flew into the air in impotent rage. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d Noah yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s not him. It\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was grim as he paced in front of Trace\u2019s desk. \u201cThe woman always had a walk of pure sin. That was how she first caught Tucker\u2019s eye. She changed her hair, got a nose job, injected her lower lip with collagen, but she didn\u2019t change her walk.\u201d</p><p>Trace stared at him. He\u2019d only been in town an hour when Noah had called and demanded this meeting. Noah had insisted they meet at Weston Securities, a private meeting\u2014just Noah, Trace, and Drake.</p><p>Trace had told him to screw that \u201cprivate\u201d plan. Skye was with him. She stood at his side as he faced the two men who\u2019d gone to hell with him.</p><p>I can\u2019t keep any more secrets from her. Because he knew that the secrets were the things that would drive her away from him.</p><p>With Skye, it was all or nothing. He was trying so hard to give her all he had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually telling us,\u201d Drake said, voice grating, \u201cthat Anna Jean isn\u2019t dead? You saw her today?\u201d</p><p>Noah rounded on him. \u201cYou tell me. I mean, you\u2019re the one who supposedly to kill her, right? But I got to thinking...you were sleeping with her. You admitted that. So maybe at that kill moment, you hesitated. Did you hesitate, Drake?\u201d</p><p>Drake glared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear a damn answer,\u201d Noah snarled. \u201cDid you kill her? Did you stab her in the heart? Or did you hesitate?\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in Drake\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cStop, Noah,\u201d Trace said wearily. \u201cI found out more about Tucker. You both need to know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Drake hissed.</p><p>The tension in the room kicked up about one hundred percent. Trace\u2019s hand dropped to his side. He focused totally on Drake. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed her heart.\u201d All of the color had bled from Drake\u2019s face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it. I know she was trying to kill me, but I hesitated, okay? I wounded her, but she wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died in Tucker\u2019s arm,\u201d Trace said. He\u2019d been sure...the way Tucker had reacted...</p><p>Drake closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve replayed those moments in my head a thousand times. I didn\u2019t remember hitting her heart with the blade. I didn\u2019t, but she still died, so I thought I was wrong. I thought I\u2019d imagined\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice vibrated with fury. \u201cThe bitch is strolling around Chicago, looking for Skye.\u201d</p><p>Skye jerked beside Trace. \u201cWhy would she be looking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because she wants to screw with your head,\u201d Noah fired out. \u201cShe likes playing mind games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr because she wants to kill you,\u201d Drake said.</p><p>Neither would happen on Trace\u2019s watch. \u201cYou got the name of the cab company?\u201d Noah had told him that he\u2019d missed the cab by seconds.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Noah replied instantly.</p><p>That was something. \u201cNow tell me that you got the cab number.\u201d</p><p>Noah rattled it off.</p><p>Trace picked up his phone. In two minutes, he had the manager of that cab company on the line. Thirty seconds later, Trace said, \u201cHe dropped her at the Navy Pier.\u201d</p><p>Noah headed for the door. \u201cLet\u2019s get her, let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a team,\u201d Trace said, working to keep his voice free of emotion. \u201cThey\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>Noah stiffened. He swung back around to stare incredulously at Trace. \u201cAre you kidding me? It\u2019s her. After all that\u2019s happened, you\u2019re just sending a team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Flat. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing because I\u2019ll be damned if I walk into some trap that she\u2019s setting.\u201d He pulled Tucker\u2019s letter from his pocket. \u201cTucker knew, okay? He knew what she was doing. He knew that she was setting us all up, and I\u2019m pretty sure he planned for the three of us\u2014\u201d His gaze hit on each man there. \u201cTo die during that last mission. Only we got lucky. We lived.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s eyelids flickered. \u201cHe...knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the letter says. He was finishing his job with Anna Jean, and they weren\u2019t coming back. They had a future all mapped out. They just didn\u2019t count on us fighting back so hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah looked shell-shocked. \u201cTucker? He was setting us up, too?\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded. Rage had twisted inside of Trace. He knew just how Noah felt.</p><p>Skye\u2019s fingers curled around his shoulder. Some of the fury eased.</p> <p>\u201cAnna Jean wasn\u2019t working alone then. I don\u2019t buy for an instant that she\u2019s working alone now.\u201d This was the part that sealed the deal for Trace. \u201cI saw the bodies at the morgue. Sharpe, Parker, and Sara. There were no hesitation wounds on Parker, but the killer paused when he was carving up Sharpe\u2019s throat and when he was slicing open Sara.\u201d</p><p>Noah cocked is head. \u201cHe paused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wounds were deep. Hard. Strong. Anna Jean is many things, but I don\u2019t think she could\u2019ve inflicted those wounds. The angles would\u2019ve been wrong. The depth of entry\u2014none of it matches up to her.\u201d Anna Jean had been all of five foot three and one hundred and twenty pounds.</p><p>\u201cThen Tucker\u2019s here, too,\u201d Drake said. He looked and sounded hollowed out. \u201cWe thought that we left them to die, but they\u2019ve come back to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge?\u201d Skye asked. \u201cIf that\u2019s what this is about, then why attack all the others? Why go after Sara?\u201d</p> <p>Trace told her the dark truth. He said, \u201cBecause lives don\u2019t matter to Anna Jean. They never did.\u201d She\u2019d been willing to use anyone or anything in order to get what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pawns in a chess game,\u201d Drake explained. \u201cShe\u2019s the queen on the board.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s hands slapped down on the surface of his desk. He fucking knew how to play chess. \u201cWe need to find her damn king.\u201d</p><p>And destroy him.</p><p>It was storming outside. Skye stared out at the pounding rain. Lightning lit up the sky.</p><p>Thunder roared.</p> <p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t at the Pier,\u201d Trace said as he came up behind her. The others had left. Noah had stormed away, no doubt headed out to search on his own. Drake had followed Noah out, but his steps had been much slower.</p><p>Was he in love with Anna Jean? There was just something about the way Drake looked each time her name was mentioned. Pain filled his eyes. Skye suspected that there was a whole lot more to Drake\u2019s connection to Anna Jean had he wanted to confess.</p><p>Trace\u2019s hands closed over her shoulders. \u201cMy men are talking with the vendors there. Someone had to see her. They\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Skye saw another flash of lightning. She waited for the thunder to rumble. \u201cHave you told me everything?\u201d</p><p>His fingers began to rub her shoulders. \u201cEverything that you need to know.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the answer she wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tense up on me like that,\u201d Trace said. \u201cBaby, you don\u2019t want to know about every battle. About every life that was lost or about how I felt when I had to pull the trigger each time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Skye told him. Didn\u2019t he understand yet? \u201cGood and bad. Everything in between.\u201d</p> <p>He bent his head. Because the office was lit and it was so dark outside, she could easily see their reflections in the glass. He surrounded her, so big and strong.</p><p>His lips brushed over her nape. \u201cI don\u2019t like for that world to touch you. The more you learn about me, the more you realize you\u2019re too good for me. That I shouldn\u2019t even be touching you.\u201d</p><p>He was wrong. \u201cI like it when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>His right hand slid down and curled around her stomach, pulling her back against him. She could feel his aroused length pressing against her.</p><p>\u201cThis nightmare is going to be over soon,\u201d he promised her as he pressed another kiss to her throat. \u201cNow we know we\u2019re looking for Anna Jean. She\u2019s not getting away. And we\u2019ll find her partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to hesitate.</p><p>And she caught that telling sign. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Tucker is alive, do you?\u201d</p><p>His head lifted, but his arm tightened around her. \u201cI\u2019m not like Drake.\u201d</p><p>Skye waited, her heart racing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hesitate at the last instant. I know my shot hit his heart.\u201d Trace shook his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get out of that frozen hell, but she did. She took the dog tags, and now she\u2019s got some other dumb SOB doing her dirty work.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down into the darkness of the city. \u201cSo her partner could be anyone.\u201d Any man that Skye passed on the street. Anyone she saw. Anywhere. Any time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running down leads right now. The guy made a mistake when he hacked into my phone system. I\u2019ve got my techs on it, retracing his steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that it\u2019s been years since that attack in Siberia. Why are they after you now? Why wait so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people can wait forever for the right vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Anna Jean...she and her partner want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>By hurting me.</p><p>He pressed another kiss to her nape.</p><p>A shiver slid over her. \u201cI would do anything to keep you safe. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His muscles locked. She felt the tenseness in his hold. \u201cI don\u2019t want you at risk, Skye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she came looking for me. In broad daylight.\u201d That just didn\u2019t sound like a woman who was trying to come in for a slow, sneaky kill.</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean is insane. You don\u2019t want to ever get close to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been close to other insane folks.\u201d Like my mother. \u201cI managed okay.\u201d</p><p>He turned her in his arms. His gaze searched hers. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think of you in danger. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His lips took hers.</p><p>She kissed him back eagerly, her lips opening beneath his. Trace lifted her up, carried her a few feet across the room. She felt the hard edge of the desk against her thighs. He sat her down there, right on top of his gleaming desk, and he slipped between her splayed legs.</p><p>\u201cI have you, and I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d One of his hands rested lightly against the column of her throat, right over her frantically racing pulse. \u201cI don\u2019t care which asshole from my past comes calling, no one will take you from me.\u201d</p><p>Just as she wasn\u2019t going to let anyone take Trace from her. Not when they finally had a chance together.</p><p>He lifted up her shirt. Tossed it across the room. His eyes were lit with a bright, burning fire. Lust. Need. The same need that pulsed through her veins.</p><p>His fingers brushed aside her bra. Her nipples were tight, aching, and when he bent his head and took one sensitive peak into his mouth, she arched against him.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>But he had on too many clothes. Way, way too many. Her fingers pushed between their bodies. She caught his belt. Yanked it aside. Jerked open his fly.</p><p>So her moves weren\u2019t as easy or seductive as his had been. Skye wasn\u2019t in the mood for easy.</p><p>\u201cTrace.\u201d His name came from her as a sensual demand. \u201cI want you. Now.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. His gaze met hers.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Skye said again. And, seeing that hot lust in his gaze, she told him, \u201cI want you to fuck me hard, Trace. No control. No limits.\u201d</p><p>His hands gripped the edge of the desk. \u201cSkye, baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything, Trace. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>What she\u2019d have.</p><p>Lightning flashed beyond the windows.</p><p>Skye kicked off her shoes. She slid off the desk, her body brushing against Trace\u2019s. Staring into his eyes, she stripped off the rest of her clothes. Her pants fell. Her panties\u2014she threw those at him.</p><p>He caught them in a tight fist. \u201cI never want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She stood before him, naked. \u201cThe first time I came to see you in this office, I was terrified.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed an even brighter blue. \u201cThe first time you came to see me, I wanted to strip you and fuck you on my desk.\u201d</p><p>Her hands tapped on said desk. \u201cRight here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A hard growl.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019re about to get your wish, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She smiled at him and she touched herself, letting her hands slide down her stomach. Down to\u2014</p><p>Trace grabbed her. He spun her around, turning her toward that desk. Her hands flew out and this time, her palms hit against the hard surface.</p><p>He was behind her. Fully erect, the head of his cock thrust toward her. She spread her legs. She arched against him.</p><p>He held her easily. Didn\u2019t enter her yet, damn him. Just let her feel him, all around her. \u201cIf I get too rough,\u201d he rasped out, \u201ctell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll scream it,\u201d she promised, her own breath panting.</p><p>His fingers stroked her. Pressed against her clit. Drove her insane.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d</p><p>He plunged into her, slamming balls deep. Yes! He withdrew. Plunged deep again. Harder. The thud of flesh hitting flesh seemed to fill the room. Again and again.</p><p>She was so wet for him. So eager.</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>Deeper, deeper. She pushed back against each thrust, trying to take as much of him as she could. Her orgasm beat down on her. Her muscles tightened. So close. Just right\u2014</p><p>\u201cAh, baby, you didn\u2019t think it would be that easy, did you?\u201d Trace whispered against her ear. He stilled.</p><p>Her sex clenched tightly around him, holding him in a desperate grip.</p><p>His mouth slid to her neck. He licked. He kissed.</p><p>His teeth pressed against her in a sensual bite. \u201cNow,\u201d he rasped against her skin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me everything.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew. She cried out. \u201cNo, Trace\u2014\u201d</p><p>In a flash, he had rolled Skye onto her back. The wood of the desk pressed into her. Her legs hung over the edge of the desk. Her legs were open, her sex desperate for him.</p><p>\u201cRemember...tell me...\u201d Trace gritted out.</p><p>That was all he said. Because as she stared up into his eyes, she could see his control break. The blue turned wild in its brilliance.</p><p>He thrust into her. Deep.</p><p>His hands caught hers. He locked them to the desk, holding them on either side of her. He held her, controlled her completely, and all Skye could do was take the pleasure that he gave to her.</p><p>Helpless, trapped.</p><p>Again and again, he drove into her body. She\u2019d thought that was she was slick before. Now\u2014\u201cTrace!\u201d</p><p>He yanked her closer to the edge of the desk. Her legs lifted and locked around his hips. The orgasm was there, the pleasure already starting to crest through her.</p><p>Trace kissed her. His mouth was hot. Open.</p><p>She came around him, exploding on a release so powerful that she shuddered.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>His thrusts came faster. They were even harder, lifting her body. She tightened her hold around him, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not done, Skye.\u201d He locked both of her wrists in one of his. Kept them secured above her head. His left hand slipped between their bodies. He stroked her clit again. Pushed her and pushed her until she screamed.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t scream for him to stop.</p><p>She screamed Trace\u2019s name.</p><p>He came, surging into her with a hot release that had him shuddering.</p><p>Only he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He kept thrusting. His release made her even more sensitive to him, and his cock stretched, filling her, sliding over flesh that was desperate for more.</p><p>Insatiable.</p><p>Only for him. Only for\u2014</p><p>He lifted her off the desk. Held her in his arms. Lifted her easily. She\u2019d always known he was strong. But this\u2014</p><p>\u201cSqueeze me. As hard and tight as you can.\u201d</p><p>Her inner muscles clamped around him.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d His eyes were still wild. \u201cWant...more...want...all...\u201d</p><p>He took her against the wall then. Her shoulders hit the surface, but she didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d freed her hands, and her nails scratched down his back.</p><p>He was holding her hips now, lifting her up again and again. Forcing her to match his rhythm, forcing her to take and take.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the breath to scream when the release hit her this time. She shuddered and trembled in his arms. Then she fell against him, limp, as her heart raced.</p><p>He still wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>Trace kept thrusting. A fast, hard tempo that she couldn\u2019t match. The tender lover was gone. She looked up and saw that his face was cut in hard lines of need. Primitive lust. Her arms wrapped around him, and that was pretty much all her exhausted body could manage.</p><p>His cock was so full. Big and thick, filling every inch of her. Her sex was swollen from her orgasms. With every thrust, she was on the brink of more pleasure...or pain?</p><p>The line was there, so hard to determine. Because the feelings coursing through her were so strong. So dark and powerful.</p><p>He erupted. \u201cSkye!\u201d His orgasm went on and on, and she was lost as she seemed to fall into the abyss.</p><p>Not pain.</p><p>Only pleasure.</p><p>Only...Trace.</p><p>Navy Pier. The place was normally a tourist\u2019s dream, but, in the middle of a night-time thunderstorm, the place was deserted.</p><p>Drake stood at the end of the dock, staring out at the glistening water. Lightning flashed in the dark sky. Bright strobes that lit the waves.</p><p>Anna Jean.</p><p>She\u2019d been his worst mistake.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t even managed to kill her.</p><p>Drake turned away from the water, hunching his shoulders against the rain that continued to fall in heavy blasts from the dark sky. He\u2019d screwed up back then\u2014when he\u2019d screwed her. But he\u2019d never met another woman like Anna Jean.</p><p>She\u2019d had a walk of pure temptation. Eyes that made him think constantly of sex and the pleasures found between lovers. She\u2019d belonged to Tucker. He knew it, and he\u2019d done his best to keep his hands off her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she\u2019d come to him. They\u2019d danced too much and drank too damn much in a godforsaken bar in Russia.</p><p>They\u2019d fucked in that same bar.</p><p>When the booze had cleared from his head, Drake had hated himself for what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d wanted to tell Tucker about his mistake.</p> <p>But Anna Jean had said that Tucker would never forgive. Or forget.</p><p>\u201cDrake...\u201d</p><p>He turned at the faint call. He could just see the outline of a person, walking toward him. He squinted, trying to see better in the storm.</p><p>\u201cDrake.\u201d</p><p>A woman\u2019s voice. Drifting to him. He took a step toward her, focusing completely on her now.</p> <p>So when the blow came from behind, he didn\u2019t have time to defend himself.</p><p>Something heavy and hard slammed into the back of his head. Then Drake felt himself flying to the side, and he crashed right into the icy water.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d Trace stared down at Skye as a fist seemed to squeeze his heart. His body still shuddered with aftershocks of the most powerful release he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>He\u2019d gone damn blind there for a moment. He\u2019d only been able to feel\u2014her.</p><p>Her head tilted back against the wall, and she smiled at him. A slow, sensual smile that pierced straight through him. \u201cWas that supposed to scare me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been too rough. Too controlling, too\u2014</p> <p>\u201cIf so, then I think you should work real hard to scare me again. You know, every night or so.\u201d</p><p>The tightness around his heart eased. He lifted her into his arms. Her hands wrapped around his neck, and he carried her to the bathroom.</p><p>Trace sat her on the granite countertop. Carefully, he cleaned off the signs of their love-making from her body. And when he looked up, he found Skye staring straight at him.</p><p>\u201cEvery lover that I\u2019ve ever had...he\u2019s been you in the dark.\u201d Her voice was soft and sensual.</p><p>Always tempting me.</p><p>He tossed aside the cloth. Trace put his hands on either side of her body. He didn\u2019t touch her, not then. Try to go five seconds without touching her. \u201cNo other lover could ever compare to you.\u201d After he\u2019d had sex with them, he couldn\u2019t get away from the other women fast enough. Because they weren\u2019t Skye.</p><p>And he\u2019d felt guilty, so damn guilty, for being with them.</p><p>Even when Skye had been a world away.</p> <p>\u201cI never asked you for a list of lovers,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>That gave him pause. He\u2019d asked for a list of her lovers, back when he\u2019d been trying to figure out who was stalking her. He\u2019d also been tempted to destroy every man on her list.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know about them,\u201d Skye said. \u201cBecause then I\u2019ll just have people to hate.\u201d</p><p>His breath burned in his lungs. \u201cYou\u2019re it for me. There can\u2019t be anyone else, not after what we\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew then and lit her eyes. She leaned toward him. Her lips pressed against his ear. \u201cGood,\u201d Skye whispered, \u201cbecause I\u2019d hate to hurt a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Her words surprised him so much\u2014coming from his delicate Skye\u2014not so delicate\u2014that Trace laughed.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t laugh. She kept gazing up into his eyes. \u201cOh, Trace,\u201d Skye said softly. \u201cWhen are you ever going to realize the truth? You don\u2019t love me because you want to protect me. You love because you realize that, deep down, we\u2019re very much alike.\u201d</p><p>His laughter slowly faded.</p><p>His Skye.</p><p>If another man tried to come near her...</p><p>I\u2019d destroy the bastard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Trace whispered, \u201cwe are.\u201d Then he kissed her once more.</p><p>Drake broke through the surface of the waves, his breath heaving out. He\u2019d barely avoided slamming into the dock on his way into the blackness of the water.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice shouted.</p><p>Her?</p><p>Someone was crouched at the edge of the pier. When lightning flashed, he could see the outline of a person\u2019s body.</p><p>He grabbed for the dock. Caught the wooden ladder that would get him out of the water.</p><p>Something dripped into his eyes. Water? Or blood?</p><p>Her hand reached for him. \u201cLet me help you!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her and yanked her into the water with him.</p><p>She screamed. Hell, yes, it\u2019s your turn to scream.</p><p>She also...sank?</p><p>The woman disappeared beneath the waves. Swearing, Drake dove after her. He caught her hair, long, spider-web like tendrils that drifted in the water, and he reached lower, grabbing for her.</p><p>They broke the surface together. She was gasping and shuddering and clinging to him as desperately as she could.</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean?\u201d Drake demanded. No, that wasn\u2019t right. Anna Jean could swim for miles. She\u2019d gone swimming with sharks for fuck\u2019s sake. Anna Jean had no fear. Anna Jean\u2014</p><p>The woman was about to choke him with her death-grip on his neck. \u201cM-my...s-sister...\u201d</p><p>He dragged her toward the dock. Hauled her up. Dropped her like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>She pushed up to her knees. \u201cY-you aren\u2019t what I thought...\u201d</p><p>He still couldn\u2019t see her face. There just wasn\u2019t enough light. Rain pelted down on them, hitting like hard spikes against his skin.</p><p>But...her voice was wrong. Too soft and husky, and tinged with the faintest of accents.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>She shoved wet hair out of her face. \u201cI\u2019m Piper, and I...I believe you knew my sister, Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>Believe? What the hell kind of game was this? \u201cWhere\u2019s your partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t have a partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d And Drake yanked out his weapon. The gun had been soaked, but there was a fifty-fifty chance it would still fire at least one bullet. \u201cThe jerk who hit me and threw me in the water. Now tell me...where the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFine, I figure that answer means we get to do things the hard way.\u201d He grabbed her and put the gun to her throat.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Trace answered his phone, stopping the peeling rings. \u201cWhat the hell is it?\u201d At this time of night, it had better be important.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d Drake\u2019s growling voice said. \u201cGet to your dancer\u2019s studio. I\u2019m heading there now.\u201d</p><p>The line ended.</p><p>What. The. Hell?</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s insane!\u201d The woman screamed the instant she saw Trace and Skye. \u201cHe has a gun!\u201d</p><p>Trace shoved open the door to Skye\u2019s studio. He made sure she got inside first, then he turned to confront Drake. \u201cHave you lost what little sanity you had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I found it...when I found her.\u201d</p><p>Drake pushed the woman inside.</p><p>Trace made certain that he secured the lock behind them all.</p><p>Skye hit the lights, and the illumination flooded down on them, giving Trace his first good look at the woman.</p><p>This just keeps getting worse.</p><p>The woman\u2014a drenched redhead with flashing green eyes\u2014was as pale as death. Her high cheeks gave her a hallowed out, frightened look\u2014or maybe that look just came from the absolute terror that was reflected in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cH-he tried to drown me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThen he put his g-gun to my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake shoved the gun into his waistband. \u201cI found her at Navy Pier. Right before some asshole slammed a board into the back of my head and dumped me in the water. Now she won\u2019t tell me who her partner is, but the lady did confess to one thing. According to her, she\u2019s Anna Jean\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Trace studied the woman\u2019s face. \u201cYes, I can see the resemblance.\u201d The eyes weren\u2019t the same shade of green, and her hair was the wrong color. Anna Jean\u2019s face had been more classically beautiful. Cold perfection\u2014that was what he\u2019d thought of when he saw Anna Jean.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is happening down here?\u201d A snarling voice demanded. Then footsteps thudded down from the upstairs apartment.</p><p>And Noah appeared.</p><p>Noah?</p><p>Claire was right behind him, peering nervously over his shoulder.</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze darted over to Drake and then that golden stare narrowed when he saw Drake\u2019s guest. \u201cYou.\u201d He lunged toward the woman. \u201cAnna Jean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The woman cried out as she tried to back away from him, and she thudded into Drake. \u201cI\u2019m not. My name\u2019s Piper! I-I\u2019m her half-sister.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s doubting gaze swept over her. \u201cNice trick. Got some collagen in your lower lip. A nose job. Died your hair.\u201d He peered at her. \u201cAnd I\u2019d wager those are contacts, just to make your eyes look a little different, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I saw you walk away today. I know that walk. I know you. You always were a good actress, Anna Jean. Too good.\u201d</p><p>Her frantic green stare flew around the room and locked on Skye. \u201cHelp me,\u201d she begged. \u201cThis isn\u2019t why I came here. I-I needed to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk,\u201d Trace invited.</p><p>Skye edged around him. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s chest shuddered. She glanced over her shoulder at Drake, then her terrified stare came back to Skye. \u201cY-you\u2019re in danger,\u201d she said. \u201cI-I had to tell you. You needed to be warned.\u201d</p><p>Trace stiffened. \u201cDid you just threaten her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Trace,\u201d it was Skye who answered, her voice calm, \u201cshe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2014Piper or Anna Jean or whoever the hell she was\u2014told Skye, \u201cYou have to get away from him.\u201d</p><p>Skye glanced back at Trace.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a killer,\u201d the woman threw out, breath heaving.</p><p>Skye already knew that.</p><p>\u201cHe...he was my sister\u2019s lover. He killed Anna Jean, and I\u2019m afraid he will kill you, too.\u201d</p><p>The hell, no.</p><p>All of the players were assembled. They\u2019d gathered. Drawn in close.</p><p>Now it was time for the chaos.</p><p>Time for vengeance.</p><p>They were all to blame, so they would all suffer.</p><p>In the end, no one would be left.</p><p>I will win.</p><p>Trace Weston\u2014oh, he would lose everything.</p><p>The bodies would start falling now. If they\u2019d thought the blood ran heavily on the streets before...</p><p>It\u2019s nothing compared to what I am about to do.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Noah sounded stunned. \u201cYou screwed her, too, Trace?\u201d</p><p>Skye kept her eyes on the woman called Piper. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Piper shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not! My sister was in a hospital, some hole-in-the-wall in the middle of Russia. I barely got to her in time. She was dying. He\u2019d stabbed her and left her for dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stabbed her,\u201d Drake said, his voice thick.</p><p>The woman stiffened. \u201cY-you?\u201d</p><p>Skye watched as shock seemed to flare in the woman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI stabbed her, and I\u2019m the one who left her for dead.\u201d He flashed her a hard smile. \u201cAnd you know what? I\u2019m the one who fucked her, too. So if you\u2019re looking for someone to blame for all that...look right here.\u201d</p><p>She slapped him. A hard, vicious hit that seemed to echo across the room.</p><p>Then the woman fell to her knees. She wrapped her arms around her stomach. Shuddered. \u201cI-I found the dog tags. She had them. She told me...\u201d Her head lifted. Her face was a mask of confusion and rage. \u201cTrace. He was the one. He killed her. He screwed my sister and he left her to die.\u201d Tears leaked from her eyes as she looked once more at Skye. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll do the same to you! He\u2019s a killer! A killer!\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d Drake said again. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>Claire tried to ease past Noah. He caught her arm and pushed her right back behind his body. \u201cDon\u2019t get close to Anna Jean. She\u2019s a viper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Anna Jean!\u201d The woman yelled. \u201cAnna Jean died in a Siberian hospital. She lost her fingers and her toes to hypothermia. She struggled to live\u2014for days and days, but the fluids built up around her heart. Or, around what was left of it. She died, broken and in agony.\u201d Now her gaze swung wildly around the room. \u201cI-I thought it was just Weston, but it was all of you. All of you!\u201d</p><p>Then she whirled around and grabbed at Drake. No, not at him. Her fingers latched onto the gun he\u2019d tucked into his waistband. She yanked the weapon up.</p><p>Drake\u2019s fingers locked around her wrist. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>Trace flew across the room.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t move. Her eyes were on the scene before her. Piper seemed so broken.</p><p>She came to warn me?</p><p>Piper let go of the gun. She whirled back toward Trace. \u201cY-you were going to do the same thing to Skye. I saw in the papers...you were with her. You were going to kill her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Trace said, his voice flat.</p><p>Piper flinched. \u201cI wanted to help. I came all this way...to help...\u201d Her shoulders sagged.</p><p>Skye\u2019s eyes narrowed on her. \u201cIf you thought Trace killed your sister, why didn\u2019t you go to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean died. Sh-she could barely remember what had happened to her. When she could talk, she told me that it was all white...snow and hell. A white hell, and that was all she could say.\u201d Piper drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cBut she had Trace\u2019s dog tags. She had them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now they\u2019re in the city.\u201d Trace tilted his head to the left. \u201cWant to tell me how that happened? Who\u2019d you give the dog tags to, Piper?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Piper seemed to pale even more.</p><p>Trace lifted his head. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>Noah stalked toward them.</p> <p>\u201cY-you know,\u201d Piper whispered.</p><p>Skye frowned at her. Piper was shaking now. Trembling.</p><p>Piper glanced back at Drake. \u201cI want to go. Please...please let me go...\u201d</p><p>His fingers settled on her shoulder. \u201cYou had a partner at the pier,\u201d Drake said. \u201cIs that the guy who had the dog tags?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t...I\u2019m afraid!\u201d Piper cried out. Her stare slid toward Noah.</p> <p>He\u2019d halted a few feet from Piper. He stared at her, heavy suspicion on his face and in his eyes.</p><p>Skye\u2019s gaze darted between them. Something just wasn\u2019t right there.</p><p>\u201cWho had the tags?\u201d Trace demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe cop!\u201d Piper screamed. Her hand came up and slapped over her mouth, as if she were horrified by the words she\u2019d just said.</p><p>A cold chill slid down Skye\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cWhat cop?\u201d Trace asked, only now, his voice was lethally soft.</p> <p>Piper\u2019s hands dropped to her sides. Her shoulders slumped, as if she were defeated, and she answered, \u201cA detective came to see me in Atlanta. He found out about you and Anna Jean, and he told me that you were going to attack again. He said\u2014he said we had to stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe this cop.\u201d The order came from Noah.</p><p>\u201cE-early thirties. Blond hair. Dark eyes. Good-looking.\u201d</p><p>Alex? Skye\u2019s heart beat faster. \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d She asked.</p><p>Piper\u2019s lips pressed together.</p><p>\u201cHis name,\u201d Trace shouted.</p><p>Piper jerked. \u201cHe\u2019s a police officer,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe wanted to help. He said that he\u2019d investigated you. That he knew who you were, deep inside. He knew what you\u2019d do.\u201d Piper\u2019s eyes gleamed as she cast a desperate glance toward Skye. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you turning out like Anna Jean!\u201d</p><p>Anna Jean. A woman long dead, but haunting them all.</p> <p>\u201cAlex Griffin,\u201d Skye said softly, but...this feels wrong.</p><p>Piper\u2019s head moved in the slightest of nods.</p><p>Trace\u2019s face grew even harder. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you gave my dog tags to Detective Griffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he needed them for the investigation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those dog tags turned up at a murder scene,\u201d Trace said, cutting across her words. \u201cThe dead man had been stabbed in the heart, and the knife wounds in his throat were so severe that he was nearly decapitated.\u201d</p><p>Piper gasped.</p><p>\u201cThe cop?\u201d Noah edged toward Trace. \u201cAre you really thinking it\u2019s him?\u201d</p><p>A faint line had appeared between Trace\u2019s brows. \u201cHe was downstairs at my building when we got the call about Sara. He couldn\u2019t have killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d had help, he could\u2019ve done it.\u201d This flat response came from Drake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Trace\u2019s eyes widened as something seemed to click for him. Then he said, \u201cThe wounds were different. There were hesitation wounds on Sharpe\u2019s neck and on Sara\u2019s neck. Those wounds weren\u2019t on Parker. I thought it was just easier for the killer to take out Parker but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it could\u2019ve been two killers,\u201d Skye finished, understanding what he meant.</p><p>Trace nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Piper\u2019s high-pitched cry. \u201cCops protect people. They don\u2019t\u2014they don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive someone the right motivation,\u201d Claire\u2019s quiet voice was a direct contrast to Piper\u2019s, \u201cand they\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Her lips twisted in disgust. \u201cI\u2019ve seen plenty of cops turn away from the law. I\u2019ve seen them do things that would give you nightmares\u2014and they did \u2018em just for a little money.\u201d</p><p>But Skye had been so convinced that Alex was a good cop. \u201cHe wanted to help me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe worked so hard to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he wants me out of your life,\u201d Trace told her. \u201cBecause he thinks I\u2019m like the monster who killed his sister.\u201d</p><p>Skye wasn\u2019t so sure of that. Alex stuck to the law. He was a good guy, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Trace\u2019s phone rang then, startling her. Trace yanked it out of his pocket. \u201cLook, Reese,\u201d he said into the phone, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a good time. I need to\u2014What?\u201d</p><p>Fear flashed across Trace\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you? Yeah, yeah, all right, listen to me, okay? Stay there. No, don\u2019t try to face him yourself. This is personal. Stay there. I am on my way.\u201d He ended the call and his stare immediately locked on Skye.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Noah\u2019s body was as tense as Trace\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cReese thinks someone tailed him back to his apartment.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s breath caught. Not Reese.</p><p>Trace returned to Skye\u2019s side. \u201cIf you want to hurt me,\u201d Trace said, his voice a rasp, \u201cyou hurt the people close to me.\u201d His fingers slid over her cheek. \u201cYou and Reese. You two are my family.\u201d</p><p>She caught his hand. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hell, no.\u201d He gave a hard, negative shake of his head. \u201cYou might think Alex won\u2019t hurt you, but I know otherwise.\u201d</p><p>If they even were dealing with Alex. \u201cCall him,\u201d Skye said, the words flying from her. \u201cCall Alex. Find out where he is.\u201d</p><p>Trace dialed quickly. She barely breathed while she waited and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo answer, and I\u2019m not wasting any more time\u2014time that Reese may not have.\u201d</p><p>She was really supposed to what? Wait there? He could just get pissed. She was going with him. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Piper\u2019s desperate cry. More tears were on her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening, but I\u2019m scared to death. I-I don\u2019t trust them!\u201d She pointed to Trace, to Noah, to Drake. Then her gaze came back to Skye. \u201cI came here because of you. I wanted to help you, the way I couldn\u2019t help my own sister. Wherever you go, I want to go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo damn way,\u201d was Trace\u2019s instant reply.</p><p>Piper trembled.</p><p>\u201cStay here, Skye,\u201d Trace said. His voice lowered, \u201cPlease, baby, I\u2019d go crazy if I thought he could get to you. Stay here and Drake\u2014you protect her, understand? With your life.\u201d</p><p>Drake nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf Drake\u2019s got guard duty, then I\u2019m your back-up,\u201d Noah said as he moved to Trace\u2019s side.</p><p>But Claire raced across the room then. She grabbed Noah\u2019s arm, leaned up, and whispered something into his ear.</p><p>His shoulders stiffened. He drew back and gazed down at her. After a moment, he nodded.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t like this. Trace and Noah were headed for the door. Claire had wrapped her arms around Piper\u2019s shoulders as she tried to comfort the other woman.</p><p>Drake was still casting suspicious glances Piper\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cH-he put a gun to my head,\u201d Piper mumbled to Claire. \u201cAnd he yanked me into the water.\u201d</p><p>That would explain her drenched clothing and hair.</p><p>But...a gun to her head?</p><p>Her gaze jerked to Trace. He was steps away from the door. \u201cCome back to me!\u201d She called out. He\u2019d better. He had to return to her.</p><p>Trace paused at the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back, baby, safe and sound.\u201d He spared her a glance, giving her a hard nod. \u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>Trace will keep his promise. He always kept his promises to her. She fought not to show the fear that clawed through her. \u201cAnd you make sure that Reese is safe, too.\u201d Reese had faced too much danger on their behalf.</p><p>Then Trace was gone. The door closed softly behind him. The alarm reset with a faint beep.</p><p>Piper kept crying. Drake raked a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d Claire told Piper. \u201cI\u2019ve got some extra clothes in my bag up there. You can dry off.\u201d</p><p>Piper let Claire lead her to the stairs, but she cast one more suspicious glance back at Drake. \u201cYou...you really killed my sister?\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened. He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she whispered and her face contorted with pain.</p><p>Sweat covered Reese\u2019s forehead as he glanced out of his apartment window. He was up on the second floor, and the street below him was dead quiet.</p><p>The storm had stopped. Finally.</p><p>But the danger hadn\u2019t passed.</p><p>He gazed down at the street. The street lamps barely provided any illumination, their glow was too weak. Shadows seemed to move down there.</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>Death was coming tonight. Hunting.</p><p>Hurry the hell up, Trace.</p><p>The phone behind him began to ring.</p><p>\u201cI know someone was with her on that pier,\u201d Drake said, his shoulder brushing against Skye\u2019s arm. \u201cThe jackass knocked me in the head and dumped me in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in all of the other kills, the attacker used a knife. No one drowned.\u201d The whole situation just didn\u2019t make sense to Skye.</p><p>Drake glanced up at the ceiling. \u201cShe knows more than what she\u2019s saying.\u201d He started to march for the stairs.</p><p>Skye stopped him. \u201cYou\u2019re the last person she wants to see now.\u201d There had been no missing the hate and fury on Piper\u2019s face. Skye gave a decisive nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, okay? I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should get anywhere near her,\u201d he snapped out. \u201cTrace asked me to stay because he wanted you safe. If she\u2019s anything like her viper of a sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Skye asked.</p><p>She heard a faint creak from upstairs, as if a door had opened.</p><p>Drake blanched. \u201cWhat? What are you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t love,\u201d Skye allowed. \u201cBut maybe it was as close as you\u2019d ever come. You cared about Anna Jean, but you still had to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was going to kill me! She had a gun to my head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had a gun to Piper\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut. \u201cShe\u2019s in my nightmares.\u201d All the emotion had drained from his voice. \u201cEvery night. I close my eyes, and I see her dying in that snow. An angel with blood for wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we really sure a cop is the one we\u2019re after?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Trace had the Jag\u2019s gas pedal shoved to the ground. \u201cNo, we won\u2019t be sure until we see him with our own eyes.\u201d Because all of the puzzle pieces weren\u2019t fitting for Trace.</p><p>The way the evidence had been planted at Parker\u2019s murder scene. Trace\u2019s shirt...the dog tag. All of that indicated that the killer had been trying to frame him, and a cop would know just how to set up a frame job.</p><p>But then something had happened. The killer had struck again. Too quickly? He\u2019d gone right after Sara.</p><p>Why?</p><p>His hold on the steering wheel tightened. Maybe the cop had worried that Sara knew too much, that she\u2019d turn on him.</p><p>So did you have someone else kill her? Someone who hesitated?</p><p>Trace raced through a yellow light. He needed to go faster.</p><p>\u201cI should be in jail,\u201d Drake said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I belong. I fucking killed her.\u201d His breath rasped out. \u201cThat\u2019s what she tells me, every single night.\u201d</p><p>Did Trace have those same nightmares? Only, for him, was it the ghost of Tucker who came back and haunted him?</p><p>Another creak came from upstairs. Skye\u2019s gaze rose. Is Piper listening? Skye didn\u2019t want the other woman to hear anymore.</p><p>Her fingers slid down Drake\u2019s arm, and she headed for the stairs.</p><p>Sure enough, Piper stood at the top of those stairs. Her hands were wrapped tightly around her stomach.</p><p>Skye slowly climbed the stairs. Piper backed up, sliding into the apartment. She held the door open for Skye.</p><p>\u201cAll this time,\u201d Piper whispered, \u201cand I blamed the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d Skye told her as she closed the door behind her. She glanced quickly around the apartment, but she didn\u2019t see Claire. The bathroom door was closed. Maybe Claire was in there.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know everything,\u201d Piper continued, her stare glassy. \u201cThen the truth comes along, and it rips your world right apart.\u201d</p><p>A muffled cry reached Skye\u2019s ears. She frowned. That cry had come from the bathroom. \u201cClaire?\u201d Skye called.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d Piper told her, blinking, and glancing toward the bathroom door. \u201cShe said she kept seeing her sister.\u201d A bitter laugh escaped her. \u201cI guess they took both our sisters away, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Skye hurried toward the bathroom. She knocked lightly on the wooden door. \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>The floor squeaked behind Skye.</p><p>She lifted her hand and knocked on the door. \u201cClaire, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Something sharp and hard\u2014a knife?\u2014pressed into Skye\u2019s back, freezing her. Terrifying her.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry so much about Claire. She\u2019s already dead but you...you still have plenty of time to suffer.\u201d Piper\u2019s breath blew against Skye\u2019s ear. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about screaming, bitch. You raise your voice above a whisper, and I will slit your throat in an instant.\u201d</p><p>Trace slammed on the brakes. The Jag stopped with a squeal of its tires. \u201cYou take the back,\u201d Trace ordered Noah as they jumped from the car.</p><p>\u201cAnd you storm the front.\u201d Noah inclined his head. \u201cJust like old times.\u201d</p><p>Screw old times. Trace had taken his weapon from the car. After Sharpe\u2019s death, he\u2019d made sure to keep the gun close. He checked the weapon. Loaded. Ready. Then he ran toward the apartment. Reese should be upstairs, waiting and\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah cried out, the sound sharp and full of pain.</p><p>Trace whirled around.</p><p>Noah was on the cement, sprawled beneath a street lamp. Blood poured from beneath his body.</p> <p>\u201cNoah!\u201d Trace yelled. Then he realized what was happening.</p><p>Shooter.</p><p>Trace dove for cover, but he moved a second too late, and he felt the burn of the bullet slice across the side of his face.</p><p>A silencer. The SOB was up there, trying to kill them both without making a sound.</p><p>Trace ducked behind the Jag. This wasn\u2019t his first shoot-out. He might be rusty, but he knew this game, and he knew how to find the shooter. Based on the angle of those shots...his gaze swept up and to the left. Those bullets had come from the second story. Corner apartment.</p> <p>Reese\u2019s apartment?</p><p>\u201cH-help...\u201d Noah gasped out the plea.</p><p>Trace jerked his gaze back to his friend.</p><p>Had the shooter heard that cry? If so, he\u2019d know Noah was still alive. Alive and a sitting duck.</p><p>Another shot would end Noah.</p><p>Trace knew he couldn\u2019t just sit there and watch his friend die. Even if that was the killer\u2019s plan.</p> <p>Trace glanced up at the apartment. You want me? Then take your best shot. He sucked in a deep breath. An image of Skye flashed before him.</p><p>Come back to me.</p><p>He would. He would.</p><p>\u201cPeople have no defense against an innocent face,\u201d Piper said, sounding not the least bit shattered or scared any longer. Now, she sounded satisfied. Smug. \u201cMen think you\u2019re weak, and they want to protect you, and women, well, they think you\u2019re a friend, so they let their guard down when you\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>Skye was still facing the bathroom door. She\u2019d heard no other sound from inside, but when she glanced down, she saw blood slipping from under the bathroom door.</p><p>Claire!</p><p>\u201cDid you see her wrist?\u201d Piper asked. \u201cIt looks like Claire tried to kill herself once. I noticed that right away. Weak bitch. I guess I helped her out this time.\u201d</p><p>Skye tried to keep her muscles loose. \u201cYou\u2019re not Piper, are you?\u201d</p> <p>Laughter.</p><p>And she had her answer. \u201cYou\u2019re Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>The blade sliced across Skye\u2019s back. She cried out.</p><p>\u201cGive the bitch a cookie!\u201d Anna Jean jerked Skye around to face her. Skye\u2019s shoulders hit the bathroom door. \u201cAll I had to do was make myself look a little bit more like my goody two-shoes sister. Then they all stared right at me, and they believed every lie I told them.\u201d</p><p>Skye glanced over Anna Jean\u2019s shoulders. \u201cNot everyone believed them.\u201d And that was why Trace had left a guard behind. Skye tried to act like she was looking at that guard right then.</p><p>Anna Jean\u2019s jaw dropped open. \u201cDrake?\u201d Then she was whirling around to face what she obviously thought was a new threat, her body vibrating with tension as she tried to follow Skye\u2019s stare.</p><p>Only Drake wasn\u2019t standing there.</p><p>Skye slammed her body into Anna Jean\u2019s and she screamed as loud as she possibly could. They hit the floor. Skye grabbed two handfuls of Anna Jean\u2019s still wet hair, and she slammed the woman\u2019s face into the floor. Once, twice.</p><p>But Anna Jean broke free. She slashed out with the knife, and it sliced over Skye\u2019s forearm. Skye jerked back, hissing out at the pain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the start,\u201d Anna Jean promised.</p><p>Drake threw open the door. \u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>Anna Jean grabbed Skye and put the knife to her throat. \u201cNow the hero\u2019s here,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>The blade nicked Skye\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean,\u201d Drake whispered. One of his hands held the gun\u2014a weapon that was pointed at Skye and Anna Jean. \u201cI see you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I see you!\u201d Her words were a scream. \u201cAll this time, I thought it was Trace! I couldn\u2019t remember what happened to me\u2014every time I closed my eyes, I saw the snow and the blood and I heard screams.\u201d</p><p>Drake took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cI lost four toes, Drake! It was so cold out there. You left me in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s face hardened. Emotion\u2014emotion that Skye couldn\u2019t name\u2014burned in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was in that shit-hole of a hospital for months! Barely living, in pain every single day. And it was because of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Anna Jean cried out. The knife sliced across Skye\u2019s throat. Skye felt the wet warmth of her blood sliding down her neck. \u201cTake another step, and you know I\u2019ll cut her throat open. I\u2019ll enjoy doing it.\u201d</p><p>Drake didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cTrace\u2019s dog tags were left.\u201d Now Anna Jean\u2019s voice was hoarse. \u201cThe men who found me, they said he\u2019d been the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men who found you,\u201d Drake repeated. In contrast to Anna Jean, his voice was thick with tension. Anger. No, rage. \u201cThey were your partners, Anna Jean. They were the men you sent to kill us.\u201d</p><p>Anna Jean laughed then. \u201cBut here you are, still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d he pointed out. He still had his gun up, but Skye knew he wouldn\u2019t take the shot, not while Anna Jean was using her as a shield.</p><p>This was insane.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks to you,\u201d Anna Jean said. For an instant, she sounded...lost. \u201cI was going to let you live, Drake. Because I thought you were the one who loved me. But you\u2014you\u2019re the one who left me to die?\u201d</p><p>Red stained his cheeks. \u201cYou gave me no choice! You tried to kill me!\u201d He sprang forward.</p><p>\u201cAnd you just killed her,\u201d Anna Jean spat back. Her hold on Skye tightened as the blade dug into Skye\u2019s throat.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Trace grabbed for Noah. He expected to feel a bullet sink into him at any moment.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t.</p><p>He pulled Noah behind the Jag. His fingers ripped open Noah\u2019s shirt so he could see the damage. The bullet had gone straight through Noah\u2019s chest and out his back.</p><p>\u201cMissed...my heart,\u201d Noah muttered. \u201cSaw the glint of the weapon. Dodged just in time.\u201d</p><p>The street was still dead silent. Since the shooter had used a silencer, no one else had even been aware of the shots. Trace pulled out his phone and dialed nine-one-one. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d Trace promised him. The guy was bleeding like a stuck pig, and he was as pale as death. Trace was afraid for him. Damn scared, despite his words.</p><p>\u201cNine-one-one, what is the nature of your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s been shot,\u201d Trace told the dispatcher. \u201cI need an ambulance, now.\u201d He snapped out the address.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the shooter, sir?\u201d</p><p>Trace glanced up at the apartment. \u201cHe fired from one of the apartments. You need to get the cops en route now.\u201d</p><p>And if a cop already was on the scene?</p><p>\u201cGet...him,\u201d Noah rasped.</p><p>Trace hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you to bleed out on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...\u201d Noah\u2019s breath heaved out. \u201cReese is dying, too?\u201d Another breath shuddered from him. \u201cI\u2019m not...going yet,\u201d Noah promised and gave him a weak smile. \u201cI...envied you too long. I\u2019ll get...what you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I think you\u2019re delirious.\u201d Trace pulled Noah\u2019s back-up gun from his ankle holster. He wasn\u2019t sure where Noah\u2019s other weapon was. \u201cCan you hold this?\u201d Because if he went up to find the shooter, then he had to know Noah was safe.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Noah\u2019s bloody fingers curled around the weapon.</p><p>Trace met his stare. \u201cDon\u2019t even think of dying before I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not...that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Trace lied. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s lips curved. \u201cDo me a...favor? No, two?\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded.</p><p>\u201cKill the b-bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already dead.\u201d The guy just didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>\u201cAnd then...tell Claire I was a fucking rock star...when I got sh-shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her yourself.\u201d Trace tightened his hold on his weapon. He\u2019d keep covered as much as possible as he ran for the apartment building. But he had to hurry.</p><p>If the killer got away, there\u2019d just be another attack. And another. It wouldn\u2019t ever stop. Not until he stopped it.</p><p>Trace kept his head low as he ran toward the building.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t care about the pain. When the knife dug into her, she didn\u2019t scream or try to jerk away from the blade.</p><p>Instead, she lifted up her hands and she clawed at Anna Jean\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Anna Jean was the one to scream. The blade slipped, cutting Skye more, but she let her knees buckle and she fell right from Anna Jean\u2019s weakened hold.</p><p>Drake grabbed Skye and tossed her across the room. Then he lunged for Anna Jean.</p><p>But he staggered to a stop when she brought up her knife.</p><p>\u201cGoing to shoot me?\u201d Anna Jean taunted him. \u201cGoing to leave me to die alone? Again? You weren\u2019t supposed to be the one!\u201d</p><p>He circled her.</p><p>Skye put her hand to her throat. The wounds weren\u2019t that deep, and she pushed the pain to the back of her mind. After all, the pain didn\u2019t matter then. Stopping Anna Jean was all that mattered.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Drake firing at her?</p><p>\u201cYou were different,\u201d Anna Jean whispered. \u201cI stopped him from killing you earlier because I always thought...not you, Drake. Not. You!\u201d The knife trembled in her grasp.</p><p>He opened his hand. Held it out to her. \u201cGive me the knife.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him.</p><p>Screw this. Skye raced across the room. She yanked on the bathroom door. It flew open, but only just a few inches, because it hit Claire\u2019s prone body.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Skye sank to her knees beside the other woman. There was blood. So much. A growing pool of it. Not from a slit throat, but from a deep wound in Claire\u2019s gut. Skye\u2019s fingers covered the wound, pushing down as she tried to apply pressure.</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes cracked open. Her stare was glassy, nearly blind with fear. \u201cAgain,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s happening a-again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Skye shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. We\u2019ll get you help.\u201d She turned her head. Drake and Anna Jean were still facing off. What the hell? \u201cCall an ambulance,\u201d Skye yelled at Drake. \u201cClaire needs help, now!\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s gaze jerked to Skye. He blinked as if waking from a dream. Or maybe a nightmare.</p><p>And in that one moment, Anna Jean attacked. She lunged forward and drove the knife into Drake\u2019s stomach, and then she yanked, jerking the blade to the right. He fell back, stunned, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cThis time, you get to die,\u201d Anna Jean told him.</p><p>His knees sagged, and he hit the floor.</p><p>Anna Jean spun to face Skye. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>Claire whimpered.</p><p>Skye kept applying pressure. \u201cClaire has nothing to do with this. Let her go.\u201d Drake wasn\u2019t making a sound. His guilt had made him vulnerable. Guilt, love\u2014they could wreck a person.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Claire,\u201d Anna Jean yelled. She bent over Drake\u2019s body, and when she rose, she had his gun. \u201cMaybe he did love me,\u201d she said as she stared down at him. \u201cBecause if he\u2019d been smart, he would\u2019ve shot me when he had the chance. Instead, I had the pleasure of gutting him.\u201d Her voice dropped. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for leaving me in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s body was already covered in blood. So much blood. But when Anna Jean moved to step around him, his hand flew out. His fingers locked around her ankle. \u201cNo...\u201d Drake growled.</p><p>\u201cOh, darling, relax, I\u2019ll slit your throat and end things soon.\u201d She lifted the gun. \u201cBut first, I want to make sure Skye\u2019s dead. You were right, you know. I did have a partner. And he\u2019s waiting for a phone call from me. One that tells him Skye is dead.\u201d She smiled at Skye. \u201cWho\u2019s going to save you now?\u201d</p><p>Skye stood up. She inched away from Claire, not wanting the bullet to hit the other woman. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when Trace falls, we\u2019ll take everything he has. All that money...mine.\u201d</p><p>This had been about money? \u201cI thought this was for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling you...\u201d Anna Jean shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s for revenge. The rest is for money.\u201d</p><p>Drake was trying to heave himself up behind her.</p><p>Anna Jean\u2019s finger tightened on the trigger. \u201cAt least I\u2019m being merciful. Good-bye, little dancer.\u201d</p><p>Skye flew forward even as\u2014</p><p>Nothing happened?</p><p>Anna Jean\u2019s fingers squeezed the trigger twice more, but the gun didn\u2019t fire.</p><p>Skye slammed into her. They fell to the floor, landing right next to Drake.</p><p>\u201cStupid...f-freaking water...\u201d Anna Jean snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll just...do it...the old f-fashioned way...\u201d Her fingers locked around Skye\u2019s throat and she started to squeeze.</p><p>Skye slid her own hands under Anna Jean\u2019s, and she shoved up, fast and hard, breaking the other woman\u2019s hold. Then Skye drove her fist into Anna Jean\u2019s face.</p><p>Again and again.</p><p>She was pretty sure that she heard bones crunch.</p><p>Anna Jean sagged back, unmoving.</p><p>Skye jumped up. Her hand throbbed. She\u2019d probably broken some of her own fingers. She tried to grab for the phone that had been left on the little table near the door, but the phone fell from her now burning hand. Skye dove for it, and tried to dial nine-one-one.</p><p>Anna Jean yelled. The woman just won\u2019t stay down. Anna Jean pushed up to her knees. \u201cB-bitch, you\u2019re done!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Drake drove the knife into her heart. Anna Jean gasped. Her eyes widened. She turned her head to look at him.</p><p>His face was ashen. His eyes appeared sunken. \u201cI didn\u2019t...miss this time,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Anna Jean\u2019s lips trembled.</p> <p>The nine-one-one operator came on the line.</p><p>Skye spilled out the emergency details as quickly as she could. When she looked back over at Anna Jean, the woman\u2019s body was ominously still.</p><p>And Drake was slumped over her.</p><p>Skye scrambled to them. She rolled Drake over. Checked his pulse. Faint, thready, but he was still alive.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she whispered into the phone. \u201cPlease, hurry.\u201d</p> <p>She ran back to Claire.</p><p>\u201cT-tell me she\u2019s dead,\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>If Anna Jean wasn\u2019t dead yet, she would be soon. And will Claire be gone, too?</p><p>The phone in Skye\u2019s hands vibrated.</p><p>Another call was coming in. Skye was still on the line with the nine-one-one operator, but she glanced at the screen and saw the note for\u2014</p><p>Unknown caller. The message flashed across the phone\u2019s screen.</p> <p>The phone wasn\u2019t hers. It had just been tossed on the table.</p><p>Was it Claire\u2019s?</p><p>Or Anna Jean\u2019s?</p><p>Anna Jean\u2019s voice echoed through Skye\u2019s mind. I did have a partner. And he\u2019s waiting for a phone call from me. One that tells him Skye is dead.</p><p>Had the partner got tired of waiting?</p><p>Skye crouched next to Claire. She put one hand on the wound, keeping up the pressure. Her left hand held the phone. Her finger slid across the phone\u2019s screen as she took the call. \u201cH-hello?\u201d Her voice was a rasp. Lower than normal.</p><p>Static, then. \u201cIs she dead?\u201d</p><p>A tear slid down Skye\u2019s cheek because she knew that voice.</p> <p>Frantic, she ended the call and immediately tried to get Trace on the line.</p><p>Trace bounded up the stairs. When he reached Reese\u2019s apartment, he didn\u2019t pause.</p><p>He kicked in the damn door.</p><p>Trace ran inside with his weapon ready, but he stopped cold at the sight of the body before him.</p><p>Detective Alex Griffin lay on the floor, face-down. Reese stood above him, a horrified look on his face. \u201cI had no choice,\u201d Reese muttered. \u201cNo choice.\u201d</p><p>There was no weapon in Reese\u2019s hands. No weapon near Alex, either.</p><p>\u201cHe did it,\u201d Reese said. \u201cHe came here, with a knife, trying to kill me.\u201d Reese lifted his head. \u201cBoss, dammit, why?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s phone vibrated in his pocket. He didn\u2019t answer it. Not yet. Carefully, he bent next to Alex. The cop\u2019s blond hair was matted with blood, and Alex\u2019s pulse was weak, but steady. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive. An ambulance is on the way.\u201d</p><p>Reese hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>Trace looked up at him. \u201cThere was a shooter here.\u201d</p><p>Reese nodded frantically. \u201cHim. He had me tied up, I got loose, we fought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s phone kept vibrating. He rose to his feet. The gun was still in his hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time,\u201d Trace told Reese.</p><p>Reese nodded. He rocked back on his heels. \u201cA cop...I can\u2019t believe...a cop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve trusted you with my life.\u201d The phone stopped vibrating. \u201cMore importantly, I\u2019ve trusted you with Skye\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s hand slid toward his waist. \u201cYou can always trust me,\u201d he told Trace, the expression on his face stark. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back. You\u2019ve got mine.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s jaw locked. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m wondering what the hell you have behind your back.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s hand stopped its slow glide toward his waist. \u201cBoss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex was hit from behind. His head is matted with blood\u2014blood that\u2019s already partly dry in his hair. If the blood had time to dry, that means he wasn\u2019t shooting at me. You were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shock slackened Reese\u2019s face. \u201cHow can you say that? I would never do that! We\u2019re friends!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear the scream of sirens yet. They needed to damn well get there. \u201cBut you\u2019re still the man who\u2019s been after me.\u201d Rage beat in his blood. \u201cYou killed Sara.\u201d</p><p>Reese flinched. \u201cNo, no, it was the cop!\u201d He took a lunging step forward.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Trace shook his head and aimed his weapon at Reese\u2019s head. \u201cAnother step, and I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThe same way you shot Tucker? I guess you have a history of shooting your friends, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because my friends have a history of betraying me. I don\u2019t deal well with betrayal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t betrayed you!\u201d Spittle flew from Reese\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t checked on you?\u201d Trace demanded, body tight. \u201cGuess who didn\u2019t have alibis for the kills?\u201d</p><p>His phone vibrated again.</p><p>Reese\u2019s gaze flickered at the sound. \u201cMaybe you should get that call, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe we should all just wait right here until the cops arrive.\u201d</p><p>At that, Reese laughed. \u201cLike the great Trace Weston gives a flying shit about local cops. You do what you want, when you want. You always have.\u201d</p><p>And the mask that Reese had worn seemed to fall away. His face twisted with bitterness.</p><p>This was my friend?</p><p>\u201cYou climb out of hell, and you rise to heaven,\u201d Reese\u2019s voice was a grating snarl. His eyes flashed with fury. \u201cThat\u2019s your charmed life, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life\u2019s never been charmed.\u201d An alcoholic mother. A father who used his fists too frequently and forgot to even feed his son most days.</p><p>One war zone after another.</p><p>The phone stopped vibrating.</p><p>Reese shook his head. \u201cYou do have a weakness, though.\u201d Reese smiled at him. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you just left her alone...with Anna Jean.\u201d</p><p>In that instant, Trace\u2019s heart stopped.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, boss, it\u2019s her. New face. New contacts. New hair. But you\u2014you\u2019re always so taken in by the innocent ones. The ones who look lost and scared, just like Skye.\u201d</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t look lost and scared. She looked like the most perfect thing in the world.</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean came to me,\u201d Reese told him, smug now. \u201cShe told me about what you\u2019d done. How you\u2019d left her and Tucker to die. I\u2019d heard the story before, of course. You\u2019d told me your version, but this was different.\u201d</p><p>Anna Jean\u2019s story was bull. \u201cYou know Anna Jean betrayed the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I gave a damn about that. I wasn\u2019t on that team.\u201d His smile stretched. \u201cShe wanted vengeance, and you know what I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d Every instinct in Trace\u2019s body screamed for him to attack.</p><p>Alex still lay prone on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI almost died for your girlfriend,\u201d Reese snapped. \u201cWhen that freak of a doctor came after her, I wound up in the hospital. Collateral damage, right? Screw that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were not\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Reese cut right through his words and said, \u201cI had your back day in and day out, but I got nothing.\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my ass in battle, so what? I\u2019m supposed to be your lackey forever? I want my share! Why do you get everything? Why?\u201d</p><p>This time, Trace didn\u2019t try to talk. He knew Reese didn\u2019t care what he said.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to marry her. As soon as I saw the chunk of glass on her finger, I knew I had to act. I got Anna Jean in town, and we started our plan. Skye had to die, of course.\u201d</p><p>He fucking dared to speak so easily about her death?</p><p>\u201cIf you married Skye, then you\u2019d change your will,\u201d Reese said, jerking a hand through his hair. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let the money go to her. Not after all the time I\u2019d put in to make sure I was the one closest to you.\u201d</p><p>Now Trace laughed. \u201cYou idiot. I never planned to change my will.\u201d Reese was so wrong. About so many things.</p><p>Reese blinked. \u201cWh-what? But...but I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always going to take care of you, Reese. You were my friend.\u201d A lying, deadly friend. \u201cBut Skye, she was the one I loved. Even if I\u2019d never gotten back with her, the bulk of my fortune was always set to go to Skye when I died.\u201d It had been his only way to take care of her.</p><p>Reese\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cWith the ring or without it,\u201d Trace said. \u201cShe was always mine. And I protect what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s head tilted. Ah, he could hear the siren now. It was time to end this.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t protect her this time!\u201d Reese\u2019s body vibrated with fury. \u201cAnna Jean killed her. Your precious Skye bled out while you were on your way here. Anna Jean killed her the instant you left the studio. Then she killed Drake and Claire. They never even saw her coming.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s alive. Skye\u2019s alive. He yanked out his phone.</p><p>Reese\u2019s hand flew up. He grabbed a gun\u2014one that he\u2019d had hidden behind his back\u2014and he fired.</p><p>Trace fired at the same instant. The blasts thundered through the room.</p><p>Reese\u2019s lips moved. A weak gasp slipped from him.</p><p>Trace hadn\u2019t aimed for his heart. The bullet had blasted right through Reese\u2019s head.</p><p>Reese\u2019s body thudded to the floor.</p><p>Trace\u2019s weapon dropped. He pulled out the phone. Called back the number that had tried to reach him again and again. It wasn\u2019t Skye\u2019s number. It was a number he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d Skye\u2019s frantic voice shouted over the line.</p><p>She was alive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Reese,\u201d she told him, her voice warming him even as a chill seemed to surround his heart. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s been after you.\u201d</p><p>Sirens screamed, coming closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to you! Be careful, Trace, be very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Trace told her as emotion rose up to choke him. \u201cAlways, you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>The phone slipped from his fingers.</p><p>Trace stared down at his chest. Reese had always been such a damn fine shot.</p><p>A good friend? No.</p><p>But a good killer.</p><p>I love you, Skye.</p><p>He just hated that he\u2019d broken his promise to her. He\u2019d said that he would return to her.</p><p>She\u2019d asked for only one thing. Come back to me.</p><p>It was the one thing he couldn\u2019t give her.</p><p>Skye raced toward the apartment. Her breath heaved in her lungs even as her heart thundered wildly in her chest. She\u2019d been disconnected. Trace\u2019s call had just ended and no matter how many times she tried, she couldn\u2019t get him back on the line.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, stop!\u201d A uniformed cop appeared in her path. \u201cThis is a crime scene, you can\u2019t go in there!\u201d</p><p>Police cruisers lined the street. Three ambulances\u2014three\u2014were there. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 is in that building! I\u2019ve got to find him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, but no one is getting in there now.\u201d His face was grim but sympathetic. \u201cNow just stand back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInjured officer!\u201d Another voice shouted. \u201cMake room!\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped to the right. Two EMTs were pushing out a man on a gurney. They wheeled right past her, and she saw Alex\u2019s ashen face.</p><p>\u201cAlex!\u201d She rushed toward him.</p><p>His hand rose and caught her wrist. \u201cSo...sorry...\u201d</p><p>An EMT pulled Alex\u2019s hand away.</p><p>But she grabbed it right back. \u201cWhere\u2019s Trace?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes squinted up at her. \u201cWas...watching Reese...caught him t-tailing me...thought Weston had...sent him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, where is Trace?\u201d</p><p>The uniformed cop wrapped his arms around Skye and pulled her back. The EMTs loaded Alex into the back of the nearest ambulance. The doors slammed shut and the siren screamed on.</p><p>\u201cOne fatality,\u201d a voice behind her muttered. \u201cBut did you see the blood in that place? It looked like something out of a horror movie.\u201d</p><p>Skye was glad the cop held her. Without him, she might have hit the ground right then. Her nails dug into his arms, and she turned to gaze up at the young officer. \u201cWas the fatality Trace Weston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who died, ma\u2019am,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI wasn\u2019t cleared to go upstairs. I just know some guy took a detective hostage and started shooting people in the street.\u201d He pointed to the left, and she looked, gasping when she saw the dark pool of what had to be blood under a street lamp.</p><p>\u201cThey already took one man to the hospital. He had a gunshot wound to the chest.\u201d The cop\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI can\u2019t say anymore, okay? Go to the hospital. St. Mary\u2019s. Wait there.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him, forcing her legs to move. St. Mary\u2019s. Claire and Drake had been taken to St. Mary\u2019s, too. The EMTS had arrived at her studio. They\u2019d come with police.</p><p>The police had wanted to question Skye. They\u2019d wanted her to go down to the station.</p><p>She\u2019d just wanted to get away. She\u2019d faked being sick and she\u2019d darted to the bathroom. Then she\u2019d climbed out of the window and grabbed the first taxi that she saw.</p><p>Her gaze flew around the scene. Trace\u2019s car was still there. Far too close to the ominous pool of blood. It looked black. In the darkness, the blood looked so black.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see Noah. She didn\u2019t see Trace.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seizing!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two more EMTs ran from the apartment. A man was between them on the gurney. His hand fell limply, his fingers lax.</p><p>In that instant, everything stopped for Skye as she gazed at that hand.</p><p>It was the hand of the man who\u2019d saved her from being raped when she was fifteen. That hand had struck out with vicious accuracy then, beating her attacker again and again.</p> <p>That was the man who\u2019d saved her from hell. He\u2019d pulled her out of that terrible basement. Carried her. Held her close with that hand.</p><p>That was the hand of the man who\u2019d proposed to her. His fingers had trembled when he\u2019d slid the ring onto her finger. Weakness, when Trace was normally so strong.</p><p>Trace! They were loading him into the back of an ambulance, and she jumped inside with them.</p><p>One of the EMTs glanced up. \u201cLady, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9.\u201d Oh, God, his chest. The blood. \u201cHelp him!\u201d</p> <p>The EMT jerked his head and went back to work. The siren screamed as the vehicle lurched forward.</p><p>Skye grabbed for Trace\u2019s hand. She held it like the lifeline that it was. She hadn\u2019t warned him fast enough. Reese had done this. The man they\u2019d trusted.</p><p>Her hold tightened on him. \u201cCome back to me,\u201d Skye whispered because she could tell\u2014she could feel\u2014that Trace was slipping away. His face was too still. Too pale. The life and energy\u2014all that was Trace\u2014gone.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered while the EMTs hooked him up to machines and poked him with needles. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Trace. I don\u2019t want to be without you.\u201d She\u2019d tried that. And she\u2019d felt as if she were only living half a life during those years.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me,\u201d Skye said again.</p><p>But Trace didn\u2019t answer her, and a cold chill covered her body.</p> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Skye walked into the morgue. The police chief was at her side. Because of this case, because of who was involved, she\u2019d warranted attention from the man in charge.</p><p>Maybe that was supposed to make her feel better. It didn\u2019t. Nothing could make her feel better. Nothing could make her feel then. Her wounds were bandaged. The doctors had wanted to give her pain medication. She\u2019d refused. There was no need for the drugs because a wall of ice surrounded her, numbing her. Each breath was an effort, sawing out of her lungs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Skye said. Her voice was wooden. As cold as she felt.</p><p>\u201cWe just need the identification process completed, Ms. Sullivan,\u201d he told her. His eyes and his face were sympathetic. Everyone kept looking at her that way. With sympathy. Pity.</p><p>She hated those stares.</p><p>The first body waited. She glanced down at it. Felt no emotion stir. Not even rage. She\u2019d locked her emotions away. She had to lock them away, or else she\u2019d go crazy.</p><p>I\u2019m more like my mother than I thought.</p> <p>Because she wanted to kill. Wanted to destroy everyone in her path.</p><p>Skye cleared her throat as she stared at the body. \u201cThat\u2019s Anna Jean Hurley. She was working with Reese Stokes. I believe they killed Ben Sharpe, Parker Jacobs, and Sara Kramer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Anna Jean told me they did, so I believed the bitch.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Skye glared at the body. For a minute there, rage had cracked through her surface. She couldn\u2019t have that. Because her pain was hidden just behind the rage.</p><p>Her gaze slid to the next slab. To the body that was waiting for her. Her lips trembled. Her hands clenched tightly into fists, and her nails bit into her palms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Reese Stokes.\u201d And he was missing part of his head.</p><p>The chief\u2019s shoulder brushed against hers. \u201cMost people can\u2019t handle seeing a dead body, not one like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people probably don\u2019t stare at the dead and wish that they\u2019d been the one to do the killing.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cReese was Anna Jean\u2019s partner. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe because he was a psychotic jerk. Maybe because he fell for the wrong woman, and she warped his mind.\u201d Her gaze slid back to Reese. \u201cI thought of him as family, and I hope the bastard is burning now.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cNow I need to get back to Trace.\u201d She\u2019d been away from him too long already. Skye skirted around the police chief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...very sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d he called.</p><p>Her fingers hesitated above the door.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors briefed me on Weston\u2019s injuries. I understand that he...he\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her spine snapped straight. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about Trace Weston. Neither do they. But I know plenty.\u201d She faced him. \u201cHe\u2019s the strongest man I know. And he\u2019s a man who keeps his promises. Trace isn\u2019t going to leave me. He\u2019s going to wake up. He\u2019s going to open his eyes any time.\u201d That was why she had to be there. \u201cAnd he\u2019s going to make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>The pity flashed in his eyes again. She hated that pity. She wouldn\u2019t look at it anymore. She left the chief, hurrying from the room and running back to the only man who mattered to her.</p><p>She was only supposed to stay with Trace for fifteen minutes at a time. That was the rule in the ICU.</p><p>Skye was breaking their rules, and the doctors hadn\u2019t tried to throw her out yet. Maybe they were afraid of the Weston name. Of the Weston money.</p><p>Or maybe...maybe they just had pity in their eyes, too, when they looked at her.</p><p>She stood by his bed. Stroked his fingers. They\u2019d told her that machines were keeping him alive.</p><p>Skye wouldn\u2019t believe that. He was alive.</p><p>His skin wasn\u2019t warm to the touch, it was cool, too cold. So was hers. She rubbed his fingers, trying to force warmth back into him and wishing that she could be the one in that bed.</p><p>But she was there, at his side, helpless.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you felt?\u201d Skye asked him. \u201cWhen I was taken and you were left behind, did you feel like this? Like you were being ripped apart, like you were losing your life...and there was nothing you could do but stand there and watch it all fall away?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. He couldn\u2019t. A tube was shoved down his throat. He couldn\u2019t breathe on his own. They\u2019d operated on him\u2014three times. He hadn\u2019t regained consciousness since the EMTs had hauled him out of that apartment.</p><p>It looked like something out of a horror movie.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one for me to fight.\u201d Her voice had gone hoarse. From the tears? Or from all the hours she\u2019d talked to him?</p><p>Skye hadn\u2019t slept. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI want to hurt the man who did this to you, but he\u2019s gone.\u201d And she was there. Holding him. \u201cI need to confess something to you.\u201d</p><p>She heard the rustle of the curtain behind her.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t look away from Trace.</p><p>\u201cI would have killed Reese for you. I would have killed anyone to protect you.\u201d She swallowed, trying to ease the ache in her throat so that she could keep talking. \u201cI was never afraid of the darkness that you carried. Because inside, I\u2019ve got that same darkness. I think...I think I just hide it better than you do.\u201d</p><p>She hid her true self from everyone, but him.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve killed them. I would\u2019ve done anything for you.\u201d Her hand lifted. She brushed her fingers over his still cheek. \u201cI still will. I\u2019ll do anything, Trace, just please, please come back to me. Because there is one thing I can\u2019t do...I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to try.</p><p>A hand touched her shoulder. \u201cSkye.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s voice. He\u2019d heard her confession. She didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t care about anything but Trace.</p><p>\u201cHas there been any change?\u201d Alex asked her.</p><p>Her fingers slid back down to hold Trace\u2019s hand. \u201cNot yet. But there will be. He\u2019s coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s hand fell away from her. \u201cI heard that...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI heard that Claire Kramer and Drake Archer will be discharged soon.\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d They\u2019d healed. Trace would, too.</p><p>\u201cNoah York is improving. He lost a lot of blood, so the docs aren\u2019t ready to release him yet.\u201d Alex paused. \u201cNoah said that Weston saved his life, and Claire...she said you are the only reason she\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t look away from Trace. She just needed him to open his eyes. Once he opened his eyes, everything would be all right.</p><p>\u201cI saw Reese following me when I left the station. I\u2019d thought that Weston sent him after me.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her fingers over Trace\u2019s knuckles. Her engagement ring gleamed up at her. \u201cYou always think the worst of Trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he\u2019d killed Parker because he loved you and wanted you safe.\u201d Alex cleared his throat. \u201cBut we found evidence at Reese\u2019s place. Photos. He\u2019d been following Parker. Meeting with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they both wanted the same thing,\u201d Skye whispered. \u201cTo destroy Trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese was...involved with Sara. We showed one of Sara\u2019s neighbors a picture of him, and the neighbor confirmed that he\u2019d been there to visit her several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just using her. He used her, and he killed her.\u201d And Skye had trusted him.</p><p>When you put your trust in the wrong person, you opened yourself up for all kinds of hurt.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t think it was possible to hurt more than she did then.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand...\u201d Alex\u2019s shoulder brushed against hers. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why I didn\u2019t get killed, too. He had me. Reese knocked me out. He could\u2019ve killed me at any point.\u201d</p><p>Skye blinked at that. Finally, she pulled her gaze off Trace. Focused on the detective. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill you because you were going to be the killer.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>\u201cAnna Jean named you...she said that you\u2019d come to find her in Atlanta. She was tossing you out to us all, setting you up as the killer.\u201d Lying so easily. \u201cThen Trace ran over to Reese\u2019s place because Reese called and said that you were watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your gun that Reese used to shoot Trace, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>That was what she\u2019d thought. \u201cYou would\u2019ve been killed, eventually. At the right time\u2014a time that would match up with whatever scenario Reese planned to spin to the authorities. He would\u2019ve killed you, no doubt with Trace\u2019s gun. That way, everything would end tied up nicely. You went after the killer\u2014you shot Trace, but not before he fatally ended you.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze flashed to Trace. \u201cOnly the plan got fucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not soon enough.\u201d Because if she\u2019d just reached Trace sooner, then he wouldn\u2019t be in that hospital bed.</p><p>Silence from Alex. The heavy, rough silence that seemed to push against Skye\u2019s skin. Then, finally, he asked \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>She smoothed her fingers over Trace\u2019s. \u201cHe bounced back so quickly when Mitch shot him.\u201d Just a few weeks before. Why\u2014why couldn\u2019t they just have an easy life? \u201cBut I guess Reese was a better shot.\u201d Damn the bastard. \u201cThey\u2019ve operated on Trace so many times, trying to repair the damage from that bullet, but the doctors just\u2014\u201d She broke off and had to blink back her hears. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the doctors can\u2019t have more hope.\u201d She had plenty. There was no way that she would give up on Trace. \u201cHe survived before. He\u2019ll do it again.\u201d Please, Trace, cheat death again for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Skye.\u201d</p><p>So was she. \u201cIf you want to do something, then bring him back to me.\u201d Because that was the only thing that she wanted.</p><p>Alex pulled a chair closer to the bed.</p><p>A chair for her.</p><p>A chair for him.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like I owe that man my life,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>That man was her life.</p><p>They sat down, and they waited.</p><p>Skye was dead. Anna Jean had killed her. Sliced open Skye\u2019s throat. Let her blood drain out.</p><p>Skye was an angel with bloody wings. Dead on a snow covered field.</p><p>He\u2019d left her behind, and she\u2019d died.</p><p>Skye! Trace tried to scream her name. Again and again, but no sound slipped past his lips.</p><p>The cold froze him. Numbed him. And Skye was dead before him.</p><p>If she was gone, then he wanted to die, too. He couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t go years without her again.</p><p>Skye had been his hope. His only dream.</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>And he wanted to be with her.</p><p>The machines started to beep louder. Faster.</p><p>Skye shot out of her chair. Her knees locked as she stood at Trace\u2019s bedside. \u201cTrace?\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>He was coming back to her.</p><p>The beeping grew more frantic.</p><p>Alex rose from his chair. \u201cAh...Skye...\u201d</p><p>A nurse and two doctors rushed into the room. They pushed Skye back.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go back to the waiting room, miss,\u201d the nurse told Skye as she blocked her path to Trace. \u201cYou need to go now.\u201d</p><p>No way. Skye peered around the nurse\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s waking up! I\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood pressure\u2019s dropping...too damn low,\u201d one doctor muttered.</p><p>Alex caught Skye\u2019s hand. \u201cWe should go outside.\u201d He sounded so grim. So...sad?</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Skye yanked away from him. \u201cHe\u2019s waking up!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The nurse gave a slight shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d Skye jumped around the nurse. She shoved at the doctors. Fought to get to Trace. \u201cCome back to me! You promised.\u201d Her hands grabbed him. \u201cDon\u2019t you do this! Don\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p><p>One of the doctors tried to pry Skye\u2019s hand away from Trace. He\u2019d have to try a whole lot harder than that.</p> <p>\u201cMs. Sullivan, you have to leave. He\u2019s...\u201d The doctor\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to stabilize him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Skye yelled right back. \u201cYou\u2019re waiting for him to die, but I\u2019m not.\u201d Her hold on Trace was desperate. \u201cDon\u2019t go where I can\u2019t follow. Do you hear me? Don\u2019t you dare go where I can\u2019t follow. You promised me forever, Trace. That was your promise. But it hasn\u2019t been forever. It\u2019s been weeks. You. Promised. Me!\u201d</p><p>The cold had cracked around her.</p><p>The rage had bled out.</p><p>There was only pain left. So much anguish. So much grief. And it was tearing her apart.</p> <p>Skye\u2019s body vanished. The snow vanished.</p><p>Only the blood remained.</p><p>Skye? He tried to call out again, but his throat felt twisted. His speech was gone.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear anything around him. The silence was so complete.</p><p>And the blood began to darken.</p><p>\u201c...Promised me!\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of the silence, her voice was deafening.</p><p>Skye\u2019s voice.</p><p>She was close to him. He just had to find her. She was close. She was alive.</p><p>\u201c...Forever!\u201d</p><p>The darkness deepened. It grew. So complete. So total. So\u2014</p><p>Trace\u2019s eyes flew open. A room of white surrounded him. So bright.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d His head jerked at Skye\u2019s cry.</p><p>She was there. A man in white\u2014a doctor?\u2014had his arms around Skye as if he\u2019d been pulling her back.</p> <p>Trace tried to call out to her.</p><p>She tore free from the man\u2019s hold. \u201cYou came back!\u201d Tears were on her cheeks. Her eyes were so big and wide and so full of love. \u201cYou...came back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d someone muttered.</p><p>Trace\u2019s gaze flickered to the left. Alex stared at him, a wide smile on his face.</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t smile back. Everything hurt too badly right then.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d Skye whispered. She pressed a kiss to his check. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay again.\u201d</p><p>Skye was alive. She didn\u2019t have a trail of bloody wings in the snow. She was right next to him. Staring at him with love in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with me,\u201d she said, smiling at him. A smile that lit up his whole world.</p><p>No, she was his world.</p><p>The doctors worked on him, but Skye stayed close. She held his hand. He wouldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>He heard the doctor talk about breathing machines. Blood loss. Surgeries.</p><p>They took out the tube that had been in his throat. They poked him. They prodded him.</p><p>Skye stayed with him.</p><p>And when the doctors were done, she bent toward him and pressed a kiss to his lips. She still tasted like every dream he\u2019d ever had. The good dreams. The dreams that made a man want to live, even when death called to him.</p><p>\u201cYou kept your promise,\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>His throat felt as if it had been cut open. He swallowed. Once. Twice. Then he managed to say, \u201cHad to...keep.\u201d Hell, that had sounded like he was spitting out glass. Trace tried again and managed, \u201cWas...mine...to you...had to...keep.\u201d</p><p>But Skye shook her head. Her smile came again. The smile that told him everything was going to be all right.</p><p>Reese was gone. The betrayal, the pain, would always be there, but Trace didn\u2019t have to worry about the past coming back.</p><p>The threat was over. Dead.</p><p>Just like Anna Jean.</p><p>It was time to leave the dead behind. Time to focus on the living.</p><p>\u201cIt was your promise,\u201d Skye said. Her lips pressed lightly to his once more. \u201cBut you, Trace, you\u2019re mine, and I was ready to fight heaven and hell to keep you with me.\u201d</p><p>His promise. Her love.</p><p>Trace tried to sit up, to get closer to her, but he was so weak.</p><p>So Skye came to him. Carefully, slowly, she curled her body around his.</p><p>She held him. He held her.</p><p>The love that they had would keep them strong. Through whatever came in the future.</p><p>But he was damn well tired of death and danger. He was also sick of getting shot. He never wanted to see another hospital again.</p><p>He was ready for the promise of happiness that they deserved. And, for Skye, he\u2019d make sure they got that happiness.</p><p>Another promise for him to keep.</p><p>Trace stared into her eyes. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>And he saw love shining in her eyes, an endless love that stared back at him.</p><p>A love that would last forever.</p><p>I always keep my promises to Skye.</p><p>Always. </p> </body></html>"]
