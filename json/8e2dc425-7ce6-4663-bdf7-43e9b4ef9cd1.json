Pain rolled through her body, and she tried to fight it, tried to break free, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>The metal had twisted around her. It held her in a grip too tight and too hard, and every move she made just caused her to hurt even more.</p> <p>She screamed for help, but no one was there to save her.</p><p>The rain poured down, pelting through the broken windshield. Her car had rolled, again and again, down the incline. Would anyone from the road even be able to see her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d She screamed again.</p><p>Every part of her body hurt. Broken glass was all around her. The blood and rain mixed together on her face.</p><p>She begged for help until her voice broke.</p> <p>Until the rain stopped.</p><p>Until the pain finally stopped.</p><p>There was nothing left, nothing but the darkness.</p><p>It was in that darkness that she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here...I\u2019ve got you...\u201d</p><p>And when she heard him, she was afraid.</p> <p>Chapter One</p><p>Skye Sullivan stared up at the building before her. It shot high into the sky, its massive windows gleaming in the light. There were too many floors for her to count. Looking more like a fortress than an office, the place spoke of power.</p><p>And money. A lot of it.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d The doorman eyed her with a hint of concern in his dark eyes.</p><p>Probably because she was standing in the middle of the street, gawking up at the place. Skye gave a quick shake of her head, pulled her coat a bit closer around her, and hurried inside that fortress. Getting out of that icy Chicago air was a relief for her.</p><p>Another man waited behind the gleaming desk in the lobby. She glanced to the left and the right, and Skye nervously noted the security cameras that followed her every move.</p><p>Cautiously now, she approached the desk. \u201cI, um, I\u2019m looking for Trace Weston.\u201d</p><p>The man, in his early twenties and sporting a stylish blue suit, raised his brows at her. \u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d</p> <p>Not exactly. She\u2019d barely gathered the courage to actually head into this place. Twice that morning, she\u2019d turned around and almost gone back to her home.</p><p>I need him.</p><p>Skye straightened her shoulders. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have an appointment.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>She rushed on, saying, \u201cMy name is Skye Sullivan, and I-I\u2019m an...old friend of his.\u201d Okay, so that part that wasn\u2019t exactly the truth.</p><p>But she was desperate. No, more than that. She was scared.</p><p>When she\u2019d done a search looking for private detectives in the area, Weston Securities had immediately popped up on her computer screen. As soon as she\u2019d seen the name, Skye\u2019s whole body had tensed.</p><p>Trace Weston. Some men left a mark on a woman, a mark that went far beneath the skin.</p><p>Trace had marked her years before.</p><p>His company was way out of her price range, Skye got that. The lobby even smelled expensive. And, after the accident, pretty much everything was out of her range, but she didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>She had to get Trace to help her.</p><p>Besides, they had been friends once.</p><p>Before they\u2019d been lovers. Before everything had gone to hell.</p><p>The guy in the fancy suit looked down at his computer. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand just how busy Mr. Weston\u2019s schedule is, ma\u2019am. If you\u2019d like to speak with one of the junior associates here, I\u2019m sure that we can find someone available.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat thudded in her ears. A junior associate. Right. Well, that was certainly better than nothing.</p><p>The phone on the man\u2019s desk rang. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he murmured as he reached for the phone.</p><p>Skye nodded. Her cheeks were burning. Had she really thought that she could get Trace to help her? That she could just walk into this place and he\u2019d be there for her? After all the time that had passed, she\u2019d be lucky if the guy even remembered her.</p><p>If only I could have forgotten him.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, sir. Right now.\u201d A sharp note of nervousness had entered the man\u2019s voice.</p><p>Skye glanced back at him as he hurriedly put the phone down. His eyes, a warm gray, had come back to her. Now there was some definite curiosity in his stare. \u201cYou\u2019re to go right up, Ms. Sullivan.\u201d He pushed a clipboard toward her. \u201cSign in first, then I\u2019ll take you to the elevator.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid to the nearest security camera. Tension tightened her shoulders as she scribbled her name across the page. Then Skye hurried toward the elevators on the right. Don\u2019t limp. Don\u2019t. Take slow steps. Nice and slow.</p><p>\u201cNot that elevator.\u201d He caught her elbow and steered her to the left. \u201cThis one.\u201d He pulled a keycard from his pocket. Swiped it across the elevator\u2019s panel. The doors opened almost instantly, and he guided Skye inside. \u201cGo up to the top floor. Mr. Weston will be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>But Mr. Weston hadn\u2019t even known she was coming to the building. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d Skye began.</p><p>The doors slid closed.</p><p>Her hands trembled as the elevator shot up. The elevator\u2019s walls were made of glass and she turned, glancing out at the view of the city.</p><p>A lot could change for a person in ten years. You could go from having absolutely nothing...to having everything.</p><p>Or you could go from everything...to nothing.</p><p>The elevator slowed. Skye turned back toward the doors. She took a deep breath. Then those doors slid open.</p><p>Her shoes sank into lush carpet as she stepped out of the elevator.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at the pretty blonde woman who\u2019d rushed toward her.</p><p>The blonde smiled. \u201cThis way, please.\u201d</p><p>Trace had seen her on the video cameras. That was the only explanation. He\u2019d seen her, and he\u2019d actually remembered her.</p><p>Well, you were always supposed to remember your first, weren\u2019t you?</p><p>He\u2019d been her first. Once upon a time, he\u2019d been her everything.</p><p>The blonde opened a gleaming, mahogany door. \u201cMs. Sullivan is here, sir.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t limp. Skye stepped inside the office and saw him.</p><p>The man who\u2019d haunted her.</p><p>The man who\u2019d taught her about lust and loss.</p><p>Trace Weston.</p><p>He sat behind a massive desk. He\u2019d leaned back in his chair, and his head was tilted to the right as his eyes\u2014still the bluest that she\u2019d ever seen\u2014swept over her body. His hair was midnight black, cut to perfectly frame the strong planes of his face.</p><p>Handsome wasn\u2019t a word that could be used to describe Trace. It never had been. Sexy. Dangerous. Those were words for him.</p><p>The door shut behind Skye, sealing her inside the office with him.</p><p>Trace rose from his seat. He came toward her, his stride slow and certain. With every step that he took, she tensed, her body helpless to do otherwise.</p><p>\u201cH-hello, Trace.\u201d She hated that stupid break in her voice. Trace made her nervous. Always had.</p><p>He stopped in front of her. He stood at several inches over six feet, while she barely skimmed five feet three. Skye tilted her head back so that she could meet his stare.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Trace said, the words a deep, dark rumble. His voice went perfectly with the rock hard body and the sexy face\u2014a voice that a woman could imagine in the darkness.</p><p>She swallowed because her throat was suddenly dry. \u201cYes, it has.\u201d Ten years and three months. Not that she\u2019d counted.</p><p>That assessing gaze of his slid down her body once more. There was an awareness in his stare that she hadn\u2019t expected. A heat that made her remember too many things.</p><p>He was close enough to touch. Close enough for her to smell the crisp, masculine scent that clung to him.</p><p>His nostrils flared, as if he were catching her scent, too.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, Skye.\u201d Again, that heat was in his stare. A heat that said he knew her intimately.</p><p>She wished her heartbeat would slow down.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not here for a friendly chat, are you?\u201d And he stepped away from her. He waved to the open chair near his desk and returned to his seat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never really been the friendly chat kind,\u201d she said softly as she eased into the leather chair.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take off her coat. She just pulled it closer to her.</p><p>A faint furrow appeared between his brows. \u201cNo, we weren\u2019t, were we? More the hot sex type.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. He had not just said that to her.</p><p>His faint smile said that he had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for that, either.\u201d She\u2019d been wrecked after her last go round with Trace.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. The leather groaned beneath him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that...\u201d</p><p>Uh, no, they wouldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t ready to feel that burn again.</p><p>He tapped his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re not here for pleasantries, you\u2019re not here for sex, then why have you come looking for me?\u201d</p><p>This was where she\u2019d have to beg. Because there was no way she had enough money in her account to cover his services. Not with the guy sporting this high rise building and looking like he\u2019d just walked off the cover of GQ. How things have changed. \u201cSomeone is watching me.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. The heat banked in his eyes as his whole expression instantly became guarded. \u201cAnd what makes you so sure of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can feel him.\u201d Wait, that sounded crazy, didn\u2019t it? When she\u2019d gone to the cops, they\u2019d sure looked at her as if she were crazy. You couldn\u2019t feel a stalker. So they said.</p><p>She disagreed.</p><p>Trace wasn\u2019t speaking.</p><p>So she did the talking, saying quickly, \u201cI know someone has been watching me, okay? When I go to my studio, when I go out at night...\u201d A tenseness would slip over her. An awareness that was instinctive.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone is following you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t believing her any more than the cops had. \u201cI think,\u201d she stressed the word back to him as her hands clenched, \u201cthat someone has been in my house. Things are rearranged. They aren\u2019t where I put them. My doors are locked but someone has been getting in.\u201d</p><p>Now he leaned forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s been rearranged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCl-clothes.\u201d</p><p>His piercing stare stayed on her face.</p><p>\u201cUnderwear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSome panties are missing. Some...some are left on my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was exactly how she felt. \u201cCops aren\u2019t buying my feelings. They don\u2019t see any signs of a break-in at my apartment. And they think I just lost my laundry.\u201d</p><p>But she knew something else was happening.</p><p>She licked too dry lips. \u201cThis...this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened.\u201d</p><p>His hands had flattened on his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in New York...\u201d That seemed like a life-time away. \u201cThe same thing was happening before my accident. Someone would get into my apartment.\u201d At first, the whole thing had started harmlessly enough. Just with flowers. \u201cHe started by leaving flowers in my dressing room.\u201d She\u2019d gone into her dressing room after a performance and found them waiting for her. No note. Just the flowers.</p><p>Trace waited for her to continue.</p><p>Her chest ached as she said, \u201cThe next time I found the flowers, they were in my apartment. My locked apartment.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure the flowers weren\u2019t just a gift from a lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lover.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot then. Not now.\u201d</p><p>What she had was someone who was terrifying her. A shadow that seemed to follow her wherever she went. \u201cI came here because I was hoping that one of your agents might be able to help me. That you could assign someone to follow-up and just see what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>His gaze seemed to bore into her. She\u2019d always felt like Trace saw too deeply when he looked at her.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cThe police won\u2019t help me. I was hoping that you could.\u201d Skye kissed her pride good-bye. When this much fear was involved, there was no room for pride. She had secrets that she wasn\u2019t telling him, not yet. \u201cPlease, Trace. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me.\u201d Said instantly.</p><p>Her breath eased out. \u201cThank you.\u201d Tell him about the money. \u201cMaybe we can\u2014we can work out some kind of payment plan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the money.\u201d He rose from his desk again. Stalked toward her. Her head tilted back and her hair slid over her arm as she looked up at him.</p><p>He reached for her hand. Pulled her to her feet. At his touch\u2014just that one touch\u2014awareness poured through her. Heat flushed her cheeks. Memories tightened her body. That was the way it had always been between them. One touch and\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still there,\u201d Trace gritted out as his hold tightened on her hand. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be getting to that, soon enough.\u201d</p><p>The dark words were a promise.</p><p>\u201cBut right now, I want to find out what the hell is going on in your life.\u201d</p><p>So did she.</p><p>Skye Sullivan. Skye Fucking Sullivan. The girl who\u2019d starred in every teenage fantasy that he\u2019d ever had. The woman who\u2019d made him realize just how dark and wild lust could burn.</p><p>She\u2019d come back to him. Walked straight into his building. Into his life.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her image on the security screen. One look, and everything had changed.</p><p>She\u2019s back.</p><p>This time, things would end differently for them. He\u2019d never had his fill of Skye.</p><p>This time, she needs me.</p><p>They stepped outside of his building. The sounds of the city instantly filled his ears\u2014horns, voices, the backfire of engines. Skye eased away from him, heading for the cab at the corner of the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He caught her arm and pulled her right back against him. \u201cWe\u2019ll take my car.\u201d He\u2019d already called for his driver. The sleek, black ride was waiting to the right. The driver\u2014who doubled as one of Trace\u2019s guards\u2014held the back door open for them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be heading to Skye\u2019s apartment,\u201d Trace murmured to Reese Stokes.</p><p>Skye hesitated, then quickly rattled off the address.</p> <p>Reese nodded. Reese had been with Trace for over five years now, and Trace trusted the man implicitly.</p><p>Skye slid into the vehicle first, and when she did, her skirt lifted, revealing a silken expanse of leg covered in nylon.</p><p>Once upon a time, Skye had enjoyed wearing thigh-highs. He\u2019d bought them for her. Because he\u2019d loved the feel of them against her skin.</p><p>She disappeared into the car.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, memories swirling through his mind, Trace followed her. The door shut, sealing them inside. The privacy shield was already in place, completely blocking them from Reese\u2019s scrutiny.</p> <p>The car pulled away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cI thought one of your agents would handle this. I mean, you\u2019re the boss.\u201d Her words came a little too quickly. She\u2019d always done that. Spoken fast when she was nervous.</p><p>It\u2019s good that I still make her nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have time to spend on me.\u201d</p><p>On the contrary. He slid back into the seat next to her, making sure that their shoulders brushed. \u201cYou\u2019re not going back to New York.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked toward him. Her eyes\u2014deep, dark green\u2014met his. There was gold in her eyes, buried in the green. When she was aroused, the gold burned hotter.</p> <p>And when she was aroused, her cheeks flushed, her fuck-me lips trembled, and a moan would slip from her lips.</p><p>Skye Sullivan. Porcelain perfect. So delicate that he\u2019d once worried his passion might bruise her.</p><p>He still worried because the things he wanted from her...</p><p>I\u2019m not a boy any longer.</p><p>He\u2019d already held back with her for too long.</p><p>Her dark hair fell down her shoulders, long and silken. When she danced, she kept her hair pinned up, making her cheekbones look even sharper.</p><p>When she danced...</p><p>She made him ache.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me in New York any longer.\u201d Her voice was stilted. Not Skye. Skye spoke with humor and life. But when she\u2019d come into his office, finally come back to him, there had been fear in her voice\u2014and in her eyes. \u201cI was in an...accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The story had been all over the news. The prima ballerina who\u2019d been trapped in the wreckage of her car on a storm filled night. She\u2019d danced for thousands, she\u2019d lit up the stages in New York.</p><p>And she\u2019d barely survived that crash.</p><p>He forced air into his lungs. Don\u2019t think about it. She\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had physical therapy on my leg.\u201d Said with grim pride as her chin\u2014slightly pointed\u2014came into the air. \u201cI can dance, just not like...not like before.\u201d She gave a little shake of her head. \u201cThe stage won\u2019t be for me any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you came home?\u201d</p><p>Home. The only home he\u2019d ever had\u2014it had been with her.</p><p>Two foster kids. Tossed through the system again and again. He\u2019d met her when he was seventeen. She\u2019d been fifteen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I came back to Chicago,\u201d she agreed, voice husky. \u201cI\u2019m saving money to open a studio. I\u2019ll teach here. I can still do that.\u201d</p><p>Her dancing had gotten her out of poverty. Into the bright lights of studios and stages in New York. Her dancing had given her a new life.</p><p>And taken her from his.</p><p>\u201cThe money is a problem.\u201d She wasn\u2019t looking at him anymore. He wanted her eyes on his.</p><p>He leaned toward her. Caught her hand.</p><p>That made her gaze fly right back to his. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to pay you,\u201d she told him. \u201cI can do it, just give me some time.\u201d</p><p>His going rate\u2014for his newest junior agents, not for his personal services because he didn\u2019t go into the field any longer\u2014was three hundred an hour. \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>He had plenty of plans for her.</p><p>His fingers threaded through hers. His hand swallowed hers. His skin was rough and dark, tanned from the time he spent in the sun. Her hand was pale, almost fragile. So very breakable.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he always thought that about her? From the first moment he\u2019d seen her, when he\u2019d rushed into that room, hearing her scared cries...</p><p>Don\u2019t, please don\u2019t!</p><p>She\u2019d been his to save then.</p><p>His.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe way it used to be.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes were long. Her dark green eyes were so sexy. Her breath slipped out a little too quickly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d even remember me.\u201d</p><p>Only every damn minute. There were some things a man could never forget.</p><p>\u201cYou should have come to me sooner.\u201d He hated to think of her out there, afraid.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>\u201cThe last time we spoke,\u201d her voice seemed to stroke right over him, \u201cyou told me to get the hell out of your life. Coming back wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed.</p><p>His jaw had locked. You\u2019re not getting away so easily this time.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re here,\u201d she said and tugged on her hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t release her. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have a lover.\u201d Good. He didn\u2019t want to think of her with some other bastard.</p><p>Her gaze held his.</p><p>\u201cYou will, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTrace...\u201d</p><p>His name was a husky murmur from her. Denial and need all tied together.</p><p>Her lips were too close. She smelled too good. Sweet vanilla. Good enough to damn well eat.</p><p>He took her mouth. Not gently. Not softly. Because he\u2019d never been that kind of guy. Trace knew he wasn\u2019t the tender lover type.</p><p>He\u2019d fought for every single thing that he had. He\u2019d keep fighting.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth. She tasted even sweeter than she smelled. Her lips were soft and lush, and she was kissing him back. A low moan rose in her throat, and her tongue slid lightly against his.</p><p>He\u2019d been the one to teach her how to kiss.</p><p>And to fuck.</p><p>He deepened the kiss, needing more, so much more from her than he could get right then. She\u2019d come to him because she was afraid, but he wasn\u2019t interested in her fear. He wanted her passion. He wanted her.</p><p>She pulled back. Her lips were wet and red from his mouth.</p><p>His addiction. The one that he\u2019d never been able to ditch.</p><p>No matter how much money he got, no matter how many women came into his bed, Skye was the one he wanted, the one that he would have.</p><p>There was a price for everything in this world. He knew that lesson well.</p><p>Skye would pay a price.</p><p>So would he.</p><p>It was a good thing he could afford that price this time.</p><p>She nearly jumped from the car when he let her go. He exited slowly, far too aware of the ache for her\u2014and of the arousal that wasn\u2019t going away.</p><p>Sunlight glinted down on him. Early spring, but still cold because that was the way of his city. He ignored the chill and stared up at the apartment complex. Older, in a more rundown area just outside of the city.</p><p>When she\u2019d been in New York, her place had been so much bigger\u2014so close to the lights of Broadway.</p><p>The hospital bills had taken a lot of her money. He knew that. He knew so much more than she realized.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he told Reese and then Trace followed Skye to the building. Security at her apartment was non-existent. Anyone could walk right in...</p><p>And they did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the third floor,\u201d Skye said.</p><p>The top floor.</p><p>\u201cThe elevator is getting fixed right now, so...\u201d She turned for the stairs.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cCan your leg handle that climb?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders snapped up. Ah, there it was. Her fierce pride. One of the things that had so drawn him to her. \u201cYes. I can handle it.\u201d And she didn\u2019t look back as she started on the stairs. But he noticed she clung a little too tightly to the banister.</p><p>He followed behind her, easily closing the distance that separated them, and he stayed one stair behind her, all the way up.</p><p>His gaze noted everything. The peeling paint on the walls. The lights that flickered. The lights that weren\u2019t on at all.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>Then they were on the third floor. There were three other doors on that floor, but she took him to apartment 301. He stopped her before she could put her key in the lock. Trace bent, inspecting the old, golden lock. No scratch marks to indicate that someone had tried to pick it. There were no signs of tampering at all.</p><p>He eased back. She unlocked the door. It opened with a groan of sound, the hinges ancient and obviously in need of oil. Skye hurried inside, stumbling just a little, before she flipped on the lights.</p><p>The apartment was small but so very Skye. Bright colors lit the walls, comfortable furniture filled the interior. The curtains were pulled back near the windows, letting the light spill inside.</p><p>The place smelled of her.</p><p>He advanced toward the windows. The fire escape led all the way up to her floor. The windows were locked there, and, again, he didn\u2019t see any sign of tampering.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d She stood a few feet behind him. \u201cThe detective\u2014Griffin\u2014didn\u2019t find any sign of a break-in, either. But I\u2019m telling you, someone has been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say that I didn\u2019t believe you?\u201d He glanced back at her.</p><p>Skye shook her head.</p><p>\u201cTake me to your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She rocked back a step.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where he goes, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Trace didn\u2019t let any emotion enter his voice. Now wasn\u2019t the time for emotion.</p><p>Skye spun away and walked down the narrow hallway. She opened another door. \u201cIt\u2019s...here.\u201d</p><p>He brushed past her and stepped inside the small room. The bed was wooden, an old four-poster. A chest of drawers\u2014one that had been painted a bright blue\u2014waited to the left. A matching dresser stood to the right.</p><p>Nothing looked disturbed in her room. \u201cWhen is the last time you think he was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she said as her gaze went to the bed. \u201cWhen I came home last night, my\u2014my underwear was left on the bed.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the bed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave them there,\u201d she continued, voice tight. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t. Someone is playing some kind of game with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a game.\u201d Trace glanced away from the bed and back at her. Skye hadn\u2019t moved away from the door. \u201cI think someone is stalking you.\u201d He paused. \u201cSomeone like this can be very, very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were on his.</p><p>\u201cTo break into your home, to follow you...\u201d He lifted his hand and brushed back the hair that had slipped over her shoulder. \u201cIt sounds like the guy is fixated on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find him, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. My agents will watch your place. No one will get in here again.\u201d</p><p>Her breath whispered out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get better locks on your doors and windows.\u201d He\u2019d do a hell of a lot more than that. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be safer...\u201d He had to say it. \u201cIf you came back home with me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cTrace...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it would be the first time, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She retreated. Her back hit the door frame. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t come to you...for that.\u201d</p><p>That. The storm of lust and need and want that had consumed them before.</p><p>The uncontrolled desire had almost destroyed them both.</p><p>\u201cI need your help, Trace, but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all he wanted. But he\u2019d give her this moment. Soon enough, she\u2019d be coming to him.</p><p>I know her weaknesses.</p><p>Trace inclined his head. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get your protection started. It\u2019s the least I can do for my old...friend.\u201d Once more, his body brushed past hers. The tension rolled off her as he headed into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWe were, once.\u201d</p><p>Her voice halted him.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends before we were anything more.\u201d Her words were soft, like a whispered confession.</p><p>Yes, they had been friends, but they\u2019d lost that, long ago.</p><p>He pulled out his phone even as he headed for the front door. As soon as the front door closed, he demanded, \u201cI want agents at Skye Sullivan\u2019s apartment.\u201d The address came from him as a curt bark. \u201cNew locks. A video camera and alarm inside.\u201d She didn\u2019t even have an alarm. \u201cI want a team watching the place.\u201d He remembered the way her hand had gripped the banister. \u201cAnd I want the fucking elevator fixed.\u201d</p><p>His orders would be obeyed. His staff jumped at his command. He wasn\u2019t the abandoned, penniless kid anymore. He had the power now.</p><p>Trace glanced over his shoulder at Skye\u2019s closed apartment door.</p><p>He had the power, and he was going to use it.</p><p>The dream came again. It snuck up on him when he was tired or when she got into his mind too much.</p><p>He found himself back in that old house. The one with the roof that sagged. With carpets that had been worn bare.</p><p>Another home. Another place.</p><p>His first night there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, please...\u201d</p><p>The voice had called out to him.</p><p>He\u2019d been on his feet before he\u2019d thought twice. On his feet and on his way to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dream took over.</p><p>His fist shoved open the wooden door, revealing a small bedroom. He hadn\u2019t seen that one when they\u2019d brought him in to the house earlier that day. Two people were on the bed. The boy\u2014his new \u201cbrother\u201d Parker. The other was the girl...the one with the long hair and the sad eyes.</p><p>The pretty girl who\u2019d been too shy to speak to him before.</p> <p>But he was sure her voice had been the one calling to him, begging, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t speaking anymore. Wasn\u2019t crying out, not pleading.</p><p>Because Parker had his hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Trace demanded.</p><p>\u201cGet out, man, get out!\u201d Parker snapped back, but he kept his voice low.</p> <p>So his parents wouldn\u2019t hear?</p><p>Trace\u2019s gaze shot to the girl. Tears leaked from her eyes. Parker had one hand over her mouth, and one of his hands pinned her small wrists to the bed.</p><p>Rage pushed through Trace. \u201cGet off her, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Parker said again, \u201cor I\u2019ll tell my parents to ship your ass out of here. This is my house, I say what\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get to say anything else. Trace knocked the guy off her. He drove his fist into Parker\u2019s face, again and again. Bones broke. Blood spurted. Trace kept hitting him.</p><p>\u201cStop! You\u2019re going to kill him!\u201d Her voice. Her hands on him.</p> <p>Trace\u2019s eyes flew open as the dream\u2014his past\u2014vanished.</p><p>His hands were clenched into fists.</p><p>Skye needed him again.</p><p>I won\u2019t let her down.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Skye stared at her reflection. Too pale. Too thin. She didn\u2019t look like a star who belonged in the center of the lights.</p><p>That\u2019s not who I am.</p><p>Sometimes, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever really been that woman.</p> <p>Her hands reached for the barre. She\u2019d installed it herself. Just gotten the mirrors positioned a few moments ago. Right after she\u2019d finished up the paint job. Done it all\u2014herself. There was a grim pride in her accomplishment. She\u2019d sweated blood and tears for this place.</p><p>The studio had taken the last of her money. She\u2019d put down her deposit and paid rent for a half a year. Skye knew that opportunity\u2014that precious six months\u2014was her chance. To do something. To get her life back.</p><p>The studio was hers. She would make it work.</p><p>Only the image staring back at her in the mirror didn\u2019t look so certain.</p><p>Skye rose onto her toes, ignoring the twinge in her left calf. That twinge would soon turn to an ache, but she\u2019d ignore that, too. She\u2019d grown used to ignoring pain over the years. That was the first rule of dancing. No pain. If your body was weak, you ignored the weakness. You danced until your feet bled. Then you went out onto the stage, and you danced some more.</p><p>Her arms stretched. Her back arched. Her first dance class would start in three days. That would give her just enough time to\u2014</p><p>The lights turned off. Every single light shut off at once, plunging her into total darkness.</p><p>Her heels hit the hardwood floor. The circuit breaker. Dammit, this same problem had happened before. Only then it had been daytime and sunlight had trickled through the windows, providing enough illumination for her to see. Now, there was just night to deepen the darkness.</p><p>She kept her hand on the barre as she made her way to the door. The building manager had promised her that the problem had been fixed.</p><p>This isn\u2019t fixed. This is\u2014</p><p>A faint rustle of sound reached her ears.</p><p>Like a shoe. The quick press of a footstep.</p><p>Skye froze. \u201cIs...is someone there?\u201d When she\u2019d left her apartment, Trace\u2019s men had been installing new locks and an alarm system. One of the men had even followed her to the dance studio. She was supposed to be safe.</p><p>The floor squeaked. She knew that squeak. There was a weak spot near the front door. Every time she came inside the studio, she stepped in that spot and the floor squeaked beneath her.</p><p>Not alone.</p><p>She stopped advancing toward the door. Instead, she backed up, fast.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d A rasp of her name.</p><p>Turning, she ran away from that rasp.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t get far. Hard hands grabbed her and locked tight around her stomach. He spun her around and jerked her against his body\u2014and those hands holding her so tightly hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching...\u201d His voice was still a rasp. A terrifying rasp. He was bigger than she was. So much bigger and stronger, and he held her easily when she twisted against him.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t covered her mouth. His mistake. \u201cHelp me!\u201d She screamed as loudly as she could.</p><p>Trace\u2019s agent was outside. He\u2019d hear her. He\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Her attacker slammed her into the mirror. The glass cracked and shattered around her. His fingers pressed over her mouth, reminding her of a nightmare from her past that wouldn\u2019t ever stop.</p><p>Her head ached where it had hit the mirror. The wooden barre shoved into her back.</p><p>His breath blew against the shell of her ear. \u201cI will be the one,\u201d he told her, voice low and hard.</p><p>She lifted her knee. Tried to shove it into his groin, but he was already pulling back.</p><p>Even as the sound of footsteps pounded toward her.</p><p>Footsteps\u2014and a light?</p><p>\u201cMs. Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>She clung to the barre. It seemed to be the only thing holding her up right then. He was here. He was here.</p><p>The flashlight hit her in the face. \u201cMs. Sullivan, what happened? I heard you cry for help.\u201d It was her guard\u2014Reese Stokes. She recognized his deep voice and that faint Alabama accent. If she could have moved, Skye would have hugged that man right then. Instead, she managed to say, \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>That flashlight immediately swept the room, cutting through the darkness. But finding no one.</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Reese asked her as he came closer. He put his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Skye said again. Trace had warned her, he\u2019d told her...He\u2019s dangerous. He\u2019d been right. If Reese hadn\u2019t been there, what would her attacker have done?</p><p>\u201cSkye?\u201d</p><p>At that familiar, deep voice, she tensed in Reese\u2019s arms. Trace.</p><p>The lights flooded back on at that moment, coming with a brightness that almost hurt her eyes.</p><p>Trace rushed toward her. He pulled her from Reese. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said someone was here.\u201d Reese seemed to have just noticed the broken glass.</p><p>\u201cGo. Search,\u201d Trace ordered as he pulled Skye even closer to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got her.\u201d</p><p>Pieces of the broken mirror had fallen to the floor. They crunched beneath Trace\u2019s expensive shoes.</p><p>Reese hurried away from them. When he ran away, Skye saw the gun in his hand.</p><p>Her breath choked out. Why is this happening?</p><p>Trace\u2019s fingers slid through her hair. He growled, \u201cDammit, you could have a concussion.\u201d</p><p>What she had was a giant knot on her head. One that was making her dizzy and nauseous. Wait, was that a concussion?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here.\u201d</p><p>Before she could say anything else, he\u2019d lifted her into his arms. He held her easily, as if she weighed nothing at all, and he hurried for the door.</p><p>Then they were outside. The crisp air hit her, pushing back some of the nausea, but not doing a thing to alleviate her fear. The fear had far too tight of a grip on her.</p><p>Trace carried her toward a dark Jag. He opened the door and sat her inside on the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen him in ten years. So why was she so ridiculously glad that he was the one there with her? \u201cI was practicing...the lights went out. I-I thought it as the breaker. It\u2019s gone out before and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her chin in his hand. \u201cWhen did the man come?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWhen it went dark. I heard the floor squeak, and I knew he was there.\u201d She licked her too-dry lips. \u201cI tried to run, but he caught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he...\u201d Trace\u2019s words were gritted, \u201cwhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flickered as she remembered. \u201cHe slammed my head into the mirror. Reese came in...before he could do anything else.\u201d</p><p>I will be the one.</p><p>Her hands were shaking. She balled them into fists in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital,\u201d Trace said again, anger snapping in the words. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a concussion. You need to be checked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d Reese rushed toward them. \u201cI searched the building, but no one\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted down the street. There were other buildings, a few shops nearby, but they were all closed for the night.</p><p>\u201cStay here. Get back-up on the scene,\u201d Trace ordered Reese. \u201cI want that SOB. And we\u2019re getting him.\u201d</p><p>Then he slammed her door shut. She watched him through the window, chill bumps rising on her skin. Trace leaned close to Reese. Whispered something that she couldn\u2019t hear. The chill bumps got worse. Skye felt so cold then. So very cold.</p><p>Trace turned away from Reese and stalked back toward her. The driver\u2019s door opened. Trace slid inside the vehicle, and the engine growled to life.</p><p>I will be the one.</p><p>The words wouldn\u2019t stop whispering through her mind.</p><p>The car\u2019s engine snarled to life, and the Jag shot into the night.</p><p>She looked back. Reese stood there, staring after them. Her studio was lit up, every light glowing.</p><p>And the monster who\u2019d been in the dark\u2014he was long gone.</p><p>But he\u2019ll be back.</p><p>The cold sank down, penetrating all the way to her bones.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely concussed,\u201d the doctor said as she shone a light into Skye\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Trace crossed his arms over his chest. He\u2019d moved back so the doctor could work on Skye, but he hadn\u2019t been about to leave the small exam room. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to let Skye out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need you to stay overnight for observation,\u201d Dr. Denise Bond told Skye as she lowered her light. \u201cIt\u2019s a precaution in a situation like this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Skye said, her immediate denial cutting through the doctor\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you realize how dangerous a concussion could be.\u201d The doctor spoke carefully, still in that soothing bedside manner that some docs managed so easily. \u201cBrain injuries are unpredictable. Your concussion appears mild now, but what if you have a seizure in the middle of the night? What if you fall...is there someone at your home that can help you?\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s green gaze darted to Trace, then back to the doctor. \u201cI-I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019ll be alone.</p><p>The doctor glanced back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the patient,\u201d Skye reminded her. Trace rather liked the snap of anger in her voice. Before, Skye had been afraid. She\u2019d been shaking when he first rushed inside that studio.</p><p>Reese should have been taking better care of her. The agent had screwed up.</p><p>No, I screwed up. I should have kept her closer. Too much time had been wasted.</p><p>\u201cAre you...involved with the patient?\u201d The doctor asked him, obviously trying to figure out his relationship with Skye.</p><p>He nodded. She didn\u2019t need to know more. \u201cShe won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension eased from the doctor\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to keep her awake. Monitor her through the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d Skye began.</p><p>\u201cConsider it done,\u201d he said.</p><p>The doctor nodded, looking grateful. \u201cI\u2019ll go prepare discharge orders.\u201d But then she hesitated. \u201cYou will keep a close eye on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closest possible,\u201d Trace promised.</p><p>The doctor hurried from the room, and Trace headed toward the exam table. He locked eyes with Skye. Forgot about the doctor. \u201cThis is the way it will play out. You come with me, or you spend the night here.\u201d</p><p>Bright spots of color stained her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been inside hospitals long enough. After the accident, I had weeks of therapy. I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>His hands pressed into the exam table on either side of her. \u201cThen you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d She\u2019d been the one to walk into his office. To return to him. He wasn\u2019t about back away now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s accelerated,\u201d Trace told her as he leaned in close. The room smelled like antiseptic, but she smelled of sweet vanilla. He was close enough to see the gold in her eyes. \u201cHe snuck past my guard. He got to you. He hurt you.\u201d Trace barely held back his fury. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you on your own until that SOB is off the streets.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the door then. He glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis is Detective Alex Griffin!\u201d A voice called. \u201cSkye, I need to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s eyes narrowed. He\u2019d been wondering when the local boys in blue would be showing up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s been handling my case,\u201d Skye murmured. \u201cThe doctors...they must have called the police in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were assaulted.\u201d Trace knew the notification would have been standard protocol.</p><p>\u201cI guess he has to believe me now,\u201d she said, voice tense.</p><p>His gaze cut back to her. Skye was clad in a one of those green paper hospital gown. She looked so fragile sitting on that table. Her eyes were huge. Her hair a dark curtain around her face.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d The detective called again.</p><p>And, before she could respond, the guy began to open the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trace moved quickly so that when the door opened, he was right in the cop\u2019s path.</p><p>Alex Griffin jerked to a halt when he saw Trace. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s brows rose as he studied the detective. In his early thirties, light blond hair, fit, and with a dark stare that heated a little too much when it peered over Trace\u2019s shoulder and focused on Skye. The guy immediately put Trace on edge. \u201cI\u2019m Skye\u2019s friend,\u201d he said simply, but Trace knew the other man would hear the note of possessiveness that roughened his voice.</p> <p>Alex stepped around him. Seemed to focus totally on Skye. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was forced. It barely lifted her lips. \u201cJust a bump on the head. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Then the detective actually reached out to her and curled his hand around hers.</p><p>Trace tensed. What the hell kind of police work was that? The detective was far too cozy with Skye, especially for a guy who hadn\u2019t believed her story about a stalker.</p><p>\u201cThe attack changes things,\u201d Alex told her as his fingers skimmed over her knuckles. \u201cThis is an assault. I can get a team at\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy team is already at her studio,\u201d Trace said as he returned to Skye\u2019s side. The detective was still holding her hand. Still staring at Skye with far too much interest. Still pissing Trace off to an alarming degree. \u201cBut your officers are certainly welcome to join the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour team?\u201d Alex repeated as his brow furrowed. Then his stare\u2014a muddy brown\u2014was back on Trace. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d</p><p>Because he hadn\u2019t thrown it. He did now, with pleasure. \u201cTrace Weston.\u201d Deliberately, he took Skye\u2019s hand from the detective.</p><p>Alex backed up a step. \u201cWeston Securities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Alex whistled and glanced back at Skye. \u201cYou hired him to keep you safe?\u201d Before Skye could answer, Alex continued, \u201cI don\u2019t get it. If Weston Securities was on the case, why the hell did she get hurt? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be the best in the damn area?\u201d</p> <p>His hold tightened on Skye. \u201cIf we\u2019re asking questions, I\u2019ve got a few of my own...like why the hell didn\u2019t you do your job sooner? Someone has been stalking Skye for weeks.\u201d No, much longer if she\u2019d been watched in New York.</p><p>\u201cBecause there was no evidence,\u201d Alex gritted out. \u201cBut I tried, okay? I sent extra patrols to her house. I dropped by whenever I could. I\u2019ve been trying to keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>The guy wanted to keep more than an eye on her. That much was obvious to Trace. The detective\u2019s expression was too intense when he glanced her way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, detective,\u201d Trace said, his voice flat, \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on her from now on.\u201d</p><p>Skye looked between them. Her lips tightened. \u201cI just want this man caught, okay? I want him stopped!\u201d She pulled away from Trace and slid from the exam table. When her feet hit the floor, Trace was there to brace her, just in case.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything that happened,\u201d Alex told her, hunching his shoulders as he leaned in closer to her.</p><p>Back the hell off. Skye didn\u2019t need the cop crowding her.</p><p>Skye had come to Trace because there hadn\u2019t been anyone else to help her. The detective didn\u2019t get to step in now and play hero.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell.\u201d The hospital gown slipped off her right shoulder and she tried to quickly pull it back into place. \u201cI was working in my studio. The lights went off. I-I heard the creak of the floor and knew someone was there. I tried to run, but h-he caught me.\u201d</p> <p>Trace had locked his back teeth while she spoke. Bastard, I\u2019m going to make you pay.</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Alex pounced on that word choice. \u201cYou\u2019re sure it was a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see him.\u201d Her stare darted to Trace. \u201cBut I could feel him. He was strong, and he was big...about Trace\u2019s height. His body curved over mine when he\u2014he held me against him.\u201d Her voice broke a little.</p><p>Trace wanted her out of that room. He wanted her in his home, where he could protect her.</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything to you?\u201d Alex pressed. \u201cDid you hear any kind of accent in his voice? Did he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo accent.\u201d She shook her head. Winced a little. \u201cHe was just whispering to me.\u201d</p><p>Alex stilled. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018I will be the one,\u2019\u201d she told them, her voice husky. She blinked quickly, as if fighting tears. \u201cThat\u2019s all he told me, okay?\u201d Those words came out rushed. \u201cThat he\u2019d be the one. Then Trace\u2019s agent came rushing in and\u2014and the guy let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he slammed your head into the glass,\u201d Trace added, the words tearing from him.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, he slammed my head into the glass before he gave me his little promise.\u201d She curled her arms around her stomach. Stared up at Trace. \u201cPlease take me home,\u201d she said. \u201cTake me home with you.\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>The doctor and a nurse headed into the room then. The doc glanced Trace\u2019s way. He inclined his head. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s safe tonight.\u201d Every night.</p><p>He and the detective headed out while the nurse helped Skye change. Trace would have been more than happy to do that job himself\u2014seeing Skye nude was one of his favorite things\u2014but he needed to clear the air with the detective.</p><p>And it seemed the guy wanted to clear the air with him, too. As soon as the door closed behind them, Alex spun toward Trace. \u201cWhat\u2019s your game?\u201d</p><p>He let his brows rise. \u201cI\u2019m not playing a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago, Skye told me that she wasn\u2019t involved with anyone. She didn\u2019t have any family in the city, no close friends...\u201d Alex exhaled roughly as he glared at Trace. \u201cNow you\u2019re standing here, saying you\u2019re her \u2018old friend\u2019 and taking her home for the night.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was exactly what he was doing. Wasn\u2019t the detective observant? \u201cSkye doesn\u2019t like hospitals. After her accident in New York, I think that\u2019s understandable.\u201d He didn\u2019t like to think about her accident. Didn\u2019t like to remember\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you, Weston.\u201d</p><p>Good for the detective. \u201cMost people in Chicago know about me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got money, a freaking ton of it from all accounts.\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, he did. He\u2019d come a long way from being the poor kid on the streets.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got dangerous connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe connections aren\u2019t any fun,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re high profile. You take the big cases. You don\u2019t sign on as some woman\u2019s bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>If the detective kept pushing, he\u2019d find out just how hard Trace could push back. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some woman,\u201d Trace said. Time for his turn to talk. \u201cThis is Skye, and, I assure you, where she is concerned, I am very involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t two days ago,\u201d Alex fired back.</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago...\u201d Trace exhaled slowly and fought to chain his anger. \u201cThat would have been back when you were patrolling, doing your circles around her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Alex hissed. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to protect her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m here to help you do that job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like you were here to fuck her.\u201d</p><p>The words were low, hard. Jealous?</p><p>Trace stepped toward the detective. The fellow was close to his height, and even though he was a cop, he had a soft look to him that told Trace this man hadn\u2019t seen nearly enough darkness in his life.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen plenty.</p><p>Enough to appreciate the light that came his way.</p><p>Alex pointed his index finger at Trace. Bad move\u2014that\u2019s the way to get that finger broken. \u201cI\u2019ve got a woman being stalked,\u201d Alex snapped, \u201can attack on her\u2014and suddenly, I have a new guy\u2014wait, sorry, an \u2018old friend\u2019\u2014who has just entered the picture. Two days ago, she said that she had no one.\u201d</p><p>He kept harping on the two days bit. \u201cShe has someone,\u201d Trace told him, keeping his voice flat with a monumental effort. \u201cAnd until the SOB after her is caught, Skye be staying with me. So if you need to contact her,\u201d he gave him a hard smile, \u201ccome find me.\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind them. Skye was seated in a wheelchair, and she sure didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cThey said I had to go out in this thing.\u201d Her hands lightly hit the wheels. \u201cSome kind of hospital rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiability issue,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStandard. Right.\u201d Skye\u2019s hands rose and clenched in her lap. Her frantic gaze locked on Trace. \u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>He moved behind the wheelchair. Pushed her carefully. The wheels spun on the chair.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>The detective was a dick, and he\u2019d just snapped Trace\u2019s last nerve. Did the fellow realize that, with just one phone call, Trace could have the guy writing parking tickets? Doing traffic patrol?</p><p>Or sitting bench at desk duty?</p><p>Alex hurried around them and stopped in front of the wheelchair. \u201cJust how long have you known Weston?\u201d</p><p>Skye swallowed. \u201cSince I was fifteen years old.\u201d</p><p>Alex leaned toward her. His voice dropped, but Trace heard him clearly as he said, \u201cI asked you to tell me about any ex\u2019s that you might have in town. Someone who might have a hard time letting go...\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cTrace never had trouble letting go.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s stare swept to his.</p><p>He knows.</p><p>It was easy to recognize need, lust, in another man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Behind the cop, Trace saw Reese striding down the hallway toward them. Trace inclined his head toward the cop. \u201cMake sure the detective has our contact information, Reese. Skye\u2019s going to be staying with me for a while.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned toward him. \u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pushed her down the hall, leaving Reese to deal with Alex.</p><p>The detective could become a problem. Trace would have to watch him, carefully.</p><p>Because no one could be allowed to interfere with his plans for Skye.</p><p>She should have expected the penthouse. The elevator doors opened up, and she stepped out onto the top level of the high-rise. Trace was right at her side.</p><p>\u201cNo one can get up here without passing my guards,\u201d he told her as his fingers curled around her elbow.</p><p>Right then, she was sure glad to hear about that security.</p><p>They entered the penthouse. Her gaze swept around the place. Everything looked expensive. Everything smelled expensive.</p><p>And the view was killer.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been scared to death, literally shaking apart on the inside, she would have appreciated that view more right then.</p><p>As it was, she just wanted to go someplace and collapse.</p><p>The door shut behind them. She heard the sound of the alarm engaging. Then...Trace\u2019s hands slid down her arms. Her bare arms because all she\u2019d had to wear out of that hospital were her workout clothes. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, Skye.\u201d His words whispered into her ear.</p><p>And the fear deepened. Because she remembered him. The man in the dark. His mouth at her ear. His whisper.</p><p>I will be the one.</p><p>She pulled away from Trace and headed toward the big, floor to ceiling window that looked out over Chicago.</p><p>He didn\u2019t follow her.</p><p>His voice did. Trace told her, \u201cI\u2019m having a top-of-the-line security system installed at your studio. And a damn electrician is going in to check your lights.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her arms. No matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t seem to shake the chill from her body. Her gaze stared out at the city. It seemed like she could see forever from this vantage.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop your life for me,\u201d she made herself speak when she just wanted to stand in silence. \u201cI\u2019m sure having me here...in your home...it\u2019s going to cramp your style.\u201d She\u2019d read the papers. She knew all about his many, many exploits.</p><p>Trace certainly wasn\u2019t a man living in the past.</p><p>He was too busy seducing in the present.</p><p>That was why she hadn\u2019t told Alex about him. When the detective had asked for a list of lovers in the area, anyone who might be fixated on her, Trace had been the last man to come to her mind.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t fixated on her. He\u2019d been the one to show her to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t cramping my style.\u201d</p><p>She could see her reflection in the glass. She looked lost. Carefully, Skye schooled her features before she turned back to face him. \u201cWon\u2019t the flavor of the week mind?\u201d She\u2019d seen him with some blonde just last week in the variety pages\u2014</p><p>\u201cFuck it if anyone minds.\u201d He\u2019d braced his legs apart. He stood staring at her. Behind him, a fire blazed. When had he started that fire? \u201cThis isn\u2019t about anyone but you and me.\u201d</p><p>He acted as if the last ten years hadn\u2019t happened. But not once, not once, had he tried to contact her. I missed you. She wouldn\u2019t tell him that, though. She\u2019d already broken her pride for him too many times.</p><p>He began walking toward her. His stride was slow, certain. She wanted to back up, but there was no place to go.</p><p>Sucking in a sharp breath, Skye lifted her head and stared into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReese called me when he was rushing inside that studio. He\u2019d seen the lights go dark, and he was worried. I was only five minutes away, already coming to see you, and I couldn\u2019t get there fast enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been in trouble. Back in New York, Skye had thought for certain that she was facing death. The memory of cold rain, of constant pain, flashed through her mind.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t come to me then.</p><p>\u201cTen years is a long time,\u201d she said. She hated the softness of her voice. Why couldn\u2019t she act as if the past didn\u2019t matter to her? \u201cA lot can change over all those years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd a lot can stay the same.\u201d His fingers curled under her jaw. \u201cI want you just as much now as I did then. When I saw you in my office, the same need hit me. Lust tore through me the way it always does when I\u2019m near you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were trembling. She lifted them and put her palms on his chest. Skye wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to pull him closer or shove him away.</p><p>\u201cLust was never a problem for us, though, was it?\u201d Skye whispered. His eyes were on her mouth.</p><p>Memories of their past flashed through her mind. She could almost taste him.</p><p>\u201cI was your first.\u201d</p> <p>Heat flushed her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI thought about you over the years...\u201d</p><p>His confession jolted her.</p><p>\u201cI wondered what you were doing...who you were with...\u201d</p><p>His gaze was still on her mouth. Still hot. Her hyperawareness of him pushed the aches and pains from her mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to wonder about that.\u201d Not when he\u2019d been the one to tell her to hit the curb. He didn\u2019t have that right.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t control.\u201d His head bent toward her. \u201cThe way I feel about you is one of those things.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted his mouth. She wanted to run from him. \u201cTrace...\u201d</p><p>His lips feathered over hers. Not taking. Not demanding. Soft. Gentle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have what I want tonight, I know that,\u201d his words were whispered against her lips. \u201cBut you came back to me. And you should know...that changes everything. I let you go once. You can\u2019t expect me to do that again.\u201d</p><p>Let her go? She pushed against him now. \u201cYou told me to get the hell out of your life.\u201d Skye stumbled as she hurried away from him.</p><p>\u201cI knew what your dreams were. I wasn\u2019t going to stand in your way. You wanted the stage. You wanted to dance.\u201d</p><p>His words froze her.</p><p>She looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI gave you what you wanted.\u201d A muscle jerked in his jaw. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what I\u2019ve always done? Given you every damn thing that you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You haven\u2019t.\u201d Because there was one thing she\u2019d wanted desperately but never gotten.</p><p>The faint lines near his eyes tightened. His face was a dangerous mask in the firelight. \u201cWhat did you want?\u201d</p><p>You. He was the thing she\u2019d wanted most, more than dancing, more than New York, more than getting out of the hell that her life had been when she\u2019d been a teenager.</p><p>But Trace hadn\u2019t given her a choice. He\u2019d taken her choices away.</p><p>\u201cWhat. Did. You. Want?\u201d</p><p>He was coming toward her again.</p><p>Escape.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my room?\u201d Her gaze flew frantically around the penthouse. \u201cI-I need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>He kept coming. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep. I have to keep you awake. Those were the doctor\u2019s orders. She gave me a whole list of rules for you to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t sleep.\u201d I need space. She spun away from him. Her head was throbbing again. She hurried down the darkened hallway.</p><p>He was right behind her.</p><p>She threw open the first door that she saw.</p><p>Not the guest room.</p><p>This room was masculine. Filled with heavy, cherry wood furniture. A massive bed. She could even see Trace\u2019s suit coat flung on the end of the bed\u2014</p><p>She darted back around and found him in her path. His arms were up, blocking the door.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stay where I can keep an eye on you,\u201d he told her, voice rumbling.</p><p>\u201cY-you agreed to find the man who is\u2014who is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalking you?\u201d Trace finished. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, Skye. He\u2019s focused on you. He started by watching you, then by sneaking into your apartment. Tonight, he took things to the next level. He came for you. He touched you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her breath rushed out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dangerous. He hurt you tonight, and I won\u2019t let him hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to rest.\u201d To stop reliving the past and the pain and everything.</p><p>He took her hand in his. Lead her to the bathroom. \u201cTake off your clothes. You\u2019ll find an extra robe waiting inside.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNo seduction tonight, I give you my word.\u201d</p><p>She went into the bathroom. A robe was waiting, all right. Silk. Beautiful, emerald green. Skye slipped out of her workout clothes and into the robe. She returned to him a few moments later, almost hating the feel of that silk against her skin. \u201cI guess this got left behind by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI arranged to have it brought here for you. Just like I\u2019ve ordered my men to bring your clothes here. I want you to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d changed while she was in the bathroom. Ditched his clothes. Now Trace wore only a pair of black pajama pants that clung low on his hips.</p><p>Her gaze darted over him. Wide shoulders. Strong chest. Way more than a six pack.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there, don\u2019t!</p><p>Trace lifted his hand toward her. \u201cTrust me, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>She put her fingers in his.</p><p>He led her to the bed. Eased her down on the mattress. Then he wrapped his body around hers. \u201cI won\u2019t let you sleep, but I will let you rest. Stop being afraid. Nothing can hurt you here.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe that.</p><p>She wanted to, so badly. But there was something she hadn\u2019t told him. She\u2019d tried to tell the police in New York, tried to tell the doctors there, but no one had believed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch you through the night.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stilled at those words. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d told her that.</p><p>The first night she\u2019d met him, he\u2019d told her the same thing.</p><p>After Parker had\u2014</p><p>Shut it out.</p><p>She slammed the door before the past could hit her.</p><p>But she remembered Trace\u2019s words.</p><p>That long ago night, she\u2019d been so scared. And he\u2019d said...</p><p>I\u2019ll watch you through the night.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t close her eyes, but her breath came easier as Trace held her in his arms.</p><p>The illusion of safety was a lie. Deep inside, she knew it. Physically, she could trust him\u2014he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. But there were worse things in this world than just physical pain.</p><p>Much, much worse.</p><p>Alex Griffin tossed his coat over his chair and keyed up his computer.</p><p>Trace Weston. Having that guy in the picture changed fuckin\u2019 everything.</p><p>Trace Weston had plenty of money. Plenty of power.</p><p>And plenty of secrets.</p><p>The man had burst onto the security scene a few years ago, seemingly coming from nowhere.</p><p>His eyes were wrong. Whenever Trace had looked at Skye, the guy\u2019s eyes had changed. There had been need in his stare, lust, anger...</p><p>Possession.</p><p>The fellow looked at Skye Sullivan as if the woman were his, when Skye had sure been singing a different story when he\u2019d questioned her about any relationships she might have in the city.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the attack on Ms. Sullivan,\u201d his partner said as he came toward him. Joe Harris had been a cop for twenty years. He\u2019d seen plenty of hell on the beat during those years. His grizzled face reflected his worry. \u201cShit, I was sure hoping things wouldn\u2019t get that bad.\u201d</p><p>Because their hands had been tied. The woman\u2019s feelings\u2014 her gut instincts\u2014those hadn\u2019t been enough for them to go on. And whoever had been accessing her apartment had slipped in and out without leaving any trace behind.</p><p>Except for the small signs meant to torment Skye.</p><p>Alex stared up at Joe. Light glinted off the top of his partner\u2019s shaved head. \u201cShe\u2019s got security now. Weston Securities.\u201d</p><p>Joe whistled. \u201cHow much is she paying for that set-up?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s bank account was empty, so she couldn\u2019t be paying anything.</p><p>So maybe I\u2019ve checked a little deeper into Skye\u2019s life than my partner realizes.</p><p>But...</p><p>When Skye Sullivan had talked to him, she\u2019d been afraid. He hated to see fear in a woman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she is paying him,\u201d Alex muttered as he leaned forward and went back to typing on his keyboard. \u201cSeems she and Trace Weston are old friends.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. They were ex-lovers. He knew exactly what they\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust him,\u201d Alex said flatly. Skye had just looked so breakable at the hospital, while Trace had been too eager to get her out of there. And away from me.</p><p>\u201cBe careful with him,\u201d Joe warned him. \u201cThat\u2019s not a man you want for an enemy. Hell, if he wanted, Weston could probably have your badge\u2014and mine\u2014with one phone call.\u201d</p><p>Alex wasn\u2019t scared of Trace Weston.</p><p>But he was determined to uncover his secrets.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened in New York.\u201d</p><p>Skye glanced over at Trace. They were in his kitchen\u2014a giant monstrosity that seemed to swallow them both. His cook\u2014he had a personal chef!\u2014had made them breakfast, and she\u2019d never tasted pancakes so perfectly fluffy in her life.</p><p>Sure, at her peak in New York, she\u2019d been able to afford some of the finer things, but she was sure realizing that Trace had flown way out of her league.</p><p>The boy she\u2019d remembered was long gone.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if she knew the man before her at all.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>She gulped some more orange juice. In the bright light of day, she could almost pretend that the nightmare from last night hadn\u2019t actually happened.</p><p>Almost. The ache in her head confirmed that it had been a very scary reality.</p><p>\u201cI was in an accident,\u201d she said carefully. The chef had bustled into the other room. \u201cMy car went off the road. I was\u2014I was trapped.\u201d Rain. Fear. Pain.</p><p>\u201cFor twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>Those words had her gaze jerking to his. \u201cY-yes. I was pinned in the car for twelve hours.\u201d The story had been splashed all over the news. The prima ballerina who\u2019d lost everything in a tragic accident.</p><p>Only it hadn\u2019t been an accident. She was sure of that.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cThere\u2019s more you aren\u2019t telling me. More than what was in the papers.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t pushed her last night. He\u2019d held her in his arms, talked softly to her, and made absolutely certain that she stayed awake.</p><p>Now he was back to grilling her.</p><p>\u201cYou think the man was stalking you in New York...\u201d Trace began, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI-I believed he was, yes. Someone was getting into my dressing room.\u201d Tell him. Tell him. \u201cAnd I thought...the night of my accident, I thought I was being followed.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, he put down his knife. His blue eyes glittered at her. \u201cYou\u2019re just telling me this...now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in New York, I told the cops. The doctors. No one believed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away her food. \u201cI don\u2019t remember everything about that night. I was driving away from the city. I was\u2014\u201d Thinking about the past. She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019d just left a gas station. There was a car...it seemed to follow my every turn...\u201d The fear was easy enough to recall. \u201cThe other car\u2019s headlights were in my mirror. Flashing on and off, low beams, then high.\u201d Blinding her.</p><p>His hands gripped the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cI think the other car hit me.\u201d This was the part she couldn\u2019t remember, not for certain. \u201cThe headlights had lit up my whole car. I screamed\u2014and my vehicle flew through the air.\u201d She could only recall bits and pieces after that. Fast images. Pain.</p><p>More screams.</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cBut the cops said there was no sign that any other vehicle was involved. They thought I must have just lost control on the wet roads.\u201d</p><p>Her appetite was gone. Even the fluffy pancakes couldn\u2019t tempt her then.</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me.\u201d</p><p>Anger stirred within her at his words. \u201cThe story made the papers, Trace. I might not be part of the mega wealthy set...\u201d She gestured around the kitchen, \u201clike you. But I was a pretty well-known dancer.\u201d She\u2019d made prima ballerina status by the time she was twenty-two. Dancing had been her life. \u201cMaybe...maybe you should have called.\u201d How many times had she lain in that bed, wishing that she would hear from him?</p><p>She rose and eased away from the table. From him. \u201cI have to get back to the studio. It\u2019s opening in two days, and I\u2019ll need to get it cleaned up.\u201d She couldn\u2019t have her new students stepping on broken glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already done.\u201d</p><p>Skye looked back at him. He\u2019d risen. \u201cThe mirror was replaced,\u201d he said, \u201cthe glass cleaned away, and you will not be having any more circuit breaker trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t family, so they wouldn\u2019t fucking let me in that hospital.\u201d</p><p>Her head shook, an immediate denial because he couldn\u2019t be saying\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut I found a way to you.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was grim and hard. \u201cI had to make sure you were going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>He was lying. He had to be. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there. You weren\u2019t in New York.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze held hers, and she couldn\u2019t look away as he said, \u201cThey had you in ICU. Your doctor was a guy named Mitch Loxley.\u201d</p><p>Like it would be hard for anyone to figure out her doctor\u2019s name. It would be especially easy for Trace and his limitless resources.</p><p>\u201cThe window near your bed looked out over the hospital courtyard. The sun came through that window, rising up fast and hard, and it would hit on your face every morning. I made sure the nurses kept your blinds down because I didn\u2019t want the light to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>Her throat had dried up. A fist seemed to squeeze her heart. \u201cWhen I opened my eyes, you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>His thick eyelashes flickered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want me to be.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were fists. Her nails sank into her palms. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Trace.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, a cold, hard grin. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>She backed away. \u201cI-I have to get to the studio.\u201d She hadn\u2019t counted on this. On him. It was all too fast. Too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine...just...I need to go, now.\u201d</p><p>He came toward her. Always so sure of himself. So certain. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid of me. I\u2019m the one who\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he was. \u201cWhen I went to your office the other day, I thought you might just blow me off.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes narrowed at that, and she saw the spark of anger lighten his gaze. \u201cYou underestimate yourself...and your value to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d she whispered once more.</p><p>He bent his head. His lips feathered over hers in the briefest of caresses. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Two guards went into the dance studio with Skye. Trace insisted on that surveillance. She wanted to get inside, she wanted to get her place ready, then she could do just that. But she would have his men with her every moment.</p><p>Trace sat in the back of his car, his gaze on the building. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have told Skye about his trips to the hospital in New York.</p><p>But the truth would have come out, soon enough.</p><p>Especially since he planned to take her to New York within just a few hours. \u201cThe plane\u2019s ready?\u201d Trace asked Reese. He\u2019d opted to leave the Jag at home and have Reese do the driving today. He had plans that he needed to make, and he could multi-task better with Reese at the wheel.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. The pilot\u2019s on stand-by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He\u2019d wait until Skye finished her work, then they\u2019d leave.</p><p>No one else might have believed her story, but he wasn\u2019t like the others. If Skye said that she\u2019d been forced off that road...</p><p>I want to find out what happened in New York.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t go to the city on his own. Skye was too uncertain of him now. He\u2019d asked for her trust, and she\u2019d hesitated.</p><p>No, he had to keep her close.</p><p>But he also had to be very, very careful. In New York, it would be easy for him to stumble. For her to discover more about his life.</p><p>About the last ten years.</p><p>There were some things that she\u2019d truly be better off not knowing.</p><p>\u201cI need a list of your lovers,\u201d Trace told Skye when she returned to his car that evening. He\u2019d just pulled up, seemingly at the perfect time, but she knew one of his agents must have contacted him and told Trace that she was calling it a night.</p><p>Exhaustion pulled at her, but his growled demand...</p><p>I need a list of your lovers.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t show and tell,\u201d she mumbled as she felt her cheeks flush. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe detective\u2014Griffin\u2014was right. The man after you could be an ex. Someone who had you once, and doesn\u2019t want to let go.\u201d</p><p>She glanced out of the window. The city passed her in a blur. \u201cIt could be an ex, or it could just be some nut-job who saw me on the street. Maybe someone who even saw me dance. Sometimes, people get dancers confused with the characters we play.\u201d She\u2019d been plenty of people, over the years. A sleeping beauty. A wicked witch. A swan. A\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe list of your lovers will be the starting point for us. You\u2019ll find that my resources are much stronger than the detective\u2019s. I can find these men, clear them\u2014or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t guilty.\u201d</p><p>The car eased to a stop. Then turned right. Reese was up in the front. She inched forward. This wasn\u2019t the way back to Trace\u2019s penthouse. Not unless Reese was taking a different route home.</p><p>\u201cTell me their names.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at Trace. \u201cThey\u2019re not even in the city, okay?\u201d</p><p>There was only one ex-lover for her in Chicago, and he was sitting far too close and taking up far too much room in the vehicle.</p><p>One dark brow rose. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to hop a flight or a train to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Rain began to fall, splattering against the window. Her shoulders stiffened. Fine, if he wanted the list, she\u2019d give it to him. In all its short and sweet beauty. \u201cRobert Wolfe. He was...he was a choreographer that I met years ago.\u201d Brilliant. Determined. Way too exacting.</p><p>\u201cWho else.\u201d</p><p>The impatience in his tone grated. It wasn\u2019t like she had a four page list. I bet he does. \u201cEvan Meadows, he\u2019s an actor.\u201d One who\u2019d made it pretty big recently. \u201cBut he\u2019s in California now so I don\u2019t see how he could possibly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going, Skye.\u201d His voice was clipped.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t very far that she could go. \u201cMitch Loxley.\u201d</p><p>The car\u2019s interior got very, very quiet.</p><p>\u201cSay the name again,\u201d Trace growled.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You heard me the first time.\u201d She glanced out the window once more. A frown pulled her brows low. This definitely wasn\u2019t the way to the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with your doctor?\u201d Trace demanded. His voice was low and cold.</p><p>Sometimes, he did that. When he was angry, his voice would drop to that lethal softness.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my doctor at the time.\u201d She\u2019d been so alone, and Mitch had been the only one there for her. Always smiling. Coming by with doughnuts and flowers.</p><p>One night, drinks had led to something...more.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you with him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t stay in New York.\u201d Her lease had been up, and she hadn\u2019t had the cash to renew it, not after all her medical bills. Insurance had only stretched so far.</p><p>\u201cThe fucking doctor...\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped toward him. \u201cLook, who I\u2019ve been with shouldn\u2019t matter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me.\u201d Gritted. \u201cIt matters a great deal.\u201d</p><p>She would never figure him out. \u201cYou\u2019ve been screwing your way through every model or actress you could find, so don\u2019t act like some ex-lover I had does something to you. We both know I made your ancient history list a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. In the darkened interior of the vehicle, she wished that she could see his expression. But he was still hidden by shadows. \u201cIt does something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me fucking furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d</p><p>His hand slid over her cheek. \u201cI want you to forget them. I want to take you to bed, and I want to wipe away every memory you have of them all.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take a deep enough breath. \u201cWe\u2019re over, Trace. You know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we be over, when I still want you so much?\u201d His hand slid down her cheek, down her jaw, then down to the column of her throat. His fingers splayed over her neck, lightly touching the pulse that raced frantically beneath her skin. \u201cAnd how can we be over, when you still want me so much?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d ruined her for other men. It was a sad and humiliating fact. The sex had been good with the others, but with Trace...</p><p>I was always comparing. How had that been fair? Maybe that was why Robert and Evan had ended things. They\u2019d told her\u2014both of them\u2014that she wouldn\u2019t let them get close. That she put up a wall to keep them out of her life.</p><p>After Trace, she\u2019d needed that wall. Because she hadn\u2019t ever wanted to hurt that much again.</p><p>When he left me, I felt broken. It had taken too long for her to put the pieces of her life back together.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, tell me now.\u201d Trace\u2019s hand seemed to singe her skin. \u201cTell me to back the hell off, and I will. I won\u2019t push for something you\u2019re not willing to give. I want all of you. All or nothing.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that the way it had worked between them before? She had given everything to him.</p><p>What had Trace given?</p><p>The car stopped.</p><p>\u201cAll or nothing, Skye. Make the choice.\u201d</p><p>Then he pulled away from her. Shoved open his door.</p><p>She sucked in some much needed air. A frantic glance to the left made her realize\u2014definitely not the penthouse.</p><p>Her door opened. Only Reese wasn\u2019t standing there, holding said door. Trace was.</p><p>She scrambled out. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>And here was\u2014the airport?</p><p>\u201cTaking a flight. My jet\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>He had a jet? Right, of course, the mega-wealthy guy he\u2019d become would have his own jet.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t step away from the car. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Why was this like pulling teeth with him? \u201cI have my studio opening, I can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want this SOB caught, don\u2019t you? Well, to do that, we need to head back to the beginning. If he started following you in New York, then we can try to learn more about him there.\u201d</p><p>He seriously thought she was just going to jump on a flight to New York? Right then? \u201cI\u2019m not going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make the people in that city talk to me. The dancers, your old neighbors. By you being with me, they\u2019ll share more. Maybe someone saw something. Maybe someone saw him.\u201d His fingers still gripped the door. \u201cI need you to come with me. We\u2019ll be back before the studio opens, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Once upon a time, she\u2019d loved New York.</p><p>But she\u2019d run from it, so desperate to get away.</p><p>Only...now she wondered...had she been running from the city? Or from the man who\u2019d been after her? The dark shadow that seemed to stalk her, with every step she took?</p><p>Before the accident, she\u2019d started to become so nervous. Jumping at the slightest noise. She hadn\u2019t been able to shake the feeling that her actions were being monitored. Watched. Always watched.</p><p>And he\u2019d been in her home. She knew he had broken inside, even though there had been no indication of a forced entry.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this,\u201d Trace urged her. \u201cCome with me to New York. Let me do the job that I know how to do. I\u2019ll find him, and I will stop him.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the waiting airport. A plane had just taken off, and the rumble of its engines filled the air. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>Reese slammed the trunk. Her head jerked toward him, and she saw that he was carrying two bags. One bag had to belong to Trace, but the other bag\u2014</p><p>It\u2019s mine.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might see things my way,\u201d Trace murmured.</p><p>Confident, cocky bastard.</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cNot still afraid to fly, are you?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was. Terrified.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t about to admit that fact to him. He already thought she feared too many things in this world.</p><p>I do.</p><p>She\u2019d first started to fear when she was eight years old. When her parents hadn\u2019t come home from their dinner. When she\u2019d heard her babysitter whispering about an accident. When she\u2019d stood in a graveyard and watched as flowers were put on two caskets.</p><p>She\u2019d feared when she went to the first foster home. When she\u2019d gone to the second. To the third.</p><p>She\u2019d feared when hard hands had reached for her during the night. When she was hurt. Pain that came again and again. Her only escape had been to dance.</p><p>A social worker had introduced Skye to dancing. She\u2019d taken her to a community center, and Skye had gotten lost in the music, in the dance.</p><p>She\u2019d danced. Day after day after day.</p><p>And she\u2019d feared...</p><p>Until she\u2019d looked up and into a pair of bright, angry blue eyes.</p><p>The fear had stopped then, for a time.</p><p>But it had come back all too soon.</p><p>It always returned, eventually.</p><p>Alex Griffin watched as the private plane taxied down the runway. Jet-setting away...that seemed to fit with the image that was developing for Trace Weston.</p><p>He\u2019d been digging into the man\u2019s background for most of the day. A kid who\u2019d grown up poor, Weston had entered the Army at twenty. His past had been easy enough to discover up until that point, but after he\u2019d enlisted with Uncle Sam, Trace Weston\u2019s records had vanished. There was a four-year hole in the man\u2019s past. Four years of seemingly nothing.</p><p>Then Weston had appeared again in Chicago. He\u2019d appeared and suddenly had deep ties with foreign dignitaries, government agencies. His security company had skyrocketed to the top of the field.</p><p>Weston had become a millionaire. No, a billionaire, according to his tax reports.</p><p>So why was a guy like that taking such a personal interest in a stalking case? That wasn\u2019t even the type of security Weston handled. He worked with corporations, not individuals.</p><p>Alex pulled his hands from the pockets of his jacket. He\u2019d already used his badge to gain entrance to the back area of the airport, and he was about to use the shield to help him again. People always talked freely when a badge was involved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes narrowed as he saw a man rushing away from the runway. \u201cUh, excuse me, sir...\u201d Alex called out.</p><p>The man, older, balding, frowned at him. He wore one of the light blue uniforms typical of the ground crew.</p><p>\u201cWere you just working on Trace Weston\u2019s plane?\u201d Alex asked, as he kept his badge out.</p> <p>The fellow glanced at the badge, then back at Alex\u2019s face. \u201cMr. Weston doesn\u2019t have any trouble with me. I do my job, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you didn\u2019t,\u201d Alex soothed. \u201cI was just curious...\u201d</p><p>And he had been curious. He\u2019d pulled up at Skye\u2019s studio just in time to see her climb into Weston\u2019s car. So he\u2019d followed them, and he\u2019d watched them fly right out of the city.</p><p>Strange. An attack one day. A vacation the next?</p><p>\u201cWhere was Mr. Weston heading?\u201d Alex asked as he cocked his head.</p> <p>The guy glanced over his shoulder. \u201cI-I think he was going to New York again.\u201d</p><p>Where Skye Sullivan had lived for so long. \u201cDoes he go to New York often?\u201d He could, for business, or for\u2014</p><p>\u201cYeah, he goes there a lot. At least once each week.\u201d The man tried to brush by him.</p><p>Alex just shifted and blocked his path. \u201cGuys on the ground can sometimes hear stories.\u201d And pick up a lot of gossip. \u201cYou hear any stories about why Weston visited New York? In the past? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>The man smiled, revealing a crooked front tooth. \u201cI don\u2019t care why he flies. It just matters that he does. Gives me a job.\u201d</p><p>Right. This info wasn\u2019t helping him.</p> <p>The guy walked away. Alex glanced up at the sky. Light raindrops were still falling down. He couldn\u2019t see the plane any longer.</p><p>Maybe Weston had been taking all those trips to the Big Apple strictly for business.</p><p>Or maybe...maybe he\u2019d been heading to New York for another reason.</p><p>Alex had pulled Skye\u2019s accident report. He\u2019d read her statement about someone following her. Forcing her off the road.</p><p>The more he probed, the more he worried.</p><p>Skye Sullivan was in danger. He just hoped she wasn\u2019t putting her trust in the wrong person.</p><p>A mistake like that could prove fatal for her.</p><p>Trace kept his hand curved around Skye as they headed through the hotel\u2019s lobby. The marble floor gleamed up at him as the concierge quickly escorted them to the private elevator.</p> <p>Skye wasn\u2019t speaking. She was barely making eye contact with him, and he hated that.</p><p>He missed how they used to be.</p><p>I\u2019ll have that again.</p><p>He\u2019d have everything again.</p><p>The elevator doors closed, and the ascent began. The elevator slid up, higher and higher.</p><p>\u201cUh, Mr. Weston?\u201d The concierge\u2014Max\u2014cleared his throat. \u201cIs there anything that you\u2019ll be needing tonight?\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t even try to take his eyes off Skye. She\u2019d slept on the plane. He\u2019d been too wired to even consider dozing off. \u201cI have everything I need.\u201d His voice rumbled.</p><p>Skye\u2019s gaze cut to his.</p><p>The elevator\u2019s doors opened.</p><p>Max scrambled outside. \u201cY-your suite is waiting, sir. Of course, it\u2019s our plaza suite, just as you always request when you visit to see the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the suite,\u201d Trace cut through his words before Max could say anymore. The fellow was damn chatty tonight.</p><p>Max hurriedly opened the suite room door. Skye strode inside. Her head tilted back as she looked up at the massive chandelier that waited in the great room.</p><p>\u201cYou...um...are you sure you don\u2019t want the personal chef to come up?\u201d Max lingered near the door as the bellhop brought in their luggage. \u201cIt\u2019s late, but never too late for you, Mr. Weston\u2014\u201d</p><p>He knew that the personal chef came with the suite. Trace just didn\u2019t want the guy up there at that moment. He wanted to be alone with Skye. \u201cSend him up for breakfast,\u201d Trace said. His gaze narrowed on the bellhop. \u201cAll the bags go in the master bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Skye had paused at the windows that overlooked Fifth Avenue. It seemed her shoulders tensed.</p><p>She\u2019d heard his order about the bags.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t arguing.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>The bellhop and the concierge left a few minutes later. The door eased shut behind them.</p><p>Skye kept staring down at the city below. \u201cSometimes, I forget what New York is like...\u201d</p><p>Snow fell lightly past the window. They\u2019d flown out of rain in Chicago and right into a late snowfall in New York.</p><p>Her hand lifted and touched the pane of glass. \u201cWhen I was a kid, New York was everything to me. The people here...they were happy. Famous. Everyone loved them.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d been a kid, she\u2019d bounced from foster home to foster home.</p><p>She\u2019d found dancing thanks to a social worker who\u2019d wanted her to have an outlet. That outlet had been at a small, community center. Skye had once told him how nervous she\u2019d been the first day she walked into that center.</p><p>She\u2019d been nervous, until she danced.</p><p>Skye turned away from the window. \u201cThe suite, Trace?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThere are only two of us. Do you really think we need...what is this?\u201d She glanced around with pursed lips. \u201cI\u2019m guessing...four thousand square feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-five hundred.\u201d He pulled off his coat. Tossed it aside. Went to her.</p><p>\u201cAny room would have worked. Any\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped her chin. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I dreamed of not being hungry.\u201d She would know this. Far better than anyone else. \u201cI dreamed of not wearing someone else\u2019s used clothes. Of not being the one mocked because my shoes had holes in them.\u201d His parents hadn\u2019t died like Skye\u2019s. His parents just hadn\u2019t given a shit.</p><p>They\u2019d forgotten him most days. Left him to feed and clothe himself.</p><p>The day the social workers had come for him...how long had I been without food then?</p><p>His old man loved to use his fist. His mother...she loved to use her bottles. She\u2019d drowned out reality and hadn\u2019t cared when her son cried.</p><p>\u201cI pulled myself out of the past,\u201d he told Skye, making sure he kept his hold gentle. With her, he tried for gentleness. Only for her. \u201cThese days, I can afford any damn thing I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you want...\u201d</p><p>His fingers drifted down her throat. She had such a sensitive neck. Once upon a time, he\u2019d kissed her there, and she\u2019d melted for him. \u201cWhat I want is you.\u201d Being near her drove him fucking insane. Having her scent\u2014sweet vanilla\u2014wrap around him. Having her silken skin beneath his fingers.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t telling him no. Wasn\u2019t pushing him away. Instead, she stared up at him with need in her green gaze. \u201cI thought...I thought we came here to figure out who was after me.\u201d Her words were a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d But it was nearing 3 a.m. New York might be the city that never slept, but they still couldn\u2019t go pounding on doors right then. Better to wait. Head out in the morning.</p><p>Waiting left them with the night.</p><p>His fingers eased under the heavy curtain of her hair. Her breath caught on a little rasp that was the sexiest sound he\u2019d heard in years.</p><p>\u201cTell me you haven\u2019t thought about us.\u201d Even though she\u2019d been with others. Fucking bastards. When she\u2019d told him their names, everything had gone red for him. Other men, touching her. He wanted to wipe the memory of their hands away.</p><p>Trace wanted her to only think of him.</p><p>Before the night was over, she would.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie.\u201d The snow fell lightly behind her. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you more times than I can count.\u201d</p><p>Good. Because every damn night when he closed his eyes, she was the one in his dreams.</p><p>Her hand rose. Curled around his wrist. \u201cAnd I think about the way you told me...to get the hell out of your life.\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t let his expression alter.</p><p>\u201cYou stopped wanting me, Trace, not the other way around.\u201d She yanked his hand away from her. Marched around him. \u201cSince you got the bell hop to leave my bags in the master bedroom, I\u2019ll take that room.\u201d She wasn\u2019t looking back at him. \u201cWith forty-five hundred square feet, I\u2019m sure you can find some other place to crash.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body locked down. \u201cI never stopped.\u201d His control seemed razor thin right then, and that was dangerous. He\u2019d intended a seduction for her.</p><p>The wild hunger he\u2019d held in check wasn\u2019t supposed to break free.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Her laugh was bitter. Not like Skye at all. \u201cRight. That\u2019s why you came after me, huh? Why I\u2019ve seen you pictured with dozens of women over the years? Because you wanted...\u201dShe glared over her shoulder, \u201cme so much.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he wasn\u2019t the only one eaten by jealousy. Maybe there was some hope for them after all.</p><p>\u201cWant me to prove how much I want you?\u201d Nothing could have kept him away from her in that moment. He\u2019d talked to her doctor before he left Chicago. Skye was safe. The concussion wasn\u2019t an issue. She could sleep.</p><p>She could fuck.</p><p>She was most definitely about to get fucked.</p><p>Skye rounded on him. \u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. There was simply no holding back. He\u2019d waited until they were alone. Waited until he had her in the suite with him.</p><p>Waited...waited ten long years.</p><p>There was no more waiting.</p><p>Unless Skye told him no, unless she didn\u2019t want him, he would have her.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>She should push him away. Skye knew her hands should lift and shove against Trace\u2019s chest. Those traitorous hands shouldn\u2019t be lifting and curving around his shoulders.</p><p>She needed to push him away.</p><p>Not pull him closer.</p><p>But she wanted him closer.</p><p>She. Wanted. Him.</p><p>Her emotions were too raw. Maybe it was the city. Maybe it was Trace. Maybe she was just too scared and too tired of being alone.</p><p>But when his tongue thrust into her mouth, when she tasted his rich, masculine flavor, Skye stopped thinking about why it was wrong to be with him.</p><p>Right then, she wanted to be wrong.</p><p>His mouth was strong and fierce on hers. Searching for a response that she was eager to give. Trace was a great kisser, one who\u2019d just gotten better with age. His lips and his tongue played her perfectly.</p><p>And his hands...</p><p>His hands stroked down her body. His fingers curled around her hips\u2014then he lifted her up.</p><p>Skye gasped because she hadn\u2019t been expecting that move, even though she knew how strong he was. Her gasp let him deepen the kiss, and he took two steps and pinned her against the wall.</p><p>Her legs locked around his hips. His arousal pressed against her core. Long and hard and thick.</p><p>Their clothes were in the way.</p><p>Skin to skin. She needed to be that way with him. Needed desperately to be that way.</p><p>Her hips arched toward him.</p><p>His mouth pulled from hers. Trace began to kiss his way down her neck. Right there. Yes, yes, right there. Where her neck curved into her shoulder. She loved it when he kissed her\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t forget me,\u201d his words were growled against her overheated flesh. \u201cBut you will forget them.\u201d</p><p>He was carrying her again. Down the hallway. Another chandelier glittered overhead. They turned, and he took her into the bedroom.</p><p>The big bed took up half of the massive space. The curtains were pulled back. The snow was still falling. Beautiful snow, covering the world in a blanket of white.</p><p>He lowered her onto the bed.</p><p>She thought he\u2019d follow her. That he\u2019d put his body against hers and crush her into the mattress. She wanted wild passion. Wanted to feel the surge of pleasure that would banish her fear and the past.</p><p>But he just stared down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re even more fucking beautiful now.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be. She had on old leggings. A sweatshirt. Her hair was a tangle around her head and\u2014</p><p>He started with her shoes. Tossed them aside. Tossed aside the leggings and the sweatshirt. Trace stripped her with deft hands, hands that must have undressed plenty of women.</p><p>Jealousy bit into her. Don\u2019t go there, don\u2019t.</p><p>Soon she was clad only in the slip of her black bra and her matching panties. She was spread on the bed. He still stood above her.</p><p>His gaze traveled slowly, so very slowly, over her body. His jaw hardened when his gaze landed on her bra\u2014her breasts. \u201cSo perfect.\u201d</p><p>No, she was too small there, she was\u2014</p><p>His bright stare drifted over the plane of her belly. Down to the flare of her hips.</p><p>Trace licked his lips.</p><p>She imagined him licking her.</p><p>But...but his gaze didn\u2019t stay. Down, down it went, and some of her passion began to fade.</p><p>My leg. I don\u2019t want him looking at my leg.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Trace to see the tangled mass of scars that still covered her calf. The scars that would always cover the skin.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she turned off the lights? She\u2019d turned them off with Mitch, and she should have thought to turn them off with Trace.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d her voice sharpened as she tried to reach for him.</p><p>Trace caught her hands. Pushed them back against the mattress. Fully clothed, he came down on top of her. \u201cDon\u2019t what, baby? Don\u2019t look at you?\u201d His lips\u2014open, hot, sexy\u2014brushed over hers. \u201cDon\u2019t taste? Because that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do. I\u2019ll taste every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t pity me. Those were the words she\u2019d meant to say. But he wasn\u2019t looking at her calf any longer. He was kissing her and holding her wrists prisoner.</p><p>She liked the friction of his clothes against her. Liked the feel of that strong, hard body over hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her legs were parted. His hips pushed against her sex, and it was good. So good.</p><p>He\u2019d make it better. She knew he would.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing tonight, baby,\u201d the words rumbled against her lips. \u201cI\u2019m tasting, and I\u2019m taking...everything.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted her hands above her head. Switched his hold so that just one of his hands imprisoned hers. Then his left hand snaked down her body.</p><p>Her bra was tossed across the room.</p><p>The cool air hit her nipples, making them go even tighter.</p><p>Then his mouth was on her. His mouth wasn\u2019t cool. It was hot. Seeming to singe her and the rasp of his tongue against her nipples felt so good.</p><p>She was wet. She could feel the wetness on her panties, and Skye wanted them gone. She wanted Trace thrusting into her\u2014</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let your hands go, but don\u2019t move them. I get to touch. I get to taste.\u201d His hands eased away from hers. \u201cI get to take.\u201d</p><p>She would be taking her pleasure, too. Trace liked to be in control in the bedroom, dominant, compelling and\u2014</p><p>He was kissing his way down her body. His dark stubble pressed into her stomach. His tongue licked over her skin.</p><p>His fingers slid under the edge of her panties. \u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWet for me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. \u201cTrace, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled the panties down her legs. Then his fingers slid up her thighs. Teased. Tormented her. \u201cI\u2019ve waited too long. I told you, I get to taste and take.\u201d</p> <p>Everything.</p><p>Her hands balled into fists so that she wouldn\u2019t reach out to him.</p><p>It\u2019s just sex. It\u2019s just sex. The mantra flew through her head as her heart raced. She had to focus on the present, not the past. Everything got so tangled up when she was with him.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t about love.</p><p>Sex. Pleasure.</p><p>His fingers slid between her legs. Pushed between the folds of her sex. Into her.</p><p>She arched off the bed. His thumb rubbed over her clit even as he thrust two fingers into her.</p><p>More. \u201cTrace...\u201d Skye could barely gasp out his name.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous like this...\u201d His words were dark, deep. \u201cFlushed, open, ready for me...only me.\u201d</p><p>His hands withdrew. No, dammit, she\u2019d been close.</p><p>\u201cSay it\u2019s only me, Skye.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted. She didn\u2019t even remember closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d His mouth lowered to her sex. His lips pressed against her, and if his hands hadn\u2019t moved to hold her hips against the mattress, she would have leapt off the bed at the first, electric touch of his tongue against her sex.</p><p>Pleasure beat at her as he tasted her. Her body twisted against the mattress. She wasn\u2019t trying to get away from him. Skye wanted to get closer. Her fingers splayed wide, then grabbed the thick covers, bunching them in her fists.</p><p>Release was near, so near\u2014</p><p>\u201cTell me, Skye,\u201d he demanded. A dark note had entered his voice. One that should have made her hesitate. Possessive... fierce... \u201cOnly me.\u201d</p><p>She hovered on the brink of release. \u201cTrace, I need more\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you every fucking thing.\u201d</p><p>A zipper hissed down. He lowered his body against hers.</p><p>He thrust into her.</p><p>Not easy. Not tentative.</p><p>He drove deep, filling her completely, and she stopped being on the brink. Pleasure flooded through her. She gasped as her heart raced, seeming to pound right out of her chest. Her whole body tightened as that release swept over her. So good...so perfect...on and on and on.</p><p>Trace kept thrusting. He grabbed her legs. Lifted them higher. Made her take more and more until she was frantic because another release was coming. She was hollowed out from the first one, but he was pushing the second wave on her, and she screamed this time, a broken yell because the pleasure hit her so hard.</p><p>Then he came. A hard, hot jet inside of her. \u201cOnly...\u201d he growled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear the rest of what he said. Her racing heartbeat drowned out the words, but she knew.</p><p>Only me.</p><p>Trace shuddered against her. He\u2019d come, she\u2019d felt that release, but he kept thrusting.</p><p>The pleasure didn\u2019t end.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt this way with anyone else. Never wanted and wanted and had her whole body explode with pleasure, one shattering climax after the other.</p><p>No one else.</p><p>Only Trace.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given him the words. But then, she didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>He already knew.</p><p>Only me.</p><p>Rehearsal was always a chaotic time. Dancers swirled around the stage. Choreographers jumped in, corrected, advised. The director was there, shouting orders in the background.</p><p>It seemed both incredibly familiar and oddly foreign as Skye stood in the shadows, watching everyone else. It was barely past seven a.m., but, of course the dancers were working. By this time, they would have been working for at least two hours.</p><p>Sweating. Flying. Dancing until their muscles trembled.</p><p>This had been her life.</p><p>Without it, she\u2019d been lost.</p><p>\u201cSkye?\u201d She recognized that voice, with its faint English accent. She\u2019d known that Robert Wolfe would be there\u2014since he was the lead choreographer, he had to be there. And Trace had been determined to question Robert. But...</p><p>Robert isn\u2019t doing this to me.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to suspect him.</p><p>She turned at his call, her shoulder brushing against Trace\u2019s. They hadn\u2019t spoken much that morning. She\u2019d felt too raw, too overexposed after last night.</p><p>Just how fast did you tumble into bed with him? The question whispered through her mind. The answer? Fast. Very. Very fast.</p><p>A broad smile split Robert\u2019s handsome face as he hurried toward her. He was sweating, the shine gleaming on him, because he\u2019d been working with the dancers. He rushed toward her and wrapped her in a tight hug, sweat and all.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come back,\u201d Robert said as he squeezed her even tighter. \u201cYou just needed time. You just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not here to dance.\u201d</p><p>He stopped squeezing her. Robert pulled back, but didn\u2019t release her. He stared down at her, a faint line between his perfect brows.</p><p>Robert was tall, with a strong dancer\u2019s body. His blond hair was brushed away from the strong planes of his face, and his tanned skin gleamed under the lights.</p><p>\u201cYou can let her go now,\u201d Trace ordered him. But then Trace didn\u2019t wait for Robert to comply. He pulled the other man away from Skye.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Skye, picked a jealous lover, eh?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the blush on her cheeks. Skye cleared her throat. \u201cWe...we need to talk. Somewhere private.\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2019s face hardened. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Something had been wrong, for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cThe dressing rooms.\u201d He motioned toward the right. \u201cWhile everyone\u2019s rehearsing, they\u2019re empty.\u201d</p><p>She knew the way, so Skye started walking first. She\u2019d only taken a few steps when she realized exactly what Robert was doing.</p><p>He was watching her walk. No, more specifically, he was watching her leg. Dammit, had she limped? She didn\u2019t want to limp in front of him. She didn\u2019t like to limp in front of anyone. But especially Robert. He\u2019d trained her for so long. Told her that she was the best dancer he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Oh, how the mighty had fallen.</p><p>Skye straightened her shoulders. Slowed her stride.</p><p>A few moments later, they were in her old dressing room. Memories were everywhere in that room. She\u2019d been so excited when she came in after a performance. So\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou look...familiar to me,\u201d Robert said as he closed the door and let his gaze focus on Trace.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Trace Weston,\u201d Skye said, waving her hand toward him. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen his picture in the paper.\u201d</p><p>Robert gave a little whistle. \u201cRight. I have seen you.\u201d The whistle was more mocking than anything else. Robert didn\u2019t look impressed. But then, if you weren\u2019t talking about dancing, Robert normally wasn\u2019t impressed.</p><p>His golden gaze turned back to her. \u201cI want you to dance for me again.\u201d</p><p>Skye tensed. She\u2019d been afraid that he\u2019d go right back to that.</p><p>Before she could reply, Trace put his body between them. \u201cHave you been to Chicago recently, Wolfe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago? No, no, of course not.\u201d His British accent tightened the words. \u201cI\u2019ve been here, for the last bloody month. Trying to make those dancers out there half as good as Skye...\u201d He stepped around Trace. Smiled at Skye. \u201cHave you ever seen her dance?\u201d Robert asked Trace. His eyes didn\u2019t leave Skye\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fucking beautiful thing in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her,\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was clipped.</p><p>Trace had seen her long ago. In a different lifetime. When he\u2019d taken her to the community center. Stayed to watch her practice. She\u2019d gotten much better than the way she\u2019d been then.</p><p>Well, she had been better.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here about the dancing,\u201d she tried telling Robert again. The man had such a one track mind. \u201cThere\u2019s something else that we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething more important than you getting that sweet ass of yours back onstage? Doubt it. I don\u2019t see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone is stalking, Skye.\u201d Trace\u2019s cold, quiet words cut right through the rumble of Robert\u2019s speech. \u201cSome bastard attacked her recently in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d Robert\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me? Why didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that the man first started following her here in New York. He got into her dressing room...\u201d Trace cast an angry glance around the room. \u201cSince the security here is non-existent, I can see how that happened. He got into this place, he got into her home, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said someone forced you off the road,\u201d Robert muttered. He ran a shaking hand over his face. \u201cHell, I thought it was the pain meds talking. When you first woke up, you were out of it in that hospital. I didn\u2019t realize...\u201d His words trailed off.</p><p>Maybe because he\u2019d just fully noticed the killing glare that Trace had aimed on him.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s me, mate?\u201d Robert demanded, backing up a step.</p><p>\u201cYou sure have easy access to her dressing room, mate,\u201d Trace threw right back. \u201cYou know where she lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I did! I helped her move in! Dammit, I even had her back-up key.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s shoulders stiffened. He turned and cast that rather scary glare of his at Skye.</p><p>Crap. Had she neglected to mention that part?</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t do that to Skye! I would never do anything to hurt her.\u201d And Robert reached for Skye again. His fingers locked around her arms. \u201cYou know how much I need you. I wouldn\u2019t hurt you, not for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hands off her.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on Skye\u2019s skin.</p><p>Robert immediately jerked away from her. \u201cLook, mate, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace caught Skye\u2019s hand and pulled her to his side. \u201cI\u2019m going to need confirmation that you haven\u2019t left the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re asking me for an alibi?\u201d Robert sputtered.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight, I am.\u201d</p><p>Now Robert was the one to flush. \u201cA dozen dancers can tell you that I\u2019ve been working their asses off for the last twenty days. They can all confirm that I haven\u2019t left the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Trace flashed a hard smile, one that held an evil edge. \u201cI\u2019ll get them to confirm that before I leave today.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s breath expelled in a fast rush. \u201cRobert, did you ever see anyone hanging around my dressing room? Anyone that lingered after a show?\u201d She\u2019d asked stagehands the same questions before, but no one had seen anything. After a performance, it was too chaotic to keep track of people.</p><p>Robert\u2019s eyes had narrowed on Trace. He seemed to be searching Trace\u2019s face with a dark intensity.</p><p>\u201cRobert?\u201d Skye pushed.</p><p>\u201cThere are always fans who try to get back to the dancers,\u201d Robert said, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, when you dance, you become something...quite different.\u201d</p><p>That...different...had been what drew him to her. A night of long practice had turned into something more for them. But it hadn\u2019t lasted with Robert. It never lasted because...</p><p>No other man is Trace.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see anyone?\u201d Trace questioned. \u201cDammit, what about video cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have them backstage.\u201d Robert shook his head. \u201cAfter a show, it\u2019s chaos. Plain and simple. Hell, do you have any idea just how many flowers get delivered after a show? It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 madhouse here.\u201d</p><p>And someone had slipped into that madhouse far too easily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check, okay?\u201d Robert offered as a knock sounded at the door. \u201cI\u2019ll ask around and see if anyone remembers anything but, Skye, you know how fast the back-stage groups turn over. We\u2019ve got new staff working this show.\u201d</p><p>With every new show, there was a rotation.</p><p>A knock rapped again at the door. \u201cWolfe!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice called. \u201cThey need you on stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right there.\u201d He straightened his shoulders. Met Trace\u2019s stare. \u201cCheck my alibi. Talk to the dancers. Like I said, I would never hurt Skye, and I sure hope you find the bastard who did.\u201d Then he glanced her way. The gold in his eyes heated. \u201cCome back to me. I want you to dance for me again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angry tension seemed to roll off Trace\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t,\u201d Skye said softly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Robert asked her, tilting his head as he studied her. \u201cUnless you try?\u201d</p> <p>The knock pounded again. It was much more impatient this time. \u201cWolfe, they\u2019re screwing up out here! We need you.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod to Skye and Trace, and Robert hurried away.</p><p>The door hung open behind him, just a few inches.</p><p>\u201cBefore we leave,\u201d Trace spoke slowly, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the stagehands here and see if anyone remembers something.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d If Trace had been here to question people sooner, to run his investigation, then perhaps more evidence, more clues could have been found.</p> <p>Trace exhaled slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll find him. He\u2019s not getting away.\u201d</p><p>She hoped that he wasn\u2019t. She started to slip by Trace.</p><p>He caught her arm. \u201cYou left New York without trying to dance again? You just ran from the city?\u201d</p><p>Her throat had gone dry. \u201cIt took me weeks to walk again.\u201d That was only after all of the surgeries. \u201cAnd I did try.\u201d That painful memory would never go away. \u201cThe first time I tried to dance, I fell on my face.\u201d The first time, the second, the third. Her lashes lifted so that she could meet that bright blue stare. \u201cRobert is the most demanding choreographer I\u2019ve ever worked with. I knew what he would see if he watched me dance. I didn\u2019t want to hear him say\u2014\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve lost it, love.</p><p>She could hear his words clearly in her mind.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some things that you know on your own.\u201d She\u2019d had enough humiliation and pain by that point. Running had seemed like her best plan. Escape.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. \u201cI\u2019ll go talk to some of the dancers.\u201d Her words tumbled out quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll see if anyone remembers or\u2014or maybe if anyone had something like this happen to them.\u201d So she was grasping at straws. That room was too small. Too filled with memories, and Skye wanted to get out of there.</p><p>So she fled. After all, she might suck at walking sometimes, but when it came to running away, she had that one down cold.</p><p>The Brit was a bastard who touched Skye far too freely. Trace could still feel the jealousy coursing through him.</p><p>You came back to me.</p><p>The hell she had. Skye hadn\u2019t turned to Wolfe when she needed protection.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to Trace.</p><p>The dancers and the stagehands had been no help. They didn\u2019t remember anything.</p> <p>Or anyone.</p><p>Plenty of fans had come to see Skye, but their faces were a blur in everyone\u2019s memories.</p><p>Useless.</p><p>So they\u2019d left the dancers and the choreographer who watched Skye with far too much intensity. They\u2019d moved to the second stop on their list.</p><p>He\u2019d visited this place before. So many times, when Skye hadn\u2019t even known he was there. I had to make sure she was all right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d Skye murmured beside him as they strode down the hospital corridor. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t exactly say I\u2019m happy to be back here.\u201d</p><p>The scent of disinfectant filled his nose. Nurses bustled past him. A family walked down the corridor, carrying flowers and balloons in their hands.</p><p>Skye\u2019s doctor was on duty that day. Trace had verified Dr. Mitch Loxley\u2019s rotation schedule before heading to the hospital. He\u2019d also had his men check to see if either Mitch Loxley or Robert Wolfe had taken any recent flights to Chicago.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t.</p><p>But they could have driven over there. A thirteen-hour drive was doable.</p><p>He halted at the nurse\u2019s station. \u201cI need to see Dr. Loxley.\u201d</p><p>The nurse glanced up. Her eyes widened a bit as she stared at Trace, then she smiled.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten plenty of smiles like hers over the years. Flirtatious. Interested.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t interested. Skye was at his side.</p><p>When he had her, he didn\u2019t need anyone else.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his rounds right now, but is there something I can help you with?\u201d The nurse asked as she rose\u2014and leaned forward, putting her hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to help you, if you need assistance.\u201d</p><p>What he needed was Loxley.</p><p>Another of Skye\u2019s lovers.</p><p>Shit, but it had been hard not to drive his fist into Wolfe\u2019s pretty-boy face. When the guy kept touching Skye, too much familiarity in that touch...I wanted to break his hand.</p><p>Only Trace wasn\u2019t supposed to be that guy any longer. He was supposed to be the businessman. The success story.</p><p>Not the street fighter who wanted to tear into anyone who\u2019d gotten too close to Skye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that only Dr. Loxley can help us,\u201d he said, pulling Skye close to his side. She\u2019d tensed up when they walked into the hospital. Not that he blamed her, not after what she\u2019d been through. He wanted to question the doctor, then get the hell out of that place with her.</p><p>He\u2019d prefer to get her back to the hotel. To get her naked in his bed again.</p><p>Once wasn\u2019t nearly enough.</p><p>But he had to eliminate the threats around her first.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you expecting Loxley back?\u201d Trace asked the blonde nurse.</p><p>Then, speak of the damn devil, Loxley marched around the corner. The guy\u2019s white lab coat swirled around him as he put a clipboard on the nurse\u2019s station. \u201cMarsha, make sure the low carb diet for Mr. Rodriguez continues for at least twenty-four more hours and...\u201d He trailed off.</p><p>Because his gaze had lifted.</p><p>And locked on Skye.</p><p>Another asshole that I want to punch.</p><p>But, at least unlike Robert, Loxley didn\u2019t rush across the room and wrap Skye in a too-tight hug.</p><p>Loxley didn\u2019t move at all, but his gaze sure seemed to drink Skye in.</p><p>What was it about her? She drew men to her. She\u2019d sure drawn him easily enough.</p><p>Addicted him, from the very first.</p><p>\u201cDr. Loxley.\u201d With an effort, Trace kept all the emotion from his voice. \u201cWe need a few minutes of your time.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s startled gaze flew to his. The doc hadn\u2019t even seemed aware of the fact that Trace was standing there, not until that moment.</p><p>Trace wasn\u2019t used to being ignored.</p><p>He flashed his teeth in a shark\u2019s grin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need that time, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I just finished my rounds.\u201d Loxley glanced at his watch. \u201cI can spare a few minutes. Come this way.\u201d Then he turned, without another word, and headed back down the corridor.</p><p>Trace took his time following the doc, and he made sure not to let go of Skye.</p><p>How did she feel about the doctor? The fellow was close to Trace\u2019s height, had a build similar to Trace...Mitch Loxley even had the same dark hair.</p><p>Mitch Loxley seemed like a safer, more dependable version of Trace.</p><p>Trace hated the sonofabitch.</p><p>Files were scattered around the doctor\u2019s office. A few framed photographs. The doc grabbed the files and shoved them on his desk, blocking some of those photos.</p><p>But Trace had already seen them.</p><p>Yes, he hated the SOB.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Skye?\u201d Loxley asked as he crossed his arms over his chest. Now that they were away from the nurse\u2019s station, the polite veneer that the doc had worn while they had an audience showed signs of cracking. \u201cI thought you\u2019d gone to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>He knew where she\u2019d headed.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Skye pulled her hand from Trace\u2019s. \u201cDo you...do you remember when I said that someone forced me off the road?\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s dark eyebrows shot up. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here? The cops told you that there were no signs of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone attacked me recently, in Chicago.\u201d Her voice was soft. \u201cBefore the attack, someone had been following me for days, weeks...the same way the person followed me here, in New York.\u201d</p><p>The faint lines near Mitch\u2019s eyes deepened. \u201cLook, you were under a lot of stress after the accident, I get that...but the cops said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not real interested in what the cops said,\u201d Trace cut in. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to have this pompous prick dismiss Skye\u2019s fears. \u201cI\u2019m interested in what Skye says. Someone attacked her, and I\u2019m here to find out who that was.\u201d</p><p>Loxley\u2019s brown eyes darted from Skye to Trace. \u201cAre you some kind of bodyguard or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething.\u201d</p><p>Those brown eyes assessed Trace. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d Mitch\u2019s fingers snapped together. \u201cYou were at the hospital, back when Skye was first brought in. The admins upstairs forced us to let you in to see her.\u201d</p><p>With the right leverage, he\u2019d found his way to Skye\u2019s bedside. The fact that he\u2019d made a hefty donation to the hospital\u2019s charity board had certainly helped his situation.</p><p>Mitch\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re Trace Weston.\u201d</p><p>Trace shrugged.</p><p>\u201cTrace,\u201d the doctor gritted as his gaze jumped to Skye. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that name before, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>What the hell is that about?</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d Loxley continued, \u201cwhen you told me you were headed back to Chicago, that you\u2019d wind up with him.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want from me, Skye. You left and\u2014hold the hell up.\u201d A muscle flexed in his jaw as the doc seemed to fully grasp the situation. \u201cYou think it was me? You think I\u2019m the one who came after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Trace asked him.</p><p>The color had fled from Skye\u2019s face. Trace didn\u2019t like that. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know her before the accident. So I sure couldn\u2019t have been stalking her then.\u201d Mitch threw himself into his chair. The wheels rolled back. \u201cAnd, no, I didn\u2019t rush after her to Chicago. The sex was good, but trust me, I\u2019ve moved the hell on.\u201d</p><p>The sex was good. Every muscle in Trace\u2019s body tensed.</p><p>\u201cGive us a moment, would you, Skye?\u201d Trace\u2019s voice was soft. Too soft.</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d Worry had entered her voice. She did still know him so well.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cIt will only take a moment.\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. This is my life we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>The drumming of his heartbeat filled Trace\u2019s ears. He forced himself to look back at the doctor. \u201cDo you remember who visited Skye while she was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d Loxley snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t forget it when the hospital VP tells me I have to let some visitor in against regulations.\u201d</p><p>The guy needed to stop pushing. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of patients, it\u2019s not like I can remember everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fuck all your patients.\u201d Trace paused. \u201cAt least, I hope you don\u2019t. So since Skye warranted special treatment from you, I\u2019m thinking you might have paid a bit more attention to who was coming and going from her room.\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s eyes had narrowed. Anger burned in his dark gaze. \u201cThe British guy,\u201d Mitch bit out. \u201cWolfe. He came in, so did some of the women she danced with. I never saw anyone else, but then, I was working my rounds. Treating other patients. Not keeping a twenty-four seven watch on Skye.\u201d</p><p>The doctor just kept pushing...</p><p>\u201cI guess I know why you told me good-bye, Skye,\u201d Loxley said as he drummed his fingers on the desk. \u201cBut then, I knew what was happening after that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Skye told him.</p><p>Trace stiffened. Oh, hell, no, she didn\u2019t need to apologize to this jerk who didn\u2019t understand the whole concept of a doctor-patient relationship.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Loxley murmured. His gaze shifted to the door. Jaw hard, he said, \u201cNow if that\u2019s all, I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t all. \u201cI need to know where you\u2019ve been the last few days, doctor.\u201d Though Trace had a feeling that friendly nurse Marsha could give him that info.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you think I flew to Chicago and attacked Skye?\u201d Mitch rose from his chair. Crossed the small room until he stood right in front of Skye. \u201cIs that what you think? That I would hurt you? I\u2019m the one who saved your life. I\u2019m the one who helped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Mitch,\u201d Skye said. There was some bite in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t understand\u2014he\u2019s been watching me. For so long.\u201d Her hair slid over her shoulders as she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being afraid. I want him stopped. I thought...we thought you might have seen someone, seen something that could help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew anything that would help you, I\u2019d tell you.\u201d Mitch\u2019s gaze swept over her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded. She turned away. Trace headed to her side. He took her elbow.</p><p>Made sure that she exited that room.</p><p>But...before he left...</p><p>Trace shut the door. He flipped the lock so that Skye couldn\u2019t burst back inside. Then he squared off against the doctor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care for bullshit.\u201d Trace figured it was good to be blunt.</p><p>Skye knocked on the door. \u201cTrace?\u201d Her voice was high, shocked. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the desk. \u201cIf you\u2019re so over Skye, why is her picture on your desk?\u201d</p><p>The doc\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed.</p><p>\u201cYou better have people here who can say that you haven\u2019t left town. Because if I find out that you\u2019ve been following Skye...\u201d Trace smiled and knew the sight would chill. \u201cI will make sure that you\u2019re never a threat to her again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t even realize the photo was still there.

She\u2019s moved the fuck on, and you need to do the same.\u201d Trace held the guy\u2019s gaze a moment longer, wanting to make sure the fellow got the point.</p><p>Skye\u2019s fist hit the door. \u201cTrace, stop it!\u201d Fear and anger twined in that demand.</p><p>Because she remembered what he was like. She shouldn\u2019t worry so much. He was leaving the doctor in one piece. For the moment.</p><p>The sex was good.</p><p>\u201cIt might have just been good with you,\u201d Trace said as he cast a disdainful glance at the doc. \u201cBut it\u2019s fucking fantastic with me.\u201d</p><p>Then he left the not-so-good doctor glaring after him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Skye pounced on him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSet a few things straight.\u201d</p><p>Now it was time to find that nurse and confirm Mitch Loxley\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>The door slammed closed behind him. Trace was pretty sure he heard a fist hit the wood.</p><p>Good. The message had been received.</p><p>She belonged with him.</p><p>Skye had to see it. No one else would do for her. No one else could match her the way he did.</p><p>They were meant to be.</p><p>Her sweet scent still filled his lungs. Her face haunted his nights.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get away from her.</p><p>He\u2019d make sure she didn\u2019t escape from him.</p><p>There was no place that she could hide. He\u2019d been watching her for too long. He knew all her secrets.</p><p>Beautiful Skye carried so many secrets.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the good girl that people thought her to be. Wasn\u2019t the sweet sleeping beauty in need of true love\u2019s kiss.</p><p>Skye had a dark side. That was why he was so drawn to her.</p> <p>Skye\u2019s darkness matched his own.</p><p>No one would come between them.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>He\u2019d see Skye dead first.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cThe trip was a waste of time.\u201d The plane flew through the air, the sound of its engines not even penetrating the lush interior. Skye\u2019s fingers fumbled with the clasp of her seatbelt.</p><p>Trace sat across from her. His legs were spread, brushing against hers, and a glass of whiskey was held loosely in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI told you before...none of those men would do this.\u201d Her ex\u2019s. Since Evan was shooting a film in Hawaii, he\u2019d been ruled off Trace\u2019s suspect list. At least, she hoped that he had.</p><p>Both Mitch and Robert\u2019s alibis had checked out. Four dancers had backed up Robert. And the nurse with the too-big breasts had been quick to fill in Trace about Mitch\u2019s recent activities.</p><p>\u201cI needed to see them,\u201d Trace took a long drink of the whiskey, \u201cand their reaction to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me? Uh, they didn\u2019t exactly have a reaction\u2014\u201d</p><p>He downed the rest of the whiskey in a fast gulp. \u201cRobert views you as a possession. His possession. A dancer that he controls.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did. She glanced out the darkened window. That was the reason she\u2019d broken things off with him. Not that there had been much to break-off. They\u2019d only been together a week when she realized she\u2019d made a serious mistake by getting intimately involved with him.</p><p>\u201cAs for the doctor, he was lying through his teeth.\u201d Trace sat the empty glass down beside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Marsha had said that Mitch hadn\u2019t left town in over two months. Trace had seemed doubtful, but Marsha had pulled out appointment calendars that were filled with patient listings\u2014all tying back to Mitch.</p><p>\u201cMitch Loxley would take you back in an instant if he could. He probably still jerks off to you at night.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. He had not just said that to her. \u201cYou can\u2019t know that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can. Because I did the same damn thing until I got you back.\u201d Trace unhooked his seatbelt. Stared at her with glittering eyes. \u201cCome here, Skye.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to move. \u201cWe didn\u2019t learn anything useful in New York.\u201d Why had her voice gone all husky?</p><p>His hot gaze stayed on hers. \u201cI got a chance to talk personally with the cops. I went over the police report for your accident. I actually learned a hell of a lot.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>His voice had deepened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Her heart was pounding too hard and fast in her chest. She shifted her legs restlessly. Brushed them against his. The move hadn\u2019t been deliberate, had it?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not close enough.\u201d His fingers tapped against the armrests on either side of his seat. \u201cI like that skirt on you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d had a lot of clothing choices. Since he\u2019d been the one to pack for this little trip, she\u2019d had to take what she could get.</p><p>Right then, Skye wore a long, black skirt and matching top.</p><p>Underneath that skirt?</p><p>Thigh highs. Her garter belt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the doctor mean when he said, \u2018after that night\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Her breath burned in her lungs. She did not want to make this confession. She needed to keep a little pride.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Loxley are.\u201d He hadn\u2019t moved from his seat. \u201cBut you and I are just getting started.\u201d His gaze swept over her. \u201cWhy are you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>That question caught her off guard. \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d An instant denial.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you are. You\u2019ve been afraid of me since the night we met.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to remember that night. \u201cYou saved me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scared you because I was so violent. Because in that one instant, you saw the real me\u2014the me that I try so hard to hide from everyone else.\u201d</p><p>The man who\u2019d walked a razor\u2019s edge of violence. Who\u2019d attacked with a stunning fury.</p><p>\u201cNo other woman has seen me like that.\u201d His gaze returned to pin hers. \u201cI try to take care with them, to make sure that I hold myself in check.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to pretend to be someone else with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Not with you.\u201d His right hand lifted. Opened toward her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re scared. Because you know how dangerous I can be, and you still want me.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she did.</p><p>Skye found herself rising. Walking those few feet that separated them and reaching for his offered hand.</p><p>He immediately pulled her down on top of him. In seconds, Trace had her positioned so that her legs draped over his. So that her sex pushed down against the firm ridge of his arousal.</p><p>His lips were on her neck, kissing her lightly. \u201cTell me about that night...the night the doctor lost you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>His fingers slid under the skirt. Trailed lightly up her thigh. Her muscles tightened beneath that touch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>His fingers pushed a little higher. Her body was tense, aching. If he would just move his fingers up a little bit more...</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Skye?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to open her eyes. To meet his bright stare. \u201cI want you.\u201d No hesitation. No lies.</p><p>His head tilted. \u201cThe pilot is close by. What if he hears you?\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat a little faster at that. \u201cI-I won\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made you scream before.\u201d</p><p>Her breath sawed from her lungs. His fingers had risen up a few more inches. She felt them at the edge of her panties. Then...then he was touching her through the soft silk. Rubbing over her and she pressed down into his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t make a sound,\u201d she whispered again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see...\u201d Trace murmured. His fingers slipped under the silk. \u201cOh, baby, you\u2019re already wet for me.\u201d His fingers caressed her sex, teasing her, tormenting her.</p><p>Skye\u2019s hands locked on the seat behind his head. She squeezed tightly when his index finger thrust into her.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t enough. She needed more from him.</p><p>His thumb pressed over the center of her clit. Pressed, rotated, and had her hips thrusting desperately against his hand.</p><p>Her nails sank into that seat when a second finger pushed into her.</p><p>He kissed her neck. His tongue licked her skin, then she felt the faint bite of his teeth. \u201cYou want to come, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was almost\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut not yet,\u201d he said, and his fingers eased back. Stroked, but didn\u2019t push her toward that wild rush for pleasure. \u201cNot just yet.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned. Their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cTell me about that night.\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>She shoved away from the seat, away from him. \u201cNo.\u201d Why did he have to know everything about her? Some shames were her own.</p><p>Skye tried to scramble back into her seat. Forget being graceful. She would just fall on her ass if necessary. Whatever. Anything to escape.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t let her go. He pulled her back against him, and the long, thick bulge of his arousal pressed into her damp panties. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to run.\u201d</p><p>Not when they were nearly thirty thousand feet up in the air.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to run, not from me. I\u2019m the one you ran to.\u201d His mouth was on her neck again. On that spot where her shoulder and neck met. On the spot that always made her weak.</p><p>She hated being so weak with him. So vulnerable. He shouldn\u2019t have such power over her body. Over her. He shouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>He\u2019s not the only one with power.</p><p>Determination filled her. She wasn\u2019t going to play his game. She\u2019d show Trace that his need for her blazed just as hot as her own.</p><p>Her hands pushed between them. Found that heavy length of arousal. She stroked him through the pants that he wore. His cock jerked beneath her touch.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plane will land soon. I\u2019m done talking.\u201d She\u2019d been through enough. She unbuttoned his fly. Unzipped his pants. No underwear. Typical for Trace. Her fingers closed around him, and she pumped his flesh. Once, twice.</p><p>Touching him turned her on. That was her weakness.</p><p>It was his, too.</p><p>His breath hissed out. His fingers pushed into her sex again, thrusting hard and deep even as she pumped him. It was good, so good, hands stroking, caressing. She still had her skirt on. Her bra, her panties...he\u2019d just shoved those panties to the side.</p><p>He was hot and hard and strong in her hand. Moisture gleamed on the head of his arousal, and she knew that just a few more\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot that way,\u201d he snarled, the words dark and hard. \u201cIn you.\u201d</p><p>Her panties ripped. He lifted her hips. Her skirt swirled around them. He lifted her\u2014and thrust deep.</p><p>He filled her completely with that one thrust. So full that she couldn\u2019t move for an instant. Her knees were on either side of his hips. One of her knees jammed into the armrest\u2014she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Trace started to move again. No, he moved her. Lifting her up, bringing her crashing back down.</p><p>\u201cCan you...stay quiet...?\u201d He rasped the words as the black of his pupils spread in his eyes. \u201cOr will you scream...for me?\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced faster, seeming to jump from her chest. His hand was still stroking the center of her need, and he had her angled so that every thrust sent his cock over her most sensitive flesh.</p><p>His open pants brushed against her legs. Still dressed. We\u2019re both\u2014</p><p>\u201cI like it when you scream.\u201d</p><p>Her release was coming. Tightening her body. Spiraling up and blazing through her.</p><p>He thrust harder. Harder. His grip was so tight, she wondered if it might bruise her.</p><p>Then she\u2014</p><p>Trace drove deep.</p><p>She exploded with a release so hard and consuming that her whole body shuddered. A cry broke from her lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, hell, yes.\u201d Trace found his own pleasure. A hot tide filled her as he came.</p><p>For a few moments, she couldn\u2019t see anything. She could only feel the pleasure that shook her body in hard, desperate waves. Her breath wasn\u2019t deep enough. Her heart couldn\u2019t slow down.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking beautiful...\u201d He brushed back her hair. Kissed her.</p><p>Was that the first time he\u2019d kissed her on that plane?</p><p>She blinked, and some of the darkness seemed to fade.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to begin our descent...\u201d The pilot\u2019s voice floated to her. \u201cPlease make sure you\u2019re buckled.\u201d</p><p>Heat burned her face.</p><p>Trace just laughed.</p><p>She\u2019d screamed. Right at the end there, she\u2019d screamed for him.</p><p>Fumbling, Skye pulled away from Trace. Her panties were on the floor. She grabbed for them.</p><p>But Trace got to them first. His hand fisted around her underwear. \u201cThey\u2019re ruined. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll buy you a new pair.\u201d</p><p>She sank into her seat. Her thighs were trembling. She could still feel him inside of her.</p><p>Her sex kept contracting.</p><p>Her hands fumbled as she hooked the seatbelt. Skye squeezed her legs together as she tried to stop that trembling.</p><p>Very slowly, he readjusted his own clothes. He tucked her panties in his pocket. Trace kept his eyes on her. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWh-what thing?\u201d Why did she have to stutter around him?</p><p>\u201cYou are afraid of me, but you want me anyway.\u201d His lips twisted in a smile that held no humor. \u201cSometimes I even wonder, do you want me because you fear me?\u201d</p><p>The plane began to descend. She felt the slight change. \u201cWhat kind of question is that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you like my darkness, Skye. Because it\u2019s so damn different from what you are.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t some kind of light to his dark. She\u2019d never seen him that way. Actually, she saw things very differently.</p><p>He should see my darkness.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m capable of doing.\u201d His gaze seemed to see right into her. \u201cI almost killed for you when I barely knew you. And now...now you know I would kill for you. In an instant, with no hesitation.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about what he might do. \u201cI didn\u2019t...I didn\u2019t come looking for you because I wanted you to kill someone.\u201d That wasn\u2019t who she was.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asked, and there was doubt in his deep voice. \u201cAre you very, very sure? Think about it, Skye. Just what is it you want me to do to this man who is after you?\u201d</p><p>The plane bumped a bit. Her hands clamped down on the armrests. \u201cI want him stopped. I don\u2019t want him dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was the one who caused your wreck, if he tried to kill you...do you truly believe I\u2019d just turn him over to the cops?\u201d His gaze swept over her face. \u201cYou know me better than that.\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t speak then. Because he was right. She did know him better than that. He might look like the successful businessman, but there was a primal intensity to him. Just below the surface, waiting to break out.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNow you see me, and I see you.\u201d</p><p>Her dance studio was going to open tomorrow. Skye stood in the middle of the cavernous room, her gaze sweeping across the mirrors that cast her reflection right back at her.</p><p>No more broken glass. Trace\u2019s men had taken care of that for her. There were no flickering lights. And every time the front door opened or closed, the new alarm system gave a reassuring beep.</p><p>\u201cAre you all done for tonight, Ms. Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward Reese. Trace had insisted that Reese stay with her while she made all of her last minute prep work at the studio. And she certainly wasn\u2019t going to deny that having the guy with her had been reassuring.</p> <p>Because she\u2019d been afraid when she first stepped inside the studio.</p><p>But I won\u2019t let him make me afraid. The studio was important to her. It was her dream, her chance at having a new life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She was. The floor sparkled. The barres were all in place. Her new students would come in to a perfect dance studio tomorrow.</p><p>A small start. That was her plan. To begin with a few classes and grow this place into the best damn dance studio in Chicago. She could do it.</p><p>I will do it.</p><p>She approached Reese with a determined smile. \u201cThanks for all of your help.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>She had to laugh at that. \u201cI doubt that you usually provide guard service at a dance studio.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a special case for the boss. What matters to him...\u201d Reese shrugged. \u201cIt matters to me.\u201d He glanced down at his watch. \u201cHe\u2019ll be meeting you soon.\u201d</p><p>It had been almost twelve hours since she\u2019d last seen Trace. He\u2019d had his work to attend to, she\u2019d needed to see to her studio. And...</p><p>I wanted some distance.</p><p>Because he\u2019d left her shattered after that ride on the plane.</p><p>She headed out with Reese. Pausing for a moment, Skye reset the alarm. Then they were outside. The night air wasn\u2019t as cool as it had been a few days before.</p><p>A quick glance around the area showed her that only Reese\u2019s car was in the parking lot. Everything was dark and still and\u2014</p><p>Skye groaned. \u201cI forget my bag. I\u2019ll be right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. That\u2019s not the way it works. I\u2019ll go back inside with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss\u2019s orders. Where you go, I go.\u201d</p><p>Right. She spun around and marched back toward the door. She unlocked the door and her fingers flew over the alarm pad. Reese was right at her back.</p><p>The door beeped when they slid inside. All of the lights turned on instantly.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute!\u201d She called over her shoulder as she rushed inside. \u201cI left my bag\u2014\u201d</p><p>The lights shut off.</p><p>No, no that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Trace had hired electricians to fix the circuit breaker.</p><p>She spun back around. \u201cReese!\u201d</p><p>Thud.</p><p>She stilled.</p><p>A groan reached her ears. Her breath choked out. \u201cReese?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Not a single step.</p><p>Then she heard something else. It sounded like\u2014like water being poured out. Water?</p><p>\u201cR-Reese?\u201d She called again. The alarm hadn\u2019t sounded anymore. The system had just given that one beep when they\u2019d gone inside.</p><p>Did we shut the door? Reese had been behind her. She\u2019d rushed ahead, thinking he would shut the door.</p><p>Had he?</p><p>The water kept pouring around her. She took a deep, frantic breath and realized that wasn\u2019t water.</p><p>The acrid scent told her it was gasoline.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Skye shouted and ran forward. \u201cReese!\u201d She tripped over something. Something soft and warm, and Skye careened to the floor. Her left leg twisted, and pain shot through her.</p><p>Her hands flew out. She touched a hard shoulder. Hair. \u201cReese?\u201d Her fingers skimmed over his face and head, and she felt the sticky wetness of blood.</p><p>A light flickered in the darkness. A match. \u201cI will be the one.\u201d</p><p>That voice chilled her.</p><p>The match flew through the air.</p><p>Then the fire ignited.</p><p>Trace slammed his Jag to a stop and jumped from the vehicle. His eyes were on the studio\u2014on the horrifying orange and gold flames filling that studio.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d Trace roared her name.</p><p>Reese\u2019s car was to the left. Empty. There was no sign of the other man or Skye.</p><p>Don\u2019t be in the fire. Don\u2019t.</p><p>But then he heard the faint cry of\u2014 \u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s voice. Coming from the fire.</p><p>He ran for the building even as the windows shattered and glass flew out at him.</p><p>The main door was open, smoke billowing from it. He rushed inside, heading straight into the smoke.</p><p>Flames lit the scene. Skye was on the floor, coughing, and struggling to pull Reese\u2019s unconscious body toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she cried again as he looked up. Tears streamed down her face. \u201cI-I can\u2019t get him on my own!\u201d</p><p>Because Reese was three times her weight. The fire had circled in close to Skye\u2019s skin. Too close. Trace grabbed her around the stomach. Yanked her away from Reese.</p><p>Get Skye to safety. Get her out.</p><p>She screamed and struggled against him. \u201cNo, I have to help Reese!\u201d But Trace just held her tighter. The fire was too close. Trying to scorch across her skin.</p><p>He ran outside with her. She was still coughing. She\u2019d been in the smoke and fire too long.</p><p>As soon as he put her down, Skye immediately tried to run back for the building.</p><p>He grabbed her and yanked her right back. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d The words were torn from him. Fear and rage beat in his blood, a deadly combination.</p><p>Her eyes swam with tears. \u201cHe\u2019ll die! We have to get him out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d he swore. \u201cBut you have to stay here.\u201d He had to know that she was safe.</p><p>Skye nodded.</p><p>He ran back to the fire. He rushed inside the building. The fire had spread even more, the greedy bitch that it was. The flames lapped just inches from Reese\u2019s feet.</p><p>He grabbed his friend. Pulled him up. Tossed him over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s carry. We\u2019re getting out of here.</p><p>The breath in his lungs burned. The place was getting too hot. He took a step toward the door.</p><p>The ceiling fell down, coming right at him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Skye yelled when she saw the flames burst through the top of her studio.</p><p>Trace hadn\u2019t come back out. He\u2019d gone into the flames to get Reese.</p><p>And he just expects me to stay out here? While he faces the fire?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do that. Not for another second. Too much time had already passed. He should have been back.</p><p>She leapt forward.</p><p>Sirens screamed behind her.</p><p>She was at the door, running inside because she was getting to Trace. Only\u2014</p><p>He was right in front of her. \u201cTold you...\u201d Trace growled, \u201cstay out of the fire.\u201d</p><p>He had Reese thrown over his shoulder. She and Trace ran from the building. Fire trucks streaked toward them.</p><p>Trace put Reese on the ground. Trace\u2019s clothes were smoldering as he bent over his friend. \u201cCome on, buddy, don\u2019t do this...\u201d</p><p>Reese started coughing.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>An EMT jumped from the back of an ambulance and hurried toward them.</p><p>Skye glanced over her shoulder. The fire fighters were pulling out their hoses, but there wasn\u2019t much they could do to save the studio.</p><p>Fire had engulfed the place.</p><p>The EMTs strapped Reese onto a gurney. They pushed him toward the back of the waiting ambulance. One of the EMTs tried to take Skye\u2019s hand.</p><p>She pushed him away. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She couldn\u2019t take her gaze off that fire. The firefighters were trying to contain it so that the blaze didn\u2019t destroy the other nearby businesses. Businesses that\u2014luckily\u2014had been empty at this time of night.</p><p>The crackle of the flames filled her ears. Reese could have died in that fire. She\u2019d been pulling him, straining with all of her strength, but she\u2019d only been able to move him a few feet.</p><p>The fire had been so hungry. So hot. So wild.</p><p>I will be the one.</p><p>Reese could have died, because of her.</p><p>The ambulance\u2019s back doors slammed closed. The siren screamed once more as it raced away with Reese.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell...\u201d Trace began as he closed in on her, \u201chappened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I wanted to know,\u201d Alex Griffin said as the detective stepped right in front of Skye, blocking her view of those terrible flames.</p><p>Alex? She hadn\u2019t even seen him arrive. But Skye glanced around the scene and saw that several police cars were there now. It looked like they were setting up some kind of perimeter.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sullivan,\u201d Alex continued, clearing his throat, \u201cwanna tell me what just happened?\u201d</p><p>A fire just happened. Can\u2019t you see it? Big, freaking huge, destroying my dreams.</p><p>\u201cHe was here.\u201d Skye barely recognized the hollow voice as her own. \u201cHe set the fire. T-tried to kill me and Reese.\u201d</p><p>And if Trace hadn\u2019t been there, the bastard might have just succeeded.</p><p>The flames rushed into the sky, lighting the night.</p><p>The smoke drifted in the air, and Skye watched her dream burn away.</p><p>The fire gutted the studio. It burned and burned and even the fire fighters couldn\u2019t seem to do anything to stop his flames.</p><p>Skye watched the fire.</p><p>Stared at it with lost eyes.</p><p>And he, in turn, watched her.</p><p>I had to punish you.</p><p>After what she\u2019d done, Skye had needed to be taught a lesson.</p><p>As the smoke drifted into the air and the fire fighters finally backed up, he smiled.</p><p>He was pretty sure that Skye wouldn\u2019t be forgetting this night anytime soon.</p><p>Now you\u2019ll always think of me...the way I always think of you.</p><p>Every. Fucking. Moment.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cYou saw no one?\u201d Alex demanded as he paced the small interrogation room.</p><p>Interrogation.</p><p>Trace sat with his legs sprawled in front of him. The detective had been insistent that Skye come in to the station for an interview after the fire. Trace hadn\u2019t been about to let her out of his sight.</p><p>Because every time I do, something happens to her.</p><p>He could still smell the flames, probably because the damn smoke was in his clothes. The fire had singed him. When the ceiling had caved in, he\u2019d had to dive fast and hard to the right. Another few inches, and both he and Reese would have been trapped. Dead?</p><p>His breath exhaled slowly. He had gotten out of those flames, and he\u2019d carried Reese to safety.</p><p>His friend was going to be okay. But if Trace had arrived at that studio just little bit later...</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone,\u201d Skye said softly. \u201cBut I heard him, pouring gasoline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it was gasoline?\u201d Alex stopped pacing and narrowed his eyes on Skye.</p><p>She ran her hand through her hair. A black smudge slid across her right cheek. \u201cThe smell. It\u2019s pretty unmistakable, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her.</p><p>Trace cocked his head. This was a colossal waste of his time. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be out, detective, looking for the asshole who did this? From my count, that\u2019s an arson and an assault, all within a few days.\u201d Attempted murder, more like.</p><p>Alex\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lights were out.\u201d Skye shook her head. \u201cI only saw the flash of his match, then I heard his voice.\u201d</p><p>Trace tensed. She hadn\u2019t told him this part, not yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Alex pushed.</p><p>\u201cThe same thing he said before.\u201d She was too pale. \u201cI will be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t recognize his voice?\u201d Alex yanked out the chair on the opposite side of the table. He spun it around, then sat down, draping his arms over the chair\u2019s back. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t familiar to you, at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was rasping, whispering.\u201d Her shoulders rolled. \u201cSo, no, I didn\u2019t recognize his voice. I still don\u2019t know who this guy is or why he\u2019s doing this to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex\u2019s fingers tapped against the chair. \u201cYou think he\u2019s the same man who caused your accident in New York?\u201d Then he reached forward and opened a manila folder that was on the table. He shoved some stark, black and white photos across the table.</p><p>Photos of a totaled vehicle. Skye\u2019s car.</p><p>She was trapped there.</p> <p>He looked up from those photos and found the detective\u2019s gaze on him. \u201cWhile you were away on your little trip, I did some more digging,\u201d the detective said.</p><p>Good. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing your job.</p><p>\u201cI talked with a detective Fuller in New York.\u201d The detective glanced over at Skye. \u201cHe said you were sure someone had forced you off the road.\u201d</p><p>Skye nodded.</p><p>Trace pushed the photos back toward the detective. \u201cWe just talked to Fuller, too. The guy didn\u2019t buy Skye\u2019s story\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause there was no evidence of anyone else at the crash scene. No paint from another car. No sign of a rear impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car...\u201d Her voice was too cold for Trace as Skye said, \u201cRolled four times. It was smashed like a damn can. There were signs of impact all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuller thought it was a one-vehicle accident,\u201d Alex continued. His gaze had locked on Skye\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not Fuller. I know you\u2019re scared, and it sure looks to me like you have a reason to be.\u201d</p><p>It should look that way to fucking everyone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing Weston took you to New York because he thought it might be one of your ex\u2019s, huh?\u201d Now Alex\u2019s gaze swung back to him. \u201cHow\u2019d that work out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running their alibis.\u201d And so far, turning up jack. So...no, it hadn\u2019t fucking worked out for him.</p> <p>Alex pursed his lips and nodded. \u201cRunning their alibis...that\u2019s good.\u201d He put the photos of Skye\u2019s wrecked vehicle back inside the folder. \u201cBut what about your own alibi?\u201d He pushed another sheet of paper toward Trace.</p><p>Trace stared down at a picture of himself. An image from a New York newspaper.</p><p>\u201cYou tend to catch attention when you go places,\u201d Alex murmured. \u201cGuess that\u2019s the price of being so rich, huh? When you went to New York to see the ballet...Sleeping Beauty, right? Well, you were caught leaving the show early that night.\u201d Alex paused. \u201cThe date on the image...that would be the same day that Skye here had her wreck.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s hand reached for that newspaper clipping. She pulled it toward her. \u201cYou were in New York? At my show?\u201d Her head turned toward him. A faint furrow appeared between her brows. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this isn\u2019t the first show he\u2019s caught.\u201d Again, Alex reached into that folder. \u201cSeems that when you were performing, Trace here made a point of coming to see you dance. At least once, sometimes twice a month. He was always there for opening night, but he\u2019d go back, to catch other performances, too.\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch. The detective had been busy.</p><p>\u201cYou...you saw me dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saw you, quite a lot.\u201d Now Alex seemed musing. \u201cHe liked to stay at the same hotel every time he went to see you...that posh place right off Fifth Avenue. I believe you both stayed there on your recent trip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho did you talk to?\u201d Trace demanded. Because someone had been talking too fucking much. This kind of personal leak wasn\u2019t allowed in his organization. An assistant, an agent\u2014someone was about to get his or her ass fired.</p><p>\u201cI grew up in New York,\u201d Alex said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve still got some friends there, and they helped me with my digging.\u201d His lips pursed. \u201cSkye, you mean to tell me that you didn\u2019t know he was there, any of those times? With the two of you being such old...friends...I thought you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d Her voice was even colder now. Her eyes were on Trace. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He didn\u2019t want to have this conversation with the detective\u2019s watchful stare on them. \u201cBecause we were over.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>Hell. He was fucking this up. We were over. You\u2019d moved on. I just needed to see you.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just at your dances, though.\u201d And, again, the cop pushed clippings aside. He extracted a final photo from that file. Another photo from the crash scene. Only this time, the wreckage was in the background. Skye was strapped in a gurney and being loaded into an ambulance.</p><p>\u201cA reporter on the scene that night caught this shot, but his bosses were...persuaded not to run it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d stilled.</p><p>\u201cThat man, right beside the EMTs, that\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it, Weston?\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s breath rushed out. \u201cYou were there the night of my crash?\u201d</p><p>Shit. He had to tread very, very carefully now. \u201cI found your car. I called for help.\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cWhy were you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was following you,\u201d Alex murmured as his brows lowered. \u201cHe\u2019d been watching you for some time. I suspect he left that ballet early, and he waited for you to leave, too. Then he followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened!\u201d Trace snapped. He should have told her. Dammit, the minute she\u2019d walked back into his life, he should have told her that he\u2019d been there.</p><p>As if he could forget those moments. The pelting rain. The lightning that flew across the night sky.</p><p>The blood.</p><p>The sick, twisting fear because he could not get her out of the mangled mess that had been her car.</p><p>\u201cYou were the hero who saved her from death,\u201d Alex said as he gave a nod. \u201cBoth in New York, then here, in Chicago. You\u2019ve saved her...what, two times in the last few days?\u201d</p><p>Skye wasn\u2019t speaking. Her eyes were so big and wide and lost.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into her studio, slammed her head into the glass...then you appeared, just in time to play her white knight.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice was grim.</p><p>\u201cI had a guard on her, I had\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone set her studio on fire tonight. Before the flames could get to her, you appeared again.\u201d</p><p>Skye jumped to her feet.</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t move. His hands had fisted. \u201cYou think I\u2019m her stalker.\u201d</p><p>Did Skye think that, too?</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d Alex began slowly as his face tensed in hard, tight lines, \u201cthat you\u2019ve been obsessed with Skye Sullivan for a very long time. Since you were kids, right? That was when you put Parker Jacobs in the hospital. According to him, you did it just because you caught the two of them kissing.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t! Help me!</p><p>Trace forced his hands to unclench. \u201cParker is a fucking liar. You\u2019d be wise not to believe a word he says.\u201d</p><p>Skye had backed away from the table. From me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to believe you?\u201d Alex\u2019s question mocked him. \u201cI tried to get access to your military service records, but Uncle Sam has those sealed tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way they should be.\u201d He needed to talk to Skye. Alone. He\u2019d get her to understand what he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dangerous man, Trace Weston. You went black ops within months of your deployment. Vanished during your service for nearly four years, then you burst back on the scene with connections to some of the most powerful players in the world.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t talk about his service time. Never had. Never would.</p><p>\u201cYou came back, then you fixated on the one thing that had always mattered most to you.\u201d Alex\u2019s gaze cut to Skye. \u201cYou watched her, you wanted her, and you couldn\u2019t stand for anyone else to have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d She barely breathed his name. \u201cTell me...tell me you weren\u2019t at the crash.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to lie to her anymore.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t hung up on you. Skye had other lovers, so you had to put a plan in place. You needed to get her vulnerable. She was the celebrity in New York, surrounded by too many people. So you took that celebrity status away\u2014you took her dancing away. You caused that wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d Trace leapt to his feet. His chair slammed down on the floor behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe was so hurt in the crash that she had to give up dancing, and that was exactly what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Trace stalked around the table, heading right for that bastard.</p><p>Alex shoved away from his chair and stood up, fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cYou took away the dancing because that is what originally took her away from you, right? That\u2019s what Parker said. Skye left to follow her dreams in New York. She left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Skye\u2019s denial. That sound halted Trace before he could drive his fist into the cop\u2019s face. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. Trace was joining the military. He...he\u2019s the one who left me. He told me to go.\u201d Her hair brushed over her shoulders as she shook her head. \u201cHe rejected me, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe he changed his mind.\u201d Alex didn\u2019t glance her way. \u201cMaybe he saw so much blood and death during his deployment that it made him want life again. Want you. But he had to come up with a way of getting you back...and he did. He made you afraid. So afraid that the only person you could turn to for help would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace grabbed the guy and shoved him back against the wall. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just assaulted an officer.\u201d Alex smiled at him even as the door to the interrogation room flew open. Two uniformed cops rushed in and grabbed Trace\u2019s arms. \u201cI don\u2019t care how damn rich you are, Weston, you\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p><p>He could have broken free from the cops. Could have gone right after the detective again. Instead, Trace offered the cop his own, grim smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake, detective. A very, very serious one.\u201d</p><p>Alex straightened his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. What I\u2019ve done is keep her\u2014\u201d He jerked his thumb toward Skye. \u201cSafe. I\u2019ve shown her just what you really are.\u201d</p><p>The uniformed cops pulled Trace toward the door. He glanced over at Skye. \u201cShe already knows just what I am.\u201d She was the only one who knew what he was really like, deep inside.</p><p>He hated the pain he could see on her face.</p><p>The detective\u2019s fault. His gaze cut back to Alex. \u201cSoon enough, you\u2019ll see, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d Alex demanded.</p><p>\u201cMore of a promise...\u201d Then the cops forced him from the room. You should know, detective, I always keep my promises.</p><p>Her knees felt like rubber.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sit down, Skye,\u201d Alex said, speaking in a soft, soothing voice to her as he pulled out her chair once more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit down.\u201d She wanted him to stop treating her like some kind of broken bird. Skye raked a hand over her face. \u201cIt\u2019s not Trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to believe that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved me!\u201d</p><p>Alex walked closer to her. Stopped less than a foot away. \u201cThat\u2019s what he wants you to believe. Are you so sure he wasn\u2019t at your studio before the fire started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t! I was there, Reese was there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReese is a trained agent, yet it looks like someone got the drop on him. Someone snuck up and knocked the guy out. I\u2019m guessing not many folks could do that, but Trace Weston, he could.\u201d</p><p>Trace could do anything.</p><p>He was at the wreck?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop seeing him with some freakin\u2019 rose colored glasses. He wanted you back, so he got you. He set up everything so that you had to return to him. Don\u2019t you see? He makes the threats, then he saves you from them.\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. \u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d She took a fast step toward the door.</p><p>Alex moved and blocked her path. \u201cHe\u2019s headed to booking. You can\u2019t talk to him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really going to arrest him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cAnd I figure he\u2019ll have some fancy-ass lawyer who comes in and gets him out by morning, but you know what? That gives you tonight. A night to be safe. A night to think about Weston. Every moment you\u2019ve spent with him. Realize who the hell he really is, and get smart. Get away from him. And you can stay alive.\u201d His fingers lifted and curled around her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you. You\u2014dammit, you remind me of my sister. She was like you. Trusting the wrong man. So sure he was right.\u201d His eyes glinted with a wild intensity.</p><p>\u201cAlex\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was eighteen when that right man beat her to death because he didn\u2019t want any other man getting close to her. Eighteen. He thought Susan was his, and he wasn\u2019t going to let her go.\u201d He gave a rough shake of his head, but his hands were light on her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way Weston looks at you. You think that man\u2019s not obsessed? He is. And I believe he would do anything to have you.\u201d</p><p>I would kill for you. In an instant, with no hesitation. Her lips felt numb as she said, \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Susan used to say, too. No matter how many times I told her otherwise...\u201d</p><p>The interrogation room door opened again. \u201cCaptain wants to see you, Griffin,\u201d the female officer said as she stood on the threshold. \u201cWants you now.\u201d</p><p>Alex dropped his hold on Skye. \u201cMake sure she gets home safely, will you, Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He backed away from Skye. \u201cRemember what I said, Skye. Think about him.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>The female officer stood uncertainly in the doorway. \u201cUm, miss, you ready for that ride?\u201d</p><p>Her nails dug into her palms. \u201cWhere\u2019s Trace Weston?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBooking.\u201d</p><p>Right. That was the same thing Alex had said. Skye\u2019s gaze slid to the table. To the photograph of her crash. He was there. \u201cThen, yes, I am ready to go.\u201d</p><p>The small apartment seemed to be closing in on her. Skye sat on the couch, unable to sleep. Two a.m., and she was wide awake.</p><p>The ticking of her clock seemed far too loud. Every second passed by so slowly. Every. Second.</p><p>She stood and strode toward her window. She couldn\u2019t breathe in that place. Skye threw open the window. An alarm immediately started to beep. One of the alarms that Trace had installed for her.</p> <p>Skye\u2019s back teeth clenched. She stalked to the alarm pad and stopped that damn beeping.</p><p>Then, through that open window, she heard the sound of music. A fast, driving beat.</p><p>Coming from the club down on the corner of her street.</p><p>The music drove out the sound of that ticking clock.</p><p>Before she gave herself a second to think, Skye grabbed her shoes and her bag. She nearly ran from her apartment and down the stairs. Her legs pumped. Her left calf twinged.</p><p>Then she was outside. A line of people snaked around the side of that club, waiting to get inside.</p> <p>Laughter, voices, and music drifted on the wind.</p><p>She wanted to get close to that music. She needed it.</p><p>No, not the music.</p><p>She slipped into the line.</p><p>She needed to dance. Dancing always helped her to forget the most painful moments of her life. Dancing helped her to cope. To survive.</p><p>She\u2019d go in the club. She\u2019d dance. She\u2019d be like everyone else for a time.</p><p>I\u2019ll forget.</p><p>Because if she didn\u2019t forget, for at least a little while, Skye thought she might just go crazy.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like the lady\u2019s going clubbing,\u201d Carol Jones said as she settled back into her car. An unmarked vehicle, it blended pretty well on the busy street. Friday night in Chicago. Sure, it was after two a.m., but the city usually just got pumping at this time.</p><p>She tightened her hold on the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s going into the club alone.\u201d What was the name of that place? The neon letters were flashing. Extreme. \u201cIt\u2019s a place called Extreme.\u201d</p><p>She sure hoped that she wasn\u2019t given orders to go in that club.</p><p>Not my scene.</p><p>The beat of the music was already giving her a headache.</p><p>She\u2019d rather take traffic duty over this detail any day.</p><p>But, if she had to follow orders...</p><p>Carol sighed. She\u2019d do her job.</p><p>\u201cYour detective made a serious mistake, captain!\u201d Trace\u2019s lawyer snapped as he grabbed his briefcase. \u201cHe deliberately provoked my client and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe charges have been dropped, Guthrie, what more do you want?\u201d The captain, older, with gray shooting through his red hair, sighed. \u201cMr. Weston is free to go.\u201d</p><p>Alex Griffin stood at the captain\u2019s side.</p><p>Trace had no doubt that Alex had been ripped a new one by the captain. You shouldn\u2019t have gone after me.</p><p>The charges might be dropped, but the situation between Alex and Trace was a long way from over.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Skye?\u201d Trace asked quietly.</p><p>Alex\u2019s features tightened. \u201cShe went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy herself?\u201d He swore. \u201cDammit, I\u2019m not the threat to her. Someone else is out there, and you just let her go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficer Carol Jones is keeping an eye on her.\u201d It was the captain who spoke. \u201cCarol took her home, and then we gave orders for Carol to stay and keep watch on Ms. Sullivan\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>His racing heart calmed a bit. The cops hadn\u2019t completely screwed up.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d He jerked his head toward Craig Guthrie. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ve seen enough of this station to last a fucking lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Guthrie nodded. The guy was on retainer. Five minutes after Trace had called him, Guthrie had rushed into the station.</p><p>The lawyer had been threatening a law suit even as the door swung closed behind him.</p><p>But, by then, the charges had already been dropped.</p><p>Alex was jerking me around.</p><p>The detective should know better than to play out of his league.</p><p>Trace\u2019s hands slammed into the main door and sent it flying open as he hurried outside. He needed to get to Skye and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who the girl is,\u201d Guthrie said as he grabbed Trace\u2019s arm. \u201cBut with the cops involved, it might be wise to back off a bit.\u201d</p><p>Trace paused. He glanced over his shoulder, looking back at the station\u2019s entrance. Alex had followed him out.</p><p>Not surprising.</p><p>\u201cBacking off isn\u2019t an option,\u201d he said and he shook off Guthrie\u2019s hold. His gaze met Alex\u2019s. \u201cNot a fucking chance.\u201d</p><p>The club was packed.</p><p>Lights flew over the crowd even as the music pumped out from the stage.</p><p>At first, Skye didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Her gaze swept the club.</p><p>Some women wore short and low-cut dresses. They writhed on the dance floor.</p><p>Others were dressed like Skye\u2014snug jeans, loose tops.</p><p>The music kept blaring. The beat was hard, driving.</p><p>A blond guy headed toward Skye. \u201cWant to dance?\u201d He had to yell to be heard over that pounding music.</p><p>Skye nodded. Dancing. It was what she needed. The only thing.</p><p>Trace lied. He lied.</p><p>She took the blond\u2019s hand.</p><p>Then she went onto the dance floor. She stopped thinking. Started feeling the beat.</p><p>And, finally, finally, stopped hurting.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The fucking asshole had his hands all over Skye.</p><p>Trace stood a few feet from the dance floor. His eyes had found Skye the instant that he stepped inside the club.</p><p>He could always find her.</p><p>Some blond jerk had his hands on Skye\u2019s hips. Skye was undulating and moving fluidly to the beat of the music.</p><p>Sensual temptation.</p><p>She pulled away from the man. Danced toward the center of the floor.</p><p>Spun. Rolled her body.</p><p>Another partner grabbed her.</p><p>She met his moves. Danced. Danced.</p><p>Pulled away.</p><p>Went to another damn partner.</p><p>The music\u2019s tempo increased. Skye easily matched the beat.</p><p>There was no limping. No stumbling. Just grace. Temptation.</p><p>No one else could dance like Skye.</p><p>Her body curved and spun. Dipped. Twisted.</p><p>Temptation.</p><p>Another partner. The crowd was loud. The band blasting.</p><p>Skye had nearly died that night. She should have been at home. Safe.</p><p>Another partner. Another. Fucking. Partner.</p><p>Trace stalked forward. Pushed his way through the crowd.</p><p>When she spun again, he was the one to catch her and pull her close.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t even look up at him.</p><p>Her body was rocking to the beat. Moving, moving...</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d Trace growled out the words.</p><p>Her head jerked toward him. She stopped dancing and seemed to finally see him.</p><p>Fear flashed in her eyes.</p><p>The band cranked their song up even louder.</p><p>Skye pulled away from him. Found another partner.</p><p>He followed her. \u201cTaken,\u201d Trace snapped to the blond.</p><p>The man wisely stepped back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Skye fired right back at him. \u201cI\u2019m not. Leave me alone, Trace. Get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound drunk. She sounded angry and afraid, but her words hadn\u2019t slurred.</p><p>He frowned down at her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Skye laughed. \u201cDancing. It\u2019s what I do, right? The only thing...\u201d She tried to break away again.</p><p>Not happening.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is after you!\u201d He pulled her closer. She was still moving. Her hips undulating. \u201cYou should be home.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes shielded her eyes. \u201cAre you the one after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever counted on. Don\u2019t do this to me, Trace.\u201d Her lashes lifted. There were fucking tears in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be the one hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Right there, on that dance floor, with that too-loud music and the hot press of bodies, she broke him.</p><p>His hands tunneled in her hair. He tipped her head back. \u201cI\u2019m not, baby. I\u2019m not.\u201d He kissed her. Hard and deep and desperately.</p><p>Skye had kept him sane for years, and she didn\u2019t even know it. Skye had made life worth living for him.</p><p>She thought he\u2019d hurt her? Terrorize her?</p><p>No. Hell, no.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he breathed the words against her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>He needed to get her out of that club. To some place quiet so that they could talk.</p><p>He could explain then.</p><p>She stared up at him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The words were a punch to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped,\u201d she said, lips trembling. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>To Skye, love was trust. He knew that. Because he knew her.</p><p>He pulled her close\u2014and he got her the hell out of that club.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s leaving,\u201d Carol said into her phone as she watched Skye rush out of the club. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not alone.\u201d Carol straightened in her seat. \u201cWow, wait\u2014wasn\u2019t he supposed to be in jail?\u201d Because that guy holding Skye Sullivan\u2019s hand sure looked like Trace Weston to her.</p><p>The man was pretty unmistakable.</p><p>She thought the couple would head back toward Skye\u2019s apartment. They didn\u2019t. Weston bundled her up in his black Jag and he raced away with her moments later.</p><p>The guy never glanced Carol\u2019s way. He\u2019d been focused only on Skye.</p><p>Carol listened to her orders as her hold tightened on the phone. \u201cOn it, sir.\u201d She tossed her phone to the side and cranked up her vehicle.</p><p>She was supposed to keep her eyes on Skye Sullivan.</p><p>That was exactly what she\u2019d do.</p><p>The elevator doors slid closed behind Trace, and he was finally able to take a deep breath as they headed up to his penthouse.</p><p>Vanilla. Skye\u2019s scent wrapped around him.</p><p>He glanced at her. She\u2019d retreated to the back corner of the elevator. The walls were mirrored, and his stark reflection stared back at him.</p><p>He looked too dangerous. Too wild.</p><p>Story of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in New York those times?\u201d Skye asked him.</p><p>The elevator silently rose.</p><p>He closed the distance between them. Didn\u2019t touch her. Instead, he put his hands on the mirror, positioning them on either side of Skye\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBecause I had to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you could have told me. Called me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever wanted something so badly...\u201d Trace whispered as he bent his head, \u201cthat you couldn\u2019t think about anything else? All you feel is need. An endless desire that churns through you.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little nod. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel...for you.\u201d</p><p>She was exposing her soul for him. He could do no less for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the way I feel for you,\u201d Trace told her. \u201cNothing else matters. Just you.\u201d</p><p>The elevator kept rising.</p><p>\u201cWhen you were eighteen, you had your dreams. Your dancing.\u201d She\u2019d wanted her stage so badly. \u201cFor once, once, I did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Her scent was making him light-headed.</p><p>\u201cI let you go,\u201d he rasped. \u201cIt tore my heart out, but I let you go because I wanted you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTrace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had nothing to offer you. Barely two hundred bucks to my name. And you were amazing. Fucking amazing. I\u2019d seen you dance, so many times. I knew that you\u2019d light up those stages.\u201d He wanted her mouth beneath his. \u201cBut I also knew...you\u2019d give all of that up, for me, in an instant.\u201d</p><p>Because, at eighteen, she\u2019d loved him.</p><p>Skye\u2019s love had been real and wonderful and so pure. No hesitations. No limits.</p><p>Her love had been the most precious thing in his life.</p><p>She had been the most precious thing. And because he did love her, he\u2019d tried, for once\u2014not to be a selfish bastard.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you giving up anything for me. So I told you I was done. That I wanted out.\u201d When he\u2019d just wanted her. \u201cI hurt you.\u201d Fuck, that knowledge still tore him up. \u201cAnd even as I did it, I swore to myself that I would never hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>The elevator had stopped.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have your dreams. I stepped back. And I pushed you away.\u201d Then he\u2019d gone out and clawed his way to the top. Done anything necessary to make a success of his life.</p><p>For her.</p><p>In case she ever came back to him. In case she ever gave him a second chance.</p><p>\u201cI kept thinking you\u2019d find someone else. Some nice, safe guy. Have a family.\u201d But she hadn\u2019t. \u201cThe years passed, and I...I had to see you. Just to make sure you were all right. Just to...fill the fucking hole in my chest from where my heart used to be.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened.</p><p>\u201cI saw you dance,\u201d he said, staring into her eyes, \u201cand I remembered what it was like to be loved by you. To be happy.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. \u201cThat night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cause the crash. I was...dammit, I was waiting at your place for you. I\u2019d decided that I was going to talk to you that night. To see if you still felt anything for me.\u201d But the hours had passed, and she hadn\u2019t appeared. He\u2019d gone looking for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And found the wreckage.</p><p>\u201cYou were awake when I found you,\u201d he said. Awake but...</p><p>Afraid. Of me. No matter what he\u2019d said, she\u2019d screamed and pulled away. He\u2019d thought...she doesn\u2019t want me anymore. She can\u2019t handle the darkness in me any longer.</p> <p>He\u2019d made sure she got to the hospital. He\u2019d forced his way inside to see her, again and again.</p><p>Then he\u2019d tried to give her time to heal.</p><p>\u201cWhen you walked into my office a few days ago...\u201d He stepped back and put up his hand to keep the elevator door from closing. \u201cI was so damn stunned. It was all I could do not to run and grab you, to hold you tight.\u201d And never let go.</p><p>She was still in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t burn your studio, Skye. I\u2019ve always wanted you to have your dreams. I wouldn\u2019t destroy them.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze held his.</p><p>He offered his hand to her. \u201cIf you love me, you trust me.\u201d</p><p>Because that was who she was.</p><p>Skye glanced down at his hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. This moment was hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any secrets between us,\u201d she told him, her voice soft. \u201cNot ever again.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t let his expression alter. \u201cBaby, you don\u2019t need to know the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d Sometimes, he wanted to forget them, but his nightmares wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>She stepped from the corner. Moved toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I want to know all of you.\u201d Her shoulders squared. \u201cAnd I want you to know all of me.\u201d She took his hand.</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>Trace pulled her into his arms. Kissed her. He lifted her up, holding her easily. He nearly broke down the door to the penthouse before they got inside.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make it past the foyer.</p><p>Too frantic. Too desperate.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>His clothes still smelled of smoke. The specter of death hovered too close.</p> <p>He stripped her there. Shed his own clothes in an instant.</p><p>He took her against the wall. Driving deep and hard and sinking into the only paradise he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Paradise, with her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get inside her deep enough. Couldn\u2019t touch her enough. Couldn\u2019t kiss her enough.</p><p>With her, Trace knew he could never have his fill. He\u2019d always want more with her. He\u2019d want everything.</p><p>She came around him, her delicate inner muscles squeezing hard. Her release brought on his own, and his body shuddered as the pleasure pierced him to his core.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>Didn\u2019t stop thrusting.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. He was starving, insane with need\u2014for her.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her for ten long years. She was back. No one and nothing would ever take her away from him again.</p><p>The phone call came just before dawn. Trace threw out his hand, grabbing for his phone.</p><p>His first thought...Reese. He\u2019d been told his friend was stable. Be okay, be\u2014</p><p>\u201cWeston,\u201d he barked into the phone. If that was the hospital...</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman in the lobby, sir,\u201d he recognized the voice of John Ford, his building manager. \u201cHe\u2019s insisting on seeing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take visitors,\u201d he said, rolling from the bed. \u201cEspecially not this damn early.\u201d Ford should know better. Skye slept on, undisturbed. \u201cTell him to get lost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very adamant,\u201d John\u2019s voice was hushed. \u201cHe said to tell you...his name\u2019s Mitch Loxley, and the news he has is urgent.\u201d</p><p>Loxley.</p><p>\u201cKeep him there,\u201d Trace ordered as his gaze slid over Skye once more. That SOB was in town? Right after the fire? \u201cI\u2019m on my way down.\u201d</p><p>The sheets pooled around her body. She looked relaxed, at peace.</p><p>She\u2019d stay that way.</p><p>He grabbed his clothes. Three minutes later, he was dressed and in the lobby.</p><p>John turned toward him. Mitch Loxley was at the man\u2019s side. Mitch appeared pale, and there were dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>What the hell does he want?</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me,\u201d Mitch began as he ran a hand over his face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t honest with you in New York. There\u2019s...there\u2019s something you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace?\u201d Skye reached for him when she woke up.</p><p>But the bed was empty. The sheets beside her felt cool.</p><p>She searched the penthouse.</p><p>Trace wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Uneasiness settled within her as she dressed.</p><p>Then she slipped from the penthouse and made her way downstairs.</p><p>Trace\u2019s gaze cut to John. \u201cWe need to use your office.\u201d Because he wasn\u2019t taking this guy anywhere near Skye.</p><p>John instantly nodded. \u201cOf course! Right this way.\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t speak again, not until he and Mitch were in John\u2019s office. The building manager hurried out of the room, then shut the door, making sure to give them privacy.</p><p>Trace crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the doctor. \u201cYour timing is shit, doc.\u201d Especially right after the fire. To be in same city...</p><p>\u201cI had to come.\u201d Mitch paced around the small confines of the office. \u201cI needed to tell you\u2014ah, dammit, you have to know the truth about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know plenty about Skye.\u201d He didn\u2019t need this guy cluing him in to anything.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mitch spun back around to face him. \u201cThen I suppose you know all about her mother? You know that Skye\u2019s mother was psychotic? Delusional? The car wreck that killed Skye\u2019s parents...her mother caused that wreck. She deliberately killed herself and her husband.\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t let his expression change. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Trace knew, he\u2019d found the truth long ago, but why had this guy dug into Skye\u2019s past?</p><p>\u201cI know because I was worried about her.\u201d Mitch blew out a hard breath. \u201cSkye...she\u2019s too fragile. Too damn breakable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you fucked her?\u201d Trace demanded, voice sharp. \u201cBecause she\u2019s breakable?\u201d</p><p>Mitch flushed. \u201cI thought she needed me. Skye does something to a guy. She makes you think\u2014she made me want to protect her.\u201d</p><p>Trace had always wanted to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cBut...something\u2019s wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>It took all of his strength not to lunge at the doctor.</p><p>\u201cI started to suspect the truth, after a few weeks. The things she would say, what she would do...\u201d Mitch\u2019s hands drove into the pockets of his coat. \u201cI talked to the detective up in New York. Fuller. No one pushed Skye\u2019s car off the road. I think she drove it off herself.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>\u201cSkye told me about someone breaking into her apartment back in New York, she told me that she felt like she\u2019d been watched\u2014she told me everything...\u201d Loxley\u2019s words trailed away.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t believe her,\u201d Trace finished, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t happening. I would be with her on the street, when she was so sure someone was behind her. No one was ever there. No one ever broke into her apartment. Nothing happened.\u201d A muscle jerked along his jaw. \u201cHer mother was in her early twenties when her schizophrenia first presented itself.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cYou went into her mother\u2019s medical records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelusions,\u201d Mitch muttered. \u201cParanoia. That\u2019s how it began for her mother\u2014and how it begins for dozens of others. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s beginning for Skye.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Someone is after Skye. She was attacked at her studio. She got a concussion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone see the attack?\u201d</p><p>No, his agent had found no one at the scene.</p><p>Mitch shook his head. \u201cHow do you know she didn\u2019t do it to herself?\u201d</p><p>Because I know Skye. You damn well don\u2019t. \u201cA fire nearly killed her tonight. Are you seriously standing here, trying to tell me that she might have done that, too? That she torched her own place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone see her attacker there?\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Loxley\u2019s breath heaved out. \u201cYou think I want this to happen? To her? I don\u2019t. I care about Skye. But her behavior was becoming increasingly erratic back in New York. When I told her that she needed help...that\u2019s when she fled.\u201d</p><p>Trace studied the man for a moment in silence, then demanded, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something when I questioned you at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to be wrong! I wanted to be, but my gut told me I wasn\u2019t. I came here, heard about the fire just a little while ago on the news\u2014and I knew that I had to see you. I had to warn you.\u201d He whirled away and strode toward the window on the right. \u201cBelieve me or don\u2019t, but you\u2019ve been warned. I think\u2014I think Skye can be dangerous. As dangerous as her mother was.\u201d</p><p>Trace kept his eyes on Loxley\u2019s back. \u201cShe didn\u2019t just leave because you tried to get her \u2018help\u2019.\u201d He wasn\u2019t buying that line. \u201cWhen we were in New York...\u201d And this had been bothering him... \u201cYou mentioned something about \u2018that night\u2019\u2014how it all changed then.\u201d He waited a beat and said, \u201cDo you really think Skye didn\u2019t tell me about what happened?\u201d Lying was easy for him. Especially when he was facing someone like Mitch Loxley.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s shoulders stiffened. \u201cNo.\u201d He sighed out the word. \u201cI figured she had.\u201d He turned to face Trace once more. \u201cBut doesn\u2019t that just prove my point? She confused the two of us. She called me by your name. She thought I was you. For an instant, Skye didn\u2019t know who I was\u2014or even where she was.\u201d</p><p>She called me by your name.</p><p>\u201cNo one is stalking Skye,\u201d Mitch continued, his voice strengthening. \u201cShe\u2019s a severely troubled woman. Just like her mother. She needs an evaluation, medical treatment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d</p><p>John hadn\u2019t locked the door. Shit.</p><p>Skye must have been eavesdropping outside. She\u2019d just shoved the door open. She stood on the threshold now, chest heaving, cheeks stained red. \u201cI\u2019m not imagining what is happening to me!\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s whole body jerked, like a puppet on a tight string. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean for you to hear this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, but I did hear it.\u201d She licked her lips and her chin notched up into the air. \u201cSomeone is after me, and it\u2019s not some figment of my imagination. What\u2019s happening to me is real.\u201d</p><p>Mitch eased toward her. His voice was low and soothing as he said, \u201cI know you think it is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do! Because it\u2019s real!\u201d She shoved her hair back. Pointed at him. \u201cYou want to talk about that night? Fine. Let\u2019s talk. I called you by Trace\u2019s name because I was thinking of him. I wanted him, okay? I always think of him. Every lover\u2014it\u2019s him. That\u2019s wrong and confused, and, maybe even a little crazy, but I know what I\u2019m doing. I wanted him that night, so I called for him.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it because I\u2019m having a breakdown! I did it because I wanted him.\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s face had turned stone. \u201cNo one can find any evidence of your stalker. Not the cops in New York. What about the ones here? I\u2019m betting they can\u2019t, either. Even Weston Securities has turned up nothing because he\u2019s not real. Just like your mother, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my mother.\u201d Her voice trembled with pain.</p><p>That was it for Trace. He leapt forward. Grabbed Mitch\u2019s arm and jerked the guy toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Mitch squealed. \u201cWhat are you doing? Stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your ass on a plane, and get out of Chicago. If you aren\u2019t gone by noon, I\u2019ll know. Then I\u2019ll come after you.\u201d Trace glared into the doctor\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that, got me?\u201d</p><p>Mitch swallowed. \u201cI-I just want her to get help.\u201d He cast a worried glance toward Skye. She\u2019d backed away from the door. \u201cI care about you. I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? By getting me committed?\u201d Red still stained her cheeks and her eyes glinted with fury. \u201cThe stalking is real. He is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mitch sounded sad and certain. \u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Trace took immense pleasure in throwing the doc\u2019s ass out of the building.</p><p>\u201cUh, sir...\u201d John began as he watched Mitch storm off down the street.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get past the door,\u201d Trace ordered. \u201cNot ever again, got it?\u201d</p><p>John quickly nodded. \u201cIndeed. I\u2019ve...got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He strode back to the office\u2014and found that Skye hadn\u2019t moved. Her gaze was on the window. \u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at him. \u201cGo talk to Reese. He can tell you that someone else was in that studio. I\u2019m not crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were.\u201d</p><p>Her smile held an edge of sadness. \u201cBut do you wonder?\u201d</p><p>He took her hands in his. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cI thought you were better at lying.\u201d Then Skye pulled away from him. \u201cI thought you were much better...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only saw Skye...\u201d Reese shifted restlessly in the hospital bed, a bandage taped around the left-side of his head. \u201cI felt like someone whacked me with a baseball bat, but I didn\u2019t see anyone but her.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Trace had been hoping for more. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear anyone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I had, the asshole wouldn\u2019t have gotten the drop on me.\u201d Reese exhaled slowly. \u201cSkye went in the studio first. I think she forgot her bag. I can remember her going in...\u201d His fingers clenched around the white sheets. \u201cThen not a damn thing until I woke up in this place.\u201d</p><p>Trace put his hand on Reese\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You just rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me out, didn\u2019t you? I heard the doctors talking...\u201d</p> <p>Trace nodded. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave you to the fire.\u201d</p><p>Reese gave him a tired smile. \u201cDoes that make three times...or four...that you\u2019ve saved my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I stopped counting long ago.\u201d He squeezed Reese\u2019s shoulder and slipped away from the bed. \u201cGet some rest, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait...\u201d</p><p>Trace glanced back at him.</p> <p>\u201cI do think...I remember one more thing.\u201d His eyes became slits as he seemed to struggle with the memory. \u201cYour girl, telling me she was sorry...again and again. I swear, I can hear her saying that.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any damn sense. Probably just the drugs they gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Trace murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll check back on you soon.\u201d</p><p>Trace shut the door behind him.</p><p>Skye caught sight of him, and she hurried toward him. \u201cWas Reese awake? Did you talk to him?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gone in alone because he\u2019d wanted to gauge Reese\u2019s responses for himself. He\u2019d also thought Reese might speak a little more freely if they were alone.</p><p>I remember one more thing. Your girl, telling me she was sorry...again and again.</p> <p>\u201cDid he remember anyone else being there?\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head.</p><p>Her face fell.</p><p>He had to ask her. \u201cBaby, during the fire, did you tell Reese that you were sorry?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers twisted her purse strap. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flashed up to meet his. Anger lit her green eyes. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t strong enough to get him out of the fire! Because I was using every bit of my strength, and I couldn\u2019t get him out of there!\u201d Her voice rose, catching the attention of two nearby nurses. \u201cBecause no matter what I did, I couldn\u2019t get him out of the door, and I was sure that we were both going to die in those flames.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her.</p> <p>She jerked back. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what you thought, is it?\u201d All of the heat left her voice. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy and you\u2014\u201d Sadness tightened her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I fucking do.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d already rushed toward the elevator. Swearing he ran after her. He threw out his hand, grabbing the doors before they could close. \u201cI do, baby,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019m the one who doesn\u2019t believe you.\u201d Her gaze held his. \u201cHow does that feel?\u201d</p><p>Like shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the studio. I have to\u2014I have to talk with the arson investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d He started to step into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her clipped response stopped him.</p><p>\u201cSkye...\u201d</p><p>Someone else brushed by him. Maneuvered into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI need a break,\u201d Skye said, her voice hoarse, as if she were trying to fight tears. \u201cSend one of your agents with me, but I need a break.\u201d</p><p>From you.</p><p>He forced himself to step back.</p><p>He held her gaze until the elevator closed.</p><p>Then Trace pulled out his phone. In less than five seconds, he had an agent ready to go. \u201cBe her damn shadow,\u201d he ordered. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t take a step without your eyes on her.\u201d</p><p>She might want her space from him, but he wasn\u2019t about to risk her life.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>It was gone. Her second chance had turned to ash.</p><p>Skye stared at the charred remains of her studio. There was nothing she could salvage there. Everything was just...gone. Destroyed by the flames.</p><p>She\u2019d already called her students. Skye had tried to reassure them that she would find another space.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t mentioned that she didn\u2019t have the money to rent another building.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She glanced to the left. As soon as she\u2019d arrived at the scene, she\u2019d realized that Alex Griffin was there, waiting on her. He\u2019d come straight toward her.</p><p>He watched her with a guarded expression that made her tense. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me if I\u2019m about to have a breakdown.\u201d Because that was the way he was staring at her. As if she\u2019d just shatter apart. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m much stronger than I look.\u201d The female cop, Carol\u2014the one who\u2019d given Skye a ride home the previous night\u2014stood a few feet behind Alex.</p><p>And Skye\u2019s newest watchdog from Weston Securities, a guy named Adam Longtree, waited about ten steps to Skye\u2019s right. She\u2019d quickly discovered that Adam was the strong and pretty much utterly silent type.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your studio,\u201d Alex said as he inclined his head toward her. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think you were about to breakdown. I figured if you were, well, you would\u2019ve done that last night.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cThen you make one person...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>Skye blew out a hard breath. She was so seeing her dreams covered by black and gray ash. \u201cYou make one person who doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m on the edge of some major meltdown.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had narrowed. \u201cDid you do like I asked? Did you think about Weston\u2014\u201d</p><p>She had to laugh. \u201cTrace isn\u2019t doing this to me. Hell, he thinks I\u2019m doing it to myself.\u201d Her arms felt chilled so she roughly rubbed them. \u201cTrace, the cop up in New York, Loxley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Alex cut in, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell Loxley is, but you should know that I did some more talking with Detective Fuller first thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got another mechanic to look at the car. There was still no sign of a rear-impact collision, but this guy did find something else.\u201d Her image was reflected back in his dark sunglasses. \u201cAll of the brake fluid was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The chill Skye felt got worse.</p><p>\u201cWith all the fluid gone, the car couldn\u2019t stop. That night, you were headed into the curve, and you must have tried to brake.\u201d He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t, and the car lost control.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just her arms that felt chilled. Her cheeks felt the same way. \u201cSomeone sabotaged the car.\u201d</p><p>Carol Jones stepped closer.</p><p>Alex darted a glance at Carol, then he focused once more on Skye. \u201cIt certainly looks that way.\u201d</p><p>Someone had been trying to kill her, for months. \u201cI want this to stop.\u201d What did she have to do? What? \u201cI can\u2019t live this way.\u201d Being afraid. Having a constant guard\u2014no.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him,\u201d Alex said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Easy for him to say. It wasn\u2019t his life on the line.</p><p>\u201cWith the new evidence, Fuller is re-opening the investigation in New York,\u201d Alex continued. \u201cThe jackass doing this is going down.\u201d</p><p>Carol gave a hard nod.</p><p>Skye\u2019s gaze darted between the two cops\u2014and over to Adam Longtree. She wasn\u2019t surprised to see that he had his phone out and at his ear. The guy was probably briefing Trace on this new development right then. Trace... Her gaze snapped back to Alex. \u201cYou think that jackass is Trace.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Carol whistled and rocked forward on the balls of her feet. \u201cHaving too much faith in the wrong man could be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I do is dangerous these days.\u201d She gave Carol and Alex a curt nod. \u201cThanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>She started hurrying away from them. Longtree immediately fell into step with her. Her big, six-foot-plus shadow.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>Pausing, she glanced back at the detective\u2019s call.</p><p>\u201cTell me you aren\u2019t staying with him.\u201d Tension had hardened Alex\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you that.\u201d Because she wasn\u2019t planning to return to Trace then. She hadn\u2019t lied when she told Trace that she needed a break.</p><p>Does he trust me?</p><p>Because, even after everything, she trusted him. She always had.</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going back to Weston\u2019s place, then where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid to the wreckage. \u201cTo find a new studio because I am not going to let my dream be taken from me.\u201d She\u2019d find a way to get the cash that she needed in order to rent another studio. There has to be a way. Skye wasn\u2019t going to give up. She just had to take things\u2014</p><p>One step at a time.</p><p>That was how she\u2019d recovered after the accident. How she\u2019d learned to ignore the pain and just walk.</p><p>One step at a time.</p><p>Alex watched Skye walk away, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem particularly scared to me,\u201d Carol said as she came fully to his side.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed more pissed, judging by the look in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and saw that Carol\u2019s gaze was on Skye. He followed Carol\u2019s gaze and watched as Skye climbed into the passenger seat of a waiting car. Her newest guard slammed the door and then headed for the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure she went home with Weston last night?\u201d Alex asked Carol. Dammit, he\u2019d warned Skye. Why wouldn\u2019t she take his warnings seriously? He wanted to help her.</p><p>But he was starting to think she had a death wish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s where she went. It\u2019s not easy to mistake that guy.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe rushed her out of the club and into that fancy car of his,\u201d Carol said. \u201cThey went to his penthouse and stayed in all night.\u201d</p><p>I warned her.</p><p>\u201cI guess some people like the danger too much,\u201d he said, voice gruff. His sister had been that way. He\u2019d warned her, too.</p><p>Warned her, and buried her.</p><p>Am I going to bury Skye, too?</p><p>\u201cWant me to keep up the detail on her?\u201d Carol asked. Her short, honey blonde hair blew in the faint breeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah, stay close. If you see anything suspicious, you let me know.\u201d Over her shoulder, he saw that the arson investigator was waiting to talk with him.</p><p>Like he needed the guy to tell him that the fire had been deliberately set.</p><p>That was fucking obvious.</p><p>As obvious as the fact that someone was playing a sick game with Skye Sullivan.</p><p>A game that wasn\u2019t going to end until Skye was dead.</p><p>Just like my sister.</p><p>This location could work.</p><p>Skye gazed around at the old fire station. Okay, sure, most people wouldn\u2019t think this place was primed to be a dance studio...</p><p>But this can happen. I can make this work.</p><p>Excitement and determination pulsed through her. She\u2019d make this studio even better than the other one had been. She could get started right away. If she worked fast enough, hard enough, then maybe she could even have the studio up and running in three weeks, maybe two.</p><p>The building could work, so now she just had to come up with the down payment for the place. She\u2019d already sold all of her jewelry. Her credit cards were maxed out.</p><p>But...there were a few people who owed her some favors. People like Robert. Maybe...maybe he could loan her the cash\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking over, Adam. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s voice. She didn\u2019t stiffen. Didn\u2019t start in alarm. Right then, she was too hopeful and happy to stiffen up.</p><p>Adam\u2019s footsteps padded away, but Trace\u2019s didn\u2019t come any closer to her.</p><p>Determinedly, she glanced to the left. She found him staring at her with a hard intensity in his gaze. \u201cI can put the mirrors there. The barres here.\u201d She gestured with her hands. \u201cThe open area in the center will be perfect for dancers\u2019 warm-ups.\u201d</p><p>His gaze didn\u2019t leave her face. That lethal intensity didn\u2019t lessen.</p><p>Skye swallowed. I can even use the upstairs area for an apartment. That will save me money because I can get rid of my place.</p><p>But...she\u2019d just gotten that wonderful security system at her place. She didn\u2019t want to lose it.</p><p>\u201cI think you should hold off on your studio,\u201d Trace said flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An immediate denial. She whirled to fully face him.</p><p>He wore a dark suit, one that emphasized the darkness of his hair and made his blue eyes gleam even brighter.</p><p>\u201cYes, Skye,\u201d he said, voice curt. \u201cYou need to slow down. Your last place was torched less than twenty-four hours ago. Don\u2019t you think that was a message? It\u2019s not safe for you to do this. You have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to make this work. I have to believe that I can do it.\u201d</p><p>Dancing was the only thing that had always gotten her through life.</p><p>When she danced, she became someone else. Someone stronger.</p><p>Without it...I\u2019m lost.</p><p>His hands closed around her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was the one doing this to myself,\u201d she snapped at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the story going around now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat story is bullshit.\u201d His fingers tightened on her. \u201cYou trust me, and I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. She wanted those words. Wanted them so badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She searched his eyes, wondering if he was telling her the truth...or feeding her the lie he knew she needed to hear.</p><p>Carol Jones gazed across the street at the old fire station. Skye Sullivan had sure been determined. She\u2019d gone through five buildings, touring them all with her guard right at her side, before she\u2019d stopped at this place.</p><p>\u201cAnd the guard is gone,\u201d Carol murmured as she watched the fellow hurry away.</p> <p>Since Trace Weston had strode into that old fire station a few moments before, the guard\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t a real big surprise.</p><p>But...Detective Griffin didn\u2019t trust Weston. He thought the man was guilty as sin.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t safe for Skye to be alone with him.</p><p>Carol eased open her car door. Then she headed swiftly across the street. Her phone was at her ear as she entered the alley. \u201cHey, Griffin, it\u2019s me.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for him to respond but hurried to add, \u201cSkye was looking for a new building to rent. She stopped at the old fire station on Ninth, and Weston just joined her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they there alone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so. I\u2019m going in for a closer look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>Always. Carol eased into the alley. Maybe there was a window back there that she could use for a little observation.</p><p>She tucked her phone into her pocket and took a few more steps forward.</p><p>Yes. There was a window. One covered in grime. She leaned toward the bricks, trying to ease up closer to that window so that she could see\u2014</p><p>Someone grabbed her from behind. A rough hand closed over mouth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get involved in business that doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d a snarling voice\u2014a male voice\u2014grated in her ear.</p> <p>She reacted immediately, driving her elbow back into her attacker\u2019s mid-section. He grunted and his hold eased, just for a moment. She jerked away from him. Carol grabbed for her weapon as she spun to face the man who\u2014</p><p>He shoved a knife into her chest.</p><p>Carol\u2019s fingers squeezed the trigger, but her attacker was already lunging away from her.</p><p>Her knees hit the ground. The gun slid from her trembling fingers and fell beside her. Her blood soaked her, and Carol didn\u2019t even have the strength to scream.</p><p>When the gunfire blasted, Trace grabbed Skye. He pulled her against his chest and curved his body protectively around hers.</p><p>One thunderous blast...then, nothing.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. That gunshot had come from out back, in the alley. Trace shoved back his coat and pulled out his own weapon.</p><p>\u201cWh-when did you start carrying that?\u201d Skye asked him. Her eyes looked huge\u2014and scared.</p> <p>\u201cI always carry it. I just usually made sure you didn\u2019t see it before.\u201d Because he hadn\u2019t wanted to frighten her away. But this moment wasn\u2019t about reassuring Skye. It was about finding out what the hell was happening in that alley.</p><p>He pushed open the rear door, but he made sure to stay low. To stay covered and\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hurt!\u201d Skye\u2019s cry.</p><p>Trace had seen the woman, too. A cop in uniform sprawled on the dirty ground.</p><p>Skye tried to lunge toward the woman, but Trace kept her back. \u201cWait...\u201d Because whoever had injured the cop could still be close by. Waiting to strike again.</p><p>He looked to the left. To the right.</p><p>A weak moan escaped from the woman, and, at that sound, Skye sprang away from him. She hit her knees beside the cop and reached for the knife in the woman\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Trace ordered as he lunged forward. His left hand flew up, locking around hers. \u201cLeave the blade in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Skye demanded, expression shocked. \u201cWe have to help her! She\u2019s dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll die faster if you pull out the knife.\u201d He\u2019d seen attacks like this before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Carol,\u201d Skye whispered. \u201cCarol Jones. She took me home last night.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d apparently stayed around to keep an eye on Skye.</p><p>He released Skye\u2019s hand. \u201cCall 9-1-1,\u201d he told her. \u201cTell them that a cop is down.\u201d They\u2019d haul ass getting to that location then. He kept his gun in his right hand. The attacker had to be close. He wanted to break away and search for the SOB, but Carol was choking on her own blood right then.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He tilted Carol\u2019s head. Tried to help her breathe. Blood covered her lips. Her eyes were hazy, pain-filled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Trace told her. He wanted the words to be true and not a fucking lie, but the killer had known exactly what he was doing when he attacked. The knife had plunged straight into her heart and...Trace leaned forward.</p><p>The bastard had twisted the blade. For maximum damage and maximum pain.</p><p>\u201cThe ambulance is coming,\u201d Skye whispered. \u201cHelp\u2019s coming, Carol. Just hold on.\u201d Skye\u2019s fingers curled around Carol\u2019s hand.</p><p>Carol\u2019s breathing seemed so ragged and loud.</p><p>That bleary gaze of hers flickered to Trace, then it darted over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou saw him,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Carol\u2019s breathing wasn\u2019t quite so loud.</p><p>Her gaze darted over his shoulder again.</p><p>\u201cHe ran that way?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. She tried to speak.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Skye cried. \u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes were still open. Still looking over Trace\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>But the officer was dead.</p><p>In the distance, an ambulance\u2019s siren wailed.</p><p>Too late. Too fucking late.</p><p>He surged to his feet. Spun toward the snaking alley that Carol had been looking at in her very last moment.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t have gone far, you SOB.</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d Trace told Skye. He shoved his gun into her hands. \u201cStay with the cop. Help\u2019s not far away.\u201d</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t waste any more time.</p><p>\u201cNo! You need a weapon!\u201d</p><p>He yanked out his back-up weapon from his ankle holster. \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d Then Trace took off running down that alley even as Skye shouted his name.</p><p>Carol fired her gun. Did she hit you, asshole? Did she?</p><p>He glanced down and saw the spatter of blood drops.</p><p>She did. And I\u2019m gonna follow your fucking trail of blood until I find you.</p><p>\u201cTrace!\u201d Skye yelled.</p><p>He kept running. He was ending this, before Skye was the one he found dead in a blood-soaked alley.</p><p>Skye stared down at Carol. The cop\u2019s eyes were closed now. Skye had closed them. Carol\u2019s face was chalk-white. Her lips stained red with blood.</p><p>The scent of blood filled Skye\u2019s nose.</p><p>Carol Jones hadn\u2019t deserved this. To die in an alley, surrounded by garbage.</p><p>To die in someone else\u2019s place. My place.</p><p>Skye still held tight to Carol\u2019s hand. But her gaze was on the alley. Trace was gone. He\u2019d run after the attacker.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Trace dying in her place.</p><p>Not Trace.</p><p>Not Reese.</p><p>Not Carol.</p><p>\u201cCome after me!\u201d Skye shouted. \u201cStop hurting the others! You let me be the one! Don\u2019t hurt anyone else!\u201d</p><p>A tear leaked from her eye.</p><p>The ambulance\u2019s siren was louder.</p><p>\u201cLet me be the one!\u201d She called out again. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt anyone else!\u201d</p><p>Doors slammed. Footsteps rushed toward her. She looked up and saw Alex rushing her way. Behind him, she could see EMTs. More cops.</p><p>Alex blanched when he saw Carol.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>The EMTs pushed her out of the way.</p><p>They tried to work on Carol.</p><p>You can\u2019t save the dead.</p><p>Carol\u2019s death was on her.</p><p>Skye looked back into the alley. No sign of Trace. What would she do if her stalker turned his attention on Trace?</p><p>\u201cSkye.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and realized that Alex was standing right in front of her. A muscle flexed in his jaw as he said, \u201cI want you to come with me. Come with me, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace went chasing after the attacker. We-we didn\u2019t see anyone, but Trace ran down the alley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have men look for him.\u201d His eyes...they burned with emotion. Pain. Grief. Fury. \u201cBut it\u2019s not safe for you to be out here. Come on.\u201d He took the gun from her hand. Led her to a patrol car.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry about Carol.\u201d Tears wanted to choke her.</p><p>Alex nodded. The pain in his eyes deepened. \u201cSo the fuck am I. She was only twenty-two. Twenty damn two.\u201d</p><p>The EMTs weren\u2019t trying to save Carol any more.</p><p>She saw the way the other cops were acting. Saw the way they were marking the area. This wasn\u2019t about saving a life for them.</p><p>It\u2019s a crime scene now.</p><p>The blood trail ended at the entrance to an old factory.</p><p>Trace kicked open the doors and rushed inside. His gun was up. Ready.</p><p>Dust and cobwebs covered the factory\u2019s interior.</p><p>Trace searched and searched but found nothing. Because the bastard led me here.</p><p>He\u2019d led. Trace had followed. And I left Skye alone.</p><p>He whirled around and started racing back to Skye.</p><p>Trace had only gone about five feet when the bullet hit him.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Another gunshot.</p><p>When Skye heard the thundering sound, her heart stopped. Alex ran toward the blast, and she dashed after him. Rushing faster, faster and\u2014</p><p>Trace was on the ground. Blood was all around him.</p><p>Just like Carol.</p><p>Just. Like. Carol.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Skye screamed.</p><p>Alex bent beside Trace. Backup\u2014more cops\u2014raced up around them.</p><p>Skye hit the ground beside Trace. So much blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...all right,\u201d Trace managed.</p><p>Her heart started to beat again.</p><p>\u201cSOB fired from the south. Waited for me to make a target...of myself.\u201d His breath heaved out. \u201cBullet\u2019s still in my chest. I\u2019ll be...fine.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d better not be lying to her.</p><p>In his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...not as good,\u201d Trace managed, \u201cwith a gun...as he is...with a knife...\u201d</p><p>Fear clawed at Skye\u2019s insides. She grabbed for Trace\u2019s hand and held tight.</p><p>Trace\u2019s gaze\u2014not as bright, and that dimness terrified her\u2014found Skye\u2019s. \u201cGet her...out,\u201d he rasped to Alex. \u201cHe could...be here still...\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t leaving him. Alex tried to pull Skye away, but she just held tighter to Trace. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Cops fanned out, started searching the area.</p><p>The EMTs came and loaded Trace onto a gurney. When they put him into the back of an ambulance, Skye jumped right in with him.</p><p>So much blood.</p><p>\u201cRode with you...too...\u201d Trace whispered. \u201cAfter...wreck...\u201d His fingers squeezed hers. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to...let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>The EMT pushed a needle into his arm.</p><p>The ambulance jostled, bouncing along the old road. The scream of the siren echoed around her.</p><p>The EMT cut away Trace\u2019s shirt, and she got a good look at the wound.</p><p>Skye stopped breathing. \u201cYou lied to me,\u201d she whispered to Trace.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>How was he still talking? Still conscious?</p><p>\u201cNever leave...you...this won\u2019t stop...\u201d</p><p>The EMT connected thin tubes to him. Something started to beep.</p><p>\u201cBlood pressure\u2019s dropping!\u201d The EMT snapped. Then he pushed Skye back.</p><p>Trace\u2019s fingers slid from hers.</p><p>You lied to me.</p><p>Because she\u2019d seen the wound, and she knew things weren\u2019t going to be all right for Trace.</p><p>The hospital\u2019s emergency room doors flew open. The EMTs ran with the gurney, barking out orders.</p><p>Skye sprinted to keep up with them.</p><p>Doctors and nurses jumped into action, swarming that gurney.</p><p>Please, please take care of him.</p><p>Trace vanished into the ER. The doors swung shut behind him.</p><p>She stood, alone, in that narrow hallway. Staring after him. So lost.</p><p>I can\u2019t lose him again. She and Trace just found their way back to each other. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>She turned and saw a nurse\u2014a brunette with hazel eyes\u2014gazing sympathetically at her. \u201cMiss, we\u2019re going to need you to fill out some paperwork on the patient.\u201d</p><p>Skye licked lips that were bone dry. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>The nurse\u2019s face tightened. \u201cThere\u2019s a waiting room just down the hallway. It\u2019s the second door on the left. You can take the papers there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Skye said again, her voice harder.</p><p>The nurse handed her the clipboard. \u201cYou may want to notify other family members...\u201d</p><p>Trace didn\u2019t have other family members. \u201cHe only has me,\u201d Skye said. Her fingers trembled when she took the clipboard.</p><p>She walked toward the waiting room in a daze. Bodies passed her in a blur. White lab coats. Green hospital scrubs.</p><p>Someone bumped into her, right as she turned toward the waiting room.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d a voice rasped.</p><p>That rasp...</p><p>She looked up, frowning, just as something sharp jabbed into her neck.</p><p>A needle. He shoved a needle into my neck.</p><p>The man wore a green face mask\u2014the kind that doctors and nurses wore during surgery\u2014but she could see his eyes\u2014see them so perfectly.</p><p>His eyes were the last thing that she saw before everything went dark. Skye fell forward and felt his strong arms wrap around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSkye.\u201d Saying her name was hard. So much harder than it should have been.</p><p>Trace tried to move his arms, but found that they were strapped down. His throat ached, burned, and it sure as hell seemed like someone had driven a fucking stake through his chest.</p><p>A stake...or a bullet.</p> <p>\u201cTake it easy, Weston.\u201d A familiar voice advised him. \u201cYou just came out of surgery. They took the tube out of your throat three minutes ago. Just slow the hell down, okay?\u201d</p><p>A tube? That would explain the burn in his throat.</p><p>Trace forced his eyes to open. Again, the small act was too damn hard. But he opened them, and he locked his gaze on Detective Griffin\u2019s. \u201cSkye.\u201d He said her name again because she was the only thing that mattered.</p><p>But at her name, Alex looked away.</p><p>Where is she? She\u2019d been with him in the alley. He remembered her holding onto him. She\u2019d been in the ambulance, too. He\u2019d hated the look of fear in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for her,\u201d Alex said. His voice cracked. Not good. \u201cI\u2019ve got an APB out now\u2014every cop in the city is searching for her.\u201d</p><p>Searching for her...</p><p>The machines around him began to beep frantically.</p><p>Alex hurried toward the side of the bed. \u201cTake it easy. Jesus, man, calm down.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be fucking serious. Trace tried to push up in the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding again! Stop!\u201d Alex pushed the call button for the nurse, then he locked his hands around Trace\u2019s shoulders. The detective shoved him back against the bed. \u201cThey just dug a bullet out of you. You can\u2019t go racing out of here now!\u201d</p> <p>Yes, he could. Trace had to get to Skye.</p><p>The lines on Alex\u2019s face became deeper. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find her.\u201d</p><p>How had they lost her? How?</p><p>Alex exhaled on a rough sigh. \u201cShe was in the hospital. I-I saw the security video just a little while ago. Some guy in a doctor\u2019s coat came up to her. He injected her with something that knocked her out. Then the cocky bastard just put her in a wheel chair and pushed her right out the doors.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cNo one even stopped him. Didn\u2019t ask a single damn question. He took her out the emergency exit. There were two guards there, and he just took her.\u201d</p><p>The machines were shrieking now.</p><p>Two nurses ran into the room. The male nurse demanded, \u201cWhat are you doing to the patient?\u201d</p> <p>The other nurse\u2014female, a redhead\u2014hurried toward the bed. When she got close enough, Trace grabbed her wrist. \u201cGet me...out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, sir.\u201d Her brown eyes became saucer sized. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>The male nurse pulled out a needle and added something to Trace\u2019s IV bag. \u201cThis will help calm you down.\u201d</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t need to be calm. I need Skye.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d the redhead told him. \u201cYou have to rest and recover.\u201d</p><p>Resting was the last thing he needed to do. He had to get out there and find Skye. \u201cDoc...tor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor will come to see you soon,\u201d the redhead reassured him as Trace\u2019s fingers slid lifelessly away from her wrist. He could feel the cold touch of the drugs slipping through his veins. \u201cSleep...\u201d The nurse told him.</p><p>I can\u2019t sleep. Skye needs me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Alex told him, but the cop\u2019s voice seemed far away now. \u201cEvery cop in the city has her photo. She\u2019s not just going to vanish...\u201d</p><p>But she did. Skye fucking vanished.</p><p>Two days passed, and the cops didn\u2019t find her.</p><p>\u201cHe was clever,\u201d Reese said as he guided Trace into the car. They were at the hospital\u2019s exit. Finally. The doctors hadn\u2019t wanted him to leave the hospital.</p><p>Fuck what they wanted.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to leave the day before, and he\u2019d torn open his wound. Blood had spurted and the nurses had sedated him. Again.</p><p>\u201cThe guy kept his face averted from the cameras,\u201d Reese told him, \u201cand he had a surgical cap and mask on the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Trace slid into the car. The fresh stitches in his chest pulled, but he ignored the pain.</p><p>He could only focus on one thing then\u2014Skye.</p><p>Reese slid into the front seat. The car eased into traffic.</p><p>\u201cThe cops think she\u2019s already dead.\u201d Trace had heard the whispers when Alex got his updates. As soon as they\u2019d hit the forty-eight hour mark on Skye\u2019s abduction, the cops had stopped looking for a live body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s been a long time, Trace,\u201d Reese said softly. \u201cA lot can happen during all those hours...\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s hands fisted. He didn\u2019t want to imagine what had happened to Skye. \u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d He had to think that way. Had to think of her being alive. Because if he let the fear take over...I\u2019ll lose my damn mind. \u201cI\u2019m going to find her.\u201d He\u2019d already reassigned every agent that he had.</p><p>Finding Skye was their priority. He\u2019d been pulling the strings and starting the search for her even when the doctors had been sewing him back up.</p><p>Reese slanted a fast glance his way when the vehicle stopped at a red light. \u201cWe\u2019ve got eyes on the choreographer and the doctor in NY. Both guys have been going to work, business as usual for them.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t business as fucking usual.</p><p>\u201cIf one of them had her...the guy would still be with her.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019s alive. Trace heard the words that Reese didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cCould just be that it\u2019s not them. Her stalker could be anyone.\u201d Reese kept talking as he drove them through the Chicago streets. \u201cSome freak who saw her dance and fixated on her.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s gaze slid to the window. \u201cI want the plane ready to depart within the next two hours.\u201d</p><p>The car braked at another red light. \u201cBoss, you know that you\u2019re not clear to travel. The doctors didn\u2019t want to let you out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to New York.\u201d Because that was where the nightmare had started for Skye. \u201cHave the plane ready.\u201d</p><p>The killer had aimed for Trace\u2019s heart with that bullet. The bullet had missed its target, barely.</p><p>But when the SOB had taken Skye...</p><p>You cut out my fucking heart.</p><p>He wanted his heart back.</p><p>He\u2019d get it back.</p><p>The handcuffs cut into Skye\u2019s wrists. She\u2019d lost track of time again. She\u2019d tried counting the minutes before, a little trick to try and stay sane, but it hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>There was no light. Only a complete darkness. It was cold. So cold there in her prison.</p><p>Her wrists had stopped bleeding. She\u2019d thought that the blood might help her slip out of the cuffs.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Her lips were cracked. Broken. Her stomach ached, but at least it had stopped growling.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t eaten. Hadn\u2019t been given a drop to drink.</p><p>She\u2019d been taken. Then...left.</p><p>Forgotten in the dark.</p><p>She\u2019d tried yelling before. Screaming. She\u2019d screamed until her voice had broken.</p><p>Her hands were looped around some kind of thick, metal pole. She\u2019d kicked it and kicked it. Jerked and pulled.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He\u2019s just going to leave me down here. Until I starve.</p><p>It would be a slow death.</p><p>Death in darkness.</p><p>She tried to look through the dark. To see beyond it. Skye didn\u2019t want this to be her last memory.</p><p>She wanted to remember Trace.</p><p>Trace.</p><p>He\u2019d find her, eventually. She didn\u2019t doubt that. If he\u2019d survived that gunshot. He had to survive. He had to.</p><p>Trace would heal. He\u2019d get out of the hospital. Then he would look for her.</p><p>She hated to think about what he would find.</p><p>\u201cJanie, make sure that Mrs. Summer gets her medication before\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Mitch Loxley broke off, choking.</p><p>Because Trace had just wrapped his hand around the prick\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d The nurse\u2014Janie\u2014sprang to her feet. \u201cLet him go!\u201d She grabbed for the phone. \u201cSecurity\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity can wait a bit, honey,\u201d Reese said as he took the phone from her. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna have us a little chat with the doc.\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cLet...me...go...\u201d</p><p>Trace eased his hold. \u201cWant to have the chat out here, or in your office?\u201d His fingerprints were bright on the doc\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cO-office...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice.\u201d He let the doctor go.</p><p>Mitch spun away from him. Strode down the hall.</p><p>\u201cDr. Loxley?\u201d Janie called out uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d Mitch snapped back.</p><p>No, the bastard didn\u2019t.</p><p>Mitch threw open his office door. Paced inside and rubbed his neck.</p><p>Trace marched after him. Reese followed. He shut the door, then put his considerable bulk in front of the exit.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Mitch demanded as he spun to confront Trace. \u201cWhat the freaking hell! How dare you come in here and assault me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer picture is gone,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Mitch\u2019s mouth snapped closed.</p><p>\u201cAll the pictures on your desk are gone.\u201d Actually, it looked to him like the doctor was packing up his office. \u201cPlanning a trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a transfer,\u201d Mitch gritted out. \u201cI applied for it months ago after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Skye dumped you.\u201d</p><p>Mitch flushed. \u201cI heard about her disappearance. I-I\u2019m sorry. I hope the cops can find her soon.\u201d</p><p>Trace wanted to drive his fist into the doc\u2019s face. Again and again until he heard the smash of bones. \u201cSeeing as how it was some person who took Skye, and not a figment of her imagination, I think your theory was a little off, doc.\u201d Rage seethed in Trace\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake.\u201d Each word seemed torn from Mitch. \u201cI thought...I-I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d He closed in on the doctor. He didn\u2019t like Mitch Loxley. Didn\u2019t trust him. Actually, Trace wanted to rip the man apart. \u201cI almost killed a man for Skye once.\u201d</p><p>Mitch swallowed. His eyes widened. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even aware how close I put the guy to death,\u201d Trace said as the memory rose in his head. \u201cHe was trying to rape her. I saw...and I reacted. I hit him, again and again, until Skye pulled me off him.\u201d</p><p>Sweat beaded Mitch\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I did to him,\u201d Trace murmured as he stared directly into Mitch\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo what do you think I\u2019m going to do once I get my hands on the man who took her?\u201d</p><p>Mitch backed up. \u201cI didn\u2019t take Skye! I\u2019ve been here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you came back to work the day after Ms. Sullivan was taken,\u201d Reese said as he stood firm by the door. \u201cWe checked. We have lots of resources to do things like that.\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s gaze darted toward Reese.</p><p>\u201cShe left you, and you couldn\u2019t handle that...\u201d Trace fought to keep his voice level. He wanted to pound into Mitch, but that wasn\u2019t the plan. He had to walk a very delicate line here. Very delicate.</p><p>The doctor shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not me! I wanted to help her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to own her. You wanted her to be yours, but she couldn\u2019t be...Skye didn\u2019t love you, and no matter what you did, you couldn\u2019t make her love you.\u201d</p><p>A fist pounded into the door. \u201cDoctor Loxley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like Janie called security after all,\u201d Reese said flatly. \u201cSome people just don\u2019t know how to follow orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to own her.\u201d Mitch shoved his hands into the pockets of his lab coat. \u201cThat was the dancer\u2014Wolfe. He\u2019s the one who was always controlling her. Telling her when to exercise. When to go home and sleep. What to freaking eat. He wanted to control everything about her life.\u201d</p><p>Trace kept all emotion from his face. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill the man who took her.\u201d</p><p>Mitch tensed. His eyelids jerked.</p><p>Such a small move.</p><p>\u201cI am going to kill him,\u201d Trace said deliberately, \u201cbecause Skye wasn\u2019t his to take.\u201d</p><p>The guards had burst inside the room.</p><p>\u201cShe was never his,\u201d Trace told the doctor. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>The guards shoved Trace and Reese outside of the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t go so smoothly,\u201d Reese murmured as he gazed around at the hospital\u2019s parking lot. \u201cBut at least none of the damn paparazzi are here to see you get your ass thrown into the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe meeting went exactly as I\u2019d hoped.\u201d</p><p>Skye wasn\u2019t his to take.</p><p>When Trace had said those words, Mitch\u2019s hands had fisted. His eyes had been tight and angry, and the man had clamped his lips together to stop himself from replying to Trace.</p><p>\u201cThe guy was angry, but that was probably because you basically accused him of being a kidnapper and a killer. And because, you know, you threatened to murder him.\u201d Reese turned toward the car. \u201cAll right, boss, we need to back off.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t backing any place. \u201cI goaded him so that the fellow would make a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Reese glanced over his shoulder. \u201cMaybe it is the choreographer, Wolfe, maybe he\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got two agents on Robert Wolfe. They are watching him twenty-four, seven.\u201d Just in case. \u201cAnd now, you and I are going to take over the watch on Loxley.\u201d Because his gut told him to stay close to the doctor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d taken her pictures away. Packed up the office.</p><p>And the man in the video\u2014that damn grainy video that Trace had watched again and again\u2014he\u2019d expertly injected Skye with that needle.</p><p>No hesitation.</p> <p>The man who\u2019d killed Carol had known just where to shove his knife. Known just how to twist that blade to cause maximum damage.</p><p>A doctor would know.</p><p>Trace headed toward the back of the building.</p><p>Waited.</p><p>When Loxley rushed out of the hospital ten minutes later, Trace was still waiting.</p> <p>The doctor hopped into his car.</p><p>Sped away.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to be stalked,\u201d Trace whispered.</p><p>Footsteps.</p><p>They tapped across the floor, coming at a slow, steady pace toward her.</p><p>Skye was on the floor. She didn\u2019t have the strength to stand any more.</p> <p>My wrists are bleeding again.</p><p>The footsteps kept coming closer.</p><p>Skye didn\u2019t move. She thought that perhaps she might just be imagining that sound. For days, she\u2019d only heard\u2014</p><p>Her heartbeat.</p><p>Her screams.</p><p>\u201cWho...\u201d Skye tried to ask...Who\u2019s there? But she couldn\u2019t get the words out. Her throat had closed up. She couldn\u2019t even cry anymore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d his voice told her, whispering in the darkness. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Then she felt something against her lips. Something wet and cool and so wonderful. She choked at first as the water poured over her lips.</p> <p>\u201cEasy. I\u2019m going to take care of you...\u201d</p><p>She gulped the water. Drank and drank.</p><p>Her stomach cramped. Her throat convulsed.</p><p>The water spilled from her lips. Over her shirt.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Skye.\u201d</p><p>They were closed? She blinked and the light hit her. Too bright and hard and she couldn\u2019t see anything clearly.</p><p>He was before her. A big, hulking form. Blurry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you cleaned up,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>Because she was filthy and bloody.</p><p>But I\u2019m not dead.</p><p>\u201cI will be the one you need. The only one. I will be the one who takes care of you from now on. You don\u2019t have to worry about anyone else. No director telling you that you\u2019re eating too much, that you need to work out more, to practice more...\u201d</p><p>Robert?</p><p>\u201cI knew you hated that life.\u201d</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t see him clearly. Her eyes just wouldn\u2019t focus with that sudden light.</p><p>His voice was husky and low, as if he were talking to a lover.</p><p>Is that what I am to him?</p><p>\u201cI would come and watch you dance. Not just at your shows, but during rehearsal. I knew you needed me...\u201d</p><p>The water was gone.</p><p>She tilted her head back. Stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cSleeping Beauty...finally waking up to see me.\u201d</p><p>Skye shook her head. \u201cNot...Sleeping Beauty...\u201d His features were sharpening, coming into focus before her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my Beauty. And I\u2019ll be the one to wake you up. The one who gives you life.\u201d He\u2019d pushed the water away. The container spilled, and water poured over the floor. \u201cOr death.\u201d</p><p>She could see him now. Skye stared into his face. Looked straight into the eyes of a man who was crazy.</p><p>As crazy as he\u2019d accused her of being.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back now,\u201d Mitch Loxley told her, \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>The windows of the brownstone were boarded up. A giant KEEP OUT sign covered the front entrance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, got it,\u201d Reese said into his phone.</p><p>Trace glanced over at him. The weight of his gun pressed into Trace\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThe brownstone is in a cousin\u2019s name. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t come up when we did a property search for Dr. Loxley.\u201d</p><p>Because Trace had gotten his team to look up any and all properties tied to Mitch Loxley.</p><p>But his agents had come up with nothing.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>Trace had known that if he got close enough, if he taunted the guy, if he pushed him far enough, Loxley would break.</p><p>But he might try to take Skye with him when he shatters.</p><p>\u201cThe cops are on their way,\u201d Reese continued, voice roughening. \u201cWe should wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trace pulled his weapon from his holster. Thunder rumbled overhead. \u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Because he knew Skye was in that place. Scared. Hurt?</p><p>He was getting her the hell out of there.</p><p>I\u2019m coming, baby, I\u2019m coming.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Mitch\u2019s fingers slid over her cheek. \u201cI was so mad at you. When you went back to him...\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. Nausea rose in her stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me by his name. When I touched you, you called for him.\u201d His hands slid under her chin, and he shoved her head back. She hit the pole. The impact had her moaning.</p><p>\u201cYou were my Beauty, and you went to him. After all I\u2019d done...I was the one to heal your leg. I was the one at your side when you walked. I was the one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho...made me...have the wreck?\u201d</p><p>Her brakes...Alex had said...</p><p>The nausea deepened. Skye was afraid she\u2019d pass out.</p><p>Mitch smiled at her. Terrified her. \u201cIt was the only way to get your attention. I couldn\u2019t see you after the shows. I tried. Again and again. Beauty needed her hero to wake her up. I was there, and you couldn\u2019t see me. I had to find a way to make you see me.\u201d</p><p>He was a freaking doctor. He shouldn\u2019t have\u2014</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to find you that night. Not him. He was always there. Always between us.\u201d Mitch\u2019s fingers dug into her jaw. \u201cBut not anymore. Weston is dead.\u201d</p><p>Something shut off inside of Skye at those words. She could actually feel the change sweep through her.</p><p>Her heart stopped racing.</p><p>The nausea faded.</p><p>The fear vanished.</p><p>If Trace was gone, what happened next didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYou...killed...\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>\u201cI shot him in the heart because he tried to take you away from me. That wasn\u2019t happening. That wasn\u2019t ever going to happen. You belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Mitch pulled away. Fumbled in his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll take the cuffs off. I\u2019ll get you cleaned up, and then we\u2019re going far away from this place. Starting over...\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d said she was the crazy one.</p><p>Skye\u2019s body stayed perfectly still as he uncuffed her. She\u2019d long since lost feeling in her fingers.</p><p>He rose. \u201cCome on, Skye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t stand.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then he reached down for her. He put his arms around her and lifted her up. \u201cSee, I can take care of you.\u201d His breath blew lightly over her cheek as he shifted her body to the right.</p><p>Her eyes closed. His scent filled her nose. Disinfectant.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Skye swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t...want you...to take care...\u201d</p><p>Glass shattered. She heard the sound, coming from...above them?</p><p>Mitch tried to jerk away from her.</p><p>She held him tighter. He killed Trace. \u201cI want...\u201d Skye gathered her strength. Every last bit of it, and she thrust her body fully against his. \u201cI want you...to die...\u201d</p><p>The weight of her body sent him falling back, and this time, his head slammed into that metal pole. The crack was loud and wonderful and so perfect to her ears.</p><p>Footsteps thundered, sounding close.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s voice.</p><p>He\u2019s dead.</p><p>She dropped to her knees. Mitch was still alive. She couldn\u2019t have that.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>She was still hearing Trace\u2019s voice. She\u2019d finally gone crazy.</p><p>The voices came first. That was the way it had been with her mother.</p><p>The voices.</p><p>She liked hearing Trace\u2019s voice. Maybe being crazy wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Skye!\u201d</p><p>Hands grabbed her, yanked her away from Mitch and\u2014</p><p>Now I smell him.</p><p>Trace\u2019s scent was rich and warm. Masculine. His arms were around her, squeezing her so tightly, and shudders racked his body.</p><p>A hallucination? It was so real and so wonderful.</p><p>\u201cLove...you...\u201d Skye managed to whisper.</p><p>\u201cBaby, baby, I fucking love you! You\u2019re okay, I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>He was kissing her. Her face. Her cracked lips. Holding her so tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d she said, so sad about that. Because she\u2019d wanted to see him again. Her Trace.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not! Skye, I\u2019m real, and I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>She just stared into his eyes.</p><p>Fear burned in his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m here. Baby, baby, be here, too. Be here with me.\u201d</p><p>A groan came from behind her. Mitch. She hadn\u2019t finished killing him.</p><p>The image of Trace shook her. \u201cI found you. You\u2019re going home with me. You\u2019re going to dance, and we\u2019re going to fuck and laugh and be happy. Do you understand? Do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mitch\u2019s voice. Snarling. \u201cYou\u2019re not!\u201d</p><p>She was thrown across the room. Ripped from the arms of her beautiful hallucination and tossed to the floor.</p><p>She\u2019d used all of her strength. Skye couldn\u2019t rise.</p><p>More footsteps were thundering. Again, coming from upstairs?</p><p>Then Skye realized...A basement. She was in a basement.</p><p>Her hands flattened on the hard floor. Pinpricks shot through her numb fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d Trace lifted a gun. Pointed it right at Mitch. \u201cYou\u2019ll never hurt her again.\u201d</p><p>Mitch laughed. Laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who hurts her. I keep her safe. I love her\u2014\u201d He lunged forward. There was a knife in his hand. The blade gleamed as it sliced right toward Trace\u2019s chest.</p><p>Not a hallucination. That\u2019s Trace. I could smell him. I could touch him. That\u2019s Trace.</p><p>She pushed to her knees. \u201cNo!\u201d Skye tried to surge forward.</p><p>The bullet erupted from Trace\u2019s gun. It drove into Mitch\u2019s chest. But Mitch didn\u2019t stop his attack. He swiped out with his knife.</p><p>Trace fired again.</p><p>The knife sank into Trace\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Trace fired. Again and again.</p><p>The knife dropped from Mitch\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Before Mitch could fall, Trace grabbed his bloody shirt-front. \u201cI told you what would happen.\u201d</p><p>A gurgle came from Mitch\u2019s lips.</p><p>Reese burst into the room.</p><p>Trace shoved Mitch away from him. The doctor hit the floor. His eyes were closed. Blood covered him.</p><p>Skye was still on her hands and knees. She wanted to move toward Trace, but her body wouldn\u2019t listen to her. She couldn\u2019t move. \u201cTrace!\u201d</p><p>He lifted her into his arms. Held her close against his heart. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to cry, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Wanted to scream, but her voice was gone.</p><p>She could only shake and shudder in his arms. Trace. Trace.</p><p>\u201cLet me get her,\u201d Reese said, coming close to them. \u201cYour injured...you shouldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d was all Trace said. He carried her up the stairs.</p><p>Carried her through the old, dusted interior of a house. Then they were outside. Rain was falling. It pelted down on her, and it felt so clean. Good.</p><p>Not as good as Trace\u2019s arms.</p><p>He stood there, in the rain, just holding her. Police cruisers raced to the scene. An ambulance braked to a squealing stop.</p><p>Trace held her.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>Hope came back to her.</p><p>And her tears mixed with the rain.</p><p>Flowers covered the hospital room. Bright, vibrant colors. Enough petals to fill a florist shop.</p><p>The smell was heady.</p><p>The sight was gorgeous.</p><p>Skye wanted to get the hell out of there.</p><p>She\u2019d been pumped with an IV for way too long. She wanted freedom. She wanted\u2014</p><p>The hospital door opened. Trace stood there. The lines near his eyes were a little deeper. His face was grimmer than it had been when she first walked into his Chicago office.</p><p>His eyes were different, too. Still as blue. Still as bright.</p><p>But now she could see the love there. He wasn\u2019t hiding that from her any longer.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>She was more than ready.</p><p>He pushed a wheel chair into the room. \u201cYour chariot.\u201d</p><p>Her brows climbed.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let you go without it. But don\u2019t worry, Reese is waiting right outside for us.\u201d He lifted her. Let his hands linger as he pressed a gentle kiss to her lips. \u201cThis place will be a memory soon.\u201d He eased her into the chair.</p><p>Trace started to push her toward the door.</p><p>She caught his hand. \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d</p><p>He bent near her, putting their eyes on level. \u201cI take you to our suite at the hotel. I fuck you until some of this damn fear leaves me.\u201d His gaze searched hers. \u201cThen I spend the next fifty years making you as happy as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty years,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long enough. I figure it\u2019s just a start for us.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her into the hallway. She couldn\u2019t help but tense. I\u2019ll always hate hospitals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>He knew, of course. There were no secrets between them. Why should there be?</p><p>The sunlight was bright outside. Reese waited, as promised, standing beside the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, Ms. Sullivan,\u201d he said giving her a quick nod.</p><p>Considering that the last time he\u2019d seen her, Skye knew she\u2019d looked like death, so, well, anything should be an improvement over that. \u201cThank you, Reese. You look good, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He winked.</p><p>Trace eased her into the car. Buckled her seat belt. Took her hand in his.</p><p>Reese drove them away from the hospital. Skye didn\u2019t look back.</p> <p>\u201cJust so you know...we found out that Mitch\u2019s alibis were, of course, bullshit. He\u2019d been getting interns to cover for him, and threatening to have them kicked out of the hospital if they didn\u2019t do exactly as he ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe liked control,\u201d Skye said. Control over his interns...control over me.</p><p>The car slowed. Turned right.</p><p>\u201cMy agents did more digging. They found out that Mitch Loxley had a history of...getting too close to some of his patients. That was why Dr. Loxley worked in five different hospitals since his residency. He liked having women...need him.\u201d</p><p>I will be the one you need. The only one.</p> <p>\u201cHe said he saw me dance.\u201d Sleeping Beauty. A helpless victim, until she woke.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t ever hurt you again,\u201d Trace promised. His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cNo more fear, Skye, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak while Reese drove. Too much emotion had built within her.</p><p>When they got to the hotel, they were immediately ushered up to their suite.</p><p>It was both familiar and foreign to her.</p><p>She walked to the window. Gazed down at the busy street.</p> <p>Trace\u2019s hands curled around her shoulders. \u201cTell me what I can do. Tell me what I need to do so that you can forget.\u201d</p><p>His voice was ragged, rough, and when he turned her toward him, she saw that his mask had fallen away.</p><p>They were alone, and she was seeing him as he truly was.</p><p>Fear and anger were in his eyes. So much fear.</p><p>He wanted her to forget, but she couldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She\u2019d never forget the days of darkness and hunger. Fear. Terror.</p><p>But the starvation hadn\u2019t broken her.</p><p>Mitch hadn\u2019t broken her.</p> <p>The thought of Trace, dying\u2014that broke me.</p><p>He was the one thing that could destroy her. \u201cI want you to love me,\u201d she told him, her voice breaking.</p><p>His mouth found hers. Trace kissed her hard and deep and she could taste his desire. \u201cI do,\u201d he said against her lips. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>When she kissed him, she tasted the salt of her tears. She never wanted to think of a world without Trace. \u201cI want you to be mine.\u201d She needed that, needed him, and the force of that need scared her.</p><p>He slid to his knees before her.</p><p>Trace...he never bowed before anyone. He\u2014</p><p>He pulled a discrete white box from his pocket. Opened it. The diamond blazed up at her. \u201cAnd I want you to be mine. Tell me that you will be, Skye. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she said as a smile curved her lips. The first smile she\u2019d had since coming out of the darkness.</p><p>He slid the ring on her hand, but he didn\u2019t rise. He stared up at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been the only thing that mattered to me since I was seventeen years old.\u201d</p><p>The ring fit her perfectly. So bright, the diamond sparkled.</p><p>A light, after the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be without you again,\u201d Trace told her. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Since he wouldn\u2019t rise for her, Skye sank down on the lush carpet with him. Her hands lifted and curled around his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you since I was fifteen.\u201d So simple and true. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll love you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>They had years ahead of them. Time to laugh and fight. To have a family. To watch their children grow.</p><p>Time to just be together.</p><p>They didn\u2019t need to think about death or fear.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>Trace had brought it back to her.</p><p>She\u2019d fight like hell to make sure that she never lost it\u2014or him\u2014again. She wasn\u2019t going to be someone\u2019s victim. She\u2019d fought the monster. They both had. They\u2019d won.</p><p>We deserve our happiness.</p><p>Skye kissed him. His arms pulled her close. Held her against his heart.</p><p>They deserved happiness, and they\u2019d damn well take it.</p><p>This day.</p><p>And every day that came in the future. They\u2019d survived, and now, it was their turn to be happy.</p><p>Forever. </p> </body></html>"]
