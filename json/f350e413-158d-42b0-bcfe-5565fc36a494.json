I don\u2019t know when exactly I started giving myself this daily pep talk\u2014or why. It sounds like a twelve-step mantra and I\u2019m not in Anything Anonymous, though to read some of the crap they write about me, you\u2019d think I should be. I have the kind of life a lot of people would probably sell a kidney to just experience a bit of. But still, I find the need to remind myself of the temporariness of a day, to reassure myself that I got through yesterday, I\u2019ll get through today.</p><p>This morning, after my daily prodding, I glance at the minimalist digital clock on the hotel nightstand. It reads 11:47, positively crack-of-dawn for me. But the front desk has already rang with two wake-up calls, followed by a polite-but-firm buzz from our manager, Aldous. Today might be just one day, but it\u2019s packed.</p><p>I\u2019m due at the studio to lay down a few final guitar tracks for some Internet-only version of the first single of our just-released album. Such a gimmick. Same song, new guitar track, some vocal effects, pay an extra buck for it. \u201cThese days, you\u2019ve gotta milk a dollar out of every dime,\u201d the suits at the label are so fond of reminding us.</p> <p>After the studio, I have a lunch interview with some reporter from Shuffle. Those two events are kinda like the bookends of what my life has become: making the music, which I like, and talking about making the music, which I loathe. But they\u2019re flip sides of the same coin. When Aldous calls a second time I finally kick off the duvet and grab the prescription bottle from the side table. It\u2019s some anti-anxiety thing I\u2019m supposed to take when I\u2019m feeling jittery.</p><p>Jittery is how I normally feel. Jittery I\u2019ve gotten used to. But ever since we kicked off our tour with three shows at Madison Square Garden, I\u2019ve been feeling something else. Like I\u2019m about to be sucked into something powerful and painful. Vortexy.</p><p>Is that even a word? I ask myself.</p><p>You\u2019re talking to yourself, so who the hell cares? I reply, popping a couple of pills. I pull on some boxers, and go to the door of my room, where a pot of coffee is already waiting. It\u2019s been left there by a hotel employee, undoubtedly under strict instructions to stay out of my way.</p><p>I finish my coffee, get dressed, and make my way down the service elevator and out the side entrance\u2014the guest-relations manager has kindly provided me with special access keys so I can avoid the scenester parade in the lobby. Out on the sidewalk, I\u2019m greeted by a blast of steaming New York air. It\u2019s kind of oppressive, but I like that the air is wet. It reminds me of Oregon, where the rain falls endlessly, and even on the hottest of summer days, blooming white cumulus clouds float above, their shadows reminding you that summer\u2019s heat is fleeting, and the rain\u2019s never far off.</p> <p>In Los Angeles, where I live now, it hardly ever rains. And the heat, it\u2019s never-ending. But it\u2019s a dry heat. People there use this aridness as a blanket excuse for all of the hot, smoggy city\u2019s excesses. \u201cIt may be a hundred and seven degrees today,\u201d they\u2019ll brag, \u201cbut at least it\u2019s a dry heat.\u201d</p><p>But New York is a wet heat; by the time I reach the studio ten blocks away on a desolate stretch in the West Fifties, my hair, which I keep hidden under a cap, is damp. I pull a cigarette from my pocket and my hand shakes as I light up. I\u2019ve had a slight tremor for the last year or so. After extensive medical checks, the doctors declared it nothing more than nerves and advised me to try yoga.</p><p>When I get to the studio, Aldous is waiting outside under the awning. He looks at me, at my cigarette, back at my face. I can tell by the way that he\u2019s eyeballing me, he\u2019s trying to decide whether he needs to be Good Cop or Bad Cop. I must look like shit because he opts for Good Cop.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Sunshine,\u201d he says jovially.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s ever good about morning?\u201d I try to make it sound like a joke.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s afternoon now. We\u2019re running late.\u201d</p> <p>I stub out my cigarette. Aldous puts a giant paw on my shoulder, incongruously gentle. \u201cWe just want one guitar track on \u2018Sugar,\u2019 just to give it that little something extra so fans buy it all over again.\u201d He laughs, shakes his head at what the business has become. \u201cThen you have lunch with Shuffle, and we have a photo shoot for that Fashion Rocks thing for the Times with the rest of the band around five, and then a quick drinks thing with some money guys at the label, and then I\u2019m off to the airport. Tomorrow, you have a quick little meeting with publicity and merchandising. Just smile and don\u2019t say a lot. After that you\u2019re on your lonesome until London.\u201d</p><p>On my lonesome? As opposed to being in the warm bosom of family when we\u2019re all together? I say. Only I say it to myself. More and more lately it seems as though the majority of my conversations are with myself. Given half the stuff I think, that\u2019s probably a good thing.</p><p>But this time I really will be by myself. Aldous and the rest of the band are flying to England tonight. I was supposed to be on the same flight as them until I realized that today was Friday the thirteenth, and I was like no f**king way! I\u2019m dreading this tour enough as is, so I\u2019m not jinxing it further by leaving on the official day of bad luck. So I\u2019d had Aldous book me a day later. We\u2019re shooting a video in London and then doing a bunch of press before we start the European leg of our tour, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m missing a show, just a preliminary meeting with our video director. I don\u2019t need to hear about his artistic vision. When we start shooting, I\u2019ll do what he tells me.</p><p>I follow Aldous into the studio and enter a soundproof booth where it\u2019s just me and a row of guitars. On the other side of the glass sit our producer, Stim, and the sound engineers. Aldous joins them. \u201cOkay, Adam,\u201d says Stim, \u201cone more track on the bridge and the chorus. Just to make that hook that much more sticky. We\u2019ll play with the vocals in the mixing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooky. Sticky. Got it.\u201d I put on my headphones and pick up my guitar to tune up and warm up. I try not to notice that in spite of what Aldous said a few minutes ago, it feels like I\u2019m already all on my lonesome. Me alone in a soundproof booth. Don\u2019t overthink it, I tell myself. This is how you record in a technologically advanced studio. The only problem is, I felt the same way a few nights ago at the Garden. Up onstage, in front of eighteen thousand fans, alongside the people who, once upon a time, were part of my family, I felt as alone as I do in this booth.</p><p>Still, it could be worse. I start to play and my fingers nimble up and I get off the stool and bang and crank against my guitar, pummel it until it screeches and screams just the way I want it to. Or almost the way I want it to. There\u2019s probably a hundred grand\u2019s worth of guitars in this room, but none of them sound as good as my old Les Paul Junior\u2014the guitar I\u2019d had for ages, the one I\u2019d recorded our first albums on, the one that, in a fit of stupidity or hubris or whatever, I\u2019d allowed to be auctioned off for charity. The shiny, expensive replacements have never sounded or felt quite right. Still, when I crank it up loud, I do manage to lose myself for a second or two.</p><p>But it\u2019s over all too soon, and then Stim and the engineers are shaking my hand and wishing me luck on tour, and Aldous is shepherding me out the door and into a town car and we\u2019re whizzing down Ninth Avenue to SoHo, to a hotel whose restaurant the publicists from our record label have decided is a good spot for our interview. What, do they think I\u2019m less likely to rant or say something alienating if I\u2019m in an expensive public place? I remember back in the very early days, when the interviewers wrote \u2019zines or blogs and were fans and mostly wanted to rock-talk\u2014to discuss the music\u2014and they wanted to speak to all of us together. More often than not, it just turned into a normal conversation with everyone shouting their opinions over one another. Back then I never worried about guarding my words. But now the reporters interrogate me and the band separately, as though they\u2019re cops and they have me and my accomplices in adjacent cells and are trying to get us to implicate one another.</p><p>I need a cigarette before we go in, so Aldous and I stand outside the hotel in the blinding midday sun as a crowd of people gathers and checks me out while pretending not to. That\u2019s the difference between New York and the rest of the world. People are just as celebrity-crazed as anywhere, but New Yorkers\u2014or at least the ones who consider themselves sophisticates and loiter along the kind of SoHo block I\u2019m standing on now\u2014put on this pretense that they don\u2019t care, even as they stare out from their three-hundred-dollar shades. Then they act all disdainful when out-of-towners break the code by rushing up and asking for an autograph as a pair of girls in U Michigan sweatshirts have just done, much to the annoyance of the nearby trio of snobs, who watch the girls and roll their eyes and give me a look of sympathy. As if the girls are the problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to get you a better disguise, Wilde Man,\u201d Aldous says, after the girls, giggling with excitement, flutter away. He\u2019s the only one who\u2019s allowed to call me that anymore. Before it used to be a general nickname, a takeoff on my last name, Wilde. But once I sort of trashed a hotel room and after that \u201cWilde Man\u201d became an unshakable tabloid moniker.</p><p>Then, as if on cue, a photographer shows up. You can\u2019t stand in front of a high-end hotel for more than three minutes before that happens. \u201cAdam! Bryn inside?\u201d A photo of me and Bryn is worth about quadruple one of me alone. But after the first flash goes off, Aldous shoves one hand in front of the guy\u2019s lens, and another in front of my face.</p><p>As he ushers me inside, he preps me. \u201cThe reporter is named Vanessa LeGrande. She\u2019s not one of those grizzled types you hate. She\u2019s young. Not younger than you, but early twenties, I think. Used to write for a blog before she got tapped by Shuffle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich blog?\u201d I interrupt. Aldous rarely gives me detailed rundowns on reporters unless there\u2019s a reason.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. Maybe Gabber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Al, that\u2019s a piece-of-crap gossip site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuffle isn\u2019t a gossip site. And this is the cover exclusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever,\u201d I say, pushing through the restaurant doors. Inside it\u2019s all low steel-and-glass tables and leather banquettes, like a million other places I\u2019ve been to. These restaurants think so highly of themselves, but really they\u2019re just overpriced, overstylized versions of McDonald\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThere she is, corner table, the blonde with the streaks,\u201d Aldous says. \u201cShe\u2019s a sweet little number. Not that you have a shortage of sweet little numbers. Shit, don\u2019t tell Bryn I said that. Okay, forget it. I\u2019ll be up here at the bar.\u201d</p><p>Aldous staying for the interview? That\u2019s a publicist\u2019s job, except that I refused to be chaperoned by publicists. I must really seem off-kilter. \u201cYou babysitting?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNope. Just thought you could use some backup.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa LeGrande is cute. Or maybe hot is a more accurate term. It doesn\u2019t matter. I can tell by the way she licks her lips and tosses her hair back that she knows it, and that pretty much ruins the effect. A tattoo of a snake runs up her wrist, and I\u2019d bet our platinum album that she has a tramp stamp. Sure enough, when she reaches into her bag for her digital recorder, peeping up from the top of her low-slung jeans is a small inked arrow pointing south. Classy.</p><p>\u201cHey, Adam,\u201d Vanessa says, looking at me conspiratorially, like we\u2019re old buddies. \u201cCan I just say I\u2019m a huge fan? Collateral Damage got me through a devastating breakup senior year of college. So, thank you.\u201d She smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cUh, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019d like to return the favor by writing the best damn profile of Shooting Star ever to hit the page. So how about we get down to brass tacks and blow this thing right out of the water?\u201d</p><p>Get down to brass tacks? Do people even understand half the crap that comes spilling out of their mouths? Vanessa may be attempting to be brassy or sassy or trying to win me over with candor or show me how real she is, but whatever it is she\u2019s selling, I\u2019m not buying. \u201cSure,\u201d is all I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A waiter comes to take our order. Vanessa orders a salad; I order a beer. Vanessa flips through a Moleskine notebook. \u201cI know we\u2019re supposed to be talking about BloodSuckerSunshine . . .\u201d she begins.</p><p>Immediately, I frown. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re supposed to be talking about. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Not to be friends. Not to swap secrets, but because it\u2019s part of my job to promote Shooting Star\u2019s albums.</p><p>Vanessa turns on her siren. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to it for weeks, and I\u2019m a fickle, hard-to-please girl.\u201d She laughs. In the distance, I hear Aldous clear his throat. I look at him. He\u2019s wearing a giant fake smile and giving me a thumbs-up. He looks ludicrous. I turn to Vanessa and force myself to smile back. \u201cBut now that your second major-label album is out and your harder sound is, I think we can all agree, established, I\u2019m wanting to write a definitive survey. To chart your evolution from emocore band to the scions of agita-rock.\u201d</p><p>Scions of agita-rock? This self-important wankjob deconstructionist crap was something that really threw me in the beginning. As far as I was concerned, I wrote songs: chords and beats and lyrics, verses and bridges and hooks. But then, as we got bigger, people began to dissect the songs, like a frog from biology class until there was nothing left but guts\u2014tiny parts, so much less than the sum.</p> <p>I roll my eyes slightly, but Vanessa\u2019s focused on her notes. \u201cI was listening to some bootlegs of your really early stuff. It\u2019s so poppy, almost sweet comparatively. And I\u2019ve been reading everything ever written about you guys, every blog post, every \u2019zine article. And almost everyone refers to this so-called Shooting Star \u201cblack hole,\u201d but no one really ever penetrates it. You have your little indie release; it does well; you were poised for the big leagues, but then this lag. Rumors were that you\u2019d broken up. And then comes Collateral Damage. And pow.\u201d Vanessa mimes an explosion coming out of her closed fists.</p><p>It\u2019s a dramatic gesture, but not entirely off base. Collateral Damage came out two years ago, and within a month of its release, the single \u201cAnimate\u201d had broken onto the national charts and gone viral. We used to joke you couldn\u2019t listen to the radio for longer than an hour without hearing it. Then \u201cBridge\u201d catapulted onto the charts, and soon after the entire album was climbing to the number-one album slot on iTunes, which in turn made every Walmart in the country stock it, and soon it was bumping Lady Gaga off the number-one spot on the Billboard charts. For a while it seemed like the album was loaded onto the iPod of every person between the ages of twelve and twenty-four. Within a matter of months, our half-forgotten Oregon band was on the cover of Time magazine being touted as \u201cThe Millennials\u2019 Nirvana.\u201d</p><p>But none of this is news. It had all been documented, over and over again, ad nauseam, including in Shuffle. I\u2019m not sure where Vanessa is going with it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, everyone seems to attribute the harder sound to the fact that Gus Allen produced Collateral Damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cGus likes to rock.\u201d</p> <p>Vanessa takes a sip of water. I can hear her tongue ring click. \u201cBut Gus didn\u2019t write those lyrics, which are the foundation for all that oomph. You did. All that raw power and emotion. It\u2019s like Collateral Damage is the angriest album of the decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think, we were going for the happiest.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa looks up at me, narrows her eyes. \u201cI meant it as a compliment. It was very cathartic for a lot of people, myself included. And that\u2019s my point. Everyone knows something went down during your \u2018black hole.\u2019 It\u2019s going to come out eventually, so why not control the message? Who does the \u2018collateral damage\u2019 refer to?\u201d she asks, making air quotes. \u201cWhat happened with you guys? With you?\u201d</p><p>Our waiter delivers Vanessa\u2019s salad. I order a second beer and don\u2019t answer her question. I don\u2019t say anything, just keep my eyes cast downward. Because Vanessa\u2019s right about one thing. We do control the message. In the early days, we got asked this question all the time, but we just kept the answers vague: took a while to find our sound, to write our songs. But now the band\u2019s big enough that our publicists issue a list of no-go topics to reporters: Liz and Sarah\u2019s relationship, mine and Bryn\u2019s, Mike\u2019s former drug problems\u2014and the Shooting Star\u2019s \u201cblack hole.\u201d But Vanessa apparently didn\u2019t get the memo. I glance over at Aldous for some help, but he\u2019s in deep conversation with the bartender. So much for backup.</p><p>\u201cThe title refers to war,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ve explained that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cBecause your lyrics are so political.\u201d</p> <p>Vanessa stares at me with those big baby blues. This is a reporter\u2019s technique: create an awkward silence and wait for your subject to fill it in with babble. It won\u2019t work with me, though. I can outstare anyone.</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s eyes suddenly go cold and hard. She abruptly puts her breezy, flirty personality on the back burner and stares at me with hard ambition. She looks hungry, but it\u2019s an improvement because at least she\u2019s being herself. \u201cWhat happened, Adam? I know there\u2019s a story there, the story of Shooting Star, and I\u2019m going to be the one to tell it. What turned this indie-pop band into a primal rock phenomenon?\u201d</p><p>I feel a cold hard fist in my stomach. \u201cLife happened. And it took us a while to write the new stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook you a while,\u201d Vanessa interrupts. \u201cYou wrote both the recent albums.\u201d</p><p>I just shrug.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Adam! Collateral Damage is your record. It\u2019s a masterpiece. You should be proud of it. And I just know the story behind it, behind your band, is your story, too. A huge shift like this, from collaborative indie quartet to star-driven emotional punk powerhouse\u2014it\u2019s all on you. I mean you alone were the one up at the Grammys accepting the award for Best Song. What did that feel like?\u201d</p><p>Like shit. \u201cIn case you forgot, the whole band won Best New Artist. And that was more than a year ago.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to diss anybody or reopen wounds. I\u2019m just trying to understand the shift. In sound. In lyrics. In band dynamics.\u201d She gives me a knowing look. \u201cAll signs point to you being the catalyst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no catalyst. We just tinkered with our sound. Happens all the time. Like Dylan going electric. Like Liz Phair going commercial. But people tend to freak out when something diverges from their expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know there\u2019s something more to it,\u201d Vanessa continues, pushing forward against the table so hard that it shoves into my gut and I have to physically push it back.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve obviously got your theory, so don\u2019t let the truth get in the way.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flash for a quick second and I think I\u2019ve pissed her off, but then she puts her hands up. Her nails are bitten down. \u201cActually, you want to know my theory?\u201d she drawls.</p><p>Not particularly. \u201cLay it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to some people you went to high school with.\u201d</p><p>I feel my entire body freeze up, soft matter hardening into lead. It takes extreme concentration to lift the glass to my lips and pretend to take a sip.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you went to the same high school as Mia Hall,\u201d she says lightly. \u201cYou know her? The cellist? She\u2019s starting to get a lot of buzz in that world. Or whatever the equivalent of buzz is in classical music. Perhaps hum.\u201d</p><p>The glass shakes in my hand. I have to use my other hand to help lower it to the table to keep from spilling all over myself. All the people who really know what actually had happened back then aren\u2019t talking, I remind myself. Rumors, even true ones, are like flames: Stifle the oxygen and they sputter and die.</p><p>\u201cOur high school had a good arts program. It was kind of a breeding ground for musicians,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Vanessa says, nodding. \u201cThere\u2019s a vague rumor that you and Mia were a couple in high school. Which was funny because I\u2019d never read about it anywhere and it certainly seems noteworthy.\u201d</p><p>An image of Mia flashes before my eyes. Seventeen years old, those dark eyes full of love, intensity, fear, music, sex, magic, grief. Her freezing hands. My own freezing hands, now still grasping the glass of ice water.</p><p>\u201cIt would be noteworthy if it were true,\u201d I say, forcing my voice into an even tone. I take another gulp of water and signal the waiter for another beer. It\u2019s my third, the dessert course of my liquid lunch.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not?\u201d She sounds skeptical.</p><p>\u201cWishful thinking,\u201d I reply. \u201cWe knew each other casually from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t get anyone who really knew either of you to corroborate it. But then I got a hold of an old yearbook and there\u2019s a sweet shot of the two of you. You look pretty coupley. The thing is, there\u2019s no name with the photo, just a caption. So unless you know what Mia looks like, you might miss it.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Kim Schein: Mia\u2019s best friend, yearbook queen, paparazzo. We hadn\u2019t wanted that picture used, but Kim had snuck it in by not listing our names with it, just that stupid nickname.</p><p>\u201cGroovy and the Geek?\u201d Vanessa asks. \u201cYou guys even had a handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using high school yearbooks as your source? What next? Wikipedia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly a reliable source. You said you knew each other \u2018casually.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, the truth is we maybe hooked up for a few weeks, right when those pictures got taken. But, hey, I dated a lot of girls in high school.\u201d I give her my best playboy smirk.</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t seen her since school then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since she left for college,\u201d I say. That part, at least, is true.</p><p>\u201cSo how come when I interviewed the rest of your bandmates, they went all no comment when I asked about her?\u201d she asks, eyeing me hard.</p><p>Because whatever else has gone wrong with us, we\u2019re still loyal. About that. I force myself to speak out loud: \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to tell. I think people like you like the sitcom aspect of, you know, two well-known musicians from the same high school being a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like me?\u201d Vanessa asks.</p><p>Vultures. Bloodsuckers. Soul-stealers. \u201cReporters,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re fond of fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who isn\u2019t?\u201d Vanessa says. \u201cAlthough that woman\u2019s life has been anything but a fairy tale. She lost her whole family in a car crash.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa mock shudders the way you do when you talk about someone\u2019s misfortunes that have nothing to do with you, that don\u2019t touch you, and never will. I\u2019ve never hit a woman in my life, but for one minute I want to punch her in the face, give her a taste of the pain she\u2019s so casually describing. But I hold it together and she carries on, clueless. \u201cSpeaking of fairy tales, are you and Bryn Shraeder having a baby? I keep seeing her in all the tabloids\u2019 bump watches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d I\u2019m damn sure Vanessa knows that Bryn is off-limits, but if talking about Bryn\u2019s supposed pregnancy will distract her, then I\u2019ll do it.</p><p>\u201cNot that you know of? You\u2019re still together, right?\u201d</p><p>God, the hunger in her eyes. For all her talk of writing definitive surveys, for all her investigative skills, she\u2019s no different from all the other hack journalists and stalker photographers, dying to be the first to deliver a big scoop, either on a birth: Is It Twins for Adam and Bryn? Or a death: Bryn Tells Her Wilde Man: \u201cIt\u2019s Quits!\u201d Neither story is true, but some weeks I see both of them on the covers of different gossip rags at the same time.</p><p>I think of the house in L.A. that Bryn and I share. Or coinhabit. I can\u2019t remember the last time the two of us were there together at the same time for more than a week. She makes two, three films a year, and she just started her own production company. So between shooting and promoting her films and chasing down properties to produce, and me being in the studio and on tour, we seem to be on opposing schedules. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep, Bryn and I are still together,\u201d I tell Vanessa. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not pregnant. She\u2019s just into those peasant tops these days, so everyone always assumes it\u2019s to hide a belly. It\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Truth be told, I sometimes wonder if Bryn wears those tops on purpose, to court the bump watch as a way to tempt fate. She seriously wants a kid. Even though publicly, Bryn is twenty-four, in reality, she\u2019s twenty-eight and she claims her clock is ticking and all that. But I\u2019m twenty-one, and Bryn and I have only been together a year. And I don\u2019t care if Bryn says that I have an old soul and have been through a lifetime already. Even if I were forty-one, and Bryn and I had just celebrated twenty years together, I wouldn\u2019t want a kid with her.</p><p>\u201cWill she be joining you on the tour?\u201d</p><p>At the mere mention of the tour, I feel my throat start to close up. The tour is sixty-seven nights long. Sixty-seven . I mentally pat for my pill bottle, grow calmer knowing it\u2019s there, but am smarter than to sneak one in front of Vanessa.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIs Bryn going to come meet you on the tour at all?\u201d</p><p>I imagine Bryn on tour, with her stylists, her Pilates instructors, her latest raw-foods diet. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you like living in Los Angeles?\u201d Vanessa asks. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the SoCal type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dry heat,\u201d I reply.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. A joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Vanessa eyes me skeptically. I no longer read interviews about myself, but when I used to, words like inscrutable were often used. And arrogant. Is that really how people see me?</p><p>Thankfully, our allotted hour is up. She closes her notebook and calls for the check. I catch Aldous\u2019s relieved-looking eyes to let him know we\u2019re wrapping up.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you, Adam,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you too,\u201d I lie.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta say, you\u2019re a puzzle.\u201d She smiles and her teeth gleam an unnatural white. \u201cBut I like puzzles. Like your lyrics, all those grisly images on Collateral Damage. And the lyrics on the new record, also very cryptic. You know some critics question whether BloodSuckerSunshine can match the intensity of Collateral Damage. . . .\u201d</p><p>I know what\u2019s coming. I\u2019ve heard this before. It\u2019s this thing that reporters do. Reference other critics\u2019 opinions as a backhanded way to espouse their own. And I know what she\u2019s really asking, even if she doesn\u2019t: How does it feel that the only worthy thing you ever created came from the worst kind of loss?</p><p>Suddenly, it\u2019s all too much. Bryn and the bump watch. Vanessa with my high school yearbook. The idea that nothing\u2019s sacred. Everything\u2019s fodder. That my life belongs to anyone but me. Sixty-seven nights. Sixty-seven, sixty-seven. I push the table hard so that glasses of water and beer go clattering into her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis interview\u2019s over,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cI know that. Why are you freaking out on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re nothing but a vulture! This has f**k all to do with music. It\u2019s about picking everything apart.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s eyes dance as she fumbles for her recorder. Before she has a chance to turn it back on, I pick it up and slam it against the table, shattering it, and then dump it into a glass of water for good measure. My hand is shaking and my heart is pounding and I feel the beginnings of a panic attack, the kind that makes me sure I\u2019m about to die.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Vanessa screams. \u201cI don\u2019t have a backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to write my article now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call that an article?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Some of us have to work for a living, you prissy, temperamental ass\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d Aldous is at my side, laying a trio of hundred-dollar bills on the table. \u201cFor a new one,\u201d he says to Vanessa, before ushering me out of the restaurant and into a taxi. He throws another hundred-dollar bill at the driver after he balks at my lighting up. Aldous reaches into my pocket and grabs my prescription bottle, shakes a tablet into his hand, and says, \u201cOpen up,\u201d like some bearish mother.</p><p>He waits until we\u2019re a few blocks from my hotel, until I\u2019ve sucked down two cigarettes in one continuous inhale and popped another anxiety pill. \u201cWhat happened back there?\u201d</p><p>I tell him. Her questions about the \u201cblack hole.\u201d Bryn. Mia.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We can call Shuffle. Threaten to pull their exclusive if they don\u2019t put a different reporter on the piece. And maybe this gets into the tabloids or Gabber for a few days, but it\u2019s not much of a story. It\u2019ll blow over.\u201d</p><p>Aldous is saying all this stuff calmly, like, hey, it\u2019s only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, but I can read the worry in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Aldous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s just an article. It\u2019ll be handled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just that. I can\u2019t do it. Any of it.\u201d</p><p>Aldous, who I don\u2019t think has slept a full night since he toured with Aerosmith, allows himself to look exhausted for a few seconds. Then he goes back to manager mode. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got pretour burnout. Happens to the best of \u2019em,\u201d he assures me. \u201cOnce you get on the road, in front of the crowds, start to feel the love, the adrenaline, the music, you\u2019ll be energized. I mean, hell, you\u2019ll be fried for sure, but happy-fried. And come November, when this is over, you can go veg out on an island somewhere where nobody knows who you are, where nobody gives a shit about Shooting Star. Or wild Adam Wilde.\u201d</p><p>November? It\u2019s August now. That\u2019s three months. And the tour is sixty-seven nights. Sixty-seven. I repeat it in my head like a mantra, except it does the opposite of what a mantra\u2019s supposed to do. It makes me want to grab fistfuls of my hair and yank.</p><p>And how do I tell Aldous, how do I tell any of them, that the music, the adrenaline, the love, all the things that mitigate how hard this has become, all of that\u2019s gone? All that\u2019s left is this vortex. And I\u2019m right on the edge of it.</p><p>My entire body is shaking. I\u2019m losing it. A day might be just twenty-four hours but sometimes getting through just one seems as impossible as scaling Everest.</p><p>TWO</p><p>Needle and thread, flesh and bone</p><p>Spit and sinew, heartbreak is home</p><p>Your suture lines sparkle like diamonds</p><p>Bright stars to light my confinement</p><p>\u201cSTITCH\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 7</p><p>Aldous leaves me in front of my hotel. \u201cLook, man, I think you just need some time to chill. So, listen: I\u2019m gonna clear the schedule for the rest of the day and cancel your meetings tomorrow. Your flight to London\u2019s not till seven; you don\u2019t have to be at the airport till five.\u201d He glances at his phone. \u201cThat\u2019s more than twenty-four hours to do whatever you want to. I promise you, you\u2019ll feel so much better. Just go be free.\u201d</p><p>Aldous is peering at me with a look of calculated concern. He\u2019s my friend, but I\u2019m also his responsibility. \u201cI\u2019m gonna change my flight,\u201d he announces. \u201cI\u2019ll fly with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed by how grateful I am. Flying Upper Class with the band is no great shakes. We all tend to stay plugged into our own luxury pods, but at least when I fly with them, I\u2019m not alone. When I fly alone, who knows who I\u2019ll be seated next to? I once had a Japanese businessman who didn\u2019t stop talking to me at all during a ten-hour flight. I\u2019d wanted to be moved but hadn\u2019t wanted to seem like the kind of rock-star prick who\u2019d ask to be moved, so I\u2019d sat there, nodding my head, not understanding half of what he was saying. But worse yet are the times when I\u2019m truly alone for those long-haul flights.</p><p>I know Aldous has lots to do in London. More to the point, missing tomorrow\u2019s meeting with the rest of the band and the video director will be one more little earthquake. But whatever. There are too many fault lines to count now. Besides, nobody blames Aldous; they blame me.</p><p>So, it\u2019s a huge imposition to let Aldous spend an extra day in New York. But I still accept his offer, even as I downplay his generosity by muttering, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. You clear your head. I\u2019ll leave you alone, won\u2019t even call. Want me to pick you up here or meet you at the airport?\u201d The rest of the band is staying downtown. We\u2019ve gotten into the habit of staying in separate hotels since the last tour, and Aldous diplomatically alternates between staying at my hotel and theirs. This time he\u2019s with them.</p><p>\u201cAirport. I\u2019ll meet you in the lounge,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll order you a car for four. Until then, just chill.\u201d He gives me a half handshake, half hug and then he\u2019s back inside the cab, zooming off to his next order of business, probably mending the fences that I\u2019ve thrashed today.</p><p>I go around to the service entrance and make my way to my hotel room. I take a shower, ponder going back to sleep. But these days, sleep eludes me even with a medicine cabinet full of psychopharmacological assistance. From the eighteenth-story windows, I can see the afternoon sun bathing the city in a warm glow, making New York feel cozy somehow, but making the suite feel claustrophobic and hot. I throw on a clean pair of jeans and my lucky black T-shirt. I wanted to reserve this shirt for tomorrow when I leave for the tour, but I feel like I need some luck right now, so it\u2019s gonna have to pull double duty.</p><p>I turn on my iPhone. There are fifty-nine new email messages and seventeen new voice mails, including several from the label\u2019s now-certainly irate publicist and a bunch from Bryn, asking how it went in the studio and with the interview. I could call her, but what\u2019s the point? If I tell her about Vanessa LeGrande, she\u2019ll get all upset with me for losing my \u201cpublic face\u201d in front of a reporter. She\u2019s trying to train me out of that bad habit. She says every time I lose it in front of the press, I only whet their appetites for more. \u201cGive them a dull public face, Adam, and they\u2019ll stop writing so much about you,\u201d she constantly advises me. The thing is, I have a feeling if I told Bryn which question set me off, she\u2019d probably lose her public face, too.</p><p>I think about what Aldous said about getting away from it all, and I turn off the phone and toss it on the nightstand. Then I grab my hat, shades, my pills, and wallet and am out the door. I turn up Columbus, making my way toward Central Park. A fire truck barrels by, its sirens whining. Scratch your head or you\u2019ll be dead. I don\u2019t even remember where I learned that childhood rhyme or the dictum that demanded you scratch your head every time you heard a siren, lest the next siren be for you. But I do know when I started doing it, and now it\u2019s become second nature. Still, in a place like Manhattan, where the sirens are always blaring, it can become exhausting to keep up.</p><p>It\u2019s early evening now and the aggressive heat has mellowed, and it\u2019s like everyone senses that it\u2019s safe to go out because they\u2019re mobbing the place: spreading out picnics on the lawn, pushing jogging strollers up the paths, floating in canoes along the lily-padded lake.</p><p>Much as I like seeing all the people doing their thing, it all makes me feel exposed. I don\u2019t get how other people in the public eye do it. Sometimes I see pictures of Brad Pitt with his gaggle of kids in Central Park, just playing on swings, and clearly he was followed by paparazzi but he still looks like he\u2019s having a normal day with his family. Or maybe not. Pictures can be pretty deceptive.</p><p>Thinking about all this and passing happy people enjoying a summer evening, I start to feel like a moving target, even though I have my cap pulled low and my shades are on and I\u2019m without Bryn. When Bryn and I are together, it\u2019s almost impossible to fly under the radar. I\u2019m seized with this paranoia, not even so much that I\u2019ll get photographed or hounded by a mob of autograph seekers\u2014though I really don\u2019t want to deal with that right now\u2014but that I\u2019ll be mocked as the only person in the entire park who\u2019s alone, even though this obviously isn\u2019t the case. But still, I feel like any second people will start pointing, making fun of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, this is how it\u2019s become? This is what I\u2019ve become? A walking contradiction? I\u2019m surrounded by people and feel alone. I claim to crave a bit of normalcy but now that I have some, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know what to do with it, don\u2019t know how to be a normal person anymore.</p><p>I wander toward the Ramble, where the only people I\u2019m likely to bump into are the kind who don\u2019t want to be found. I buy a couple of hot dogs and down them in a few bites, and it\u2019s only then that I realize I haven\u2019t eaten all day, which makes me think about lunch\u2014and the Vanessa LeGrande debacle.</p><p>What happened back there? I mean, you\u2019ve been known to get testy with reporters, but that was just an amateur-hour move, I tell myself.</p><p>I\u2019m just tired, I justify. Overtaxed. I think of the tour and it\u2019s like the mossy ground next to me opens up and starts whirring.</p> <p>Sixty-seven nights. I try to rationalize it. Sixty-seven nights is nothing. I try to divide up the number, to fractionalize it, to do something to make it smaller, but nothing divides evenly into sixty-seven. So I break it up. Fourteen countries, thirty-nine cities, a few hundred hours on a tour bus. But the math just makes the whirring go faster and I start to feel dizzy. I grab hold of the tree trunk and run my hand against the bark, which reminds me of Oregon and makes the earth at least close up for the time being.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but think about how, when I was younger, I\u2019d read about the legions of artists who imploded\u2014 Morrison, Joplin, Cobain, Hendrix. They disgusted me. They got what they wanted and then what did they do? Drugged themselves to oblivion. Or shot their heads off. What a bunch of ass**les.</p><p>Well, take a look at yourself now. You\u2019re no junkie but you\u2019re not much better.</p><p>I would change if I could, but so far, ordering myself to shut up and enjoy the ride hasn\u2019t had much of an impact. If the people around me knew how I feel, they\u2019d laugh at me. No, that\u2019s not true. Bryn wouldn\u2019t laugh. She\u2019d be baffled by my inability to bask in what I\u2019ve worked so hard to accomplish.</p><p>But have I worked so hard? There\u2019s this assumption among my family, Bryn, the rest of the band\u2014well, at least there used to be among those guys\u2014that I somehow deserve all this, that the acclaim and wealth is payback. I\u2019ve never really bought that. Karma\u2019s not like a bank. Make a deposit, take a withdrawal. But more and more, I am starting to suspect that all this is payback for something\u2014only not the good kind.</p> <p>I reach for a cigarette, but my pack\u2019s empty. I stand up and dust off my jeans and make my way out of the park. The sun is starting to dip to the west, a bright blaring ball tilting toward the Hudson and leaving a collage of peach and purple streaks across the sky. It really is pretty and for a second I force myself to admire it.</p><p>I turn south on Seventh, stop at a deli, grab some smokes, and then head downtown. I\u2019ll go back to the hotel, get some room service, maybe fall asleep early for once. Outside Carnegie Hall, taxis are pulling up, dropping off people for tonight\u2019s performances. An old woman in pearls and heels teeters out of a taxi, her stooped-over companion in a tux holding onto her elbow. Watching them stumble off together, I feel something in my chest lurch. Look at the sunset, I tell myself. Look at something with beauty. But when I look back up at the sky, the streaks have darkened to the color of a bruise.</p><p>Prissy, temperamental ass**le. That\u2019s what the reporter was calling me. She was a piece of work, but on that particular point, she was speaking the truth.</p><p>My gaze returns to earth and when it does, it\u2019s her eyes I see. Not the way I used to see them\u2014around every corner, behind my own closed lids at the start of each day. Not in the way I used to imagine them in the eyes of every other girl I laid on top of. No, this time it really is her eyes. A photo of her, dressed in black, a cello leaning against one shoulder like a tired child. Her hair is up in one of those buns that seem to be a requisite for classical musicians. She used to wear it up like that for recitals and chamber music concerts, but with little pieces hanging down, to soften the severity of the look. There are no tendrils in this photo. I peer closer at the sign. YOUNG CONCERT SERIES PRESENTS MIA HALL.</p><p>A few months ago, Liz broke the unspoken embargo on all things Mia and mailed me a clip from the magazine All About Us. I thought you should see this, was scrawled on a sticky note. It was an article titled \u201cTwenty Under 20,\u201d featuring upcoming \u201cwunderkinds.\u201d There was a page on Mia, including a picture I could barely bring myself to glance at, and an article about her, that after a few rounds of deep breathing, I only managed to skim. The piece called her the \u201cheir apparent to Yo-Yo Ma.\u201d In spite of myself, I\u2019d smiled at that. Mia used to say that people who had no idea about the cello always described cellists as the next Yo-Yo Ma because he was their single point of reference. \u201cWhat about Jacqueline Du Pr\u00e9?\u201d she\u2019d always asked, referring to her own idol, a talented and tempestuous cellist who\u2019d been stricken with multiple sclerosis at the age of twenty-eight and died about fifteen years later.</p><p>The All About Us article called Mia\u2019s playing \u201cotherworldly\u201d and then very graphically described the car accident that had killed her parents and little brother more than three years ago. That had surprised me. Mia hadn\u2019t been one to talk about that, to fish for sympathy points. But when I\u2019d managed to make myself skim the piece again, I\u2019d realized that it was a write-around, quotes taken from old newspaper accounts, but nothing directly from Mia herself.</p> <p>I\u2019d held onto the clipping for a few days, occasionally taking it out to glance over it. Having the thing in my wallet felt a little bit like carrying around a vial of plutonium. And for sure if Bryn caught me with an article about Mia there\u2019d be explosions of the nuclear variety. So after a few more days, I threw it away and forced myself to forget it.</p><p>Now, I try to summon the details, to recall if it said anything about Mia leaving Juilliard or playing recitals at Carnegie Hall.</p><p>I look up again. Her eyes are still there, still staring at me. And I just know with as much certainty as I know anything in this world that she\u2019s playing tonight. I know even before I consult the date on the poster and see that the performance is for August thirteenth.</p><p>And before I know what I\u2019m doing, before I can argue myself out of it, rationalize what a terrible idea this is, I\u2019m walking toward the box office. I don\u2019t want to see her, I tell myself. I won\u2019t see her. I only want to hear her. The box office sign says that tonight is sold out. I could announce who I am or put in a call to my hotel\u2019s concierge or Aldous and probably get a ticket, but instead I leave it to fate. I present myself as an anonymous, if underdressed, young man and ask if there are any seats left.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, we\u2019re just releasing the rush tickets. I have a rear mezzanine, side. It\u2019s not the ideal view, but it\u2019s all that\u2019s left,\u201d the girl behind the glass window tells me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for the view,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cI always think that, too,\u201d the girl says, laughing. \u201cBut people get particular about these kinds of things. That\u2019ll be twenty-five dollars.\u201d</p><p>I throw down my credit card and enter the cool, dim theater. I slide into my seat and close my eyes, remembering the last time I went to a cello concert somewhere this fancy. Five years ago, on our first date. Just as I did that night, I feel this mad rush of anticipation, even though I know that unlike that night, tonight I won\u2019t kiss her. Or touch her. Or even see her up close.</p> <p>Tonight, I\u2019ll listen. And that\u2019ll be enough.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Mia woke up after four days, but we didn\u2019t tell her until the sixth day. It didn\u2019t matter because she seemed to already know. We sat around her hospital bed in the ICU, her taciturn grandfather having drawn the short straw, I guess, because he was the one chosen to break the news that her parents, Kat and Denny, had been killed instantly in the car crash that had landed her here. And that her little brother, Teddy, had died in the emergency room of the local hospital where he and Mia had been brought to before Mia was evacuated to Portland. Nobody knew the cause of the crash. Did Mia have any memory of it?</p><p>Mia just lay there, blinking her eyes and holding onto my hand, digging her nails in so tightly it seemed like she\u2019d never let me go. She shook her head and quietly said \u201cno, no, no,\u201d over and over again, but without tears, and I wasn\u2019t sure if she was answering her grandfather\u2019s question or just negating the whole situation. No!</p><p>But then the social worker stepped in, taking over in her no-nonsense way. She told Mia about the operations she\u2019d undergone so far, \u201ctriage, really, just to get you stable, and you\u2019re doing remarkably well,\u201d and then talked about the surgeries that she\u2019d likely be facing in the coming months: First a surgery to reset the bone in her left leg with metal rods. Then another surgery a week or so after that, to harvest skin from the thigh of her uninjured leg. Then another to graft that skin onto the messed-up leg. Those two procedures, unfortunately, would leave some \u201cnasty scars.\u201d But the injuries on her face, at least, could vanish completely with cosmetic surgery after a year. \u201cOnce you\u2019re through your nonelective surgeries, provided there aren\u2019t any complications\u2014no infections from the splenectomy, no pneumonia, no problems with your lungs\u2014we\u2019ll get you out of the hospital and into rehab,\u201d the social worker said. \u201cPhysical and occupational, speech and whatever else you need. We\u2019ll assess where you are in a few days.\u201d I was dizzy from this litany, but Mia seemed to hang on her every word, to pay more attention to the details of her surgeries than to the news of her family.</p><p>Later that afternoon, the social worker took the rest of us aside. We\u2014Mia\u2019s grandparents and me\u2014had been worried about Mia\u2019s reaction, or her lack of one. We\u2019d expected screaming, hair pulling, something explosive, to match the horror of the news, to match our own grief. Her eerie quiet had all of us thinking the same thing: brain damage.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d the social worker quickly reassured. \u201cThe brain is a fragile instrument and we may not know for a few weeks what specific regions have been affected, but young people are so very resilient and right now her neurologists are quite optimistic. Her motor control is generally good. Her language faculties don\u2019t seem too affected. She has weakness in her right side and her balance is off. If that\u2019s the extent of her brain injury, then she is fortunate.\u201d</p><p>We all cringed at that word. Fortunate. But the social worker looked at our faces. \u201cVery fortunate because all of that is reversible. As for that reaction back there,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the ICU, \u201cthat is a typical response to such extreme psychological trauma. The brain can only handle so much, so it filters in a bit at a time, digests slowly. She\u2019ll take it all in, but she\u2019ll need help.\u201d Then she\u2019d told us about the stages of grief, loaded us up with pamphlets on post-traumatic stress disorder, and recommended a grief counselor at the hospital for Mia to see. \u201cIt might not be a bad idea for the rest of you, too,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>We\u2019d ignored her. Mia\u2019s grandparents weren\u2019t the therapy types. And as for me, I had Mia\u2019s rehabilitation to worry about, not my own.</p><p>The next round of surgeries started almost immediately, which I found cruel. Mia had just come back from the brink of it, only to be told her family was dead, and now she had to go under the knife again. Couldn\u2019t they cut the girl a break? But the social worker had explained that the sooner Mia\u2019s leg was fixed, the sooner Mia would be mobile, and the sooner she could really start to heal. So her femur was set with pins; skin grafts were taken. And with speed that made me breathless, she was discharged from the hospital and dispatched to a rehab center, which looked like a condo complex, with flat paths crisscrossing the grounds, which were just beginning to bloom with spring flowers when Mia arrived.</p><p>She\u2019d been there less than a week, a determined, teeth-gritted terrifying week, when the envelope came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Juilliard. It had been so many things to me before. A foregone conclusion. A point of pride. A rival. And then I\u2019d just forgotten about it. I think we all had. But life was churning outside Mia\u2019s rehab center, and somewhere out there in the world, that other Mia\u2014the one who had two parents, a brother, and a fully working body\u2014still continued to exist. And in that other world, some judges had listened to Mia play a few months earlier and had gone on processing her application, and it had gone through the various motions until a final judgment was made, and that final judgment was before us now. Mia\u2019s grandmother had been too nervous to open the envelope, so she waited for me and Mia\u2019s grandfather before she sliced into it with a mother-of-pearl letter opener.</p><p>Mia got in. Had there ever been any question?</p><p>We all thought the acceptance would be good for her, a bright spot on an otherwise bleak horizon.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve already spoken to the dean of admissions and explained your situation, and they\u2019ve said you can put off starting for a year, two if you need,\u201d Mia\u2019s grandmother had said as she\u2019d presented Mia with the news and the generous scholarship that had accompanied the acceptance. Juilliard had actually suggested the deferral, wanting to make sure that Mia was able to play up to the school\u2019s rigorous standards, if she chose to attend.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mia had said from the center\u2019s depressing common room in that dead-flat voice she had spoken in since the accident. None of us was quite sure whether this was from emotional trauma or if this was Mia\u2019s affect now, her newly rearranged brain\u2019s way of speaking. In spite of the social worker\u2019s continued reassurances, in spite of her therapists\u2019 evaluations that she was making solid progress, we still worried. We discussed these things in hushed tones after we left her alone on the nights that I couldn\u2019t con myself into staying over.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be hasty,\u201d her grandmother had replied. \u201cThe world might look different in a year or two. You might still want to go.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s grandmother had thought Mia was refusing Juilliard. But I knew better. I knew Mia better. It was the deferral she was refusing.</p><p>Her grandmother argued with Mia. September was five months away. Too soon. And she had a point. Mia\u2019s leg was still in one of those boot casts, and she was just starting to walk again. She couldn\u2019t open a jar because her right hand was so weak, and she would often blank on the names of simple things, like scissors. All of which the therapists said was to be expected and would likely pass\u2014in good time. But five months? That wasn\u2019t long.</p><p>Mia asked for her cello that afternoon. Her grandmother had frowned, worried that this foolishness would waylay Mia\u2019s recovery. But I jumped out of my chair and ran to my car and was back with the cello by the time the sun set.</p> <p>After that, the cello became her therapy: physical, emotional, mental. The doctors were amazed at Mia\u2019s upper-body strength\u2014what her old music teacher Professor Christie had called her \u201ccello body,\u201d broad shoulders, muscular arms\u2014and how her playing brought that strength back, which made the weakness in her right arm go away and strengthened her injured leg. It helped with the dizziness. Mia closed her eyes as she played, and she claimed that this, along with grounding her two feet on the floor, helped her balance. Through playing, Mia revealed the lapses she tried to hide in everyday conversation. If she wanted a Coke but couldn\u2019t remember the word for it, she\u2019d cover up and just ask for orange juice. But with cello, she would be honest about the fact that she remembered a Bach suite she\u2019d been working on a few months ago but not a simple \u00e9tude she\u2019d learned as a child; although once Professor Christie, who came down once a week to work with her, showed it to her, she\u2019d pick it right up. This gave the speech therapists and neurologists clues as to the hopscotch way her brain had been impacted, and they tailored their therapies accordingly.</p><p>But mostly, the cello improved her mood. It gave her something to do every day. She stopped speaking in the monotone and started to talk like Mia again, at least when she was talking about music. Her therapists altered her rehabilitation plan, allowing her to spend more time practicing. \u201cWe don\u2019t really get how music heals the brain,\u201d one of her neurologists told me one afternoon as he listened to her play to a group of patients in the common room, \u201cbut we know that it does. Just look at Mia.\u201d</p><p>She left the rehab center after four weeks, two weeks ahead of schedule. She could walk with a cane, open a jar of peanut butter, and play the hell out of Beethoven.</p><p>That article, the \u201cTwenty Under 20\u201d thing from All About Us that Liz showed me, I do remember one thing about it. I remember the not-just-implied but overtly stated connection between Mia\u2019s \u201ctragedy\u201d and her \u201cotherworldly\u201d playing. And I remember how that pissed me off. Because there was something insulting in that. As if the only way to explain her talent was to credit some supernatural force. Like what\u2019d they think, that her dead family was inhabiting her body and playing a celestial choir through her fingers?</p><p>But the thing was, there was something otherworldly that happened. And I know because I was there. I witnessed it: I saw how Mia went from being a very talented player to something altogether different. In the space of five months, something magical and grotesque transformed her. So, yes, it was all related to her \u201ctragedy,\u201d but Mia was the one doing the heavy lifting. She always had been.</p><p>She left for Juilliard the day after Labor Day. I drove her to the airport. She kissed me good-bye. She told me that she loved me more than life itself. Then she stepped through security.</p> <p>She never came back.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>The bow is so old, its horsehair is glue</p><p>Sent to the factory, just like me and like you</p><p>So how come they stayed your execution?</p><p>The audience roars its standing ovation</p><p>\u201cDUST\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 9</p> <p>When the lights come up after the concert, I feel drained, lugubrious, as though my blood has been secreted out of me and replaced with tar. After the applause dies down, the people around me stand up, they talk about the concert, about the beauty of the Bach, the mournfulness of the Elgar, the risk\u2014that paid off\u2014of throwing in the contemporary John Cage piece. But it\u2019s the Dvo?\u00e1k that\u2019s eating up all the oxygen in the room, and I can understand why.</p><p>When Mia used to play her cello, her concentration was always written all over her body: a crease folded across her forehead. Her lips, pursed so tightly they sometimes lost all their color, as if all her blood was requisitioned to her hands.</p><p>There was a little bit of that happening with the earlier pieces tonight. But when she got to the Dvo?\u00e1k, the final piece of her recital, something came over her. I don\u2019t know if she hit her groove or if this was her signature piece, but instead of hunching over her cello, her body seemed to expand, to bloom, and the music filled the open spaces around it like a flowering vine. Her strokes were broad and happy and bold, and the sound that filled the auditorium seemed to channel this pure emotion, like the very intention of the composer was spiraling through the room. And the look on her face, with her eyes upward, a small smile playing on her lips, I don\u2019t know how to describe it without sounding like one of these clich\u00e9d magazine articles, but she seemed so at one with the music. Or maybe just happy. I guess I always knew she was capable of this level of artistry, but witnessing it f**king blew me away. Me and everyone else in that auditorium, judging by the thunderous applause she got.</p><p>The houselights are up now, bright and bouncing off the blond wood chairs and the geometric wall panels, making the floor start to swim. I sink back down into the nearest chair and try not to think about the Dvo?\u00e1k\u2014or the other things: the way she wiped her hand on her skirt in between pieces, the way she cocked her head in time to some invisible orchestra, all gestures that are way too familiar to me.</p><p>Grasping onto the chair in front of me for balance, I stand up again. I make sure my legs are working and the ground isn\u2019t spinning and then will one leg to follow the other toward the exit. I am shattered, exhausted. All I want to do now is go back to my hotel to down a couple of Ambien or Lunesta or Xanax or whatever\u2019s in my medicine cabinet\u2014and end this day. I want to go to sleep and wake up and have this all be over.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Wilde.\u201d</p><p>I normally have a thing about enclosed spaces, but if there is one place in the city where I\u2019d expect the safety of anonymity, it\u2019s Carnegie Hall for a classical concert. All through the concert and intermission, no one gave me a second glance, except a pair of old biddies who I think were mostly just dismayed by my jeans. But this guy is about my age; he\u2019s an usher, the only person within fifty feet under the age of thirty-five, the only person around here likely to own a Shooting Star album.</p><p>I\u2019m reaching into my pocket for a pen that I don\u2019t have. The usher looks embarrassed, shaking his head and his hands simultaneously. \u201cNo, no, Mr. Wilde. I\u2019m not asking for an autograph.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s actually against the rules, could get me fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, chastened, confused. For a second I wonder if I\u2019m about to get dressed-down for dressing down.</p><p>The usher says: \u201cMs. Hall would like you to come backstage.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s noisy with the after-show hubbub, so for a second I assume I\u2019ve misheard him. I think he says that she wants me backstage. But that can\u2019t be right. He must be talking about the hall, not Mia Hall.</p><p>But before I can get him to clarify, he\u2019s leading me by the elbow back toward the staircase and down to the main lobby and through a small door beside the stage and through a maze of corridors, the walls lined with framed sheet music. And I\u2019m allowing myself to be led; it\u2019s like the time when I was ten years old and was sent to the principal\u2019s office for throwing a water balloon in class, and all I could do was follow Mrs. Linden down the hallways and wonder what awaited me behind the main office doors. I have that same feeling. That I\u2019m in trouble for something, that Aldous didn\u2019t really give me the evening off and I\u2019m about to be reamed out for missing a photo shoot or pissing off a reporter or being the antisocial lone wolf in danger of breaking up the band.</p><p>And so I don\u2019t really process it, don\u2019t let myself hear it or believe it or think about it until the usher leads me to a small room and opens the door and closes it, and suddenly she\u2019s there. Really there. A flesh-and-blood person, not a specter.</p><p>My first impulse is not to grab her or kiss her or yell at her. I simply want to touch her cheek, still flushed from the night\u2019s performance. I want to cut through the space that separates us, measured in feet\u2014not miles, not continents, not years\u2014and to take a callused finger to her face. I want to touch her to make sure it\u2019s really her, not one of those dreams I had so often after she left when I\u2019d see her as clear as day, be ready to kiss her or take her to me only to wake up with Mia just beyond reach.</p><p>But I can\u2019t touch her. This is a privilege that\u2019s been revoked. Against my will, but still. Speaking of will, I have to mentally hold my arm in place, to keep the trembling from turning it into a jackhammer.</p><p>The floor is spinning, the vortex is calling, and I\u2019m itching for one of my pills, but there\u2019s no reaching for one now. I take some calming breaths to preempt a panic attack. I work my jaw in a vain attempt to get my mouth to say some words. I feel like I\u2019m alone on a stage, no band, no equipment, no memory of any of our songs, being watched by a million people. I feel like an hour has gone by as I stand here in front of Mia Hall, speechless as a newborn.</p><p>The first time we ever met in high school, I spoke first. I asked Mia what cello piece she\u2019d just played. A simple question that started everything.</p><p>This time, it\u2019s Mia who asks the question: \u201cIs it really you?\u201d And her voice, it\u2019s exactly the same. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d expect it to be different except that everything\u2019s different now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her voice jolts me back to reality. Back to the reality of the past three years. There are so many things that demand to be said. Where did you go? Do you ever think about me? You\u2019ve ruined me. Are you okay? But of course, I can\u2019t say any of that.</p><p>I start to feel my heart pound and a ringing in my ears, and I\u2019m about to lose it. But strangely, just when the panic starts to peak, some survival instinct kicks in, the one that allows me to step onto a stage in front of thousands of strangers. A calm steals over me as I retreat from myself, pushing me into the background and letting that other person take over. \u201cIn the flesh,\u201d I respond in kind. Like it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world for me to be at her concert and for her to have beckoned me into her sanctum. \u201cGood concert,\u201d I add because it seems like the thing to say. It also happens to be true.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says. Then she cringes. \u201cI just, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I think of the three-year restraining order she basically took out on me, which I violated tonight. But you called me down, I want to say. \u201cYeah. I guess they\u2019ll let any old riffraff in Carnegie Hall,\u201d I joke. In my nervousness, though, the quip comes out surly.</p> <p>She smooths her hands on the fabric of her skirt. She\u2019s already changed out of her formal black gown into a long, flowy skirt and a sleeveless shirt. She shakes her head, tilts her face toward mine, all conspiratorial. \u201cNot really. No punks allowed. Didn\u2019t you see the warning on the marquee? I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get arrested just for setting foot in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s trying to return my bad joke with one of her own and part of me is thankful for that, and thankful to see a glimmer of her old sense of humor. But another part, the churlish part, wants to remind her of all of the chamber music concerts, string quartets, and recitals I once sat through. Because of her. With her. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Adam Wilde in Zankel Hall. At the intermission, the entire backstage crew was buzzing about it. Apparently, a lot of Shooting Star fans work at Carnegie Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was being incognito,\u201d I say. To her feet. The only way to survive this conversation is to have it with Mia\u2019s sandals. Her toenails are painted pale pink.</p><p>\u201cYou? Impossible,\u201d she replies. \u201cSo, how are you?\u201d</p> <p>How am I? Are you for real? I force my eyes upward and look at Mia for the first time. She\u2019s still beautiful. Not in an obvious Vanessa LeGrande or Bryn Shraeder kind of way. In a quiet way that\u2019s always been devastating to me. Her hair, long and dark, is down now, swimming damply against her bare shoulders, which are still milky white and covered with the constellation of freckles that I used to kiss. The scar on her left shoulder, the one that used to be an angry red welt, is silvery pink now. Almost like the latest rage in tattoo accessories. Almost pretty.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes reach out to meet mine, and for a second I fear that my facade will fall apart. I look away.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know? Good. Busy,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course. Busy. Are you on tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Off to London tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m off to Japan tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Opposite directions, I think and am surprised when Mia actually says it out loud. \u201cOpposite directions.\u201d The words just hang out there, ominous. Suddenly, I feel the vortex begin to churn again. It\u2019s going to swallow us both if I don\u2019t get away. \u201cWell, I should probably go.\u201d I hear the calm person impersonating Adam Wilde say from what sounds like several feet away.</p><p>I think I see something darken her expression, but I can\u2019t really tell because every part of my body is undulating, and I swear I might just come inside-out right here. But as I\u2019m losing it, that other Adam is still functioning. He\u2019s reaching out his hand toward Mia even though the thought of me giving Mia Hall a business handshake is maybe one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever imagined.</p><p>Mia looks down at my outstretched hand, opens her mouth to say something, and then just sighs. Her face hardens into a mask as she reaches out her own hand to take mine.</p><p>The tremor in my hand has become so normal, so nonstop, that it\u2019s generally imperceptible to me. But as soon as my fingers close around Mia\u2019s, the thing I notice is that it stops and suddenly it goes quiet, like when the squall of feedback is suddenly cut when someone switches off an amp. And I could linger here forever.</p><p>Except this is a handshake, nothing more. And in a few seconds my hand is at my side and it\u2019s like I\u2019ve transferred a little of my crazy to Mia because it looks like her own hand is trembling. But I can\u2019t be sure because I\u2019m drifting away on a fast current.</p><p>And the next thing I know, I hear the door to her dressing room click behind me, leaving me out here on the rapids and Mia back there on the shore.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>I know it\u2019s really cheesy\u2014crass even\u2014to compare my being dumped to the accident that killed Mia\u2019s family, but I can\u2019t help it. Because for me, at any rate, the aftermath felt exactly the same. For the first few weeks, I\u2019d wake up in a fog of disbelief. That didn\u2019t really happen, did it? Oh, f**k, it did. Then I\u2019d be doubled over. Fist to the gut. It took a few weeks for it all to sink in. But unlike with the accident\u2014when I had to be there, be present, help, be the person to lean on\u2014after she left, I was all alone. There was nobody to step up to the plate for. So I just let everything fall away and then everything just stopped.</p> <p>I moved home, back to my parents\u2019 place. Just grabbed a pile of stuff from my room at the House of Rock and left. Left everything. School. The band. My life. A sudden and wordless departure. I balled up in my boy bed. I was worried that everyone would bang down the door and force me to explain myself. But that\u2019s the thing with death. The whisper of its descent travels fast and wide, and people must\u2019ve known I\u2019d become a corpse because nobody even came to view the body. Well, except relentless Liz, who stopped by once a week to drop off a CD mix of whatever new music she was loving, which she cheerfully stacked on top of the untouched CD she\u2019d left the week before.</p><p>My parents seemed baffled by my return. But then, bafflement was pretty typical where I was concerned. My dad had been a logger, and then when that industry went belly-up he\u2019d gotten a job on the line at an electronics plant. My mom worked for the university catering department. They were one another\u2019s second marriages, their first marital forays both disastrous and childless and never discussed; I only found out about them from an aunt and uncle when I was ten. They had me when they were older, and I\u2019d apparently come as a surprise. And my mom liked to say that everything that I\u2019d done\u2014from my mere existence to becoming a musician, to falling in love with a girl like Mia, to going to college, to having the band become so popular, to dropping out of college, to dropping out of the band\u2014was a surprise, too. They accepted my return home with no questions. Mom brought me little trays of food and coffee to my room, like I was a prisoner.</p><p>For three months, I lay in my childhood bed, wishing myself as comatose as Mia had been. That had to be easier than this. My sense of shame finally roused me. I was nineteen years old, a college dropout, living in my parents\u2019 house, unemployed, a layabout, a clich\u00e9. My parents had been cool about the whole thing, but the reek of my pathetic was starting to make me sick. Finally, right after the New Year, I asked my father if there were any jobs at the plant.</p><p>\u201cYou sure this is what you want?\u201d he\u2019d asked me. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted. But I couldn\u2019t have what I wanted. I\u2019d just shrugged. I\u2019d heard him and my mom arguing about it, her trying to get him to talk me out of it. \u201cDon\u2019t you want more than that for him?\u201d I heard her shout-whisper from downstairs. \u201cDon\u2019t you want him back in school at the very least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about what I want,\u201d he\u2019d answered.</p><p>So he asked around human resources, got me an interview, and a week later, I began work in the dataentry department. From six thirty in the morning to three thirty in the afternoon, I would sit in a windowless room, plugging in numbers that had no meaning to me.</p><p>On my first day of work, my mother got up early to make me a huge breakfast I couldn\u2019t eat and a pot of coffee that wasn\u2019t nearly strong enough. She stood over me in her ratty pink bathrobe, a worried expression on her face. When I got up to leave, she shook her head at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou working at the plant,\u201d she said, staring at me solemnly. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t surprise me. This is what I would\u2019ve expected from a son of mine.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if the bitterness in her voice was meant for her or me.</p><p>The job sucked, but whatever. It was brainless. I came home and slept all afternoon and then woke up and read and dozed from ten o\u2019clock at night until five in the morning, when it was time to get up for work. The schedule was out of sync with the living world, which was fine by me</p><p>A few weeks earlier, around Christmas, I\u2019d still held a candle of hope. Christmas was when Mia had initially planned to come home. The ticket she\u2019d bought for New York was a round-trip, and the return date was December nineteenth. Though I knew it was foolish, I somehow thought she\u2019d come see me, she\u2019d offer some explanation\u2014or, better yet, a massive apology. Or we\u2019d find that this had all been some huge and horrible misunderstanding. She\u2019d been emailing me daily but they hadn\u2019t gotten through, and she\u2019d show up at my door, livid about my not having returned her emails, the way she used to get pissed off at me for silly things, like how nice I was, or was not, to her friends.</p><p>But December came and went, a monotony of gray, of muted Christmas carols coming from downstairs. I stayed in bed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until February that I got a visitor home from a back East college.</p><p>\u201cAdam, Adam, you have a guest,\u201d my mom said, gently rapping at my door. It was around dinnertime and I was sacked out, the middle of the night to me. In my haze, I thought it was Mia. I bolted upright but saw from my mother\u2019s pained expression that she knew she was delivering disappointing news. \u201cIt\u2019s Kim!\u201d she said with forced joviality.</p><p>Kim? I hadn\u2019t heard from Mia\u2019s best friend since August, not since she\u2019d taken off for school in Boston. And all at once, it hit me that her silence was as much a betrayal as Mia\u2019s. Kim and I had never been buddies when Mia and I were together. At least not before the accident. But after, we\u2019d been soldered somehow. I hadn\u2019t realized that Mia and Kim were a package deal, one with the other. Lose one, lose the other. But then, how else would it be?</p><p>But now, here was Kim. Had Mia sent her as some sort of an emissary? Kim was smiling awkwardly, hugging herself against the damp night. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re hard to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m where I\u2019ve always been,\u201d I said, kicking off the covers. Kim, seeing my boxers, turned away until I\u2019d pulled on a pair of jeans. I reached for a pack of cigarettes. I\u2019d started smoking a few weeks before. Everyone at the plant seemed to. It was the only reason to take a break. Kim\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, like I\u2019d just pulled out a Glock. I put the cigarettes back down without lighting up.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be at the House of Rock, so I went there. I saw Liz and Sarah. They fed me dinner. It was nice to see them.\u201d She stopped and appraised my room. The rumpled, sour blankets, the closed shades. \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a weird schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Your mom told me. Data entry?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to try to mask her surprise.</p><p>I was in no mood for small talk or condescension. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up, Kim?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m in town for break. We all went to Jersey to see my grandparents for Hanukkah, so this is the first time I\u2019ve been back and I wanted to stop and say hi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kim looked nervous. But she also looked concerned. It was an expression I recognized well. The one that said I was the patient now. In the distant night I heard a siren. Reflexively, I scratched my head.</p><p>\u201cDo you still see her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kim\u2019s voice chirped in surprise.</p><p>I stared at her. And slowly repeated the question. \u201cDo you still see Mia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY\u2014Yes,\u201d Kim stumbled. \u201cI mean, not a lot. We\u2019re both busy with school, and New York and Boston are four hours apart. But yes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>Of course. It was the certainty that did it. That made something murderous rise up in me. I was glad there was nothing heavy within reaching distance.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I came as your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my friend?\u201d</p> <p>Kim blanched from the sarcasm in my voice, but that girl was always tougher than she seemed. She didn\u2019t back down or leave. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTell me, then, friend. Did Mia, your friend, your BFF, did she tell you why she dumped me? Without a word? Did she happen to mention that to you at all? Or didn\u2019t I come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, please . . .\u201d Kim\u2019s voice was an entreaty.</p><p>\u201cNo, please, Kim. Please, because I haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d</p><p>Kim took a deep breath and then straightened her posture. I could practically see the resolve stiffening up her spine, vertebra by vertebra, the lines of loyalty being drawn. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to talk about Mia. I came here to see you, and I don\u2019t think I should discuss Mia with you or vice versa.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d adopted the tone of a social worker, an impartial third party, and I wanted to smack her for it. For all of it. Instead, I just exploded. \u201cThen what the f**k are you doing here? What good are you then? Who are you to me? Without her, who are you? You\u2019re nothing! A nobody!\u201d</p> <p>Kim stumbled back, but when she looked up, instead of looking angry, she looked at me full of tenderness. It made me want to throttle her even more. \u201cAdam\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here,\u201d I growled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you again!\u201d</p><p>The thing with Kim was, you didn\u2019t have to tell her twice. She left without another word.</p><p>That night, instead of sleeping, instead of reading, I paced my room for four hours. As I walked back and forth, pushing permanent indentations into the tread of my parents\u2019 cheap shag carpeting, I felt something febrile growing inside of me. It felt alive and inevitable, the way a puke with a nasty hangover sometimes is. I felt it itching its way through my body, begging for release, until it finally came tearing out of me with such force that first I punched my wall, and then, when that didn\u2019t hurt enough, my window. The shards of glass sliced into my knuckles with a satisfying ache followed by the cold blast of a February night. The shock seemed to wake something slumbering deep within me.</p><p>Because that was the night I picked up my guitar for the first time in a year.</p><p>And that was the night I started writing songs again.</p><p>Within two weeks, I\u2019d written more than ten new songs. Within a month, Shooting Star was back together and playing them. Within two months, we\u2019d signed with a major label. Within four months, we were recording Collateral Damage, comprised of fifteen of the songs I\u2019d written from the chasm of my childhood bedroom. Within a year, Collateral Damage was on the Billboard charts and Shooting Star was on the cover of national magazines.</p><p>It\u2019s occurred to me since that I owe Kim either an apology or a thank-you. Maybe both. But by the time I came to this realization, it seemed like things were too far gone to do anything about it. And, the truth is, I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019d say to her.</p> <p>SIX</p><p>I\u2019ll be your mess, you be mine</p><p>That was the deal that we had signed</p><p>I bought a hazmat suit to clean up your waste</p><p>Gas masks, gloves, to keep us safe</p><p>But now I\u2019m alone in an empty room</p><p>Staring down immaculate doom</p><p>\u201cMESSY\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 2</p><p>When I get onto the street, my hands are quaking and my insides feel like they\u2019re staging a coup. I reach for my pills, but the bottle is empty. Fuck! Aldous must\u2019ve fed me the last one in the cab. Do I have more at the hotel? I\u2019ve got to get some before tomorrow\u2019s flight. I grab for my phone and remember that I left it back at the hotel in some boneheaded attempt to disconnect.</p><p>People are swarming around and their gazes are lingering a little too long on me. I can\u2019t deal with being recognized right now. I can\u2019t deal with anything. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want any of this.</p><p>I just want out. Out of my existence. I find myself wishing that a lot lately. Not be dead. Or kill myself. Or any of that kind of stupid shit. It\u2019s more that I can\u2019t help thinking that if I\u2019d never been born in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t be facing those sixty-seven nights, I wouldn\u2019t be right here, right now, having just endured that conversation with her. It\u2019s your own fault for coming tonight, I tell myself. You should\u2019ve left well enough alone.</p><p>I light a cigarette and hope that will steady me enough to walk back to the hotel where I\u2019ll call Aldous and get everything straightened out and maybe even sleep a few hours and get this disastrous day behind me once and for all.</p><p>\u201cYou should quit.\u201d</p><p>Her voice jars me. But it also somehow calms me. I look up. There\u2019s Mia, face flushed, but also, oddly, smiling. She\u2019s breathing hard, like she\u2019s been running. Maybe she gets chased by fans, too. I imagine that old couple in the tux and pearls tottering after her.</p><p>I don\u2019t even have time to feel embarrassed because Mia is here again, standing in front of me like when we still shared the same space and time and bumping into each other, though always a happy coincidence, was nothing unusual, not the slightest bit extraordinary. For a second I think of that line in Casablanca when Bogart says: Of all the gin joints in the world, she has to walk into mine. But then I remind myself that I walked into her gin joint.</p><p>Mia covers the final few feet between us slowly, like I\u2019m a cagey cat that needs to be brought in. She eyes the cigarette in my hand. \u201cSince when do you smoke?\u201d she asks. And it\u2019s like the years between us are gone, and Mia has forgotten that she no longer has the right to get on my case.</p><p>Even if in this instance it\u2019s deserved. Once upon a time, I\u2019d been adamantly straightedge where nicotine was concerned. \u201cI know. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9,\u201d I admit.</p><p>She eyes me, the cigarette. \u201cCan I have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d When Mia was like six or something, she\u2019d read some kid\u2019s book about a girl who got her dad to quit smoking and then she\u2019d decided to lobby her mom, an on-again-off-again-smoker, to quit. It had taken Mia months to prevail upon Kat, but prevail she did. By the time I met them, Kat didn\u2019t smoke at all. Mia\u2019s dad, Denny, puffed on a pipe, but that seemed mostly for show. \u201cYou smoke now?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mia replies. \u201cBut I just had a really intense experience and I\u2019m told cigarettes calm your nerves.\u201d</p><p>The intensity of a concert\u2014it sometimes left me pent up and edgy. \u201cI feel that way after shows sometimes,\u201d I say, nodding.</p><p>I shake out a cigarette for her; her hand is still trembling, so I keep missing the tip of the cigarette with my lighter. For a second I imagine grabbing her wrist to hold her steady. But I don\u2019t. I just chase the cigarette until the flame flashes across her eyes and lights the tip. She inhales and exhales, coughs a little. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the concert, Adam,\u201d she says before taking another labored drag. \u201cI\u2019m talking about you.\u201d</p><p>Little pinpricks fire-cracker up and down my body. Just calm down, I tell myself. You just make her nervous, showing up all out of the blue like that. Still, I\u2019m flattered that I matter\u2014even if it\u2019s just enough to scare her.</p><p>We smoke in silence for a while. And then I hear something gurgle. Mia shakes her head in dismay and looks down at her stomach. \u201cRemember how I used to get before concerts?\u201d</p><p>Back in the day, Mia would get too nervous to eat before shows, so afterward she was usually ravenous. Back then, we\u2019d go eat Mexican food at our favorite joint or hit a diner out on the highway for French fries with gravy and pie\u2014Mia\u2019s dream meal. \u201cHow long since your last meal ?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Mia peers at me again and stubs out her half-smoked cigarette. She shakes her head. \u201cZankel Hall? I haven\u2019t eaten for days. My stomach was rumbling all through the performance. I was sure even people in the balcony seats could hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Just the cello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I think.\u201d</p><p>We stand there in silence for a second. Her stomach gurgles again. \u201cFries and pie still the optimal meal?\u201d I ask. I picture her in a booth back in our place in Oregon, waving her fork around, as she critiqued her own performance.</p><p>\u201cNot pie. Not in New York. The diner pies are such disappointments. The fruit\u2019s almost always canned. And marionberry does not exist here. How is it possible that a fruit simply ceases to exist from one coast to another?\u201d</p><p>How is it possible that a boyfriend ceases to exist from one day to another? \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the French fries are good.\u201d She gives me a hopeful half smile.</p><p>\u201cI like French fries,\u201d I say. I like French fries? I sound like a slow child in a made-for-TV movie.</p><p>Her eyes flutter up to meet mine. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Am I ever.</p><p>I follow her across Fifty-seventh Street and then down Ninth Avenue. She walks quickly\u2014without even a faint hint of the limp she had when she left\u2014and purposefully, like New Yorkers do, pointing out landmarks here and there like a professional tour guide. It occurs to me I don\u2019t even know if she still lives here or if tonight was just a tour date.</p><p>You could just ask her, I tell myself. It\u2019s a normal enough question.</p><p>Yeah, but it\u2019s so normal that it\u2019s weird that I have to ask.</p><p>Well you\u2019ve got to say something to her.</p><p>But just as I\u2019m getting up the nerve, Beethoven\u2019s Ninth starts chiming from her bag. Mia stops her NYC monologue, reaches in for her cell phone, looks at the screen, and winces.</p><p>\u201cBad news?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and gives a look so pained it has to be practiced. \u201cNo. But I have to take this.\u201d</p><p>She flips open the phone. \u201cHello. I know. Please calm down. I know. Look, can you just hold on one second?\u201d She turns to me, her voice all smooth and professional now. \u201cI know this is unbearably rude, but can you just give me five minutes?\u201d</p><p>I get it. She just played a big show. She\u2019s got people calling. But even so, and in spite of the mask of apology she\u2019s wearing, I feel like a groupie being asked to wait in the back of the bus until the rock star\u2019s ready. But like the groupies always do, I acquiesce. The rock star is Mia. What else am I gonna do?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says.</p><p>I let Mia walk a few paces ahead of me, to give her some privacy, but I still catch snippets of her end of the conversation. I know it was important to you. To us. I promise I\u2019ll make it up to everyone. She doesn\u2019t mention me once. In fact she seems to have forgotten about me back here entirely.</p><p>Which would be okay except that she\u2019s also oblivious to the commotion that my presence is creating along Ninth Avenue, which is full of bars and people loitering and smoking in front of them. People who double take as they recognize me, and yank out their cell phones and digital cameras to snap pictures.</p><p>I vaguely wonder if any of the shots will make it onto Gabber or one of the tabloids. It would be a dream for Vanessa LeGrande. And a nightmare with Bryn. Bryn is jealous enough of Mia as it is, even though she\u2019s never met her; she only knows about her. Even though she knows I haven\u2019t seen Mia in years, Bryn still complains: \u201cIt\u2019s hard competing with a ghost.\u201d As if Bryn Shraeder has to compete with anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdam? Adam Wilde?\u201d It\u2019s a real paparazzo with a telephoto lens about a half block away. \u201cYo, Adam. Can we get a shot? Just one shot,\u201d he calls.</p><p>Sometimes that works. Give them one minute of your face and they leave. But more often than not, it\u2019s like killing one bee and inviting the swarm\u2019s wrath.</p><p>\u201cYo, Adam. Where\u2019s Bryn?\u201d</p><p>I put on my glasses, speed up, though it\u2019s too late for that. I stop walking and step out on to Ninth Avenue, which is clogged with taxis. Mia just keeps walking down the block, yapping away into her cell phone. The old Mia hated cell phones, hated people who talked on them in public, who dismissed one person\u2019s company to take a phone call from someone else. The old Mia would never have uttered the phrase unbearably rude.</p> <p>I wonder if I should let her keep going. The thought of just jumping into a cab and being back at my hotel by the time she figures out I\u2019m not behind her anymore gives me a certain gritty satisfaction. Let her do the wondering for a change.</p><p>But the cabs are all occupied, and, as if the scent of my distress has suddenly reached her, Mia swivels back around to see me, to see the photographer approaching me, brandishing his cameras like machetes. She looks back on to Ninth Avenue at the sea of cars. Just go on, go on ahead, I silently tell her. Get your picture taken with me and your life becomes fodder for the mill. Just keep moving.</p><p>But Mia\u2019s striding toward me, grabbing me by the wrist and, even though she\u2019s a foot shorter and sixty pounds lighter than me, I suddenly feel safe, safer in her custody than I do in any bouncer\u2019s. She walks right into the crowded avenue, stopping traffic just by holding up her other hand. A path opens for us, like we\u2019re the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. As soon as we\u2019re on the opposite curb, that opening disappears as the cabs all roar toward a green light, leaving my paparazzo stalker on the other side of the street. \u201cIt\u2019s near impossible to get a cab now,\u201d Mia tells me. \u201cAll the Broadway shows just let out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got about two minutes on that guy. Even if I get into a cab, he\u2019s gonna follow on foot in this traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He can\u2019t follow where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>She jogs through the crowds, down the avenue, simultaneously pushing me ahead of her and shielding me like a defensive linebacker. She turns off on to a dark street full of tenement buildings. About halfway down the block, the cityscape of brick apartments abruptly gives way to a low area full of trees that\u2019s surrounded by a tall iron fence with a heavy-duty lock for which Mia magically produces the key. With a clank, the lock pops open. \u201cIn you go,\u201d she tells me, pointing to a hedge and a gazebo behind it. \u201cDuck in the gazebo. I\u2019ll lock up.\u201d</p><p>I do as she says and a minute later she\u2019s back at my side. It\u2019s dark in here, the only light the soft glow of a nearby street lamp. Mia puts a finger to her lips and motions for me to crouch down.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did he go?\u201d I hear someone call from the street.</p><p>\u201cHe went this way,\u201d says a woman, her voice thick with a New York accent. \u201cI swear to ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that park?\u201d the woman asks.</p> <p>The clatter of the gate echoes through the garden. \u201cIt\u2019s locked,\u201d he says. In the darkness, I see Mia grin.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he jumped over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like ten feet high,\u201d the guy replies. \u201cYou don\u2019t just leap over something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ya think he has superhuman strength?\u201d the woman replies. \u201cYa could go inside and check for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rip my new Armani pants on the fence? A man has his limits. And it looks empty in there. He probably caught a cab. Which we should do. I got sources texting that Timberlake\u2019s at the Breslin.\u201d</p><p>I hear the sound of footsteps retreating and stay quiet for a while longer just to be safe. Mia breaks the silence.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ya think he has superhuman strength?\u201d she asks in a pitch-perfect imitation. Then she starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna rip my new Armani pants,\u201d I reply. \u201cA man has his limits.\u201d</p> <p>Mia laughs even harder. The tension in my gut eases. I almost smile.</p><p>After her laughter dies down, she stands up, wipes the dirt from her backside, and sits down on the bench in the gazebo. I do the same. \u201cThat must happen to you all the time.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s worse in New York and L.A. And London. But it\u2019s everywhere now. Even fans sell their pics to the tabloids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s in on the game, huh?\u201d she says. Now this sounds more like the Mia I once knew, not like a Classical Cellist with a lofty vocabulary and one of those pan-Euro accents like Madonna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants their cut,\u201d I say. \u201cYou get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get used to a lot of things,\u201d Mia acknowledges.</p><p>I nod in the darkness. My eyes have adjusted so I can see that the garden is pretty big, an expanse of grass bisected by brick paths and ringed by flower beds. Every now and then, a tiny light flashes in the air. \u201cAre those fireflies?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. It used to amaze me, too. But if there\u2019s a patch of green, those little guys will find it and light it up. They only come for a few weeks a year. I always wonder where they go the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>I ponder that. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re still here, but just don\u2019t have anything to light up about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. The insect version of seasonal affective disorder, though the buggers should try living in Oregon if they really want to know what a depressing winter is like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get the key to this place?\u201d I ask. \u201cDo you have to live around here?\u201d</p><p>Mia shakes her head, then nods. \u201cYes, you do have to live in the area to get a key, but I don\u2019t. The key belongs to Ernesto Castorel. Or did belong to. When he was a guest conductor at the Philharmonic, he lived nearby and the garden key came with his sublet. I was having roommate issues at the time, which is a repeating theme in my life, so I wound up crashing at his place a lot, and after he left, I \u2018accidentally\u2019 took the key.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I should feel so sucker-punched. You\u2019ve been with so many girls since Mia you\u2019ve lost count, I reason with myself. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been languishing in celibacy. You think she has?</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen him conduct?\u201d she asks me. \u201cHe always reminded me of you.\u201d</p><p>Except for tonight, I haven\u2019t so much as listened to classical music since you left. \u201cI have no idea who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastorel? Oh, he\u2019s incredible. He came from the slums of Venezuela, and through this program that helps street kids by teaching them to play musical instruments, he wound up becoming a conductor at sixteen. He was the conductor of the Prague Philharmonic at twenty-four, and now he\u2019s the artistic director for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and runs that very same program in Venezuela that gave him his start. He sort of breathes music. Same as you.\u201d</p><p>Who says I breathe music? Who says I even breathe? \u201cWow,\u201d I say, trying to push back against the jealousy I have no right to.</p><p>Mia looks up, suddenly embarrassed. \u201cSorry. I forget sometimes that the entire world isn\u2019t up on the minutiae of classical music. He\u2019s pretty famous in our world.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well my girlfriend is really famous in the rest of the world, I think. But does she even know about Bryn and me? You\u2019d have to have your head buried beneath a mountain not to have heard about us. Or you\u2019d have to intentionally be avoiding any news of me. Or maybe you\u2019d just have to be a classical cellist who doesn\u2019t read tabloids. \u201cHe sounds swell,\u201d I say.</p><p>Even Mia doesn\u2019t miss the sarcasm. \u201cNot famous, like you, I mean,\u201d she says, her gushiness petering into awkwardness.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. For a few seconds there\u2019s no sound, save for the river of traffic on the street. And then Mia\u2019s stomach gurgles again, reminding us that we\u2019ve been waylaid in this garden. That we\u2019re actually on our way someplace else.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>In a weird twisted way, Bryn and I met because of Mia. Well, one degree of separation, I guess. It was really because of the singer-songwriter Brooke Vega. Shooting Star had been slated to open for Brooke\u2019s former band, Bikini, the day of Mia\u2019s accident. When I hadn\u2019t been allowed to visit Mia in the ICU, Brooke had come to the hospital to try to create a diversion. She hadn\u2019t been successful. And that had been the last I\u2019d seen of Brooke until the crazy time after Collateral Damage went double platinum.</p><p>Shooting Star was in L.A. for the MTV Movie Awards. One of our previously recorded but never released songs had been put on the sound track for the movie Hello, Killer and was nominated for Best Song. We didn\u2019t win.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. The MTV Awards were just the latest in a string of ceremonies, and it had been a bumper crop in terms of awards. Just a few months earlier we\u2019d picked up our Grammys for Best New Artist and Song of the Year for \u201cAnimate.\u201d</p><p>It was weird. You\u2019d think that a platinum record, a pair of Grammys, a couple of VMAs would make your world, but the more it all piled on, the more the scene was making my skin crawl. There were the girls, the drugs, the ass-kissing, plus the hype\u2014the constant hype. People I didn\u2019t know\u2014and not groupies, but industry people\u2014rushing up to me like they were my longtime friends, kissing me on both cheeks, calling me \u201cbabe,\u201d slipping business cards into my hand, whispering about movie roles or ads for Japanese beer, one-day shoots that would pay a million bucks.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t handle it, which was why once we\u2019d finished doing our bit for the Movie Awards, I\u2019d ducked out of the Gibson Amphitheater to the smokers\u2019 area. I was planning my escape when I saw Brooke Vega striding toward me. Behind her was a pretty, vaguely familiarlooking girl with long black hair and green eyes the size of dinner plates.</p><p>\u201cAdam Wilde as I live and breathe,\u201d Brooke said, embracing me in a dervish hug. Brooke had recently gone solo and her debut album, Kiss This, had been racking up awards, too, so we\u2019d been bumping into each other a lot at the various ceremonies. \u201cAdam, this is Bryn Shraeder, but you probably know her as the fox nominated for The Best Kiss Award. Did you catch her fabulous smooch in The Way Girls Fall?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost to a vampire-werewolf kiss. Girl-on-girl action doesn\u2019t have quite the same impact it used to,\u201d Bryn deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cYou were robbed!\u201d Brooke interjected. \u201cBoth of you. It\u2019s a cryin\u2019 shame. But I\u2019ll leave you to lick your wounds or just get acquainted. I\u2019ve got to get back and present. Adam, see you around, I hope. You should come to L.A. more often. You could use some color.\u201d She sauntered off, winking at Bryn.</p><p>We stood there in silence for a second. I offered a cigarette to Bryn. She shook her head, then looked at me with those eyes of hers, so unnervingly green. \u201cThat was a setup, in case you were wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was, sort of.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, not in the least embarrassed. \u201cI told Brooke I thought you were intriguing, so she took matters into her own hands. She and I, we\u2019re alike that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would bother a lot of guys out here. Actors tend to be really insecure. Or g*y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. Then she looked at my jacket. \u201cYou going AWOL or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll send the dogs on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s L.A., so they\u2019ll be teeny-tiny Chihuahuas all trussed up in designer bags, so how much damage can they do. You want company?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t have to stay and mourn your best-kiss loss?\u201d</p><p>She looked me squarely in the eye, like she got the joke I was making and was in on it, too. Which I appreciated. \u201cI prefer to celebrate or commiserate my kissing in private.\u201d</p><p>The only plan I had was to return to my hotel in the limo we had waiting. So instead I went with Bryn. She gave her driver the night off and grabbed the keys to her hulking SUV and drove us down the hill from Universal City toward the coast.</p><p>We cruised along the Pacific Coast Highway to a beach north of the city called Point Dume. We stopped on the way for a bottle of wine and some takeout sushi. By the time we reached the beach, a fog had descended over the inky water.</p> <p>\u201cJune gloom,\u201d Bryn said, shivering in her short little green-and-black off-the-shoulder dress. \u201cNever fails to freeze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a sweater or something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t complete the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I handed her my jacket.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows in surprise. \u201cA gentleman.\u201d</p> <p>We sat on the beach, sharing the wine straight out of the bottle. She told me about the film she\u2019d recently wrapped and the one she was leaving to start shooting the following month. And she was trying to decide between one of two scripts to produce for the company she was starting.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a fundamentally lazy person?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI grew up in this armpit town in Arizona, where all my life my mom told me how pretty I was, how I should be a model, an actress. She never even let me play outside in the sun\u2014in Arizona!\u2014because she didn\u2019t want me to mess up my skin. It was like all I had going for me was a pretty face.\u201d She turned to stare at me, and I could see the intelligence in her eyes, which were set, admittedly, in a very pretty face. \u201cBut fine, whatever, my face was the ticket out of there. But now Hollywood\u2019s the same way. Everyone has me pegged as an ingenue, another pretty face. But I know better. So if I want to prove I have a brain, if I want to play in the sunshine, so to speak, it\u2019s up to me to find the project that breaks me out. I feel like I\u2019ll be better positioned to do that if I\u2019m a producer, too. It\u2019s all about control, really. I want to control everything, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but some things you can\u2019t control, no matter how hard you try.\u201d</p><p>Bryn stared out at the dark horizon, dug her bare toes into the cool sand. \u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly. She turned to me. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about your girlfriend. Mia, right?\u201d</p><p>I coughed on the wine. That wasn\u2019t a name I was expecting to hear right now.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just when I asked Brooke about you, she told me how you two met. She wasn\u2019t gossiping or anything. But she was there, at the hospital, so she knew.\u201d</p><p>My heart thundered in my chest. I just nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy dad left when I was seven. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Bryn continued. \u201cSo I can\u2019t imagine losing someone like that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, swigged at the wine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I managed to say.</p><p>She nodded slightly in acknowledgment. \u201cBut at least they all died together. I mean that\u2019s got to be a blessing in a way. I know I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to wake up if the rest of my family had died.\u201d</p><p>The wine came sputtering out of my mouth, through my nose. It took me a few moments to regain my breath and my power of speech. When I did, I told Bryn that Mia wasn\u2019t dead. She\u2019d survived the crash, had made a full recovery.</p><p>Bryn looked genuinely horrified, so much so that I felt sorry for her instead of for myself. \u201cLord, Adam. I\u2019m so mortified. I just sort of assumed. Brooke said she\u2019d never heard boo about Mia again and I would\u2019ve come to the same conclusion. Shooting Star kind of disappears and then Collateral Damage, I mean, the lyrics are just so full of pain and anger and betrayal at being left behind. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Then Bryn looked at me, the green of her eyes reflecting in the moonlight. And I could tell that she understood it all, without my having to say a word. Not having to explain, that felt like the biggest relief. \u201cOh, Adam. That\u2019s even worse in a way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>When Bryn said that, uttered out loud the thing that to my never-ending shame I sometimes felt, I\u2019d fallen in love with her a little bit. And I\u2019d thought that was enough. That this implicit understanding and those first stirrings would bloom until my feelings for Bryn were as consuming as my love for Mia had once been.</p><p>I went back to Bryn\u2019s house that night. And all that spring I visited her on set up in Vancouver, then in Chicago, then in Budapest. Anything to get out of Oregon, away from the awkwardness that had formed like a thick pane of aquarium glass between me and the rest of the band. When she returned to L.A. that summer, she suggested I move into her Hollywood Hills house. \u201cThere\u2019s a guesthouse out back that I never use that we could turn into your studio.\u201d</p><p>The idea of getting out of Oregon, away from the rest of the band, from all that history, a fresh start, a house full of windows and light, a future with Bryn\u2014it had felt so right at the time.</p><p>So that\u2019s how I became one half of a celebrity couple. Now I get my picture snapped with Bryn as we do stuff as mundane as grab a coffee from Starbucks or take a walk through Runyon Canyon.</p><p>I should be happy. I should be grateful. But the problem is, I never can get away from feeling that my fame isn\u2019t about me; it\u2019s about them. Collateral Damage was written with Mia\u2019s blood on my hands, and that was the record that launched me. And when I became really famous, it was for being with Bryn, so it had less to do with the music I was making than the girl I was with.</p><p>And the girl. She\u2019s great. Any guy would kill to be with her, would be proud to knock her up.</p><p>Except even at the start, when we were in that can\u2019t-get-enough-of-you phase, there was like some invisible wall between us. At first I tried to take it down, but it took so much effort to even make cracks. And then I got tired of trying. Then I justified it. This was just how adult relationships were, how love felt once you had a few battle scars.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why I can\u2019t let myself enjoy what we have. Why, in the middle of the night when I can\u2019t sleep, I go outside to listen to the lapping of the pool filter and obsess about the shit about Bryn that drives me crazy. Even as I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s minor league\u2014the way she sleeps with a BlackBerry next to her pillow, the way she works out hours a day and catalogs every little thing she eats, the way she refuses to deviate from a plan or a schedule. And I know that there\u2019s plenty of great stuff to balance out the bad. She\u2019s generous as an oil baron and loyal as a pit bull.</p><p>I know I\u2019m not easy to live with. Bryn tells me I\u2019m withdrawn, evasive, cold. She accuses me\u2014depending on her mood\u2014of being jealous of her career, of being with her by accident, of cheating on her. It\u2019s not true. I haven\u2019t touched a groupie since we\u2019ve been together; I haven\u2019t wanted to.</p><p>I always tell her that part of the problem is that we\u2019re hardly ever in the same place. If I\u2019m not recording or touring, then Bryn\u2019s on location or off on one of her endless press junkets. What I don\u2019t tell her is that I can\u2019t imagine us being together more of the time. Because it\u2019s not like when we\u2019re in the same room everything\u2019s so great.</p><p>Sometimes, after Bryn\u2019s had a couple of glasses of wine, she\u2019ll claim that Mia\u2019s what\u2019s between us. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go back to your ghost?\u201d she\u2019ll say. \u201cI\u2019m tired of competing with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody can compete with you,\u201d I tell her, kissing her on the forehead. And I\u2019m not lying. Nobody can compete with Bryn. And then I tell her it\u2019s not Mia; it\u2019s not any girl. Bryn and I live in a bubble, a spotlight, a pressure cooker. It would be hard on any couple.</p><p>But I think we both know I\u2019m lying. And the truth is, there isn\u2019t any avoiding Mia\u2019s ghost. Bryn and I wouldn\u2019t even be together if it weren\u2019t for her. In that twisted, incestuous way of fate, Mia\u2019s a part of our history, and we\u2019re among the shards of her legacy.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>The clothes are packed off to Goodwill</p><p>I said my good-byes up on that hill</p><p>The house is empty, the furniture sold</p><p>Soon your smells will decay to mold</p><p>Don\u2019t know why I bother calling, ain\u2019t nobody answering</p><p>Don\u2019t know why I bother singing, ain\u2019t nobody listening</p><p>\u201cDISCONNECT\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 10</p><p>Ever hear the one about that dog that spent its life chasing cars and finally caught one\u2014and had no idea what to do with it?</p><p>I\u2019m that dog.</p><p>Because here I am, alone with Mia Hall, something I\u2019ve fantasized about now for more than three years, and it\u2019s like, now what?</p><p>We\u2019re at the diner that was apparently her destination, some random place way over on the west side of town. \u201cIt has a parking lot,\u201d Mia tells me when we arrive.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d is all I can think to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never seen a Manhattan restaurant with a parking lot before, which is why I first stopped in. Then I noticed that all the cabbies ate here and cabbies are usually excellent judges of good food, but then I wasn\u2019t sure because there is a parking lot, and free parking is a hotter commodity than good, cheap food.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s babbling now. And I\u2019m thinking: Are we really talking about parking? When neither of us, as far as I can tell, owns a car here. I\u2019m hit again by how I don\u2019t know anything about her anymore, not the smallest detail.</p><p>The host takes us to a booth and Mia suddenly grimaces. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought you here. You probably never eat in places like this anymore.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, actually, not because I prefer darkened, overpriced, exclusive eateries but because those are the ones I get taken to and those are the ones I generally get left alone in. But this place is full of old grizzled New Yorkers and cabbies, no one who\u2019d recognize me. \u201cNo, this place is good,\u201d I say.</p><p>We sit down in a booth by the window, next to the vaunted parking lot. Two seconds later, a short, squat hairy guy is upon us. \u201cMaestro,\u201d he calls to Mia. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Stavros.\u201d</p><p>Stavros plops down our menus and turns to me. He raises a bushy eyebrow. \u201cSo, you finally bring your boyfriend for us to meet!\u201d</p><p>Mia goes scarlet and, even though there\u2019s something insulting in her being so embarrassed by being tagged as my girlfriend, there\u2019s something comforting in seeing her blush. This uncomfortable girl is more like the person I knew, the kind who would never have hushed conversations on cell phones.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old friend,\u201d Mia says.</p><p>Old friend? Is that a demotion or a promotion?</p><p>\u201cOld friend, huh? You never come in here with anyone before. Pretty, talented girl like you. Euphemia!\u201d he bellows. \u201cCome out here. The maestro has a fellow!\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s face has practically turned purple. When she looks up, she mouths: \u201cThe wife.\u201d</p><p>Out of the kitchen trundles the female equivalent of Stavros, a short, square-shaped woman with a face full of makeup, half of which seems to have melted onto her jowly neck. She wipes her hands on her greasy white apron and smiles at Mia, showing off a gold tooth. \u201cI knew it!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI knew you had a boyfriend you were hiding. Pretty girl like you. Now I see why you don\u2019t want to date my Georgie.\u201d</p><p>Mia purses her lips and raises her eyebrow at me; she gives Euphemia a faux-guilty smile. Caught me.</p><p>\u201cNow, come on, leave them be,\u201d Stavros interjects, swatting Euphemia on the hip and edging in front of her. \u201cMaestro, you want your usual?\u201d</p><p>Mia nods.</p><p>\u201cAnd your boyfriend?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia actually cringes, and the silence at the table lengthens like dead air you still sometimes hear on college radio stations. \u201cI\u2019ll have a burger, fries, and a beer,\u201d I say finally.</p><p>\u201cMarvelous,\u201d Stavros says, clapping his hands together like I\u2019ve just given him the cure for cancer. \u201cCheeseburger Deluxe. Side of onion rings. Your young man is too skinny. Just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never have healthy kids if you don\u2019t put some meat on your bones,\u201d Euphemia adds.</p><p>Mia cradles her head in her hands, as though she\u2019s literally trying to disappear into her own body. After they leave, she peeks up. \u201cGod, that was, just, awkward. Clearly, they didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they knew who you were. Wouldn\u2019t have pegged them as classical music buffs.\u201d Then I look down at my jeans, my black T-shirt, my beat-up sneaks. Once upon a time I\u2019d been a classical music fan, too, so there\u2019s no telling.</p><p>Mia laughs. \u201cOh, they\u2019re not. Euphemia knows me from playing in the subway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou busked in the subway? Times that tough?\u201d And then I realize what I just said and want to hit rewind. You don\u2019t ask someone like Mia if times are tough, even though I knew, financially, they weren\u2019t. Denny had taken out a supplemental life insurance policy in addition to the one he had through the teachers\u2019 union and that had left Mia pretty comfortable, although no one knew about the second policy right away. It was one of the reasons that, after the accident, a bunch of the musicians in town had played a series of benefit concerts and raised close to five thousand dollars for Mia\u2019s Juilliard fund. The outpouring had moved her grandparents\u2014and me, too\u2014but it had infuriated Mia. She\u2019d refused to take the donation, calling it blood money, and when her grandfather had suggested that accepting other people\u2019s generosity was itself an act of generosity that might help people in the community feel better, she\u2019d scoffed that it wasn\u2019t her job to make other people feel better.</p><p>But Mia just smiles. \u201cIt was a blast. And surprisingly lucrative. Euphemia saw me and when I came here to eat, she remembered me from the Columbus Circle station. She proudly informed me that she\u2019d put a whole dollar into my case.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s phone rings. We both stop to listen to the tinny melody. Beethoven plays on and on.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to get that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shakes her head, looking vaguely guilty.</p><p>No sooner does the ringing stop then it pipes up again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re popular tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much popular as in trouble. I was supposed to be at this dinner after the concert. Lots of bigwigs. Agents. Donors. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s either a Juilliard professor, someone from Young Concert Artists, or my management calling to yell at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Ernesto?\u201d I say as lightly as humanly possible. Because Stavros and Euphemia may have been on to something about Mia having some fancy-pants boyfriend\u2014one that she doesn\u2019t drag into Greek diners. He just isn\u2019t me.</p> <p>Mia looks uncomfortable again. \u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have people to talk to, or, you know, business to attend to, don\u2019t let me stand in your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I should just turn this off.\u201d She reaches into her bag and powers down the phone.</p><p>Stavros comes by with an iced coffee for Mia and a Budweiser for me and leaves another awkward pause in his wake.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I begin.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Mia repeats.</p><p>\u201cSo, you have a usual at this place. This like your regular spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come for the spanakopita and nagging. It\u2019s close to campus, so I used to come here a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Used to? For like the twentieth time tonight, I do the math. It\u2019s been three years since Mia left for Juilliard. That would make her a senior this fall. But she\u2019s playing Carnegie Hall? She has management? I\u2019m suddenly wishing I\u2019d paid more attention to that article.</p><p>\u201cWhy not anymore?\u201d My frustration echoes through the din.</p><p>Mia\u2019s face prickles up to attention, and a little caterpillar of anxiety bunches up above the bridge of her nose. \u201cWhat?\u201d she says quickly.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you still in school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she says, relief unfurling her brow. \u201cI should\u2019ve explained it before. I graduated in the spring. Juilliard has a three-year-degree option for . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirtuosos.\u201d I mean it as a compliment, but my annoyance at not having the baseball card on Mia Hall\u2014the stats, highlights, career bests\u2014turns it bitter.</p><p>\u201cGifted students,\u201d Mia corrects, almost apologetically. \u201cI graduated early so I can start touring sooner. Now, actually. It all starts now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We sit there in an awkward silence until Stavros arrives with the food. I didn\u2019t think I was hungry when we ordered, but as soon as I smell the burger, my stomach starts rumbling. I realize all I\u2019ve eaten today is a couple of hot dogs. Stavros lays down a bunch of plates in front of Mia, a salad, a spinach pie, French fries, rice pudding.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your regular?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI told you. I haven\u2019t eaten in two days. And you know how I much I can put away. Or knew, I mean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need anything, Maestro, you just holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Stavros.\u201d</p><p>After he leaves, we both kill a few minutes drowning our fries and the conversation in ketchup.</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d I begin.</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d she repeats. Then: \u201cHow\u2019s everyone. The rest of the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon. Or on their way.\u201d</p><p>Mia cocks her head to the side. \u201cI thought you said you were going tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I had to tie up some loose ends. Logistics and all that. So I\u2019m here an extra day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean . . . fortunate, because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have bumped into each other.\u201d</p><p>I look at her. Is she serious? Ten minutes ago she looked like she was about to have a coronary at the mere possibility of being my girlfriend, and now she\u2019s saying it\u2019s lucky I stalked her tonight. Or is this merely the polite small talk portion of the evening?</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s Liz? Is she still with Sarah?\u201d</p><p>Oh, it is the small talk interlude. \u201cOh yeah, going strong. They want to get married and have this big debate about whether to do it in a legal state like Iowa or wait for Oregon to legalize. All that trouble to tie the knot.\u201d I shake my head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to get married?\u201d she asks, a hint of challenge in her voice.</p><p>It\u2019s actually kind of hard to return her stare, but I force myself. \u201cNever,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, sounding almost relieved.</p><p>Don\u2019t panic, Mia. I wasn\u2019t gonna propose.</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Still in Oregon?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m in L.A. now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother rain refugee flees south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d No need to tell her how the novelty of being able to eat dinner outside in February wore off quickly, and how now the lack of seasons seems fundamentally wrong. I\u2019m like the opposite of those people who need to sit under sunlamps in the gloom of winter. In the middle of L.A.\u2019s sunny non-winter, I need to sit in a dark closet to feel right. \u201cI moved my parents down, too. The heat\u2019s better for my dad\u2019s arthritis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Gramps\u2019s arthritis is pretty bad, too. In his hip.\u201d</p><p>Arthritis? Could this be any more like a Christmascard update: And Billy finished swimming lessons, and Todd knocked up his girlfriend, and Aunt Louise had her bunions removed.</p><p>\u201cOh, that sucks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou know how he is. He\u2019s all stoic about it. In fact, he and Gran are gearing up to do a lot of traveling to visit me on the road, got themselves new passports. Gran even found a horticulture student to look after her orchids when she\u2019s away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how are your gran\u2019s orchids?\u201d I ask. Excellent. We\u2019ve moved on to flowers now.</p><p>\u201cStill winning prizes, so I guess they must be doing well.\u201d Mia looks down. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her greenhouse in a while. I haven\u2019t been back there since I came out here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m both surprised by this\u2014and not. It\u2019s like I knew it already, even though I thought that once I skipped town, Mia might return. Once again, I\u2019ve overestimated my importance.</p><p>\u201cYou should look them up sometime,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d be so happy to hear from you, to hear about how well you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>When I look up at her, she\u2019s peering at me from under a waterfall of hair, shaking her head in wonder. \u201cYeah, Adam, how amazing you\u2019re doing. I mean, you did it. You\u2019re a rock star!\u201d</p><p>Rock star. The words are so full of smoke and mirrors that it\u2019s impossible to find a real person behind them. But I am a rock star. I have the bank account of a rock star and the platinum records of a rock star and the girlfriend of a rock star. But I f**king hate that term, and hearing Mia pin it on me ups the level of my loathing to a new stratosphere.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any pictures of the rest of the band?\u201d she asks. \u201cOn your phone or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, pictures. I have a ton on my phone, but it\u2019s back at the hotel.\u201d Total bullshit but she\u2019ll never know. And if it\u2019s pictures she wants, I can just get her a copy of Spin at a corner newsstand.</p><p>\u201cI have some pictures. Mine are actual paper pictures because my phone is so ancient. I think I have some of Gran and Gramps, and oh, a great one of Henry and Willow. They brought their kids to visit me at the Marlboro Festival last summer,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBeatrix, or Trixie as they call her, remember their little girl? She\u2019s five now. And they had another baby, a little boy, Theo, named for Teddy.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Teddy\u2019s name, my gut seizes up. In the calculus of feelings, you never really know how one person\u2019s absence will affect you more than another\u2019s. I loved Mia\u2019s parents, but I could somehow accept their deaths. They\u2019d gone too soon, but in the right order\u2014parent before child\u2014though, not, I supposed, from the perspective of Mia\u2019s grandparents. But somehow I still can\u2019t wrap my head around Teddy staying eight years old forever. Every year I get older, I think about how old Teddy would be, too. He\u2019d be almost twelve now, and I see him in the face of every zitty adolescent boy who comes to our shows or begs an autograph.</p><p>I never told Mia about how much losing Teddy gutted me back when we were together, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna tell her now. I\u2019ve lost my right to discuss such things. I\u2019ve relinquished\u2014or been relieved of\u2014my seat at the Hall family table.</p><p>\u201cI took the picture last summer, so it\u2019s a little old, but you get the idea of how everyone looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>But Mia\u2019s already rooting through her bag. \u201cHenry still looks the same, like an overgrown kid. Where is my wallet?\u201d She heaves the bag onto the table.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see your pictures!\u201d My voice is as sharp as ice cracking, as loud as a parent\u2019s reprimand.</p><p>Mia stops her digging. \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d She looks chastened, slapped down. She zips her bag and slides it back into the booth, and in the process, knocks over my bottle of beer. She starts frantically grabbing at napkins from the dispenser to sop up the brew, like there\u2019s battery acid leaking over the table. \u201cDamn!\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019ve made a huge mess,\u201d Mia says breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou got most of it. Just call your buddy over and he\u2019ll get the rest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She continues to clean maniacally until she\u2019s emptied the napkin dispenser and used up every dry paper product in the vicinity. She balls up the soiled napkins and I think she\u2019s about to go at the tabletop with her bare arm, and I\u2019m watching the whole thing, slightly perplexed. Until Mia runs out of gas. She stops, hangs her head. Then she looks up at me with those eyes of hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I know the cool thing to do is say it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s no big deal, I didn\u2019t even get beer on me. But all of a sudden I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re talking about beer, and if we\u2019re not talking about beer, if Mia\u2019s issuing some stealth apology . . .</p><p>What are you sorry about, Mia?</p><p>Even if I could bring myself to ask that\u2014which I can\u2019t\u2014she\u2019s jumping out of the booth and running toward the bathroom to clean the beer off herself like she\u2019s Lady Macbeth.</p> <p>She\u2019s gone for a while, and as I wait the ambiguity she left in the booth curdles its way into the deepest part of me. Because I\u2019ve imagined a lot of scenarios over the last three years. Most of them versions of this all being some kind of Huge Mistake, a giant misunderstanding. And a lot of my fantasies involve the ways in which Mia grovels for my forgiveness. Apologizes for returning my love with the cruelty of her silence. For acting as though two years of life\u2014those two years of our lives\u2014amount to nothing.</p><p>But I always stop short of the fantasy of her apologizing for leaving. Because even though she might not know it, she just did what I told her she could do.</p><p>NINE</p><p>There were signs. Probably more of them than I ever caught, even after the fact. But I missed them all. Maybe because I wasn\u2019t looking for them. I was too busy checking over my shoulder at the fire I\u2019d just come through to pay much attention to the thousand-foot cliff looming in front of me.</p><p>When Mia had decided to go to Juilliard that fall, and when by late that spring it became clear that she\u2019d be able to, I\u2019d said I\u2019d go with her to New York. She\u2019d just given me this look, no way. \u201cThat was never on the table before,\u201d she said, \u201cso why should it be now?\u201d</p> <p>Because before you were a whole person but now you don\u2019t have a spleen. Or parents. Because New York might swallow you alive, I\u2019d thought. I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for both of us to get back to our lives,\u201d she continued. I\u2019d only been at the university part-time before but had just stopped going after the accident and now had a term\u2019s worth of incompletes. Mia hadn\u2019t been back to school, either. She\u2019d missed too much of it, and now she worked with a tutor to finish up her senior year classes so she could graduate and go to Juilliard on time. It was more going through the motions. Her teachers would pass her even if she never turned in another assignment.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the band?\u201d she asked. \u201cI know they\u2019re all waiting on you.\u201d Also true. Just before the accident, we\u2019d recorded a self-titled record on Smiling Simon, a Seattle-based independent label. The album had come out at the beginning of the summer, and even though we hadn\u2019t toured to support it, the CD had been selling up a storm, getting tons of play on college radio stations. As a result, Shooting Star now had major labels circling, all interested in signing a band that existed only in theory. \u201cYour poor guitar is practically dying of neglect,\u201d she said with a sad smile. It hadn\u2019t been out of its case since our aborted opening act for Bikini.</p><p>So, I agreed to the long-distance thing. In part because there was no arguing with Mia. In part because I really didn\u2019t want to quit Shooting Star. But also, I was kind of cocky about the distance. I mean, before I\u2019d been worried about what the continental divide would do to us. But now? What the hell could twenty-five hundred miles do to us now? And besides, Kim had accepted a spot at NYU, a few miles downtown from Juilliard. She\u2019d keep an eye on Mia.</p><p>Except, then Kim made a last-minute change and switched to Brandeis in Boston. I was furious about this. After the accident, we frequently had little chats about Mia\u2019s progress and passed along pertinent info to her grandparents. We kept our talks secret, knowing Mia would\u2019ve killed us had she thought we were conspiring. But Kim and I, we were like co-captains of Team Mia. If I couldn\u2019t move to New York with Mia, I felt Kim had a responsibility to stay near her.</p><p>I stewed about this for a while until one hot July night about a month before she and Mia were due to leave. Kim had come over to Mia\u2019s grandparents house to watch DVDs with us. Mia had gone to bed early so it was just the two of us finishing some pretentious foreign movie. Kim kept trying to talk to me about Mia, how well she was doing, and was jabbering over the film like a noisy parrot. I finally told her to shut up. Her eyes narrowed and she started gathering her stuff. \u201cI know what you\u2019re upset about and it\u2019s not this lame movie, so why don\u2019t you just yell at me about it already and get it over with,\u201d she said. Then she\u2019d burst out crying. I\u2019d never seen Kim cry, full-on like this, not even at the memorial service, so I\u2019d immediately felt like crap and apologized and sort of awkwardly hugged her.</p> <p>After she\u2019d finished sniveling, she\u2019d dried her eyes and explained how Mia had made her choose Brandeis. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s where I really want to go. After so long in Goyoregon, I really wanted to be at a Jewish school, but NYU was fine, and New York is plenty Jewish. But, she was fierce on this. She said she didn\u2019t want \u2018any more babysitting.\u2019 Those were her exact words. She swore that if I went to NYU, she\u2019d know it was because we\u2019d hatched a plan to keep an eye on her. She said she\u2019d cut ties with me. I told her I didn\u2019t believe her, but she had a look in her eye I\u2019d never seen. She was serious. So I did it. Do you know how many strings I had to pull to get my spot back this late in the game? Plus, I lost my tuition deposit at NYU. But whatever, it made Mia happy and not a lot does these days.\u201d Kim smiled ruefully. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s making me feel so miserable. Guilt, I guess. Religious hazard.\u201d Then she\u2019d started crying again.</p><p>Pretty loud sign. I guess I had my fingers in my ears.</p><p>But the end, when it finally came, was quiet.</p><p>Mia went to New York. I moved back to the House of Rock. I went back to school. The world didn\u2019t end. For the first couple of weeks, Mia and I sent each other these epic emails. Hers were all about New York, her classes, music, school. Mine were all about our record-label meetings. Liz had scheduled a bunch of gigs for us around Thanksgiving\u2014and we had some serious practicing to do before then, given that I hadn\u2019t picked up a guitar in months\u2014but, at Mike\u2019s insistence, we were seeing to business first. We were traveling to Seattle and L.A. and meeting label execs. Some A&amp;R guys from New York were coming out to Oregon to see us. I told Mia about the promises they made, how each of them said they\u2019d hone our sound and launch us to superstardom. All of us in the band tried to keep it in check, but it was hard not to inhale their stardust.</p><p>Mia and I also had a phone call check-in every night before she went to bed. She was usually pretty wiped so the conversations were short; a chance to hear one another\u2019s voice, to say I love you in real time.</p><p>One night about three weeks into the semester, I was a little late calling because we were meeting one of the A&amp;R reps for dinner at Le Pigeon in Portland and everything ran a little late. When my call went to voice mail, I figured she\u2019d already gone to sleep.</p><p>But the next day, there was no email from her. \u201cSorry I was late. U pissed @ me?\u201d I texted her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she texted right back. And I was relieved.</p> <p>But that night, I called on time, and that call went right to voice mail. And the next day, the email from Mia was a terse two sentences, something about orchestra getting very intense. So I justified it. Things were starting to heat up. She was at Juilliard, after all. Her cello didn\u2019t have WiFi. And this was Mia, the girl known to practice eight hours a day.</p><p>But then I started calling at different times, waking up early so I could get her before classes, calling during her dinnertime. And my calls kept going to voice mail, never getting returned. She didn\u2019t return my texts either. I was still getting emails, but not every day, and even though my emails were full of increasingly desperate questions\u2014\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you picking up your cell?\u201d \u201cDid you lose it? Are you okay?\u201d\u2014her responses glossed right over everything. She just claimed to be busy.</p><p>I decided to go visit her grandparents. I\u2019d pretty much lived with them for five months while Mia was recovering and had promised to visit frequently but I\u2019d reneged on that. I found it hard to be in that drafty old house with its photo gallery of ghosts\u2014a wedding portrait of Denny and Kat, a gut-wrenching shot of twelve-year-old Mia reading to Teddy on her lap\u2014without Mia beside me. But with Mia\u2019s contact dwindling, I needed answers.</p><p>The first time I went that fall, Mia\u2019s grandmother talked my ear off about the state of her garden and then went out to her greenhouse, leaving me to sit in the kitchen with her grandfather. He brewed us a strong pot of coffee. We didn\u2019t say much, so all you could hear was the crackling of the woodstove. He just looked at me in that quiet sad way that made me inexplicably want to kneel at the foot of his chair and put my head in his lap.</p><p>I went back a couple more times, even after Mia had cut off contact with me completely, and it was always like that. I felt kind of bad pretending that I was there on social calls when really I was hoping for some news, some explanation. No, what I was really hoping for was not to be the odd man out. I wanted them to say: \u201cMia has stopped calling us. Has she been in touch with you?\u201d But, of course, that never happened because that never would happen.</p><p>The thing was, I didn\u2019t need any confirmation from Mia\u2019s grandparents. I knew from that second night when my call went to voice mail, that it was the end of the line for me.</p><p>Because hadn\u2019t I told her? Hadn\u2019t I stood over her body and promised her that I\u2019d do anything if she stayed, even if it meant letting her go? The fact that she\u2019d been in a coma when I\u2019d said this, hadn\u2019t woken up for another three days, that neither of us had ever mentioned what I\u2019d said\u2014that seemed almost irrelevant. I\u2019d brought this on myself.</p><p>The thing I can\u2019t wrap my head around is how she did it. I\u2019ve never dumped a girl with such brutality. Even back when I did the groupie thing, I\u2019d always escort the girl du jour out of my hotel room or limo or whatever, give her a chaste kiss on the cheek and a \u201cThanks, that was a lot of fun,\u201d or something with a similar note of finality in it. And that was a groupie. Mia and I had been together for more than two years, and yes, it was a high-school romance, but it was still the kind of romance where I thought we were trying to find a way to make it forever, the kind that, had we met five years later and had she not been some cello prodigy and had I not been in a band on the rise\u2014or had our lives not been ripped apart by all this\u2014I was pretty sure it would\u2019ve been.</p><p>I\u2019ve come to realize there\u2019s a world of difference between knowing something happened, even knowing why it happened, and believing it. Because when she cut off contact, yeah, I knew what had happened. But it took me a long, long time to believe it.</p><p>Some days, I still don\u2019t quite believe it.</p><p>TEN</p><p>Barrel of the gun, rounds one two three</p><p>She says I have to pick: choose you, or choose me</p><p>Metal to the temple, the explosion is deafening</p><p>Lick the blood that covers me</p><p>She\u2019s the last one standing</p><p>\u201cROULETTE\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 11</p><p>After we leave the diner, I start to feel nervous. Because we bumped into each other. We did the polite thing and stuck around to catch up, so what\u2019s left except our good-byes? But I\u2019m not ready for that. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s not going to be another postscript with Mia, and I\u2019m gonna have to live on the fumes of tonight for the rest of my life, so I\u2019d like a little more to show for it than parking lots and arthritis and aborted apologies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which is why every block we walk that Mia doesn\u2019t hail a cab or make excuses and say good night feels like a stay of execution. In the sound of my footsteps slapping against the pavement, I can almost hear the word, reprieve, reprieve, echo through the city streets.</p><p>We walk in silence down a much-quieter, muchscummier stretch of Ninth Avenue. Underneath a dank overpass, a bunch of homeless guys camp out. One asks for some spare change. I toss him a ten. A bus goes by, blasting a cloud of diesel exhaust.</p><p>Mia points across the street. \u201cThat\u2019s the Port Authority Bus Terminal,\u201d she says.</p><p>I just nod, not sure if we\u2019re going to discuss bus stations with the same amount of detail we did parking lots, or if she\u2019s planning on sending me away.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bowling alley inside,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>\u201cIn the bus station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy right?!\u201d Mia exclaims, suddenly all animated. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when I found it either. I was coming home from visiting Kim in Boston late one night and got lost on the way out and there it was. It reminded me of Easter egg hunts. Do you remember how Teddy and I used to get about those?\u201d</p><p>I remember how Mia used to get. She\u2019d been a sucker for any holiday that had a candy association\u2014especially making it fun for Teddy. One Easter she\u2019d painstakingly hand-colored hard-boiled eggs and hidden them all over the yard for Teddy\u2019s hunt the next morning. But then it poured all night and all her colorful eggs had turned a mottled gray. Mia had been tearfully disappointed, but Teddy had practically peed himself with excitement\u2014the eggs, he declared, weren\u2019t Easter eggs; they were dinosaur eggs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone loves New York City for all these different reasons. The culture. The mix of people. The pace. The food. But for me, it\u2019s like one epic Easter egg hunt. You\u2019re always finding these little surprises around every corner. Like that garden. Like a bowling alley in a giant bus depot. You know\u2014\u201d She stops.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cYou probably have something going tonight. A club. An entourage to meet.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t do entourage, Mia.\u201d It comes out harder than I intended.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it as an insult. I just assumed all rock stars, celebrities, traveled with packs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop assuming. I\u2019m still me.\u201d Sort of.</p> <p>She looks surprised. \u201cOkay. So you don\u2019t have anywhere you need to be?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. Do you need to get to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do much of that these days. I can sleep on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d Mia kicks away a piece of trash with her toe, and I realize she\u2019s still nervous. \u201cLet\u2019s go on an urban Easter egg hunt.\u201d She pauses, searches my face to see if I know what she\u2019s talking about, and of course I know exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cI\u2019ll show you all the secret corners of the city that I love so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask her. And then as soon as I ask the question, I want to kick myself. You got your reprieve, now shut up! But part of me does want to know. If I\u2019m unclear why I went to her concert tonight, I\u2019m thoroughly confused as to why she called me to her, why I\u2019m still here.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d like to show you,\u201d she says simply. I stare at her, waiting for her to elaborate. Her brows knit as she tries to explain. Then she seems to give up. She just shrugs. After a minute she tries again: \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not exactly leaving New York, but I sort of am. I go to Japan tomorrow to do two concerts there and then one in Korea. And after that I come back to New York for a week and then I really start touring. I\u2019ll be on the road for maybe forty weeks a year, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much time for egg hunting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this would be like your farewell tour?\u201d Of New York? Of me?</p><p>A little late for me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of looking at it, I suppose,\u201d Mia replies.</p><p>I pause, as though I\u2019m actually considering this, as though I\u2019m weighing my options, as though the RSVP to her invitation is in question. Then I shrug, put on a good show, \u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m still a little iffy about the bus station, so I put on my shades and cap before we go inside. Mia leads me through an orange-tiled hall, the aroma of pine disinfectant not quite masking the smell of piss, and up a series of escalators, past shuttered newsstands and fastfood restaurants, up more escalators to a neon sign blaring LEISURE TIME BOWL.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d she says shyly, proudly. \u201cAfter I found it by accident, I made a habit of peeking in any time I was in the station. And then I started coming here just to hang out. Sometimes I sit at the bar and order nachos and watch people bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not bowl yourself?\u201d</p><p>Mia tilts her head to the side, then taps her elbow.</p><p>Ahh, her elbow. Her Achilles\u2019 heel. One of the few parts of her body that, it seemed, hadn\u2019t been hurt in the accident, hadn\u2019t been encased in plaster or put together with pins or stitches or touched by skin grafts. But when she\u2019d started playing cello again in that mad attempt to catch up with herself, her elbow had started to hurt. X-rays were taken. MRIs done. The doctors couldn\u2019t find anything wrong, told her it might be a bad bruise or a contused nerve, and suggested she ease off the practicing, which had set Mia off. She said if she couldn\u2019t play, she had nothing left. What about me? I remember thinking, but never saying. Anyhow, she\u2019d ignored the doctors and played through the pain and either it had gotten better or she\u2019d gotten used to it.</p><p>\u201cI tried to get some people from Juilliard to come down a few times, but they weren\u2019t into it. But it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s the place I love. How it\u2019s totally secreted away up here. I don\u2019t need to bowl to appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>So your Garden-of-Eden boyfriend is too highbrow for greasy diners and bowling alleys, huh?</p><p>Mia and I used to go bowling, sometimes the two of us, other times with her whole family. Kat and Denny had been big bowlers, part of Denny\u2019s whole retro thing. Even Teddy could hit an eighty. Like it or not, Mia Hall, you have a bit of grunge twined into your DNA, thanks to your family. And, maybe, thanks to me.</p><p>\u201cWe could go bowling now,\u201d I suggest.</p><p>Mia smiles at the offer. Then taps her elbow again. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bowl,\u201d I explain. \u201cI\u2019ll bowl. You can watch. Just for you to get the whole effect. Or I can even bowl for both of us. It seems like you should have one game here. This being your farewell tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d And it\u2019s the surprise in her voice that gets to me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not? I haven\u2019t been bowling in ages.\u201d This isn\u2019t entirely true. Bryn and I went bowling a few months ago for some charity thing. We paid twenty thousand bucks to rent a lane for an hour for some worthy cause and then we didn\u2019t even bowl; just drank champagne while Bryn schmoozed. I mean who drinks champagne at a bowling alley?</p><p>Inside Leisure Time, it smells like beer\u2014and wax and hot dogs and shoe disinfectant. It\u2019s what a bowling alley should smell like. The lanes are full of an unusually unattractive grouping of New Yorkers who actually seem to be bowling for the sake of bowling. They don\u2019t look twice at us; they don\u2019t even look once at us. I book us a lane and rent us each a pair of shoes. Full treatment here.</p><p>Mia\u2019s practically giddy as she tries hers on, doing a little soft-shoe as she selects a ladies\u2019 pink eight-pounder for me to bowl with on her behalf.</p><p>\u201cWhat about names?\u201d Mia asks.</p><p>Back in the day, we always went for musicians; she\u2019d choose an old-school punk female singer and I\u2019d pick a male classical musician. Joan and Frederic. Or Debbie and Ludwig.</p><p>\u201cYou pick,\u201d I say, because I\u2019m not exactly sure how much of the past we\u2019re supposed to be reliving. Until I see the names she inputs. And then I almost fall over. Kat and Denny.</p><p>When she sees my expression she looks embarrassed. \u201cThey liked to bowl, too,\u201d she hastily explains, quickly changing the names to Pat and Lenny. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d she asks a little too cheerfully</p><p>Two letters away from morbid, I think. My hand is shaking again as I step up to the lane with \u201cPat\u2019s\u201d pink ball, which might explain why I only knock down eight pins. Mia doesn\u2019t care. She squeals with delight. \u201cA spare will be mine,\u201d she yells. Then catches her outburst and looks down at her feet. \u201cThanks for renting me the shoes. Nice touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come nobody recognizes you here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a context thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can take off your sunglasses. It\u2019s kind of hard talking to you in them.\u201d</p><p>I forgot that I still had them on and feel stupid for it, and stupid for having to wear them in the first place. I take them off.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Mia says. \u201cI don\u2019t get why classical musicians think bowling is white trash. It\u2019s so fun.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why this little Juilliard-snobs-versus-the-rest-of-us should make me feel a little digging thrill, but it does. I knock down the remaining two of Mia\u2019s pins. She cheers, loudly.</p><p>\u201cDid you like it? Juilliard?\u201d I ask. \u201cWas it everything you thought it\u2019d be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, and again, I feel this strange sense of victory. Until she elaborates. \u201cIt was more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t start out that way, though. It was pretty rocky at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not surprising, you know, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the problem. \u2018All things considered.\u2019 Too many things considered. When I first got there, it was like everywhere else; people were very considerate. My roommate was so considerate that she couldn\u2019t look at me without crying.\u201d</p><p>The Over-Empathizer\u2014her I remember. I got cut off a few weeks into her.</p><p>\u201cAll my roommates were drama queens. I changed so many times the first year before I finally moved out of the dorms. Do you know I\u2019ve lived in eleven different places here? I think that must be some kind of record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it practice for being on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like being on the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Getting to see all those different countries. I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I get to see is the hotel and the venue and the blur of the countryside from the window of a tour bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever sightsee?\u201d</p><p>The band does. They go out on these private VIP tours, hit the Rome Colosseum before it\u2019s open to the public and things like that. I could tag along, but it would mean going with the band, so I just wind up holed up in my hotel. \u201cThere\u2019s not usually time,\u201d I lie. \u201cSo you were saying, you had roommate issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mia continues. \u201cSympathy overload. It was like that with everyone, including the faculty, who were all kind of nervous around me, when it should\u2019ve been the opposite. It\u2019s kind of a rite of passage when you first take orchestra to have your playing deconstructed\u2014basically picked apart\u2014in front of everyone. And it happened to everybody. Except me. It was like I was invisible. Nobody dared critique me. And trust me, it wasn\u2019t because my playing was so great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was,\u201d I say. I edge closer, dry my hands over the blower.</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t. One of the courses you have to take when you first start is String Quartet Survey. And one of the profs is this guy Lemsky. He\u2019s a bigwig in the department. Russian. Imagine every cruel stereotype you can think of, that\u2019s him. Mean, shriveled-up little man. Straight out of Dostoyevsky. My dad would\u2019ve loved him. After a few weeks, I get called into his office. This is not usually a happy sign. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s sitting behind this messy wooden desk, with papers and sheet music piled high. And he starts telling me about his family. Jews in the Ukraine. Lived through pogroms. Then through World War II. Then he says, \u2018Everyone has hardship in their life. Everyone has pain. The faculty here will coddle you because of what you went through. I, however, am of the opinion if we do that, that car crash might as well have killed you, too, because we will smother your talent. Do you want us to do that?\u2019</p><p>\u201cAnd, I didn\u2019t know how to respond, so I just stood there. And then he yelled at me: \u2018Do you? Do you want us to smother you?\u2019 And I manage to eke out a \u2018no.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Good.\u2019 Then he picks up his baton and sort of flicks me out with it.\u201d</p><p>I can think of places I\u2019d like to stick that guy\u2019s baton. I grab my ball and hurl it down the lane. It hits the pin formation with a satisfying thwack; the pins go flying in every direction, like little humans fleeing Godzilla. When I get back to Mia, I\u2019m calmer.</p><p>\u201cNice one,\u201d she says at the same time I say, \u201cYour professor sounds like a dick!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue, he\u2019s not the most socially graced. And I was freaked out at the time, but looking back I think that was one of the most important days of my life. Because he was the first person who didn\u2019t just give me a pass.\u201d</p><p>I turn, glad to have a reason to walk away from her so she can\u2019t see the look on my face. I throw her pink ball down the lane, but the torque is off and it veers to the right. I get seven down and the remaining three are split. I only pick off one more on my next go. To even things up, I purposely blow my next frame, knocking down six pins.</p><p>\u201cSo, a few days later, in orchestra,\u201d Mia continues, \u201cmy glissando gets taken apart, and not very kindly.\u201d She grins, awash in happy memories of her humiliation.</p><p>\u201cNothing like a public flogging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!? It was great. It was like the best therapy in the world.\u201d</p> <p>I look at her. \u201cTherapy\u201d was once a forbidden word. Mia had been assigned a grief counselor in the hospital and rehab but had refused to continue seeing anyone once she\u2019d come home, something Kim and I had argued against. But Mia had claimed that talking about her dead family an hour a week wasn\u2019t therapeutic.</p><p>\u201cOnce that happened, it was like everyone else on the faculty relaxed around me,\u201d she tells me. \u201cLemsky rode me extra hard. No time off. No life that wasn\u2019t cello. Summers I played festivals. Aspen. Then Marlboro. Then Lemsky and Ernesto both pushed me to audition for the Young Concert Artists program, which was insane. It makes getting into Juilliard look like a cakewalk. But I did it. And I got in. That\u2019s why I was at Carnegie tonight. Twenty-year-olds don\u2019t normally play recitals at Zankel Hall. And that\u2019s just thrown all these doors wide open. I have management now. I have agents interested in me. And that\u2019s why Lemsky pushed for early graduation. He said I was ready to start touring, though I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I heard tonight, he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Her face is suddenly so eager, so young, it almost hurts. \u201cDo you really think so? I\u2019ve been playing recitals and festivals, but this will be different. This will be me on my own, or soloing for a few nights with an orchestra or a quartet or a chamber music ensemble.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cSome days I think I should just find a permanent position in an orchestra, have some continuity. Like you have with the band. It has to be such a comfort to always be with Liz, Mike, and Fitzy.\u201d The stage changes, but the players stay the same.</p><p>I think of the band, on an airplane as we speak, speeding across the Atlantic\u2014an ocean, the least of the things, dividing us now. And then I think of Mia, of the way she played the Dvo?\u00e1k, of what all the people in the theater were saying after she left the stage. \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t do that. That would be a waste of your talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like Lemsky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Mia laughs. \u201cOh, I know he comes across as such a hard-ass, but I suspect deep down he\u2019s doing this because he thinks by giving me a shot at a career, he\u2019ll help fill some void.\u201d</p><p>Mia stops and turns to me, her eyes dead on mine, searching, reaching. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t have to give me the career. That\u2019s not what fills the void. You understand that, right? You always understood that.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, all the shit from the day comes ricocheting back\u2014Vanessa and Bryn and the bump watches and Shuffle and the looming sixty-seven days of separate hotels and awkward silences and playing shows with a band behind me that no longer has my back.</p><p>And it\u2019s like, Mia, don\u2019t you get it? The music is the void. And you\u2019re the reason why.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Shooting Star had always been a band with a code\u2014feelings first, business second\u2014so I hadn\u2019t given the band much thought, hadn\u2019t considered their feelings, or their resentments, about my extended leave. I figured they\u2019d get my absence without my having to explain.</p><p>After I came out of my haze and wrote those first ten songs, I called Liz, who organized a band dinner/meeting. During dinner, we sat around the Club Table\u2014so named because Liz had taken this fugly 1970s wooden dining table we\u2019d found on the curb and covered it with band flyers and about a thousand layers of lacquer to resemble the inside of a club. First, I apologized for going MIA. Then I pulled out my laptop and played them recordings of the new stuff I\u2019d been writing. Liz\u2019s and Fitzy\u2019s eyes went wide. They dangled vegetable lasagna in front of their mouths as they listened to track after track: \u201cBridge,\u201d \u201cDust,\u201d \u201cStitch,\u201d \u201cRoulette,\u201d \u201cAnimate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDude, we thought you were just packing it in, working some crap-ass job and pining, but you\u2019ve been productive,\u201d Fitzy exclaimed. \u201cThis shit rocks.\u201d</p><p>Liz nodded. \u201cIt does. And it\u2019s beautiful, too. It must have been cathartic,\u201d she said, reaching over to squeeze my hand. \u201cI\u2019d love to read the lyrics. Do you have them on your computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrawled on paper at home. I\u2019ll transcribe them and email them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome? Isn\u2019t this home?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cYour room is an untouched museum. Why don\u2019t you move back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much to move. Unless you sold my stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe tried. Too dusty. No takers,\u201d Fitzy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been using your bed as a hat rack, though.\u201d Fitzy shot me a wiseass grin. I\u2019d made the mistake of telling him how I\u2019d thought I was turning into my dead grandfather, with all his weird superstitions, like his vehement belief that hats on beds bring bad luck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll burn sage,\u201d Liz said. Clearly Fitzy had alerted the media.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, that\u2019s it?\u201d Mike said, tapping his nails against my laptop.</p><p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s ten songs,\u201d Fitzy said, a piece of spinach in his giant grin. \u201cTen insanely good songs. That\u2019s practically an album. We already have enough to go into the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are just the ones that are done,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ve got at least ten more coming. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re just kinda flowing out of me right now, like they\u2019re already written and recorded and someone just pressed play. I\u2019m getting it all out as fast I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObey the muse,\u201d Liz said. \u201cShe\u2019s a fickle mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the songs,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if there will be any album. If any of the labels will still want us. We had all this forward momentum and he basically killed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill anything,\u201d Liz said. \u201cFor one, it\u2019s only been a few months, and second of all, our Smiling Simon album has been ripping up the indie charts, getting tons of play on the college stations. And I\u2019ve been working the college angle pretty well,\u201d Liz continued, \u201cwith interviews and all, to keep the embers burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dude, \u2018Perfect World\u2019 has even crossed over; it\u2019s getting play on satellite radio stations,\u201d Fitzy said. \u201cI\u2019m sure all those A&amp;R guys will be happy to see us, shitting bricks to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThey have their trends. Quotas. The outfits they want. And my point is, he\u201d\u2014he jabbed a finger at me\u2014\u201cditches the band without a word and just waltzes back like it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Mike had a point, but it wasn\u2019t like I held anyone back. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. We all go off the cliff sometimes. But you could\u2019ve replaced me if you\u2019d wanted to. Gotten a new guitar player and your major-label deal.\u201d</p><p>By the quick look that passed among the three of them, I could see that this option had been discussed, and likely vetoed by Liz. Shooting Star was a democratic outfit; we\u2019d always made decisions together. But when it came down to it, the band was Liz\u2019s. She started it and recruited me to play guitar after seeing me play around town. Then she\u2019d lassoed Fitzy and Mike, so ultimately a personnel change would\u2019ve been her call. Maybe this was why Mike had started playing gigs with another drummer under the name of Ranch Hand.</p><p>\u201cMike, I don\u2019t get what you want out of this,\u201d Fitzy said. \u201cDo you want a box of chocolates? Do you want Adam to get you a nice bouquet to say sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiss off, Fitz,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you flowers,\u201d I offered. \u201cYellow roses. I believe those symbolize friendship. Whatever it takes, I\u2019ll do what I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that make it good?\u201d Fitzy continued. \u201cBecause what the f**k, man? We have these amazing songs. I wish I\u2019d written those songs. But Adam did. He came through. And we have him back. So maybe now we can get back to making kick-ass music and see where it takes us. And maybe, you know, let our kid get a little joy back in his life. So, dude. Bygones.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s worries turned out to be unfounded. Some of the major labels that had been courting us in the fall had cooled on us, but a handful were still interested, and when we sent them the demos of the songs that would become Collateral Damage they went ballistic, and we were signed and in the studio with Gus before we knew it.</p><p>And for a while, things were good. Fitzy and Liz were both right. Recording Collateral Damage was cathartic. And there was joy. Working with Gus was intense; he brought out the noise in us, told us not to be scared of our raw power, and we all ran with it. And it was cool being up in Seattle recording and staying in a corporate apartment and feeling like The Shit. Everything seemed good.</p><p>Not long after the record came out, the tour started. A five-month slog through North America, Europe, and Asia that, at the outset, seemed like the most exciting thing in the world. And in the beginning, it was. But it was also grueling. And soon I was tired all the time. And lonely. There was a lot of empty time in which to miss her. I kind of holed away in my hotel rooms, the backs of tour buses. I pushed everyone away. Even Liz. Especially Liz. She wasn\u2019t stupid; she knew what was going on\u2014and why. And she wasn\u2019t some fragile flower, either. She kept after me. So I burrowed, until, I guess, she got tired of trying to dig me out.</p><p>As the tour went on, the album just started going haywire. Platinum. Then double-platinum. The tour dates sold out, so our promoters added additional ones to meet demand. The merchandising deals were everywhere. Shooting Star T-shirts, caps, posters, stickers, even a special-edition Shooting Star telescope. Suddenly, the press was all over us. Interviews all the time, which was flattering at first. People cared enough about us to read what we had to say.</p><p>But a weird thing started to happen in interviews. The reporter would sit the band down together, ask some perfunctory questions to us all, and then turn the microphone or camera on me. And I tried to open it up to the rest of the band. That\u2019s when reporters started requesting interviews with just me, a request I uniformly turned down, until it suddenly became impossible for us to do interviews any other way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>About four months into the tour, we were in Rome. Rolling Stone had sent a reporter to spend a few days with us. One night, after a show, we were closing the hotel bar. It was a pretty mellow scene and we were sitting around, decompressing, pounding grappa. But then the reporter starts firing away with all these heavy-duty questions. All to me. I mean, there were about a dozen of us in there\u2014me, Liz, Fitzy, Mike, Aldous, some roadies, some groupies\u2014but this guy was acting like I was the only person in the room. \u201cAdam, do you see Collateral Damage as having a single narrative? If so, can you elaborate on it?\u201d \u201cAdam, do think this record represents your growth as a songwriter?\u201d \u201cAdam, you\u2019ve mentioned in other interviews you don\u2019t want to go down \u2018that dark rock star path,\u2019 but how do you keep from suffocating on your own fumes?\u201d</p><p>Mike just lost it. \u201cYou hijacked the band!\u201d he screamed at me, like it was just the two of us in a room, like there wasn\u2019t a reporter right there. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just the Adam Wilde Show, you know. We\u2019re a band. A unit. There are four of us. Or did you forget that, on your way down the \u2018dark rock star path?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Mike turned to the reporter. \u201cYou wanna know about the illustrious Adam Wilde? I\u2019ve got some choice details. Like our rock star over here has to do this crazy voodoo shit before each show and is such a prima donna that if you whistle backstage before a show he has a tantrum because of the bad luck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, come on,\u201d Liz interrupted sharply. \u201cAll artists have their rituals.\u201d</p> <p>The reporter, meanwhile, was scribbling away, eating all this up until Aldous diplomatically said that everyone was tired and shooed everyone but the band out of the bar and tried to get me and Mike to make nice. But then Mike just let loose for round two of insults, telling me what a spotlight-hogging ass**le I\u2019d become. I looked over at Liz to come to my defense again, but she was staring intently at her drink. So I turned to Fitzy, but he just shook his head. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be the one to say this, but grow up, you two.\u201d Then he left. I looked pleadingly at Liz. She looked sympathetic, but tired. \u201cMike, you were out of line in there,\u201d she said flatly. But then she turned to me and shook her head. \u201cBut, Adam, come on. You\u2019ve got to try to see it from his perspective. From all of ours. It\u2019s tough to be big about this, especially when you\u2019ve retreated from us. I get why you have, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier.\u201d</p><p>All of them\u2014they were all against me. I waved my hands in surrender. I ran out of the bar, strangely close to tears. In the lobby, this Italian model named Rafaella, who\u2019d been hanging with us, was waiting for a taxi. She smiled when she saw me. When her taxi came, she gestured with her head, inviting me inside. And I went. The next day, I checked into a different hotel from the band.</p><p>The story hit RollingStone.com almost immediately and the tabloids a few days later. Our label freaked, as did our tour promoters, all of whom warned of the various forms of hell there would be to pay if we didn\u2019t honor our concert commitments. Aldous flew in a professional mediator to talk to me and Mike. She was useless. Her genius idea, a legacy that continues to this day, is what Fitzy refers to as \u201cThe Divorce.\u201d I would continue to stay at one hotel for the remainder of the tour, the rest of the band at another. And our publicists decided it was safer to keep me and Mike separate in interviews, so now reporters often talk to me solo. Yeah, those changes have helped a lot!</p><p>When I got back from the Collateral Damage tour, I almost quit the band. I moved out of the house I\u2019d been sharing with Fitzy in Portland and into my own place. I avoided those guys. I was angry, but also ashamed. I wasn\u2019t sure how, but I\u2019d clearly ruined everything. I might\u2019ve just let the run end there, but Liz stopped by my new place one afternoon and asked me to just give it a few months\u2019 breathing space and see how I felt. \u201cAnyone would be going a little nuts after the couple years we\u2019ve had, especially the couple of years you\u2019ve had,\u201d she\u2019d said, which was about as much as we acknowledged Mia. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to do anything. I\u2019m just asking you to not do anything and see how you feel in a few months.\u201d</p><p>Then the album started winning all these awards, and then I met Bryn and moved to L.A. and didn\u2019t have to deal with them much, so I just wound up getting sucked in for another round.</p> <p>Bryn\u2019s the only person who knows how close to the edge that tour pushed me, and how badly I\u2019ve been dreading this upcoming one. \u201cCut them loose,\u201d is her solution. She thinks I have some sort of guilt complex, coming from humble origins and all, and that\u2019s why I won\u2019t go solo. \u201cLook, I get it. It\u2019s hard to accept that you deserve the acclaim, but you do. You write all the songs and most of the music and that\u2019s why you get all the attention,\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re the talent! Not just some pretty face. If this were a movie, you\u2019d be the twenty-million-dollar star and they\u2019d be the supporting players, but instead you all get an equal split,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need them. Especially with all the grief they give you.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s not about the money. It never has been. And going solo doesn\u2019t seem like much of a solution. It would just be out of the frying pan and into the fire. And there\u2019d still be touring to contend with, the thought of which has been making me physically sick.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call Dr. Weisbluth?\u201d Bryn suggested on the phone from Toronto, where she was wrapping her latest film. Weisbluth\u2019s the psychopharmacologist the label had hooked me up with a few months earlier. \u201cSee if he can give you something a little stronger. And when you get back, we need to have a sit-down with Brooke and seriously talk about you going solo. But you have to get through this tour. You\u2019ll blow your reputation otherwise.\u201d</p><p>There are worse things to blow than your reputation, aren\u2019t there? That\u2019s what I thought. But I didn\u2019t say it. I just called Weisbluth, got some more scripts, and steeled myself for the tour. I guess Bryn understood, like I understood, like everyone who knew me understood, that in spite of his bad-boy rep, Adam Wilde does as he\u2019s told.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>There\u2019s a piece of lead where my heart should beat</p> <p>Doctor said too dangerous to take out</p><p>You\u2019d better just leave it be</p><p>Body grew back around it, a miracle, praise be</p><p>Now, if only I could get through airport security</p><p>\u201cBULLET\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 12</p><p>Mia doesn\u2019t tell me what the next destination is. Says because it\u2019s her secret New York tour, it should be a secret and then proceeds to lead me out of Port Authority down, down, down into a warren of subway tunnels.</p><p>And I follow her. Even though I don\u2019t like secrets, even though I think that Mia and I have enough secrets between the two of us at this point, and even though the subway is like the culmination of all my fears. Enclosed spaces. Lots of people. No escape. I sort of mention this to her, but she throws back what I said earlier in the bowling alley about context. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be expecting Adam Wilde on the subway at three in the morning? Without an entourage?\u201d She gives me a joking smile. \u201cBesides, it should be dead at this hour. And in my New York, I always take the train.\u201d</p> <p>When we reach the Times Square subway station, the place is so crowded that it might as well be five P.M. on a Thursday. My warning bell starts to ping. Even more so once we get to the thronged platform. I stiffen and back toward one of the pillars. Mia gives me a look. \u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d I mumble, but my worries are drowned out by the oncoming train.</p><p>\u201cThe trains don\u2019t run often at night, so it must be that everyone\u2019s been waiting for a while,\u201d Mia shouts over the clatter. \u201cBut here comes one now, so look, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>When we get on the N, we both see that Mia\u2019s wrong. The car\u2019s packed with people. Drunk people.</p><p>I feel the itchiness of eyes on me. I know I\u2019m out of pills, but I need a cigarette. Now. I reach for my pack.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t smoke on the train,\u201d Mia whispers.</p><p>\u201cI need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d If I get arrested, at least I\u2019d be in the safety of police custody.</p><p>Suddenly, she goes all Vulcan. \u201cIf the purpose is to not call attention to yourself, don\u2019t you think that perhaps lighting up is counterproductive?\u201d She pulls me into a corner. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she croons, and I half expect her to caress my neck like she used to do when I\u2019d get tense. \u201cWe\u2019ll just hang out here. If it doesn\u2019t empty out at Thirty-fourth Street, we\u2019ll get off.\u201d</p><p>At Thirty-fourth, a bunch of people do get off, and I feel a little better. At Fourteenth more people get off. But then suddenly at Canal, our car fills up with a group of hipsters. I angle myself into the far end of the train, near the conductor\u2019s booth, so my back is to the riders.</p><p>It\u2019s hard for most people to understand how freaked out I get by large crowds in small contained spaces now. I think it would be hard for the me of three years ago to understand. But that me never had the experience of minding his own business at a small record shop in Minneapolis when one guy recognized me and shouted out my name and it was like watching popcorn kernels in hot oil: First one went, then another, then an explosion of them, until all these sedate record-store slackers suddenly became a mob, surrounding me, then tackling me. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>It sucks because I like the fans when I meet them individually, I do. But get a group of them together and this swarm instinct takes over and they seem to forget that you\u2019re a mere mortal: flesh and bone, bruisable and scareable.</p><p>But we seem okay in the corner. Until I make the fatal mistake of doing just one final check over my shoulder to make sure no one\u2019s looking at me. And in that little quarter second, it happens. I catch someone\u2019s eye. I feel the recognition ignite like a match. I can almost smell the phosphorus in the air. Then everything seems to happen in slow motion. First, I hear it. It goes unnaturally quiet. And then there\u2019s a low buzz as the news travels. I hear my name, in stage whispers, move across the noisy train. I see elbows nudged. Cell phones reached for, bags grabbed, forces rallied, legs shuffling. None of this takes longer than a few seconds, but it\u2019s always agonizing, like the moments when a first punch is thrown but hasn\u2019t yet connected. One guy with a beard is preparing to step out of his seat, opening his mouth to call my name. I know he means me no harm, but once he outs me, the whole train will be on me. Thirty seconds till all hell breaks loose.</p><p>I grab Mia\u2019s arm and yank.</p><p>\u201cOww!\u201d</p><p>I have the door between subway cars open and we\u2019re pushing into the next car.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she says, flailing behind me</p><p>I\u2019m not listening. I\u2019m pulling her into another car then another until the train slows into a station and then I\u2019m tugging her out of the train, onto the platform, up the stairs, taking them two at a time, some part of my brain vaguely warning me that I\u2019m being too rough but the other part not giving a shit. Once up on the street, I pull her along for a few blocks until I\u2019m sure no one is following us. Then I stop.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to get us killed?\u201d she yells.</p><p>I feel a bolt of guilt shoot through me. But I throw the bolt right back at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, what about you? Are you trying to get me attacked by a mob?\u201d</p><p>I look down and realize that I\u2019m still holding her hand. Mia looks, too. I let go.</p><p>\u201cWhat mob, Adam?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>She\u2019s talking to me like I\u2019m a crazy person now. Just like Aldous talks to me when I have one of my panic attacks. But at least Aldous would never accuse me of fantasizing a fan attack. He\u2019s seen it happen too many times.</p><p>\u201cI got recognized down there,\u201d I mutter, walking away from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia hesitates for a second, then skitters to catch up. \u201cNobody knew it was you.\u201d</p><p>Her ignorance\u2014the luxury of that ignorance!</p><p>\u201cThe whole car knew it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Adam?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I talking about? I\u2019m talking about having photographers camped out in front of my house. I\u2019m talking about not having gone record shopping in almost two years. I\u2019m talking about not being able to take a walk without feeling like a deer on the opening day of hunting season. I\u2019m talking about every time I have a cold, it showing up in a tabloid as a coke habit.\u201d</p><p>I look at her there in the shadows of the shut-down city, her hair falling onto her face, and I can see her trying to figure out if I\u2019ve lost it. And I have to fight the urge to take her by the shoulders and slam her against a shuttered building until we feel the vibrations ringing through both of us. Because I suddenly want to hear her bones rattle. I want to feel the softness of her flesh give, to hear her gasp as my hip bone jams into her. I want to yank her head back until her neck is exposed. I want to rip my hands through her hair until her breath is labored. I want to make her cry and then lick up the tears. And then I want to take my mouth to hers, to devour her alive, to transmit all the things she can\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit! Where the hell are you taking me anyway?\u201d The adrenaline thrumming through me turns my voice into a growl.</p><p>Mia looks taken aback. \u201cI told you. I\u2019m taking you to my secret New York haunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m a little over secrets. Do you mind telling me where we\u2019re going. Is that too much to f**king ask?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrist, Adam, when did you become such a . . .\u201d</p><p>Egomaniac? Asshole? Narcissist? I could fill in the blank with a million words. They\u2019ve all been said before.</p><p>\u201c. . . guy?\u201d Mia finishes.</p><p>For a second, I almost laugh. Guy? That\u2019s the best she\u2019s got? It reminds me of the story my parents tell about me, how when I was a little kid and would get angry, I\u2019d get so worked up and then curse them out by going \u201cYou, you, you . . . piston!\u201d like it was the worst thing ever.</p><p>But then I remember something else, an old conversation Mia and I had late one night. She and Kim had this habit of categorizing everything into diametric categories, and Mia was always announcing a new one. One day she told me that they\u2019d decided that my gender was divvied into two neat piles\u2014Men and Guys. Basically, all the saints of the world: Men. The jerks, the players, the wet T-shirt contest aficionados? They were Guys. Back then, I was a Man.</p><p>So I\u2019m a Guy now? A Guy! I allow my hurt to show for half a second. Mia\u2019s looking at me with confusion, but not remembering a thing.</p> <p>Whoever said that the past isn\u2019t dead had it backward. It\u2019s the future that\u2019s already dead, already played out. This whole night has been a mistake. It\u2019s not going to let me rewind. Or unmake the mistakes I\u2019ve made. Or the promises I\u2019ve made. Or have her back. Or have me back.</p><p>Something\u2019s changed in Mia\u2019s face. Some type of recognition has clicked on. Because she\u2019s explaining herself, how she called me a guy because guys always need to know the plan, the directions, and how she\u2019s taking me on the Staten Island Ferry, which isn\u2019t really a secret but it\u2019s something few Manhattanites ever do, which is a shame because there\u2019s this amazing view of the Statue of Liberty and on top of that, the ferry is free and nothing in New York is free, but if I\u2019m worried about crowds we can forget it, but we can also just check it out and if it\u2019s not empty\u2014and she\u2019s pretty sure it will be this time of night\u2014we can get right back off before it leaves.</p><p>And I have no idea if she remembered that conversation about the Man/Guy distinction or not, but it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Because she\u2019s right. I am a Guy now. And I can peg the precise night I turned into one.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>The groupies started showing up right away. Or maybe they\u2019d always been there and I just hadn\u2019t noticed. But as soon as we started touring, they were buzzing about like hummingbirds dipping their beaks into spring flowers.</p><p>One of the first things we did after we signed with the label was hire Aldous to manage us. Collateral Damage was due to come out in September, and the label planned a modest tour in the late fall, but Aldous had different ideas.</p><p>\u201cYou guys need to get your sea legs back,\u201d Aldous said when we finished mixing the album. \u201cYou need to get back on the road.\u201d</p><p>So right as the album came out, Aldous booked us a series of ten tour dates up and down the West Coast, in clubs we\u2019d played in before, to reconnect with our fan base\u2014or to remind them that we still existed\u2014and to get comfortable playing in front of an audience again.</p> <p>The label rented us a nice Econoline van, tricked out with a bed in the back, and a trailer to haul our gear, but other than that when we set out, it didn\u2019t feel that different from the shows we\u2019d always played.</p><p>It was completely different.</p><p>For one, right away and for whatever reason, \u201cAnimate\u201d was breaking out as a hit single. Even over the course of the two-week tour, its momentum was building and as that happened, you could feel it in every consecutive show we played. They went from well-attended to packed to sold-out to lines around the corner to fire marshals showing up. All in a matter of two weeks.</p><p>And the energy. It was like a live wire, like everyone at the shows knew we were right there on the verge and they wanted to be a part of it, a part of our history. It was like we were all in on this secret together. Maybe that\u2019s why these were the best, most frenetic, rocking shows we\u2019d ever played\u2014tons of stage diving and people shouting along to the songs, even though nobody had heard any of our new stuff before. And I felt pretty good, pretty vindicated because even though it was just a matter of pure luck that things had gone this way, I hadn\u2019t blown it for the band after all.</p><p>The groupies just seemed part of this wave of energy, this growing swell of fandom. At first, I didn\u2019t even think of them as groupies because a lot of the girls I\u2019d known vaguely from the scene. Except whereas before they\u2019d been friendly, now they were brazen in their flirting. After one of our first shows in San Francisco, this hipster chick named Viv who I\u2019d known for a few years came backstage. She had glossy black hair and wiry arms covered in a daisy chain of tattoos. She gave me a huge hug and then a kiss on the mouth. She hung by my side all night long, her hand resting on the small of my back.</p><p>At that point, I\u2019d been out of commission for well over a year. Mia and I, well, she\u2019d been in the hospital, then in rehab, and even if she hadn\u2019t been covered in stitches, plaster, and pressure bandages, there was no way. All those fantasies about sexy hospital sponge baths are a joke; there is no place less of a turn-on than a hospital. The smell alone is one of putrefaction\u2014the opposite of desire.</p><p>When she\u2019d come home, it had been to a downstairs room that had been her gran\u2019s sewing room, which we\u2019d turned into Mia\u2019s bedroom. I\u2019d slept on a nearby couch in the living room. There were spare rooms on the second floor, but Mia, who was still walking with a cane, couldn\u2019t handle the stairs at first, and I hadn\u2019t wanted to be even that far away.</p><p>Even though I was spending every night at Mia\u2019s, I\u2019d never officially moved out of the House of Rock, and one night, a few months after Mia had come back to her grandparents\u2019, she\u2019d suggested we go there. After dinner with Liz and Sarah, Mia had tugged me up to my room. The minute the door clicked shut behind us, she\u2019d pounced on me, kissing me with her mouth wide open, like she was trying to swallow me whole. I\u2019d been taken aback at first, freaked out by this sudden ardor, worried that it was going to hurt her, and also, not really wanting to look at the stubbly red scar on her thigh where the skin had been taken for her graft or to bang against the snakeskin-like scar on her other leg, even though she kept that one covered with a pressure bandage.</p><p>But as she\u2019d kissed me, my body had begun waking up to her, and with it, my mind had gone, too. We\u2019d laid down on my futon. But then, right as things had gotten going, she\u2019d started crying. I couldn\u2019t tell at first because the little sobs had sounded just the same as the little moans she\u2019d been giving off moments before. But soon, they\u2019d grown in intensity, something awful and animal coming from deep within her. I\u2019d asked if I\u2019d hurt her, but she\u2019d said that wasn\u2019t it and asked me to leave the room. When she\u2019d come out fully dressed, she\u2019d asked to go home.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to start things up with me once more after that. A summer night a few weeks before she\u2019d left for Juilliard. Her grandparents had gone away to visit her aunt Diane, so we\u2019d had the house to ourselves for the night, and Mia had suggested we sleep in one of the upstairs bedrooms since by then the stairs were no longer a problem for her. It had been hot. We\u2019d opened the windows and kicked off the antique quilt and just gotten under the sheet. I remember feeling all self-conscious, sharing a bed with her after all that time. So I\u2019d grabbed a book for myself and propped up a row of pillows for Mia to bolster her leg against, like she liked to at night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to sleep,\u201d she\u2019d said, running a finger down my bare arm.</p><p>She\u2019d leaned in to kiss me. Not the usual dry peck on the lips but a deep, rich, exploring kiss. I\u2019d started to kiss her back. But then I\u2019d remembered that night at the House of Rock, the sound of her animal keening, the look of fear in her eyes when she\u2019d come out of the bedroom. No way was I sending her down that wormhole again. No way was I going down that wormhole again.</p><p>That night in San Francisco, though, with Viv\u2019s hand playing on the small of my back, I was raring to go. I spent the night with her at her apartment, and she came with me the next morning to have breakfast with the band before we took off for our next stop. \u201cCall me next time you\u2019re in town,\u201d she whispered in my ear as we parted ways.</p><p>\u201cBack on the horse, my man,\u201d Fitzy said, high-fiving me as we piloted the van south.</p><p>\u201cYeah, congratulations,\u201d Liz said, a little sadly. \u201cJust don\u2019t rub it in.\u201d Sarah had recently finished law school and was working for a human rights organization. No more dropping everything to be Liz\u2019s plus-one on tours anymore.</p><p>\u201cJust because you and Mikey are all tied down, don\u2019t come sobbing to us,\u201d Fitzy said. \u201cTour time is playtime, right, Wilde Man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilde Man?\u201d Liz asked. \u201cIs that how it\u2019s gonna be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHey, if the name fits . . .\u201d Fitzy said. \u201cGood thing I hit Fred Meyer for the economy box of condoms before we left.\u201d</p><p>In L.A., there was another girl waiting. And in San Diego, another. But none of it felt skeevy. Ellie, the girl in L.A. was an old friend, and Laina, the one in San Diego, was a grad student\u2014smart and sexy and older. Nobody had any illusions that these flings were leading to grand romance.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until our second-to-last gig that I met a girl whose name I never did catch. I noticed her from the stage. She locked eyes on me the entire set and wouldn\u2019t stop staring. It was weirding me out but also building me up. I mean she was practically undressing me with her eyes. You couldn\u2019t help but feel powerful and turned on, and it felt good to be so obviously wanted again.</p><p>Our label was throwing us a CD-release party after the show, invitation only. I didn\u2019t expect to see her there. But after a few hours, there she was, striding up to me in an outfit that was half hooker, half supermodel: skirt cut up to there, boots that could double as military-grade weaponry.</p><p>She marched right up to me and announced in a not-too-quiet voice: \u201cI\u2019ve come all the way from England to f**k you.\u201d And with that, she grabbed my hand and led me out the door and to her hotel room.</p><p>The next morning was awkward like none of the morning afters had been. I did a walk of shame to the bathroom, quickly dressed and tried to slip out, but she was right there, packed and ready to go. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cComing with you?\u201d she said, as though it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cComing with me where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Portland, love.\u201d</p><p>Portland was our last show and a sort of homecoming as we\u2019d all be basing there now. Not in a communal House of Rock anymore. Liz and Sarah were getting their own place. Mike was moving in with his girlfriend. And Fitzy and I were renting a house together. But we were all still in the same area, within walking distance to one another and the rehearsal space we now rented.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a van. Not a tour bus,\u201d I told her, looking down at my Converse. \u201cAnd Portland\u2019s the last show, a kind of friends-and-family thing. You shouldn\u2019t come.\u201d And you are not my love.</p><p>She frowned and I\u2019d slunk out the door, thinking that was the last of it. But when I showed up to sound check in Portland, she was there, waiting for me in the Satyricon. I told her to leave, not very nicely. It was along the lines of: There\u2019s a name for this and it\u2019s called stalking. I was a dick, I know, but I was tired. I\u2019d asked her not to come. And she was freaking me out in a big way. Not just her. Four girls in two weeks was doing my head in. I needed to be alone.</p><p>\u201cPiss off, Adam. You\u2019re not even a bloody rock star yet, so stop acting like such a self-important wanker. And you weren\u2019t even that good.\u201d This she shouted in front of everyone.</p><p>So I had the roadies throw her out. She left screaming insults about me, my sexual prowess, my ego.</p><p>\u201cWilde Man, indeed,\u201d Liz said, raising an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, feeling like the opposite of a wild man, actually wanting to sneak into a room and hide. I didn\u2019t know it yet, but once the real tour started\u2014the one our label sent us on after the album went haywire, a five-month slog of sold-out shows and groupies galore\u2014all I\u2019d wanted to do was hide. Given my isolationist tendencies, you\u2019d think I\u2019d have learned to stay away from the freebie affection on such constant offer. But after shows, I craved connection. I craved skin\u2014the taste of another woman\u2019s sweat. If it couldn\u2019t be hers, well, then anyone\u2019s would do . . . for a few hours. But I\u2019d learned one lesson\u2014no more overnight guests.</p><p>So, that night in Seattle may have been the first time I became a guy. But it wasn\u2019t the last.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>The boogeyman sleeps on your side of the bed</p><p>Whispers in my ear: \u201cBetter off dead.\u201d</p><p>Fills my dreams with sirens and lights of regret</p> <p>Kisses me gently when I wake up in a sweat</p><p>\u201cBOO!\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 3</p><p>I go with Mia to the ferry anyway. Because what else am I going to do? Throw a tantrum because she hasn\u2019t kept an up-to-date catalog of every conversation we\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s called moving on.</p><p>And she\u2019s right about the ferry being dead. At four thirty in the morning, not a lot of demand for Staten Island. There are maybe a dozen people sprawled out in the downstairs deck. One trio of late-night stragglers is sacked out on a bench, rehashing the evening, but as we pass them, one of the girls lifts her head and stares at me. Then she asks her friend, \u201cDude, is that Adam Wilde?\u201d</p><p>The friend laughs. \u201cYeah. And next to him is Britney Spears. Why the hell would Adam Wilde be on the Staten Island Ferry?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m asking myself the same question.</p><p>But this is apparently one of Mia\u2019s things, and this is her farewell-to-New-York-even-though-I\u2019m-not-actually-leaving tour. So I follow her upstairs to the bow of the boat near the railing.</p> <p>As we pull away from New York, the skyline recedes behind us and the Hudson River opens up to one side, the harbor to the other. It\u2019s peaceful out here on the water, quiet except for a pair of hopeful seagulls following in our wake, squawking for food, I guess, or maybe just some company in the night. I start to relax in spite of myself.</p><p>And after a few minutes, we\u2019re close to the Statue of Liberty. She\u2019s all spotlit in the night, and her torch is also illuminated, like there\u2019s really a flame in there, welcoming the huddled masses. Yo, lady, here I am.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been to the Statue of Liberty. Too many crowds. Aldous once invited me on a private helicopter tour, but I don\u2019t do choppers. But now that she\u2019s right here, I can see why this is on Mia\u2019s list. In pictures, the statue always looks kind of grim, determined, But up close, she\u2019s softer. She has a look on her face, like she knows something you don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d Mia says to me.</p><p>And I realize I am. Maybe it\u2019s being granted a special pass to do something I thought was off-limits. Or maybe the statue\u2019s look is contagious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d Mia says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d I reply, \u201cbecause I was just thinking about her.\u201d I gesture toward the statue. \u201cIt\u2019s like she has some kind of secret. The secret to life.\u201d</p><p>Mia looks up. \u201cYeah. I see what you mean.\u201d</p><p>I blow air out my lips. \u201cI could really use that secret.\u201d</p><p>Mia tilts her head out over the railing. \u201cYeah? So ask her for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right there. No one\u2019s here. No tourists crawling around her feet like little ants. Ask her for her secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do it? I will, but it\u2019s your question, so I think you should do the honors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a habit of talking to statues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And pigeons. Now, are you going to ask?\u201d</p><p>I look at Mia. She\u2019s got her arms crossed across her chest, a little impatient. I turn back to the railing. \u201cUm. Statue? Oh, Statue of Liberty,\u201d I call out quietly. No one is around, but this is still really embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cLouder,\u201d Mia prods.</p><p>What the hell. \u201cHey, excuse me,\u201d I call out, \u201cwhat\u2019s your secret?\u201d</p><p>We both c**k our ears out over the water, as though we expect an answer to come racing back.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Mia asks.</p><p>\u201cLiberty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiberty,\u201d Mia repeats, nodding in agreement. \u201cNo, wait, I think there\u2019s more. Hang on.\u201d She leans out over the railing, widening her eyes. \u201cHmm. Hmm. Aha.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cApparently, she isn\u2019t wearing any underwear under her robes, and with the bay breeze, it provides a certain frisson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Liberty\u2019s going commando,\u201d I say. \u201cThat is so French!\u201d</p><p>Mia cracks up at that. \u201cDo you think she ever flashes the tourists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! Why do you think she has that private little look on her face? All those red-state puritans coming by the boatload, never once suspecting that Old Libs hasn\u2019t got panties on. She\u2019s probably sporting a Brazilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I need to lose that visual,\u201d Mia groans. \u201cAnd might I remind you that we\u2019re from a red state\u2014sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOregon\u2019s a divided state,\u201d I reply. \u201cRednecks to the east, hippies to the west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of hippies, and going commando . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Now that\u2019s a visual I really don\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMammary Liberation Day!\u201d Mia crows, referring to some sixties holdover in our town. Once a year a bunch of women spend the day topless to protest the inequity that it\u2019s legal for men to go shirtless, but not women. They do it in the summer, but Oregon being Oregon, half the time, it\u2019s still freezing, so there was a lot of aging puckered flesh. Mia\u2019s mom had always threatened to march; her dad had always bribed her with a dinner out at a fancy restaurant not to.</p><p>\u201cKeep Your Class B Misdemeanor off My B Cups,\u201d Mia says, quoting one of the movement\u2019s more ridiculous slogans between gasps of laughter. \u201cThat makes no sense. If you\u2019re baring your boobs, why a bra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense? It was some stoner hippie idea. And you\u2019re looking for logic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMammary Liberation Day,\u201d Mia says, wiping away the tears. \u201cGood old Oregon! That was a lifetime ago.\u201d</p><p>And it was. So the remark shouldn\u2019t feel like a slap. But it does. \u201cHow come you never went back?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s not really Oregon\u2019s abandonment I want explained, but it seems safer to hide under the big green blanket of our state.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Mia asks, keeping her gaze steady over the water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The people there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people there can come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo visit them. Your family. At the . . .\u201d Oh, shit, what am I saying?</p><p>\u201cYou mean the graves?\u201d</p><p>I just nod.</p><p>\u201cActually, they\u2019re the reason I don\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head. \u201cToo painful.\u201d</p><p>Mia laughs. A real and genuine laugh, a sound about as expected as a car alarm in a rain forest. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that at all.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cDo you honestly think that where you\u2019re buried has any bearing on where your spirit lives?\u201d</p><p>Where your spirit lives?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know where my family\u2019s spirits live?\u201d</p><p>I suddenly feel like I\u2019m talking to a spirit. The ghost of rational Mia.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d she says, tapping her chest. \u201cAnd here,\u201d she says, touching her temple. \u201cI hear them all the time.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what to say. Were we not just making fun of all the New Agey hippie types in our town two minutes ago?</p><p>But Mia\u2019s not kidding anymore. She frowns deeply, swivels away. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get it. I sound like a Rainbow Warrior. A freak. A Looney Tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you sound like your gran.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll call the guys with the straitjackets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left my phone at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, we\u2019re on a boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if by chance they do show up, I\u2019ll just offer myself up. So, what, do they, like, haunt you?\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and her shoulders slump as if she\u2019s setting down a heavy load. She beckons me over to one of the empty benches. I sit down next to her.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Haunt\u2019 is not the right word for it. Haunt makes it sound bad, unwelcome. But I do hear them. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just hear their voices, like the memory of them,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI can hear them talk to me. Like now. In real time. About my life.\u201d</p><p>I must give her a weird look, because she blushes. \u201cI know. I hear dead people. But it\u2019s not like that. Like remember that crazy homeless woman who used to wander around the college campus claiming she heard voices broadcast to her shopping cart?\u201d I nod. Mia stops for a minute.</p><p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it is. Maybe I am nuts and just don\u2019t think I am because crazy people never think they\u2019re crazy, right? But I really do hear them. Whether it\u2019s some kind of angel force like Gran believes, and they\u2019re up in some heaven on a direct line to me, or whether it\u2019s just the them I\u2019ve stored inside me, I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know if it even matters. What matters is that they\u2019re with me. All the time. And I know I sound like a crazy person, mumbling to myself sometimes, but I\u2019m just talking to Mom about what skirt to buy or to Dad about a recital I\u2019m nervous about or to Teddy about a movie I\u2019ve seen.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can hear them answer me. Like they\u2019re right there in the room with me. Like they never really went away. And here\u2019s what\u2019s really weird: I couldn\u2019t hear them back in Oregon. After the accident, it was like their voices were receding. I thought I was going to totally lose the ability to remember what they even sounded like. But once I got away, I could hear them all the time. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to go back. Well, one of the reasons. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll lose the connection, so to speak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you hear them now?\u201d</p><p>She pauses, listens, nods.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying it\u2019s so good to see you, Adam.\u201d</p> <p>I know she\u2019s sort of joking, but the thought that they can see me, keep tabs on me, know what I\u2019ve done these last three years, it makes me actually shudder in the warm night.</p><p>Mia sees me shudder, looks down. \u201cI know, it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve never told anyone this. Not Ernesto. Not even Kim.\u201d</p><p>No, I want to tell her. You got it wrong. It\u2019s not crazy at all. I think of all the voices that clatter around in my head, voices that I\u2019m pretty sure are just some older, or younger, or just better versions of me. There have been times\u2014when things have been really bleak\u2014that I\u2019ve tried to summon her, to have her answer me back, but it never works. I just get me. If I want her voice, I have to rely on memories. At least I have plenty of those.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have had her company in my head\u2014the comfort that would\u2019ve brought. To know that she\u2019s had them with her all this time, it makes me glad. It also makes me understand why, of the two of us, she seems like the sane one.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure that when babies are born in Oregon, they leave the hospital with birth certificates\u2014and teeny-tiny sleeping bags. Everyone in the state camps. The hippies and the rednecks. The hunters and the tree huggers. Rich people. Poor people. Even rock musicians. Especially rock musicians. Our band had perfected the art of punk-rock camping, throwing a bunch of crap into the van with, like, an hour\u2019s notice and just driving out into the mountains, where we\u2019d drink beer, burn food, jam on our instruments around the campfire, and sack out under the open sky. Sometimes, on tour, back in the early hardscrabble days, we\u2019d even camp as an alternative to crashing in another crowded, roach-infested rock \u2019n\u2019 roll house.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because no matter where you live, the wilderness is never that far off, but it just seemed like everyone in Oregon camped.</p><p>Everyone, that was, except for Mia Hall.</p><p>\u201cI sleep in beds,\u201d was what Mia told me the first time I invited her to go camping for a weekend. To which I\u2019d offered to bring one of those blow-up air mattresses, but she\u2019d still refused. Kat had overheard me trying to persuade Mia and had laughed.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that, Adam,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cDenny and I took Mia camping when she was a baby. We planned to spend a week at the coast, but she screamed for two days straight and we had to come home. She\u2019s allergic to camping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Mia had said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Teddy had offered. \u201cI only ever get to go camp in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGramps takes you out every month,\u201d Denny had replied. \u201cAnd I take you. You just don\u2019t get to go camping with all of us as a family.\u201d He\u2019d given Mia a look. She\u2019d just rolled her eyes back at him.</p><p>So it shocked me when Mia agreed to go camping. It was the summer before her senior year of high school and my first year of college, and we\u2019d hardly seen each other. Things with the band had really started heating up, so I\u2019d been touring for a lot of that summer, and Mia had been away at her band camp and then visiting relatives. She must\u2019ve been really missing me. It was the only explanation I could imagine for her relenting.</p><p>I knew better than to rely on the punk-rock mode of camping. So I borrowed a tent. And one of those foam things to sleep on. And I packed a cooler full of food. I wanted to make everything okay, though to be honest, I wasn\u2019t really clear on why Mia was so averse to camping in the first place\u2014she was not a prissy chick, not by a long shot; this was a girl who liked to play midnight basketball\u2014so I had no idea if the creature comforts would help.</p><p>When I went to pick her up, her whole family came down to see us off, like we were heading off on a crosscountry road trip instead of a twenty-four-hour jaunt. Kat waved me over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you pack, for food?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSandwiches. Fruit. For tonight, hamburgers, baked beans, s\u2019mores. I\u2019m trying for the authentic camping experience.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded, all serious. \u201cGood, though you might want to feed her the s\u2019mores first if she gets cranky. Also, I packed you some provisions.\u201d She handed me a half-gallon Ziploc. \u201cIn case of emergency, break glass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and Laters. Starburst. Pixie Stix. If she gets too bitchy, just feed her this crap. As long as the sugar high is in effect, you and the wildlife should be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head \u201cYou\u2019re a braver man than I. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll need it,\u201d Denny replied. Then he and Kat locked eyes for a second and started cracking up.</p><p>There were plenty of great camping spots within an hour\u2019s drive, but I wanted to take us somewhere a little more special, so I wound us deep into the mountains, to this place up an old logging road I\u2019d been to a lot as a kid. When I pulled off the road, onto a dirt path, Mia asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the campground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCampgrounds are for tourists. We free camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree camp?\u201d Her voice rose in alarm.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Mia. My dad used to log around here. I know these roads. And if you\u2019re worried about showers and stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the showers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because we have our own private pool.\u201d I turned off my car and showed Mia the spot. It was right alongside the river, where a small inlet of water pooled calm and crystal clear. The view in all directions was unfettered, nothing but pine trees and mountains, like a giant postcard advertising OREGON!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d Mia admitted, grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cWait till you see the view from the top of the ridge. You up for a walk?\u201d</p><p>Mia nodded. I grabbed some sandwiches and waters and two packs of watermelon Now and Laters and we traipsed up the trail, hung out for a while, read our books under a tree. By the time we got back down, it was twilight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get the tent up,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou need some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re the guest. You relax. Read your book or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>I dumped the borrowed tent pieces on the ground and started to hook up the poles. Except the tent was one of those newfangled ones, where all the poles are in one giant puzzle piece, not like the simple pup tents I\u2019d grown up assembling. After half an hour, I was still struggling with it. The sun was dipping behind the mountains, and Mia had put down her book. She was watching me, a bemused little smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying this?\u201d I asked, perspiring in the evening chill.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Had I known this was what it would be like, I would\u2019ve agreed to come ages ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you find it so amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do. But are you sure you wouldn\u2019t like some help? You\u2019ll need me to hold a flashlight if this takes much longer.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Held my hands up in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m being bested by a piece of sporting goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your opponent have instructions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably did at some point.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, stood up, grabbed the top of the tent. \u201cOkay, you take this end. I\u2019ll do this end. I think the long part loops over the top here.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later we had the tent set up and staked down. I collected some rocks and some kindling for a fire pit and got a campfire going with the firewood I\u2019d brought. I cooked us burgers in a pan over the fire and baked beans directly in the can.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cSo you like camping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she said, but she was smiling.</p><p>It was only later, after we\u2019d had dinner and s\u2019mores and washed our dishes in the moonlit river and I\u2019d played some guitar around the campfire as Mia sipped tea and chowed through a pack of Starburst, that I finally understood Mia\u2019s issue with camping.</p><p>It was maybe ten o\u2019clock, but in camping time, that\u2019s like two in the morning. We got into our tent, snuggled into the double sleeping bag. I pulled Mia to me. \u201cWanna know the best part about camping?\u201d</p><p>I felt her whole body tense up\u2014but not in the good way. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was probably just an animal,\u201d I said.</p><p>She flicked on the flashlight. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>I took the flashlight and shined it on her. Her eyes were huge. \u201cYou\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><p>She looked down and\u2014barely\u2014nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you need to worry about out here is bears and they\u2019re only interested in the food, which is why we put it all away in the car,\u201d I reassured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of bears,\u201d Mia said disdainfully.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, I just feel like such a sitting target out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting target for who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, people with guns. All those hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Half of Oregon hunts. My whole family hunts. They hunt animals, not campers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said in a small voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not really that, either. I just feel . . . defenseless. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, the world feels so big when you\u2019re out in the wide open. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t have a place in it when you don\u2019t have a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour place is right here,\u201d I whispered, laying her down and hugging her close.</p><p>She snuggled into me. \u201cI know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat a freak! The granddaughter of a retired Forest Service biologist who\u2019s scared of camping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the half of it. You\u2019re a classical cellist whose parents are old punk rockers. You\u2019re a total freak. But you\u2019re my freak.\u201d</p><p>We lay there in silence for a while. Mia clicked off the flashlight and scooted closer to me. \u201cDid you hunt as a kid?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to go out with my dad,\u201d I murmured back. Even though we were the only people within miles, something about the night demanded we speak in hushed tones. \u201cHe always said when I was twelve I\u2019d get a rifle for my birthday and he\u2019d teach me to shoot. But when I was maybe nine, I went out with some older cousins and one of them loaned me his rifle. And it must\u2019ve been beginner\u2019s luck or something because I shot a rabbit. My cousins were all going crazy. Rabbits are small and quick and hard for even seasoned hunters to kill, and I\u2019d hit one on my first try. They went to get it so we could bring it back to show everyone and maybe stuff it for a trophy. But when I saw it all bloody, I just started crying. Then I started screaming that we had to take it to a vet, but of course it was dead. I wouldn\u2019t let them bring it back. I made them bury it in the forest. When my dad heard, he told me that the point of hunting was to take some sustenance from the animal, whether we eat it or skin it or something, otherwise it was a waste of a life. But I think he knew I wasn\u2019t cut out for it because when I turned twelve, I didn\u2019t get a rifle; I got a guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that before,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cGuess I didn\u2019t want to blow my punk-rock credibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that would cement it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah. But I\u2019m emocore all the way, so it works.\u201d</p><p>A warm silence hung in the tent. Outside, I could hear the low hoot of an owl echo in the night. Mia nudged me in the ribs. \u201cYou\u2019re such a softy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from the girl who\u2019s scared of camping!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She chuckled. I pulled her closer to me, wanting to eradicate any distance between our bodies. I pushed her hair off her neck and nuzzled my face there. \u201cNow you owe me an embarrassing story from your childhood,\u201d I murmured into her ear.</p><p>\u201cAll my embarrassing stories are still happening,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThere must be one I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a while. Then she said: \u201cButterflies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cButterflies? \u201d</p><p>\u201cI was terrified of butterflies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and nature?\u201d</p><p>She shook with silent laughter. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd can there be a less-threatening creature than a butterfly? They only live, like, two weeks. But I used to freak any time I saw one. My parents did everything they could to desensitize me: bought me books on butterflies, clothes with butterflies, put up butterfly posters in my room. But nothing worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you like attacked by a gang of monarchs?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cGran had this theory behind my phobia. She said it was because one day I was going to have to go through a metamorphosis like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly and that scared me, so butterflies scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like your gran. How\u2019d you get over your fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just decided not to be scared of them anymore and then one day I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFake it till you make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could try that with camping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, but I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d turned to face me. It was almost pitch-black in the tent but I could see her dark eyes shining. \u201cMe too. But do we have to go to sleep? Can we just stay like this for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night long if you want. We\u2019ll tell our secrets to the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s hear another one of your irrational fears.\u201d</p><p>Mia grasped me by the arms and pulled herself in to my chest, like she was burrowing her body into mine. \u201cI\u2019m scared of losing you,\u201d she said in the faintest of voices.</p><p>I pushed her away so I could see her face and kissed the top of her forehead. \u201cI said \u2018irrational\u2019 fears. Because that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt still scares me,\u201d she murmured. But then she went on to list other random things that freaked her out and I did the same, and we kept whispering to each other, telling stories from our childhoods, deep, deep into the night until finally Mia forgot to be scared and fell asleep.</p><p>The weather turned cool a few weeks later, and that winter was when Mia had her accident. So that actually turned out to be the last time I went camping. But even if it weren\u2019t, I still think it would be the best trip of my life. Whenever I remember it, I just picture our tent, a little ship glowing in the night, the sounds of Mia\u2019s and my whispers escaping like musical notes, floating out on a moonlit sea.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>You crossed the water, left me ashore</p><p>It killed me enough, but you wanted more</p><p>You blew up the bridge, a mad terrorist</p><p>Waved from your side, threw me a kiss</p><p>I started to follow but realized too late</p><p>There was nothing but air underneath my feet</p><p>\u201cBRIDGE\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 4</p><p>Fingers of light are starting to pry open the night sky. Soon the sun will rise and a new day will inarguably begin. A day in which I\u2019m leaving for London. And Mia for Tokyo. I feel the countdown of the clock ticking like a time bomb.</p><p>We\u2019re on the Brooklyn Bridge now, and though Mia hasn\u2019t said so specifically, I feel like this must be the last stop. I mean, we\u2019re leaving Manhattan\u2014and not a round-trip like our cruise out to Staten Island and back was. And also, Mia has decided, I guess, that since she\u2019s pulled some confessionals, it\u2019s my turn. About halfway across the bridge, she stops suddenly and turns to me.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up with you and the band?\u201d she asks.</p><p>There\u2019s a warm wind blowing, but I suddenly feel cold. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what\u2019s up?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugs. \u201cSomething\u2019s up. I can tell. You\u2019ve hardly talked about them all night. You guys used to be inseparable, and now you don\u2019t even live in the same state. And why didn\u2019t you go to London together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, logistics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was so important that they couldn\u2019t have waited one night for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to, to do some stuff. Go into the studio and lay down a few guitar tracks.\u201d</p><p>Mia eyes me skeptically. \u201cBut you\u2019re on tour for a new album. Why are you even recording?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA promo version of one of our singles. More of this,\u201d I say, frowning as I rub my fingers together in a money-money motion.</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t you be recording together?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really work like that anymore. And besides, I had to do an interview with Shuffle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn interview? Not with the band? Just with you? That\u2019s what I don\u2019t get.\u201d</p><p>I think back to the day before. To Vanessa LeGrande. And out of the blue, I\u2019m recalling the lyrics to \u201cBridge,\u201d and wondering if maybe discussing this with Mia Hall above the dark waters of the East River isn\u2019t such a hot idea. At least it isn\u2019t Friday the thirteenth anymore.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s kinda how it works these days, too,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they only want just you? What do they want to know about?\u201d</p><p>I really don\u2019t want to talk about this. But Mia\u2019s like a bloodhound, tracking a scent, and I know her well enough to know that I can either throw her a piece of bloody meat, or let her sniff her way to the real pile of stinking corpses. I go for the diversion.</p><p>\u201cActually, that part\u2019s kinda interesting. The reporter, she asked about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mia swivels around to face me.</p><p>\u201cShe was interviewing me and asked about you. About us. About high school.\u201d The look of shock on Mia\u2019s face, I savor it. I think about what she said earlier, about her life in Oregon being a lifetime ago. Well, maybe not such a lifetime ago! \u201cThat\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened. Kinda strange coincidence, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her anything, but she\u2019d gotten a hold of the old Cougar yearbook. The one with our picture\u2014Groovy and the Geek.\u201d</p><p>Mia shakes her head. \u201cYeah, I so loved that nick-name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t say anything. And for good measure, I smashed her recorder. Destroyed all evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the evidence.\u201d She stares at me. \u201cThe Cougar lives on. I\u2019m sure Kim will be delighted to know her early work may turn up in a national magazine.\u201d She shakes her head and chuckles. \u201cOnce Kim gets you in her shutter, you\u2019re stuck forever. So it was pointless to destroy that reporter\u2019s recorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just sort of lost it. She was this very provocative person, and she was trying to get a rise out of me with all these insults-disguised-as-compliments.\u201d</p><p>Mia nods knowingly. \u201cI get that, too. It\u2019s the worst! \u2018I was fascinated by the Shostakovich you played tonight. So much more subdued than the Bach,\u2019 she says in a snooty voice. \u2018Translation: The Shostakovich sucked.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine the Shostakovich ever sucking, but I won\u2019t deny us this common ground.</p><p>\u201cSo what did she want to know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had plans to do this big expos\u00e9, I guess, on what makes Shooting Star tick. And she went digging around our hometown and talked to people we went to high school with. And they told her about us . . . about the . . . about what we were. And about you and what happened . . .\u201d I trail off. I look down at the river, at a passing barge, which, judging by its smell, is carrying garbage.</p><p>\u201cAnd what really happened?\u201d Mia asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if this is a rhetorical question, so I force my own voice into a jokey drawl. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m still trying to figure out.\u201d</p><p>It occurs to me that this is maybe the most honest thing I\u2019ve said all night, but the way I\u2019ve said it transforms it into a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou know, my manager warned me that the accident might get a lot of attention as my profile went up, but I didn\u2019t think that the connection to you would be an issue. I mean, I did in the beginning. I sort of waited for someone to look me up\u2014ghosts of girlfriends past\u2014but I guess I wasn\u2019t interesting enough compared to your other, um, attachments.\u201d</p><p>She thinks that\u2019s why none of the hacks have pestered her, because she\u2019s not as interesting as Bryn, who I guess she does know about. If only she knew how the band\u2019s inner circle has bent over backward to keep her name out of things, to not touch the bruise that blooms at the mere mention of her. That right at this very moment there are riders in interview contracts that dictate whole swaths of forbidden conversational topics that, though they don\u2019t name her specifically, are all about obliterating her from the record. Protecting her. And me.</p><p>\u201cI guess high school really is ancient history,\u201d she concludes.</p><p>Ancient history? Have you really relegated us to the trash heap of the Dumb High-School Romance? And if that\u2019s the case, why the hell can\u2019t I do the same?</p><p>\u201cYeah, well you plus me, we\u2019re like MTV plus Lifetime,\u201d I say, with as much jauntiness as I can muster. \u201cIn other words, shark bait.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cOh, well. I suppose even sharks have to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, I don\u2019t particularly want my family history dragged through the public eye, but if that\u2019s the price to be paid for doing what you love, I guess I\u2019ll pay it.\u201d</p><p>And we\u2019re back to this. The notion that music can make it all worthwhile\u2014I\u2019d like to believe. I just don\u2019t. I\u2019m not even sure that I ever did. It isn\u2019t the music that makes me want to wake up every day and take another breath. I turn away from her toward the dark water below.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not what you love?\u201d I mumble, but my voice gets lost in the wind and the traffic. But at least I\u2019ve said it out loud. I\u2019ve done that much.</p><p>I need a cigarette. I lean against the railing and look uptown toward a trio of bridges. Mia comes to stand beside me as I\u2019m fumbling to get my lighter to work.</p><p>\u201cYou should quit,\u201d she says, touching me gently on the shoulder.</p><p>For a second, I think she means the band. That she heard what I said before and is telling me to quit Shooting Star, leave the whole music industry. I keep waiting for someone to advise me to quit the music business, but no one ever does. Then I remember how earlier tonight, she told me the same thing, right before she bummed a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Mia says with a self-righteousness that instantly recalls her mother, Kat, who wore her certitude like a beat-up leather jacket and who had a mouth on her that could make a roadie blush. \u201cQuitting\u2019s not hard. Deciding to quit is hard. Once you make that mental leap, the rest is easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Was that how you quit me?\u201d</p><p>And just like that, without thinking, without saying it in my head first, without arguing with myself for days, it\u2019s out there.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says, as if speaking to an audience under the bridge. \u201cHe finally says it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I not supposed to? Am I just supposed to let this whole night go without talking about what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cSo why? Why did you go? Was it because of the voices?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the voices.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen what? What was it?\u201d I hear the desperation in my own voice now.</p><p>\u201cIt was lots of things. Like how you couldn\u2019t be yourself around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stopped talking to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd, Mia. I talked to you all the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to me, but you didn\u2019t. I could see you having these two-sided conversations. The things you wanted to say to me. And the words that actually came out.\u201d</p><p>I think of all the dual conversations I have. With everyone. Is that when it started? \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t exactly easy to talk to,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cAnything I said was the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with a sad smile. \u201cI know. It wasn\u2019t just you. It was you plus me. It was us.\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes it is. But don\u2019t feel bad. Everyone walked on eggshells around me. But with you, it was painful that you couldn\u2019t be real with me. I mean, you barely even touched me.\u201d</p><p>As if to reinforce the point, she places two fingers on the inside of my wrist. Were smoke to rise and the imprints of her two fingers branded onto me, I wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprised. I have to pull away just to steady myself.</p><p>\u201cYou were healing,\u201d is my pathetic reply. \u201cAnd if I recall, when we did try, you freaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I wanted was for you to be okay. All I wanted was to help you. I would\u2019ve done anything.\u201d</p><p>She drops her chin to her chest. \u201cYes, I know. You wanted to rescue me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn, Mia. You say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me. The sympathy is still in her eyes, but there\u2019s something else now, too: a fierceness; it slices up my anger and reconstitutes it as dread.</p><p>\u201cYou were so busy trying to be my savior that you left me all alone,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you were trying to help, but it just felt, at the time, like you were pushing me away, keeping things from me for my own good and making me more of a victim. Ernesto says that people\u2019s good intentions can wind up putting us in boxes as confining as coffins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErnesto? What the hell does he know about it?\u201d</p><p>Mia traces the gap between the wooden boardwalk planks with her toe. \u201cA lot, actually. His parents were killed when he was eight. He was raised by his grandparents.\u201d</p><p>I know what I\u2019m supposed to feel is sympathy. But the rage just washes over me. \u201cWhat, is there some club?\u201d I ask, my voice starting to crack. \u201cA grief club that I can\u2019t join?\u201d</p><p>I expect her to tell me no. Or that I\u2019m a member. After all, I lost them, too. Except even back then, it had been different, like there\u2019d been a barrier. That\u2019s the thing you never expect about grieving, what a competition it is. Because no matter how important they\u2019d been to me, no matter how sorry people told me they were, Denny and Kat and Teddy weren\u2019t my family, and suddenly that distinction had mattered.</p><p>Apparently, it still does. Because Mia stops and considers my question. \u201cMaybe not a grief club. But a guilt club. From being left behind.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, don\u2019t talk to me about guilt! My blood runs thick with it. On the bridge, now I feel tears coming. The only way to keep them at bay is to find the anger that\u2019s sustained me and push back with it. \u201cBut you could\u2019ve at least told me,\u201d I say, my voice rising to a shout. \u201cInstead of dropping me like a one-night stand, you could\u2019ve had the decency to break up with me instead of leaving me wondering for three years. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan it,\u201d she says, her own pitch rising. \u201cI didn\u2019t get on that plane thinking we\u2019d split up. You were everything to me. Even as it was happening, I didn\u2019t believe it was happening. But it was. Just being here, being away, it was all so much easier in a way I didn\u2019t anticipate. In a way I didn\u2019t think my life could be anymore. It was a huge relief.\u201d</p><p>I think of all the girls whose backs I couldn\u2019t wait to see in retreat. How once their sound and smell and voices were gone, I felt my whole body exhale. A lot of the time Bryn falls into this category. That\u2019s how my absence felt to Mia?</p><p>\u201cI planned to tell you,\u201d she continues, the words coming out in a breathless jumble now, \u201cbut at first I was so confused. I didn\u2019t even know what was happening, only that I was feeling better without you and how could I explain that to you? And then time went by, you didn\u2019t call me, when you didn\u2019t pursue it, I just figured that you, you of all people, you understood. I knew I was being a chickenshit. But I thought . . .\u201d Mia stumbles for a second then regains her composure. \u201cI thought I was allowed that. And that you understood it. I mean you seemed to. You wrote: \u2018She says I have to pick: Choose you, or choose me. She\u2019s the last one standing.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. When I heard \u2018Roulette\u2019 I just thought you did understand. That you were angry, but you knew. I had to choose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your excuse for dropping me without a word? There\u2019s cowardly, Mia. And then there\u2019s cruel! Is that who you\u2019ve become?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was who I needed to be for a while,\u201d she cries. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. I know I should\u2019ve contacted you. Should\u2019ve explained. But you weren\u2019t all that accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bullshit, Mia. I\u2019m inaccessible to most people. But you? Two phone calls and you could\u2019ve tracked me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel that way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were this . . .\u201d she trails off, miming an explosion, the same as Vanessa LeGrande had done earlier in the day. \u201cPhenomenon. Not a person anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a load of crap and you should know it. And besides, that was more than a year after you left. A year. A year in which I was curled up into a ball of misery at my parents\u2019 house, Mia. Or did you forget that phone number, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mia\u2019s voice is flat. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t call you at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I yell. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Mia faces me now. The wind is whipping her hair this way and that so she looks like some kind of mystical sorceress, beautiful, powerful, and scary at the same time. She shakes her head and starts to turn away.</p><p>Oh, no! We\u2019ve come this far over the bridge. She can blow the damn thing up if she wants to. But not without telling me everything. I grab her, turn her to face me. \u201cWhy not? Tell me. You owe me this!\u201d</p><p>She looks at me, square in the eye. Taking aim. And then she pulls the trigger. \u201cBecause I hated you.\u201d</p><p>The wind, the noise, it all just goes quiet for a second, and I\u2019m left with a dull ringing in my ear, like after a show, like after a heart monitor goes to flatline.</p><p>\u201cHated me? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me stay.\u201d She says it quietly, and it almost gets lost in the wind and the traffic and I\u2019m not sure I heard her. But then she repeats it louder this time. \u201cYou made me stay!\u201d</p><p>And there it is. A hollow blown through my heart, confirming what some part of me has always known.</p><p>She knows.</p><p>The electricity in the air has changed; it\u2019s like you can smell the ions dancing. \u201cI still wake up every single morning and for a second I forget that I don\u2019t have my family anymore,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd then I remember. Do you know what that\u2019s like? Over and over again. It would\u2019ve been so much easier . . .\u201d And suddenly her calm facade cracks and she begins to cry.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I hold up my hands. \u201cPlease don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. You have to let me say this, Adam! You have to hear it. It would\u2019ve been easier to die. It\u2019s not that I want to be dead now. I don\u2019t. I have a lot in my life that I get satisfaction from, that I love. But some days, especially in the beginning, it was so hard. And I couldn\u2019t help but think that it would\u2019ve been so much simpler to go with the rest of them. But you\u2014you asked me to stay. You begged me to stay. You stood over me and you made a promise to me, as sacred as any vow. And I can understand why you\u2019re angry, but you can\u2019t blame me. You can\u2019t hate me for taking your word.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s sobbing now. I\u2019m wracked with shame because I brought her to this.</p><p>And suddenly, I get it. I understand why she summoned me to her at the theater, why she came after me once I left her dressing room. This is what the farewell tour is really all about\u2014Mia completing the severance she began three years ago.</p><p>Letting go. Everyone talks about it like it\u2019s the easiest thing. Unfurl your fingers one by one until your hand is open. But my hand has been clenched into a fist for three years now; it\u2019s frozen shut. All of me is frozen shut. And about to shut down completely.</p><p>I stare down at the water. A minute ago it was calm and glassy but now it\u2019s like the river is opening up, churning, a violent whirlpool. It\u2019s that vortex, threatening to swallow me whole. I\u2019m going to drown in it, with nobody, nobody in the murk with me.</p><p>I\u2019ve blamed her for all of this, for leaving, for ruining me. And maybe that was the seed of it, but from that one little seed grew this tumor of a flowering plant. And I\u2019m the one who nurtures it. I water it. I care for it. I nibble from its poison berries. I let it wrap around my neck, choking the air right out of me. I\u2019ve done that. All by myself. All to myself.</p><p>I look at the river. It\u2019s like the waves are fifty feet high, snapping at me now, trying to pull me over the bridge into the waters below.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore!\u201d I yell as the carnivorous waves come for me.</p><p>Again, I scream, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore!\u201d I\u2019m yelling to the waves and to Liz and Fitzy and Mike and Aldous, to our record executives and to Bryn and Vanessa and the paparazzi and the girls in the U Mich sweatshirts and the scenesters on the subway and everyone who wants a piece of me when there aren\u2019t enough pieces to go around. But mostly I\u2019m yelling it to myself.</p><p>\u201cI CAN\u2019T DO THIS ANYMORE!\u201d I scream louder than I\u2019ve ever screamed in my life, so loud my breath is knocking down trees in Manhattan, I\u2019m sure of it. And as I battle with invisible waves and imaginary vortexes and demons that are all too real and of my own making, I actually feel something in my chest open, a feeling so intense it\u2019s like my heart\u2019s about to burst. And I just let it. I just let it out.</p><p>When I look up, the river is a river again. And my hands, which had been gripping the railing of the bridge so tight that my knuckles had gone white, have loosened.</p><p>Mia is walking away, walking toward the other end of the bridge. Without me.</p><p>I get it now.</p><p>I have to make good on my promise. To let her go. To really let her go. To let us both go.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>I started playing in my first band, Infinity 89, when I was fourteen years old. Our first show was at a house party near the college campus. All three of us in the band\u2014me on guitar, my friend Nate on bass, and his older brother Jonah on drums\u2014sucked. None of us had been playing for long, and after the gig we found out that Jonah had bribed the host of the party to let us play. It\u2019s a little-known fact that Adam Wilde\u2019s first foray into playing rock music in front of an audience might never have happened had Jonah Hamilton not pitched in for a keg.</p><p>The keg turned out to be the best thing about that show. We were so nervous that we turned the amps up too loud, creating a frenzy of feedback that made the neighbors complain, and then we overcompensated by playing so low that we couldn\u2019t hear one another\u2019s instruments.</p><p>What I could hear in the pauses between songs was the sound of the party: the din of beer bottles clinking, of mindless chatter, of people laughing, and, I swear, in the back room of the house, people watching American Idol. The point is, I could hear all this because our band was so crappy that no one bothered to acknowledge that we were playing. We weren\u2019t worth cheering. We were too bad to even boo. We were simply ignored. When we finished playing, the party carried on as if we\u2019d never gone on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We got better. Never great, but better. And never good enough to play anything but house parties. Then Jonah went off to college, and Nate and I were left without a drummer, and that was the end of Infinity 89.</p><p>Thus began my brief stint as a lone singer-songwriter about town, playing in coffeehouses, mostly. Doing the caf\u00e9 circuit was marginally better than the house parties. With just me and a guitar, I didn\u2019t need to up the volume that much, and people in the audience were mostly respectful. But as I played, I was still distracted by the sounds of things other than the music: the hiss of the cappuccino maker, the intellectual college students\u2019 hushed conversations about Important Things, the giggles of girls. After the show, the giggles grew louder as the girls came up to me to talk, to ask me about my inspiration, to offer me mix CDs they\u2019d made, and sometimes to offer other things.</p><p>One girl was different. She had ropy muscled arms and a fierce look in her eyes. The first time she spoke to me she said only: \u201cYou\u2019re wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Sober as a stone,\u201d I replied.</p> <p>\u201cNot that kind of wasted,\u201d she said, arching her pierced eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re wasted on acoustic. I saw you play before in that terrible band of yours, but you were really good, even for a child such as yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m not here for flattery. I\u2019m here for recruitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m a pacifist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny! I\u2019m a dyke, one who likes to ask and tell, so I\u2019m also ill-suited for the military. No, I\u2019m putting together a band. I think you\u2019re an outrageously talented guitar player so I\u2019m here to rob the cradle, artistically speaking.\u201d</p> <p>I was barely sixteen years old and a little bit intimidated by this ballsy chick, but I\u2019d said why not. \u201cWho else is in the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe on drums. You on guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are the most important parts, don\u2019t you think? Fantastic drummers and singing guitar players don\u2019t grow on trees, not even in Oregon. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll fill in the blanks. I\u2019m Liz by the way.\u201d She stuck out her hand. It was crusted with calluses, always a good sign on a drummer.</p><p>Within a month, Liz had drafted Fitzy and Mike, and we\u2019d christened ourselves Shooting Star and started writing songs together. A month after that, we had our first gig. It was another house party, but nothing like the ones I\u2019d played with Infinity 89. Right from the get-go, something was different. When I slashed out my first chord, it was like turning off a light. Everything just fell silent. We had people\u2019s attention and we kept it. In the empty space between songs, people cheered and then got quiet, anticipating our next song. Over time, they\u2019d start shouting requests. After a while, they got to know our lyrics so well that they\u2019d sing along, which was handy when I spaced a lyric.</p><p>Pretty soon, we moved on to playing in bigger clubs. I could sometimes make out bar sounds in the background\u2014the clink of glasses, the shouts of orders to a bartender. I also started to hear people scream my name for the first time. \u201cAdam!\u201d \u201cOver here!\u201d A lot of those voices belonged to girls.</p> <p>The girls I mostly ignored. At this point, I\u2019d started obsessing about a girl who never came to our shows but who I\u2019d seen playing cello at school. And when Mia had become my girlfriend, and then started coming to my shows\u2014and to my surprise, seemed to actually enjoy, if not the gigs, then at least our music\u2014I sometimes listened for her. I wanted to hear her voice calling out my name, even though I knew that was something she\u2019d never do. She was a reluctant plus-one. She tended to hang backstage and watch me with a solemn intensity. Even when she loosened up enough to sometimes watch the show like a normal person, from the audience, she remained pretty reserved. But still, I listened for the sound of her voice. It never seemed to matter that I didn\u2019t hear it. Listening for her was half the fun.</p><p>As the band got bigger and the shows got bigger, the cheers just grew louder. And then for a while, it all went quiet. There was no music. No band. No fans. No Mia.</p><p>When it came back\u2014the music, the gigs, the crowds\u2014it all sounded different. Even during that two-week tour right on the heels of Collateral Damage\u2019s release, I could tell how much had changed just by how different everything sounded. The wall of sound as we played enveloped the band, almost as if we were playing in a bubble made of nothing other than our own noise. And in between the songs, there was this screaming and shrieking. Soon, much sooner than I ever could\u2019ve imagined, we were playing these enormous venues: arenas and stadiums, to more than fifteen thousand fans.</p><p>At these venues, there are just so many people, and so much sound, that it\u2019s almost impossible to differentiate a specific voice. All I hear, aside from our own instruments now blaring out of the most powerful speakers available, is that wild scream from the crowd when we\u2019re backstage and the lights go down right before we go out. And once we\u2019re onstage, the constant shrieking of the crowd melds so it sounds like the furious howl of a hurricane; some nights I swear I can feel the breath of those fifteen thousand screams.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this sound. I find the monolithic nature of it disorienting. For a few gigs, we traded our wedge monitors for in-ear pieces. It was perfect sound, as though we were in the studio, the roar of the crowd blocked off. But that was even worse in a way. I feel so disconnected from the crowds as it is, by the distance between them and us, a distance separated by a vast expanse of stage and an army of security keeping fans from bounding up to touch us or stage-dive the way they used to. But more than that, I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s so hard to hear any one single voice break through. I dunno. Maybe I\u2019m still listening for that one voice.</p><p>Every so often during a show, though, as me or Mike pause to retune our guitars or someone takes a swig from a bottle of water, I\u2019ll pause and strain to pick out a voice from the crowd. And every so often, I can. Can hear someone shouting for a specific song or screaming I love you! Or chanting my name.</p><p>As I stand here on the Brooklyn Bridge I\u2019m thinking about those stadium shows, of their hurricane wail of white noise. Because all I can hear now is a roaring in my head, a wordless howl as Mia disappears and I try to let her.</p><p>But there\u2019s something else, too. A small voice trying to break through, to puncture the roar of nothingness. And the voice grows stronger and stronger, and it\u2019s my voice this time and it\u2019s asking a question: How does she know?</p> <p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Are you happy in your misery?</p><p>Resting peaceful in desolation?</p><p>It\u2019s the final tie that binds us</p><p>The sole source of my consolation</p><p>\u201cBLUE\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 6</p><p>Mia\u2019s gone.</p><p>The bridge looks like a ghost ship from another time even as it fills up with the most twenty-first-century kind of people, early-morning joggers.</p><p>And me, alone again.</p><p>But I\u2019m still standing. I\u2019m still breathing. And somehow, I\u2019m okay.</p><p>But still the question is gaining momentum and volume: How does she know? Because I never told anyone what I asked of her. Not the nurses. Not the grandparents. Not Kim. And not Mia. So how does she know?</p><p>If you stay, I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I\u2019ll quit the band, go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I\u2019ll do that, too. Maybe coming back to your old life would just be too painful, maybe it\u2019d be easier for you to erase us. And that would suck, but I\u2019d do it. I can lose you like that if I don\u2019t lose you today. I\u2019ll let you go. If you stay.</p><p>That was my vow. And it\u2019s been my secret. My burden. My shame. That I asked her to stay. That she listened. Because after I promised her what I promised her, and played her a Yo-Yo Ma cello piece, it had seemed as if she had heard. She\u2019d squeezed my hand and I\u2019d thought it was going to be like in the movies, but all she\u2019d done was squeeze. And stayed unconscious. But that squeeze had turned out to be her first voluntary muscle movement; it was followed by more squeezes, then by her eyes opening for a flutter or two, and then longer. One of the nurses had explained that Mia\u2019s brain was like a baby bird, trying to poke its way out of an eggshell, and that squeeze was the beginning of an emergence that went on for a few days until she woke up and asked for water.</p><p>Whenever she talked about the accident, Mia said the entire week was a blur. She didn\u2019t remember a thing. And I wasn\u2019t about to tell her about the promise I\u2019d made. A promise that in the end, I was forced to keep.</p><p>But she knew.</p><p>No wonder she hates me.</p><p>In a weird way, it\u2019s a relief. I\u2019m so tired of carrying this secret around. I\u2019m so tired of feeling bad for making her live and feeling angry at her for living without me and feeling like a hypocrite for the whole mess.</p><p>I stand there on the bridge for a while, letting her get away, and then I walk the remaining few hundred feet to the ramp down. I\u2019ve seen dozens of taxis pass by on the roadway below, so even though I have no clue where I am, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll find a cab to bring me back to my hotel. But when I get down the ramp, I\u2019m in a plaza area, not where the car traffic lets out. I flag down a jogger, a middle-aged guy chugging off the bridge, and ask where I can get a taxi, and he points me toward a bunch of buildings. \u201cThere\u2019s usually a queue on weekdays. I don\u2019t know about weekends, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a cab somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wearing an iPod and has pulled out the earbuds to talk to me, but the music is still playing. And it\u2019s Fugazi. The guy is running to Fugazi, the very tail end of \u201cSmallpox Champion.\u201d Then the song clicks over and it\u2019s \u201cWild Horses\u201d by the Rolling Stones. And the music, it\u2019s like, I dunno, fresh bread on an empty stomach or a woodstove on a frigid day. It\u2019s reaching out of the earbuds and beckoning me.</p><p>The guy keeps looking at me. \u201cAre you Adam Wilde? From Shooting Star?\u201d he asks. Not at all fanlike, just curious.</p><p>It takes a lot of effort to stop listening to the music and give him my attention. \u201cYeah.\u201d I reach out my hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude,\u201d he says after we shake, \u201cbut what are you doing walking around Brooklyn at six thirty on a Saturday morning? Are you lost or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not lost. Not anymore anyway.\u201d</p><p>Mick Jagger is crooning away and I practically have to bite my lip to keep from singing along. It used to be I never went anywhere without my tunes. And then it was like everything else, take it or leave it. But now I\u2019ll take it. Now I need it. \u201cCan I ask you for an insanely huge and just plain insane favor?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOkaaay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I borrow your iPod? Just for the day? If you give me your name and address, I\u2019ll have it messengered over to you. I promise you\u2019ll have it back by tomorrow\u2019s run.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, laughs. \u201cOne butt-crack-of-dawn run a weekend is enough for me, but yeah, you can borrow it. The buzzer on my building doesn\u2019t work, so just deliver it to Nick at the Southside Caf\u00e9 on Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn. I\u2019m in there every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick. Southside Caf\u00e9. Sixth Avenue. Brooklyn. I won\u2019t forget. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d he says, spooling the wires. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t find any Shooting Star on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter yet. I\u2019ll have this back to you by tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBattery was fully charged when I left so you should be good for at least . . . an hour. The thing\u2019s a dinosaur.\u201d He chuckles softly. Then he takes off running, tossing a wave at me without looking back.</p><p>I plug myself into the iPod; it\u2019s truly battered. I make a note to get him a new one when I return this one. I scroll through his collection\u2014everything from Charlie Parker to Minutemen to Yo La Tengo. He\u2019s got all these playlists. I choose one titled Good Songs. And when the piano riff at the start of the New Pornographers\u2019 \u201cChallengers\u201d kicks in, I know I\u2019ve put myself in good hands. Next up is some Andrew Bird, followed by a kick-ass Billy Bragg and Wilco song I haven\u2019t heard in years and then Sufjan Stevens\u2019s \u201cChicago,\u201d which is a song I used to love but had to stop listening to because it always made me feel too stirred up. But now it\u2019s just right. It\u2019s like a cool bath after a fever sweat, helping to soothe the itch of all those unanswerable questions I just can\u2019t be tormenting myself with anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I spin the volume up all the way, so it\u2019s blasting even my battle-worn eardrums. That, along with the racket of downtown Brooklyn waking up\u2014metal grates grinding and buses chugging\u2014is pretty damn loud. So when a voice pierces the din, I almost don\u2019t hear it. But there it is, the voice I\u2019ve been listening for all these years.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d it screams.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it at first. I turn off Sufjan. I look around. And then there she is, in front of me now, her face streaked with tears. Saying my name again, like it\u2019s the first word I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>I let go. I truly did. But there she is. Right in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you. I went back and looked for you on the bridge but I didn\u2019t see you and I figured you\u2019d walked back to the Manhattan side and I got this dumb idea that I could beat you over in a cab and ambush you on the other side. I know this is selfish. I heard what you said up there on the bridge, but we can\u2019t leave it like that. I can\u2019t. Not again. We have to say good-bye differently. Bet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia?\u201d I interrupt. My voice is a question mark and a caress. It stops her babbling cold. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>The question is out of the blue. Yet she seems to know exactly what I\u2019m asking about. \u201cOh. That,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>I start to back away from her. I have no right to ask her, and she isn\u2019t under any obligation to tell me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re good now. I\u2019m good now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Adam, stop,\u201d Mia says.</p> <p>I stop.</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you. I need to tell you everything. I just think I need some coffee before I can get it together enough to explain.\u201d</p><p>She leads me out of downtown into a historic district to a bakery on a cobblestoned street. Its windows are darkened, the door locked, by all signs the place is closed. But Mia knocks and within a minute a bushyhaired man with flour clinging to his unruly beard swings open the door and shouts bonjour to Mia and kisses her on both cheeks. Mia introduces me to Hassan, who disappears into the bakery, leaving the door open so that the warm aroma of butter and vanilla waft into the morning air. He returns with two large cups of coffee and a brown paper bag, already staining dark with butter. She hands me my coffee, and I open it to see it\u2019s steaming and black just like I like it.</p><p>It\u2019s morning now. We find a bench on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, another one of Mia\u2019s favorite New York spots, she tells me. It\u2019s right on the East River, with Manhattan so close you can almost touch it. We sit in companionable silence, sipping our coffee, eating Hassan\u2019s still-warm croissants. And it feels so good, so like old times that part of me would like to just click a magic stopwatch, exist in this moment forever. Except there are no magic stopwatches and there are questions that need to be answered. Mia, however, seems in no rush. She sips, she chews, she looks out at the city. Finally, when she\u2019s drained her coffee, she turns to me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie before when I said I didn\u2019t remember anything about the accident or after,\u201d she begins. \u201cBut then I did start remembering things. Not exactly remembering, but hearing details of things and having them feel intensely familiar. I told myself it was because I\u2019d heard the stories over and over, but that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u201cFast-forward about a year and a half. I\u2019m on my seventh or eighth therapist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you are in therapy?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a cockeyed look. \u201cOf course I am. I used to go through shrinks like shoes. They all told me the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was angry. That I was angry the accident happened. That I was angry I was the only survivor. That I was angry at you.\u201d She turns to me with an apologetic grimace. \u201cThe other stuff all made sense, but you I didn\u2019t get. I mean, why you? But I was. I could feel how . . .\u201d she trails off for a second, \u201cfurious I was,\u201d she finishes quietly. \u201cThere were all the obvious reasons, how you withdrew from me, how much the accident changed us. But it didn\u2019t add up to this lethal fury I suddenly felt once I got away. I think really, somewhere in me, I must\u2019ve known all along that you asked me to stay\u2014way before I actually remembered it. Does that make any sense?\u201d</p><p>No. Yes. I don\u2019t know. \u201cNone of this makes sense,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know. So, I was angry with you. I didn\u2019t know why. I was angry with the world. I did know why. I hated all my therapists for being useless. I was this little ball of self-destructive fury, and none of them could do anything but tell me that I was a little ball of self-destructive fury. Until I found Nancy, not one of them helped me as much as my Juilliard profs did. I mean, hello! I knew I was angry. Tell me what to do with the anger, please. Anyhow, Ernesto suggested hypnotherapy. It helped him quit smoking, I guess.\u201d She elbows me in the ribs.</p><p>Of course Mr. Perfect wouldn\u2019t smoke. And of course, he\u2019d be the one who helped Mia unearth the reason she hates me.</p><p>\u201cIt was kind of risky,\u201d Mia continues. \u201cHypnosis tends to unlock hidden memories. Some trauma is just too much for the conscious mind to handle and you have to go in through a back door to access it. So I reluctantly submitted to a few sessions. It wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be. No swinging amulet, no metronome. It was more like those guided imagery exercises they\u2019d sometimes have us do at camp. At first, nothing happened, and then I went to Vermont for the summer and quit.</p> <p>\u201cBut a few weeks later, I started to get these flashes. Random flashes. Like I could remember a surgery, could actually hear the specific music the doctors played in the operating room. I thought about calling them to ask if what I remembered was true, but so much time had passed I doubted they\u2019d remember. Besides, I didn\u2019t really feel like I needed to ask them. My dad used to say that when I was born I looked so totally familiar to him, he was overwhelmed with this feeling that he\u2019d known me all his life, which was funny, considering how little I looked like him or Mom. But when I had my first memories, I felt that same certainty, that they were real and mine. I didn\u2019t put the pieces together fully until I was working on a cello piece\u2014a lot of memories seem to hit when I\u2019m playing\u2014anyhow, it was Gershwin, Andante con moto e poco rubato.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say something, but at first nothing comes out. \u201cI played you that,\u201d I finally say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem surprised by my confirmation.</p><p>I lean forward, put my head between my knees, and take deep breaths. I feel Mia\u2019s hand gently touch the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d Her voice is tentative. \u201cThere\u2019s more. And here\u2019s where it gets a little freaky. It makes a certain sense to me that my mind somehow recorded the things that were happening around my body while I was unconscious. But there are other things, other memories. . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d My voice is a whisper.</p><p>\u201cMost of it is hazy, but I have certain strong memories of things I couldn\u2019t know because I wasn\u2019t there. I have this one memory. It\u2019s of you. It\u2019s dark out. And you\u2019re standing outside the hospital entrance under the floodlights, waiting to come see me. You\u2019re wearing your leather jacket, and looking up. Like you\u2019re looking for me. Did you do that?\u201d</p><p>Mia cups my chin up and lifts my face, this time apparently seeking some affirmation that this moment was real. I want to tell her that she\u2019s right, but I\u2019ve completely lost the ability to speak. My expression, however, seems to offer the validation she\u2019s after. She nods her head slightly. \u201cHow? How, Adam? How could I know that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if the question\u2019s rhetorical or if she thinks I have a clue to her metaphysical mystery. And I\u2019m in no state to answer either way because I\u2019m crying. I don\u2019t realize it till I taste the salt against my lips. I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve cried but, once I accept the mortification of sniveling like a baby, the floodgates open and I\u2019m sobbing now, in front of Mia. In front of the whole damn world.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>The first time I ever saw Mia Hall was six years ago. Our high school had this arts program and if you chose music as your elective, you could take music classes or opt for independent study to practice in the studios. Mia and I both went for the independent study.</p><p>I\u2019d seen her playing her cello a couple of times but nothing had really registered. I mean she was cute and all, but, not exactly my type. She was a classical musician. I was a rock guy. Oil and water and all that.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really notice her until the day I saw her not playing. She was just sitting in one of the soundproof practice booths, her cello resting gently against her knees, her bow poised a few inches above the bridge. Her eyes were closed and her brow was a little furrowed. She was so still, it seemed like she\u2019d taken a brief vacation from her body. And even though she wasn\u2019t moving, even though her eyes were closed, I somehow knew that she was listening to music then, was grabbing the notes from the silence, like a squirrel gathering acorns for the winter, before she got down to the business of playing. I stood there, suddenly riveted by her, until she seemed to wake up and start playing with this intense concentration. When she finally looked at me, I hustled away.</p><p>After that, I became kind of fascinated by her and by what I guessed was her ability to hear music in the silence. Back then, I\u2019d wanted to be able to do that, too. So I took to watching her play, and though I told myself the reason for my attention was because she was as dedicated a musician as I was and that she was cute, the truth was that I also wanted to understand what she heard in the silence.</p><p>During all the time we were together, I don\u2019t think I ever found out. But once I was with her, I didn\u2019t need to. We were both music-obsessed, each in our own way. If we didn\u2019t entirely understand the other person\u2019s obsession, it didn\u2019t matter, because we understood our own.</p><p>I know the exact moment Mia is talking about. Kim and I had driven to the hospital in Sarah\u2019s pink Dodge Dart. I don\u2019t remember asking Liz\u2019s girlfriend to borrow her car. I don\u2019t remember driving it. I don\u2019t remember piloting the car up into the hills where the hospital is or how I even knew the way. Just that one minute I was in a theater in downtown Portland, sound-checking for that night\u2019s show when Kim showed up to deliver the awful news. And the next minute I was standing outside the hospital.</p><p>What Mia inexplicably remembers, it\u2019s sort of the first pinpoint of clarity in that whole petri-dish blur between hearing the news and arriving at the trauma center. Kim and I had just parked the car and I\u2019d walked out of the garage ahead of her. I\u2019d needed a couple of seconds to gather my strength, to steel myself for what I was about to face. And I\u2019d remembered looking at the hulking hospital building and wondering if Mia was somewhere in there, and feeling a heart-in-throat panic that she\u2019d died in the time it had taken Kim to fetch me. But then I\u2019d felt this wave of something, not really hope, not really relief, but just a sort of knowledge that Mia was still in there. And that had been enough to pull me through the doors.</p><p>They say that things happen for a reason, but I don\u2019t know that I buy that. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever see a reason for what happened to Kat, Denny, and Teddy that day. But it took forever to get in to see Mia. I got turned away from the ICU by Mia\u2019s nurses, and then Kim and I devised this whole plan to sneak in. I don\u2019t think I realized it at the time, but I think in a weird way, I was probably stalling. I was gathering my strength. I didn\u2019t want to lose it in front of her. I guess part of me somehow knew that Mia, deep in her coma, would be able to tell.</p><p>Of course, I ended up losing it in front of her anyway. When I finally saw her the first time, I almost blew chunks. Her skin looked like tissue paper. Her eyes were covered with tape. Tubes ran in and out of every part of her body, pumping liquids and blood in and draining some scary-ass shit out. I\u2019m ashamed to say it, but when I first came in, I wanted to run away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I couldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t. So instead, I just focused on the part of her that still looked remotely like Mia\u2014her hands. There were monitors stuck to her fingers, but they still looked like her hands. I touched the fingertips of her left hand, which felt worn and smooth, like old leather. I ran my fingers across the nubby calluses of her thumbs. Her hands were freezing, just like they always were, so I warmed them, just like I always did.</p><p>And it was while warming her hands that I thought about how lucky it was that they looked okay. Because without hands, there\u2019d be no music and without music, she\u2019d have lost everything. And I remember thinking that somehow Mia had to realize that, too. That she needed to be reminded that she had the music to come back to. I ran out of the ICU, part of me fearing that I might never see her alive again, but somehow knowing that I had to do this one thing. When I came back, I played her the Yo-Yo Ma.</p><p>And that\u2019s also when I made her the promise. The promise that she\u2019s held me to.</p><p>I did the right thing. I know it now. I must\u2019ve always known, but it\u2019s been so hard to see through all my anger. And it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s angry. It\u2019s even okay if she hates me. It was selfish what I asked her to do, even if it wound up being the most unselfish thing I\u2019ve ever done. The most unselfish thing I\u2019ll have to keep doing.</p> <p>But I\u2019d do it again. I know that now. I\u2019d make that promise a thousand times over and lose her a thousand times over to have heard her play last night or to see her in the morning sunlight. Or even without that. Just to know that she\u2019s somewhere out there. Alive.</p><p>Mia watches me lose my shit all over the Promenade. She bears witness as the fissures open up, the lava leaking out, this great explosion of what, I guess to her, must look like grief.</p><p>But I\u2019m not crying out of grief. I\u2019m crying out of gratitude.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>Someone wake me when it\u2019s over</p> <p>When the evening silence softens golden</p><p>Just lay me on a bed of clover</p><p>Oh, I need help with this burden</p><p>\u201cHUSH\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 13</p><p>When I get a grip over myself and calm down, my limbs feel like they\u2019re made of dead wood. My eyes start to droop. I just drank a huge cup of insanely strong coffee, and it might as well have been laced with sleeping pills. I could lie down right here on this bench. I turn to Mia. I tell her I need to sleep</p> <p>\u201cMy place is a few blocks away,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can crash there.\u201d</p><p>I have that floppy calm that follows a cry. I haven\u2019t felt this way since I was a child, a sensitive kid, who would scream at some injustice or another until, all cried out, my mother would tuck me into bed. I picture Mia, tucking me into a single boy\u2019s bed, pulling the Buzz Lightyear sheets up to my chin.</p><p>It\u2019s full-on morning now. People are awake and out and about. As we walk, the quiet residential area gives way to a commercial strip, full of boutiques, caf\u00e9s, and the hipsters who frequent them. I\u2019m recognized. But I don\u2019t bother with any subterfuge\u2014no sunglasses, no cap. I don\u2019t try to hide at all. Mia weaves among the growing crowds and then turns off onto a leafy side street full of brownstones and brick buildings. She stops in front of a small redbrick carriage house. \u201cHome sweet home. It\u2019s a sublet from a professional violinist who\u2019s with the Vienna Philharmonic now. I\u2019ve been here a record nine months!\u201d</p><p>I follow her into the most compact house I\u2019ve ever seen. The first floor consists of little more than a living room and kitchen with a sliding-glass door leading out to a garden that\u2019s twice as deep as the house. There\u2019s a white sectional couch, and she motions for me to lie down on it. I kick off my shoes and flop onto one of the sections, sinking into the plush cushions. Mia lifts my head, places a pillow underneath it, and a soft blanket over me, tucking me in just as I\u2019d hoped she would.</p><p>I listen for the sound of her footsteps on the stairs up to what must be the bedroom, but instead, I feel a slight bounce in the upholstery as Mia takes up a position on the other end of the couch. She rustles her legs together a few times. Her feet are only inches away from my own. Then she lets out a long sigh and her breathing slows into a rhythmic pattern. She\u2019s asleep. Within minutes, so am I.</p><p>When I wake up, light is flooding the apartment, and I feel so refreshed that for a second I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve slept for ten hours and have missed my flight. But a quick glance at the kitchen clock shows me it\u2019s just before two o\u2019clock, still Saturday. I\u2019ve only been asleep for a few hours, and I have to meet Aldous at the airport at five.</p><p>Mia\u2019s still asleep, breathing deeply and almost snoring. I watch her there for a while. She looks so peaceful and so familiar. Even before I became the insomniac I am now, I always had problems falling asleep at night, whereas Mia would read a book for five minutes, roll onto her side, and be gone. A strand of hair has fallen onto her face and it gets sucked into her mouth and back out again with each inhalation and exhalation. Without even thinking I lean over and move the strand away, my finger accidentally brushing her lips. It feels so natural, so much like the last three years haven\u2019t passed, that I\u2019m almost tempted to stroke her cheeks, her chin, her forehead.</p><p>Almost. But not quite. It\u2019s like I\u2019m seeing Mia through a prism and she\u2019s mostly the girl I knew but something has changed, the angles are off, and so now, the idea of me touching a sleeping Mia isn\u2019t sweet or romantic. It\u2019s stalkerish.</p> <p>I straighten up and stretch out my limbs. I\u2019m about to wake her\u2014but can\u2019t quite bring myself to. Instead, I walk around her house. I was so out of it when we came in a few hours ago, I didn\u2019t really take it in. Now that I do, I see that it looks oddly like the house Mia grew up in. There\u2019s the same mismatched jumble of pictures on the wall\u2014a Velvet Elvis, a 1955 poster advertising the World Series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees\u2014and the same decorative touches, like chili-pepper lights festooning the doorways.</p><p>And photos, they\u2019re everywhere, hanging on the walls, covering every inch of counter and shelf space. Hundreds of photos of her family, including what seem to be the photos that once hung in her old house. There\u2019s Kat and Denny\u2019s wedding portrait; a shot of Denny in a spiked leather jacket holding a tiny baby Mia in one of his hands; eight-year-old Mia, a giant grin on her face, clutching her cello; Mia and Kat holding a red-faced Teddy, minutes after he was born. There\u2019s even that heartbreaking shot of Mia reading to Teddy, the one that I could never bear to look at at Mia\u2019s grandparents\u2019, though somehow here, in Mia\u2019s place, it doesn\u2019t give me that same kick in the gut.</p><p>I walk through the small kitchen, and there\u2019s a veritable gallery of shots of Mia\u2019s grandparents in front of a plethora of orchestra pits, of Mia\u2019s aunts and uncles and cousins hiking through Oregon mountains or lifting up pints of ale. There are a jumble of shots of Henry and Willow and Trixie and the little boy who must be Theo. There are pictures of Kim and Mia from high school and one of the two of them posing on top of the Empire State Building\u2014a jolting reminder that their relationship wasn\u2019t truncated, they have a history of which I know nothing. There\u2019s another picture of Kim, wearing a flak jacket, her hair tangled and down and blowing in a dusty wind.</p><p>There are pictures of musicians in formal wear, holding flutes of champagne. Of a bright-eyed man in a tux with a mass of wild curls holding a baton, and the same guy conducting a bunch of ratty-looking kids, and then him again, next to a gorgeous black woman, kissing a not-ratty-looking kid. This must be Ernesto.</p><p>I wander into the back garden for my wake-up smoke. I pat my pockets, but all I find there is my wallet, my sunglasses, the borrowed iPod, and the usual assortment of guitar picks that always seem to live on me. Then I remember that I must have left my cigarettes on the bridge. No smokes. No pills. I guess today is the banner day for quitting bad habits.</p><p>I come back inside and take another look around. This isn\u2019t the house I expected. From all her talk of moving, I\u2019d imagined a place full of boxes, something impersonal and antiseptic. And despite what she\u2019d said about spirits, I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that she\u2019d surround herself so snugly with her ghosts.</p><p>Except for my ghost. There\u2019s not a single picture of me, even though Kat included me in so many of the family shots; she\u2019d even hung a framed photo of me and Mia and Teddy in Halloween costumes above their old living-room mantel, a place of honor in the Hall home. But not here. There are none of the silly shots Mia and I used to take of each other and of ourselves, kissing or mugging while one of us held the camera at arm\u2019s length. I loved those pictures. They always cut off half a head or were obscured by someone\u2019s finger, but they seemed to capture something true.</p><p>I\u2019m not offended. Earlier, I might\u2019ve been. But I get it now. Whatever place I held in Mia\u2019s life, in Mia\u2019s heart, was irrevocably altered that day in the hospital three and a half years ago.</p><p>Closure. I loathe that word. Shrinks love it. Bryn loves it. She says that I\u2019ve never had closure with Mia. \u201cMore than five million people have bought and listened to my closure,\u201d is my standard reply.</p><p>Standing here, in this quiet house where I can hear the birds chirping out back, I think I\u2019m kind of getting the concept of closure. It\u2019s no big dramatic before-after. It\u2019s more like that melancholy feeling you get at the end of a really good vacation. Something special is ending, and you\u2019re sad, but you can\u2019t be that sad because, hey, it was good while it lasted, and there\u2019ll be other vacations, other good times. But they won\u2019t be with Mia\u2014or with Bryn.</p><p>I glance at the clock. I need to get back to Manhattan, pack up my stuff, reply to the most urgent of the emails that have no doubt piled up, and get myself to the airport. I\u2019ll need to get a cab out of here, and before that I\u2019ll need to wake Mia up and say a proper good-bye.</p><p>I decide to make coffee. The smell of it alone used to rouse her. On the mornings I used to sleep at her house, sometimes I woke up early to hang with Teddy. After I let her sleep to a decent hour, I\u2019d take the percolator right into her room and waft it around until she lifted her head from the pillow, her eyes all dreamy and soft.</p><p>I go into the kitchen and instinctively seem to know where everything is, as though this is my kitchen and I\u2019ve made coffee here a thousand times before. The metal percolator is in the cabinet above the sink. The coffee in a jar on the freezer door. I spoon the rich, dark powder into the chamber atop the percolator, then fill it with water and put it on the stove. The hissing sound fills the air, followed by the rich aroma. I can almost see it, like a cartoon cloud, floating across the room, prodding Mia awake.</p><p>And sure enough, before the whole pot is brewed, she\u2019s stretching out on the couch, gulping a bit for air like she does when she\u2019s waking up. When she sees me in her kitchen, she looks momentarily confused. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because I\u2019m bustling around like a housewife or just because I\u2019m here in the first place. Then I remember what she said about her daily wake-up call of loss. \u201cAre you remembering it all over again?\u201d I ask the question. Out loud. Because I want to know and because she asked me to ask.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cNot this morning.\u201d She yawns, then stretches again. \u201cI thought I dreamed last night. Then I smelled coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>She\u2019s smiling as she kicks off her blanket. \u201cDo you really think that if you don\u2019t mention my family I\u2019ll forget them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admit. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as you can see, I\u2019m not trying to forget.\u201d Mia motions to the photos.</p><p>\u201cI was looking at those. Pretty impressive gallery you\u2019ve got. Of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. They keep me company.\u201d</p><p>I look at the pictures, imagining that one day Mia\u2019s own children will fill more of her frames, creating a new family for her, a continuing generation that I won\u2019t be a part of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know they\u2019re just pictures,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut some days they really help me get up in the morning. Well, them, and coffee.\u201d</p><p>Ahh, the coffee. I go to the kitchen and open the cabinets where I know the cups will be, though I\u2019m a little startled to find that even these are the same collection of 1950s and 60s ceramic mugs that I\u2019ve used so many times before; amazed that she\u2019s hauled them from dorm to dorm, from apartment to apartment. I look around for my favorite mug, the one with the dancing coffeepots on it, and am so damn happy to find it\u2019s still here. It\u2019s almost like having my picture on the wall, too. A little piece of me still exists, even if the larger part of me can\u2019t.</p><p>I pour myself a cup, then pour Mia\u2019s, adding a dash of half-and-half, like she takes it.</p><p>\u201cI like the pictures,\u201d I say. \u201cKeeps things interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Mia nods, blows ripples into her coffee.</p><p>\u201cAnd I miss them, too,\u201d I say. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>She looks surprised at that. Not that I miss them, but, I guess by my admitting it, finally. She nods solemnly. \u201cI know,\u201d she says.</p><p>She walks around the room, running her fingers lightly along the picture frames. \u201cI\u2019m running out of space,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to put up a bunch of Kim\u2019s recent shots in the bathroom. Have you talked to her lately?\u201d</p><p>She must know what I did to Kim. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Then you don\u2019t know about the scandale?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cShe dropped out of college last year. When the war flared up in Afghanistan, Kim decided, screw it, I want to be a photographer and the best education is in the field. So she just took her cameras and off she went. She started selling all these shots to the AP and the New York Times. She cruises around in one of those burkas and hides all her photographic equipment underneath the robes and then whips them off to get her shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Mrs. Schein loves that.\u201d Kim\u2019s mom was notoriously overprotective. The last I\u2019d heard of her, she was having a freak-out that Kim was going to school across the country, which, Kim had said, was precisely the point.</p><p>Mia laughs. \u201cAt first, Kim told her family she was just taking a semester off, but now she\u2019s getting really successful so she\u2019s officially dropped out, and Mrs. Schein has officially had a nervous breakdown. And then there\u2019s the fact that Kim\u2019s a nice Jewish girl in a very Muslim country.\u201d Mia blows on her coffee and sips. \u201cBut, on the other hand, now Kim gets her stuff in the New York Times, and she just got a feature assignment for National Geographic, so it gives Mrs. Schein some bragging ammo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard for a mother to resist,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a big Shooting Star fan, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Schein? I always had her pegged as more hip-hop.\u201d</p><p>Mia grins. \u201cNo. She\u2019s into death metal. Hard core. Kim. She saw you guys play in Bangkok. Said it poured rain and you played right through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was at that show? I wish she would\u2019ve come backstage, said hi,\u201d I say, even though I know why she wouldn\u2019t have. Still, she came to the show. She must have forgiven me a little bit.</p><p>\u201cI told her the same thing. But she had to leave right away. She was supposed to be in Bangkok for some R &amp; R, but that rain you were playing in was actually a cyclone somewhere else and she had to run off and cover it. She\u2019s a very badass shutterbabe these days.\u201d</p><p>I think of Kim chasing Taliban insurgents and ducking flying trees. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to imagine. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d I begin.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Mia asks.</p><p>\u201cKim being a war photographer. All Danger Girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a laugh riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how I meant. It\u2019s just: Kim. You. Me. We all came from this nowhere town in Oregon, and look at us. All three of us have gone to, well, extremes. You gotta admit, it\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not weird at all,\u201d Mia says, shaking out a bowl of cornflakes. \u201cWe were all forged in the crucible. Now come on, have some cereal.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019m not even sure I can eat a single cornflake, but I sit down because my place at the Hall family table has just been restored.</p><p>Time has a weight to it, and right now I can feel it heavy over me. It\u2019s almost three o\u2019clock. Another day is half over and tonight I leave for the tour. I hear the clicking of the antique clock on Mia\u2019s wall. I let the minutes go by longer than I should before I finally speak.</p><p>\u201cWe both have our flights. I should probably get moving,\u201d I say. My voice sounds faraway but I feel weirdly calm. \u201cAre there taxis around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we get back and forth to Manhattan by river raft,\u201d she jokes. \u201cYou can call a car,\u201d she adds after a moment.</p><p>I stand up, make my way toward the kitchen counter where Mia\u2019s phone sits. \u201cWhat\u2019s the number?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSeven-one-eight,\u201d Mia begins. Then she interrupts herself. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>At first I think she has to pause to recall the number, but I see her eyes, at once unsure and imploring.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one last thing,\u201d she continues, her voice hesitant. \u201cSomething I have that really belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Wipers T-shirt?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s long gone, I\u2019m afraid. Come on. It\u2019s upstairs.\u201d</p><p>I follow her up the creaking steps. At the top of the narrow landing to my right I can see her bedroom with its slanted ceilings. To my left is a closed door. Mia opens it, revealing a small studio. In the corner is a cabinet with a keypad. Mia punches in a code and the door opens.</p><p>When I see what she pulls out of the cabinet, at first I\u2019m like, Oh, right, my guitar. Because here in Mia\u2019s little house in Brooklyn is my old electric guitar, my Les Paul Junior. The guitar I bought at a pawnshop with my pizza-delivery earnings when I was a teenager. It\u2019s the guitar I used to record all of our stuff leading up to, and including, Collateral Damage. It\u2019s the guitar I auctioned off for charity and have regretted doing so ever since.</p><p>It\u2019s sitting in its old case, with my old Fugazi and K Records stickers, with the stickers from Mia\u2019s dad\u2019s old band, even. Everything is the same, the strap, the dent from when I\u2019d dropped it off a stage. Even the dust smells familiar.</p><p>And I\u2019m just taking it all in, so it\u2019s a few seconds before it really hits me. This is my guitar. Mia has my guitar. Mia is the one who bought my guitar for some exorbitant sum, which means that Mia knew it was up for auction. I look around the room. Among the sheet music and cello paraphernalia is a pile of magazines, my face peeking out from the covers. And then I remember something back on the bridge, Mia justifying why she left me by reciting the lyrics to \u201cRoulette.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been wearing earplugs all night and they\u2019ve fallen out, and everything that was muffled is now clear. But also so loud and jarring.</p><p>Mia has my guitar. It\u2019s such a straightforward thing and yet I don\u2019t know that I would\u2019ve been more surprised had Teddy popped out of the closet. I feel faint. I sit down. Mia stands right in front of me, holding my guitar by the neck, offering it back to me.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d is all I can manage to choke out.</p><p>\u201cAlways me,\u201d she replies softly, bashfully. \u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>My brain has vacated my body. My speech is reduced to the barest of basics. \u201cBut . . . why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody had to save it from the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9,\u201d Mia says with a laugh. But I can hear the potholes in her voice, too.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d I grasp for the words like a drowning man reaching for floating debris,\u201c . . . you said you hated me?\u201d</p><p>Mia lets out a long, deep sigh. \u201cI know. I needed someone to hate, and you\u2019re the one I love the most, so it fell to you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s holding out the guitar, nudging it toward me. She wants me to take it, but I couldn\u2019t lift a cotton ball right now.</p><p>She keeps staring, keeps offering.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Ernesto?\u201d</p><p>A look of puzzlement flits across her face, followed by amusement. \u201cHe\u2019s my mentor, Adam. My friend. He\u2019s married.\u201d She looks down for a beat. When her gaze returns, her amusement has hardened into defensiveness. \u201cBesides, why should you care?\u201d</p><p>Go back to your ghost, I hear Bryn telling me. But she has it wrong. Bryn is the one who\u2019s been living with the ghost\u2014the specter of a man who never stopped loving someone else.</p><p>\u201cThere never would\u2019ve been a Bryn if you hadn\u2019t decided you needed to hate me,\u201d I reply.</p><p>Mia takes this one square on the chin. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you. I don\u2019t think I ever really did. It was just anger. And once I faced it head-on, once I understood it, it dissipated.\u201d She looks down, takes a deep breath, and exhales a tornado. \u201cI know I owe you some kind of an apology; I\u2019ve been trying to get it out all night but it\u2019s like those words\u2014apology, sorry\u2014are too measly for what you deserve.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI know what I did to you was so wrong, but at the time it also felt so necessary to my survival. I don\u2019t know if those two things can both be true but that\u2019s how it was. If it\u2019s any comfort, after a while, when it didn\u2019t feel necessary anymore, when it felt hugely wrong, all I was left with was the magnitude of my mistake, of my missing you. And I had to watch you from this distance, watch you achieve your dreams, live what seemed like this perfect life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI get that now, but how was I supposed to know? You were so very, very far from me. And I\u2019d accepted that. Accepted that as my punishment for what I\u2019d done. And then . . .\u201d she trails off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She takes a gulp of air and grimaces. \u201cAnd then Adam Wilde shows up at Carnegie Hall on the biggest night of my career, and it felt like more than a coincidence. It felt like a gift. From them. For my first recital ever, they gave me a cello. And for this one, they gave me you.\u201d</p><p>Every hair on my body stands on end, my whole body alert with a chill.</p><p>She hastily wipes tears from her eyes with the back of her hand and takes a deep breath. \u201cHere, are you going to take this thing or what? I haven\u2019t tuned it for a while.\u201d</p><p>I used to have dreams like this. Mia back from the not-dead, in front of me, alive to me. But it got so even in the dreams I knew they were unreal and could anticipate the blare of my alarm, so I\u2019m kind of listening now, waiting for the alarm to go off. But it doesn\u2019t. And when I close my fingers around the guitar, the wood and strings are solid and root me to the earth. They wake me up. And she\u2019s still here.</p><p>And she\u2019s looking at me, at my guitar, and at her cello and at the clock on the windowsill. And I see what she wants, and it\u2019s the same thing I\u2019ve wanted for years now but I can\u2019t believe that after all this time, and now that we\u2019re out of time, she\u2019s asking for it. But still, I give a little nod. She plugs in the guitar, tosses me the cord, and turns on the amp.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me an A?\u201d I ask. Mia plucks her cello\u2019s A string. I tune from that and then I strum an A-minor, and as the chord bounces off the walls, I feel that dash of electricity shimmy up my spine in a way it hasn\u2019t done for a long, long time.</p><p>I look at Mia. She\u2019s sitting across from me, her cello between her legs. Her eyes are closed and I can tell she\u2019s doing that thing, listening for something in the silence. Then all at once, Mia seems to have heard what she needs to hear. Her eyes are open and on me again, like they never left. She picks up her bow, gestures toward my guitar with a slight tilt of her head. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asks.</p><p>There are so many things I\u2019d like to tell her, top among them is that I\u2019ve always been ready. But instead, I turn up the amp, fish a pick out of my pocket, and just say yes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>We play for what seems like hours, days, years. Or maybe it\u2019s seconds. I can\u2019t even tell anymore. We speed up, then slow down, we scream our instruments. We grow serious. We laugh. We grow quiet. Then loud. My heart is pounding, my blood is grooving, my whole body is thrumming as I\u2019m remembering: Concert doesn\u2019t mean standing up like a target in front of thousands of strangers. It means coming together. It means harmony.</p><p>When we finally pause, I\u2019m sweating and Mia\u2019s panting hard, like she\u2019s just sprinted for miles. We sit there in silence, the sound of our rapid breaths slowing in tandem, the beats of our hearts steadying. I look at the clock. It\u2019s past five. Mia follows my gaze. She lays down her bow.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>\u201cSchubert? Ramones?\u201d I say, though I know she\u2019s not taking requests. But all I can think to do is keep playing because for the first time in a long time there\u2019s nothing more I want to do. And I\u2019m scared of what happens when the music ends.</p><p>Mia gestures to the digital clock flashing ominously from the windowsill. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll make your flight.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Never mind the fact that there are at least ten other flights to London tonight alone. \u201cCan you make yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make mine,\u201d she says shyly. \u201cI have a spare day before the recitals begin. I can leave tomor-row.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, I picture Aldous pacing in Virgin\u2019s departure lounge, wondering where the hell I am, calling a cell phone that\u2019s still sitting on some hotel nightstand. I think of Bryn, out in L.A., unaware of an earthquake going down here in New York that\u2019s sending a tsunami her way. And I realize that before there\u2019s a next, there\u2019s a now that needs attending to. \u201cI need to make some phone calls,\u201d I tell Mia. \u201cTo my manager, who\u2019s waiting for me . . . and to Bryn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right, of course,\u201d she says, her face falling as she rushes to stand up, almost toppling her cello in her fluster. \u201cThe phone\u2019s downstairs. And I should call Tokyo, except I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the middle of the night, so I\u2019ll just email and call later. And my travel agent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She doesn\u2019t look so sure.</p><p>I nod, though my own heart is pounding and the puzzle pieces are whirling as Mia places the cordless phone in my hand. I go into her garden where it\u2019s private and peaceful in the afternoon light, the summer cicadas chirping up a storm. Aldous picks up on the first ring and the minute I hear his voice and start talking, reassuring him that I\u2019m okay, the plans start coming out of my mouth as though long, long contemplated. I explain that I\u2019m not coming to London now, that I\u2019m not making any music video, or doing any interviews, but that I\u2019ll be in England for the kickoff of our European tour and that I\u2019ll play every single one of those shows. The rest of the plan that\u2019s formulating in my head\u2014part of which already solidified in some nebulous way last night on the bridge\u2014I keep to myself, but I think Aldous senses it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t see Aldous so I can\u2019t know if he blinks or flinches or looks surprised, but he doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cYou\u2019ll honor all your tour commitments?\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say to the band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can make the video without me if they want. I\u2019ll see them at the Guildford Festival,\u201d I say referring to the big music festival in England that we\u2019re headlining to kick off our tour. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll explain everything then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you gonna be in the meantime? If anyone needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell anyone not to need me,\u201d I answer.</p><p>The next call is harder. I wish I hadn\u2019t chosen today to give up smoking. Instead, I do the deep breathing exercises like the doctors showed me and just dial. A journey of a thousand miles starts with ten digits, right?</p><p>\u201cI thought that might be you,\u201d Bryn says when she hears my voice. \u201cDid you lose your phone again? Where are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in New York still. In Brooklyn.\u201d I pause, \u201cWith Mia.\u201d</p><p>Stone silence fills the line and I fill that silence with a monologue that\u2019s what? . . . I don\u2019t know: a running explanation of the night that happened by accident, an acknowledgment that things never were right between us, right the way she wanted them to be, and as a result, I\u2019ve been a dick of a boyfriend. I tell her I hope she\u2019ll do better with the next guy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d she says with an attempt at a cackle, but it doesn\u2019t quite come out that way. There\u2019s a long pause. I\u2019m waiting for her tirade, her recriminations, all the things I have coming. But she doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAre you still there?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about whether I\u2019d rather she\u2019d have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Bryn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up! You don\u2019t get to be the outraged one. Not right now. And the answer\u2019s no. I don\u2019t wish her dead.\u201d She pauses. \u201cNot so sure about you, though.\u201d Then she hangs up.</p><p>I stand there, still clutching the phone to my ear, taking in Bryn\u2019s last words, wondering if there might\u2019ve been a shred of absolution in her hostility. I don\u2019t know if it matters because as I smell the cooling air, I feel release and relief wash over me.</p><p>After a while, I look up. Mia\u2019s standing at the sliding-glass door, awaiting the all clear. I give her a dazed wave and she slowly makes her way to the bricked patio where I\u2019m standing, still holding the phone. She grabs hold of the top of the phone, like it\u2019s a relay baton, about to be passed off. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freed, shall we say, from my previous commitments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the tour?\u201d She sounds surprised.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot the tour. But all the crap leading up to it. And my other, um, entanglements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We both just stand there for a while, grinning like goofballs, still grasping the cordless. Finally, I let it go and then gently detach the receiver from her grasp and place it on the iron table, never releasing my grip of her hand.</p><p>I run my thumb over the calluses on her thumb and up and down the bony ridge of her knuckles and wrist. It\u2019s at once so natural and such a privilege. This is Mia I\u2019m touching. And she\u2019s allowing it. Not just allowing it, but closing her eyes and leaning into it.</p><p>\u201cIs this real. Am I allowed to hold this hand?\u201d I ask, bringing it up to my stubbly cheek.</p><p>Mia\u2019s smile is melting chocolate. It\u2019s a kick-ass guitar solo. It\u2019s everything good in this world. \u201cMmmm,\u201d she answers.</p><p>I pull her to me. A thousand suns rise from my chest. \u201cAm I allowed to do this?\u201d I ask, taking both of her arms in mine and slow-dancing her around the yard.</p><p>Her entire face is smiling now. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>I run my hands up and down her bare arms. I spin her around the planters, bursting with fragrant flowers. I bury my head into her hair and breathe the smell of her, of the New York City night that\u2019s seared into her. I follow her gaze upward, to the heavens.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think they\u2019re watching us?\u201d I ask as I give the scar on her shoulder the slightest of kisses and feel arrows of heat shoot through every part of me.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Mia asks, leaning into me, shivering slightly.</p><p>\u201cYour family. You seem to think they keep tabs on you. You think they can see this?\u201d I loop my arms around her waist and kiss her right behind her ear, the way that used to drive her crazy, the way that, judging by the sharp intake of breath and the nails that dig into my side, still does. It occurs to me that there\u2019s seemingly something creepy in my line of questioning, but it doesn\u2019t feel that way. Last night, the thought of her family knowing my actions shamed me, but now, it\u2019s not like I want them to see this, but I want them to know about it, about us.</p><p>\u201cI like to think they\u2019d give me some privacy,\u201d she says, opening up like a sunflower to the kisses I\u2019m planting on her jaw. \u201cBut my neighbors can definitely see this.\u201d She runs her hand through my hair and it\u2019s like she electrocuted my scalp\u2014if electrocution felt so good.</p><p>\u201cHowdy, neighbor,\u201d I say, tracing lazy circles around the base of her clavicle with my finger.</p><p>Her hands dip under my T-shirt, my dirty, stinky, thank-you lucky black T-shirt. Her touch isn\u2019t so gentle anymore. It\u2019s probing, the fingertips starting to tap out a Morse code of urgency. \u201cIf this goes on much longer, my neighbors are going to get a show,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cWe are performers, after all,\u201d I reply, slipping my hands under her shirt and running them up the length of her long torso then back down again. Our skins reach outward, like magnets, long deprived of their opposite charge.</p><p>I run my finger along her neck, her jawline, and then cup her chin in my hand. And stop. We stand there for a moment, staring at each other, savoring it. And then all at once, we slam together. Mia\u2019s legs are off the ground, wrapped around my waist, her hands digging in my hair, my hands tangled in hers. And our lips. There isn\u2019t enough skin, enough spit, enough time, for the lost years that our lips are trying to make up for as they find each other. We kiss. The electric current switches to high. The lights throughout all of Brooklyn must be surging.</p><p>\u201cInside!\u201d Mia half orders, half begs, and with her legs still wrapped around me, I carry her back into her tiny home, back to the couch where only hours before we\u2019d slept, separately together.</p><p>This time we\u2019re wide awake. And all together.</p><p>We fall asleep, waking in the middle of the night, ravenous. We order takeout. Eat it upstairs in her bed. It\u2019s all like a dream, only the most incredible part is waking up at dawn. With Mia. I see her sleeping form there and feel as happy as I\u2019ve ever been. I pull her to me and fall back asleep.</p><p>But when I wake again a few hours later, Mia\u2019s sitting on a chair under the window, her legs wrapped in a tight ball, her body covered in an old afghan that her gran crocheted. And she looks miserable, and the fear that lands like a grenade in my gut is almost as bad as anything I\u2019ve ever feared with her. And that\u2019s saying a lot. All I can think is: I can\u2019t lose you again. It really will kill me this time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, before I lose the nerve to ask it and do something dumb like walk away before my heart gets truly incinerated.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about high school,\u201d Mia says sadly.</p><p>\u201cThat would put anyone in a foul mood.\u201d</p><p>Mia doesn\u2019t take the bait. She doesn\u2019t laugh. She slumps in the chair. \u201cI was thinking about how we\u2019re in the same boat all over again. When I was on my way to Juilliard and you were on your way to, well, where you are now.\u201d She looks down, twists the yarn from the blanket around her finger until the skin at the tip goes white. \u201cExcept we had more time back then to worry about it. And now we have a day, or had a day. Last night was amazing but it was just one night. I really do have to leave for Japan in like seven hours. And you have the band. Your tour.\u201d She presses against her eyes with the heels of her hands.</p><p>\u201cMia, stop!\u201d My voice bounces off her bedroom walls. \u201cWe are not in high school anymore!\u201d</p><p>She looks at me, a question hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cLook, my tour doesn\u2019t start for another week.\u201d</p><p>A feather of hope starts to float across the space between us.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know, I was thinking I was craving some sushi.\u201d</p><p>Her smile is sad and rueful, not exactly what I was going for. \u201cYou\u2019d come to Japan with me?\u201d she asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m already there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that. But then what\u2014I mean I know we can figure something out, but I\u2019m going to be on the road so much and . . . ?\u201d</p><p>How can it be so unclear to her when it\u2019s like the fingers on my hand to me? \u201cI\u2019ll be your plus-one,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYour groupie. Your roadie. Your whatever. Wherever you go, I go. If you want that. If you don\u2019t, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want that. Trust me, I want it. But how would that work? With your schedule? With the band?\u201d</p> <p>I pause. Saying it out loud will finally make it true. \u201cThere is no more band. For me, at least, I\u2019m done. After this tour, I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mia shakes her head with such force, the long strands of her hair thwack the wall behind her. The determined look on her face is one I recognize all too well, and I feel my stomach bottom out. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that for me,\u201d she adds, her voice softening. \u201cI won\u2019t take any more free passes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree passes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last three years, everyone, except maybe the Juilliard faculty, has given me a free pass. Worse yet, I gave myself a free pass, and that didn\u2019t help me at all. I don\u2019t want to be that person, who just takes things. I\u2019ve taken enough from you. I won\u2019t let you throw away the thing you love so much to be my caretaker or porter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d I murmur. \u201cI\u2019ve sort of fallen out of love with music.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause of me,\u201d Mia says mournfully.</p><p>\u201cBecause of life,\u201d I reply. \u201cI\u2019ll always play music. I may even record again, but right now I just need some blank time with my guitar to remember why I got into music in the first place. I\u2019m leaving the band whether you\u2019re part of the equation or not. And as for caretaking, if anything, I\u2019m the one who needs it. I\u2019m the one with the baggage.\u201d</p><p>I try to make it sound like a joke, but Mia always could see right through my bullshit; the last twenty-four hours have proven that.</p><p>She looks at me with those laser beam eyes of hers. \u201cYou know, I thought about that a lot these last couple of years,\u201d she says in a choked voice. \u201cAbout who was there for you. Who held your hand while you grieved for all that you\u2019d lost?\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s words rattle something loose in me and suddenly there are tears all over my damn face again. I haven\u2019t cried in three years and now this is like the second time in as many days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to see you through,\u201d she whispers, coming back to me and wrapping me in her blanket as I lose my shit all over again. She holds me until I recover my Y chromosome. Then she turns to me, a slightly faraway look in her eyes. \u201cYour festival\u2019s next Saturday, right?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI have the two recitals in Japan and one in Korea on Thursday, so I could be out of there by Friday, and you gain a day back when you travel west. And I don\u2019t have to be at my next engagement in Chicago for another week after that. So if we flew directly from Seoul to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>She looks so shy when she asks it, as if there\u2019s a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that I\u2019d ever say no, as if this isn\u2019t what I\u2019ve always wanted.</p><p>\u201cCan I come to the festival with you?\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cHow come I never get to go to any concerts?\u201d Teddy asked.</p><p>We were all sitting around the table, Mia, Kat, Denny, Teddy, and me, the third child, who\u2019d taken to eating over. You couldn\u2019t blame me. Denny was a way better cook than my mom.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Little Man?\u201d Denny asked, spooning a portion of mashed potatoes onto Teddy\u2019s plate next to the grilled salmon and the spinach that Teddy had tried\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to refuse.</p><p>\u201cI was looking at the old photo albums. And Mia got to go to all these concerts all the time. When she was a baby, even. And I never even got to go to one. And I\u2019m practically eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just turned seven five months ago.\u201d Kat guffawed.</p><p>\u201cStill. Mia went before she could walk. It\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who ever told you that life was fair?\u201d Kat asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cCertainly not me. I am a follower of the School of Hard Knocks.\u201d</p><p>Teddy turned toward an easier target. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia went to concerts because they were my shows, Teddy. It was our family time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do go to concerts,\u201d Mia said. \u201cYou come to my recitals.\u201d</p><p>Teddy looked as disgusted as he had when Denny had served him the spinach. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count. I want to go to loud concerts and wear the Mufflers.\u201d The Mufflers were the giant headphones Mia had worn as a little kid when she\u2019d been taken to Denny\u2019s old band\u2019s shows. He\u2019d been in a punk band, a very loud punk band.</p><p>\u201cThe Mufflers have been retired, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Denny said. Mia\u2019s dad had long since quit his band. He now was a middle-school teacher who wore vintage suits and smoked pipes.</p><p>\u201cYou could come to one of my shows,\u201d I said, forking a piece of salmon.</p><p>Everyone at the table stopped eating and looked at me, the adult members of the Hall family each giving me a different disapproving look. Denny just looked tired at the can of worms I\u2019d opened. Kat looked annoyed for the subversion of her parental authority. And Mia\u2014who, for whatever reason, had this giant churchstate wall between her family and my band\u2014was shooting daggers. Only Teddy\u2014up on his knees in his chair, clapping\u2014was still on my team.</p><p>\u201cTeddy can\u2019t stay up that late,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYou let Mia stay up that late when she was little,\u201d Teddy shot back.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay up that late,\u201d Denny said wearily.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Mia huffed.</p><p>Immediately, I felt the familiar annoyance in my gut. Because this was the thing I never understood. On one hand, music was this common bond between Mia and me, and me being an all-rock guy had to be part of her attraction. And we both knew that the common ground we\u2019d found at her family\u2019s house\u2014where we hung out all the time\u2014made it like a haven for us. But she\u2019d all but banned her family from my shows. In the year we\u2019d been together, they\u2019d never been. Even though Denny and Kat had hinted that they\u2019d like to come, Mia was always making up excuses why this show or that was not the right time.</p><p>\u201cAppropriate? Did you just say that it\u2019s not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for Teddy to come to my show?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice level.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d She couldn\u2019t have sounded more defensive or snippy if she\u2019d tried.</p><p>Kat and Denny flashed each other a look. Whatever annoyance they\u2019d had with me had turned to sympathy. They knew what Mia\u2019s disapproval felt like.</p><p>\u201cOkay, first off, you\u2019re sixteen. You\u2019re not a librarian. So you\u2019re not allowed to say \u2018appropriate.\u2019 And second of all, why the hell isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Teddy,\u201d Kat said, scooping up Teddy\u2019s dinner plate. \u201cYou can eat in the living room in front of the TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, I want to watch this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpongeBob?\u201d Denny offered, pulling him by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d I said to Denny and Kat, \u201cthe show I was thinking of is this big festival coming up on the coast next month. It\u2019ll be during the day, on a weekend, and outside, so not as loud. That\u2019s why I thought it\u2019d be cool for Teddy. For all of you, actually.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s expression softened. She nodded. \u201cThat does sound fun.\u201d Then she gestured to Mia as if to say: But you\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry.</p><p>The three of them shuffled out of the kitchen. Mia was slunk all the way down in her chair, looking both guilty and like there was no way in hell she was going to give an inch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s your hang-up with your family and my band? Do you think we suck so badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you resent me and your dad talking music all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind the rock-talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what is it, Mia?\u201d</p><p>The tiniest rebel teardrops formed in the edges of her eyes and she angrily swatted them away.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is the matter?\u201d I asked, softening. Mia wasn\u2019t prone to crocodile tears, or to any tears, really.</p><p>She shook her head. Lips sealed shut.</p><p>\u201cWill you just tell me? It can\u2019t be worse than what I\u2019m thinking, which is that you\u2019re ashamed of Shooting Star because you think we reek to holy hell.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s just,\u201d she paused, as if weighing some big decision. Then she sighed. \u201cThe band. When you\u2019re with the band, I already have to share you with everyone. I don\u2019t want to add my family to that pot, too.\u201d Then she lost the battle and started to cry.</p><p>All my annoyance melted. \u201cYou dumb-ass,\u201d I crooned, kissing her on the forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t share me. You own me.\u201d</p><p>Mia relented. Her whole family came to the festival. It was a fantastic weekend, twenty Northwest bands, not a rain cloud in sight. The whole thing went down in infamy, spawning a live recorded CD and a series of festivals that continue to this day.</p><p>Teddy had insisted on wearing the Mufflers, so Kat had spent an hour grumbling and digging through boxes in the basement until she\u2019d found them.</p><p>Mia generally liked to hang backstage at shows but when Shooting Star played, she was right in front of the stage, just clear of the mosh pit, dancing with Teddy the whole time.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>First you inspect me</p><p>Then you dissect me</p><p>Then you reject me</p><p>I wait for the day</p><p>That you\u2019ll resurrect me</p><p>\u201cANIMATE\u201d</p><p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TRACK 1</p><p>When our flight lands in London, it\u2019s pissing down rain, so it feels like home to both of us. It\u2019s five in the afternoon when we get in. We\u2019re due in Guildford that evening. We play the next night. Then it\u2019s countdown till total freedom. Mia and I have worked out a schedule for the next three months while I\u2019m touring and she\u2019s touring, breaks here and there where we can overlap, visit, see each other. It\u2019s not going to be delightful, but compared to the last three years, it\u2019ll still feel like heaven.</p><p>It\u2019s past eight when we get to the hotel. I\u2019ve asked Aldous to book me at the same place as the rest of the band, not just for the festival but the duration of the tour. Whatever their feelings are going to be about my leaving Shooting Star, sleeping two miles away ain\u2019t gonna minimize them. I haven\u2019t mentioned Mia to Aldous or anyone, and miraculously, we\u2019ve managed to keep her name out of the tabloids so far. No one seems to know that I\u2019d spent the last week in Asia with her. Everyone was too busy buzzing about Bryn\u2019s new love interest, some Australian actor.</p><p>There\u2019s a note at the front desk informing me that the band is having a private dinner in the atrium and asking me to join them. I suddenly feel like I\u2019m being led to my execution and after the fifteen-hour trip from Seoul would like nothing more than to shower first, just maybe see them tomorrow. But Mia has her hand on my side. \u201cNo, you should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come, too?\u201d I feel bad asking her. She just played three intensely amazing and crazily well-received concerts in Japan and Korea and then flew halfway around the world and directly into my psychodrama. But all of this will be bearable if she\u2019s with me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, if anyone\u2019s intruding, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The bellman grabs our stuff to take to our room, and the concierge leads us across the lobby. The hotel is in an old castle, but it\u2019s been taken over with rockers and a bunch of different musicians nod and \u201chey\u201d me, but I\u2019m too nervous right now to respond. The concierge leads us to a dimly lit atrium. The band\u2019s all in there, along with a giant buffet serving a traditional English roast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liz turns around first. Things haven\u2019t been the same between the two of us since that Collateral Damage tour, but the look she gives me now, I don\u2019t know how to describe it: Like I\u2019m her biggest disappointment in life, but she tries to rise above it, to tamp it down, to act all casual, like I\u2019m just one of the fans, one of the hangerson, one of the many people who want something from her that she\u2019s not obliged to give. \u201cAdam,\u201d she says with a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cLiz,\u201d I begin cautiously.</p><p>\u201cHey, ass**le! Nice of you to join us!\u201d Fitzy\u2019s irrepressible voice is both sarcastic and welcoming, like he just can\u2019t decide which way to go.</p><p>Mike doesn\u2019t say anything. He just pretends I don\u2019t exist.</p> <p>And then I feel the brush of Mia\u2019s shoulder as she steps out from behind me. \u201cHi, guys,\u201d she says.</p><p>Liz\u2019s face goes completely blank for a moment. Like she doesn\u2019t know who Mia is. Then she looks scared, like she\u2019s just seen a ghost. Then my strong, tough, butchy drummer\u2014her lower lip starts to tremble, and then her face crumples. \u201cMia?\u201d she asks, her voice quavering. \u201cMia?\u201d she asks louder this time. \u201cMia!\u201d she says, the tears streaming down her face right before she tackles my girl in a hug.</p><p>When she\u2019s released her, she holds Mia at arm\u2019s length and looks at her and then back at me and then back at Mia. \u201cMia?\u201d she shouts, both asking and answering her own question. Then she turns to me. And if I\u2019m not forgiven, then at least I\u2019m understood.</p><p>The rain keeps up throughout the next day. \u201cLovely English summer we\u2019re having,\u201d everyone jokes. It\u2019s become my habit to barricade myself at these types of giant festivals, but realizing that this is probably my last one for a while, at least as a participant, I slip inside the grounds, listen to some of the bands on the side stages, catch up with some old friends and acquaintances, and even talk to a couple of rock reporters. I\u2019m careful not to mention the breakup of the band. That\u2019ll come out in time, and I\u2019ll let everyone else decide how to release this news. I do, however, briefly comment on Bryn\u2019s and my split, which is all over the tabloids anyhow. Asked about my new mystery woman, I simply say \u201cno comment.\u201d I know this will all come out soon enough, and while I want to spare Mia the circus, I don\u2019t care if the whole world knows we\u2019re together.</p><p>By the time our nine P.M. slot rolls around, the rain has subsided to a soft mist that seems to dance in the late summer twilight. The crowd has long since accepted the slosh. There\u2019s mud everywhere and people are rolling around in it like it\u2019s Woodstock or something.</p> <p>Before the set, the band was nervous. Festivals do that to us. A bigger ante than regular concerts, even stadium shows\u2014festivals have exponentially larger crowds, and crowds that include our musician peers. Except tonight, I\u2019m calm. My chips are all cashed out. There\u2019s nothing to lose. Or maybe I\u2019ve already lost it and found it, and whatever else there might be to lose, it\u2019s got nothing to do with what\u2019s on this stage. Which might explain why I\u2019m having such a good time out here, pounding through our new songs on my old Les Paul Junior, another piece of history brought back from the dead. Liz did a double take when she saw me pull it out of its old case. \u201cI thought you got rid of that thing,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d I\u2019d replied, tossing off a private smile at Mia.</p><p>We race through the new album and then throw in some bones from Collateral Damage and before I know it, we\u2019re almost at the end of the set. I look down at the set list that\u2019s duct-taped to the front of the stage. Scrawled there in Liz\u2019s block lettering is the last song before we leave for the inevitable encore. \u201cAnimate.\u201d Our anthem, our old producer Gus Allen, called it. The angstiest screed on Collateral Damage, critics called it. Probably our biggest hit of all. It\u2019s a huge crowd-pleaser on tours because of the chorus, which audiences love to chant.</p><p>It\u2019s also one of the few songs we\u2019ve ever done with any kind of production, a strings section of violins right at the top of the recorded track, though we don\u2019t have those for the live version. So as we launch into it, it\u2019s not that rolling howl of the crowd\u2019s excitement that I hear, but the sound of her cello playing in my head. For a second, I have this vision of just the two of us in some anonymous hotel room somewhere dickering around, her on her cello, me on my guitar, playing this song I wrote for her. And shit, if that doesn\u2019t make me so damn happy.</p><p>I sing the song with all I\u2019ve got. Then we get to the chorus: Hate me. Devastate me. Annihilate me. Re-create me. Re-create me. Won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you re-create me.</p><p>On the album, the chorus is repeated over and over, a rasp of fury and loss, and it\u2019s become a thing during shows for me to stop singing and turn the mic out toward the audience and let them take over. So I turn the mic toward the fields, and the crowd just goes insane, singing my song, chanting my plea.</p> <p>I leave them at it and I take a little walk around the stage. The rest of the band sees what\u2019s going on so they just keep repping the chorus. When I get closer to the side of the stage, I see her there, where she always felt most comfortable, though for the foreseeable future, she\u2019ll be the one out here in the spotlight, and I\u2019ll be the one in the wings, and that feels right, too.</p><p>The audience keeps singing, keeps making my case, and I just keep strumming until I get close enough to see her eyes. And then I start singing the chorus. Right to her. And she smiles at me, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re the only two people out here, the only ones who know what\u2019s happening. Which is that this song we\u2019re all singing together is being rewritten. It\u2019s no longer an angry plea shouted to the void. Right here, on this stage, in front of eighty thousand people, it\u2019s becoming something else.</p><p>This is our new vow. </p> </body></html>"]
