An unseasonably warm day in January. Quite balmy with nary a breeze to ruffle her carefully arranged hair. It was as if the world stood still to witness the joining of two souls.</p><p>A snort rippled from Rionna McDonald\u2019s throat, eliciting a raised eyebrow from her soon-to-be husband.</p><p>The weather for her second wedding? Gloomy and dank with a winter storm pushing in from the west. Already a brisk chill had set in and the wind blew in fierce, relentless sheets. As if the world knew just how uncertain she was about the man who stood beside her, ready to recite the vows that would bind him to her forever.</p> <p>A shiver skirted up her spine despite the fact that they stood in front of the huge fire in the great hall.</p><p>Caelen frowned and stepped closer to Rionna as if to shield her from the draft blowing through the furs at the window. She took a hasty step back before thinking better of it. The man made her nervous, and not many people intimidated her.</p><p>He frowned harder, then turned his attention back to the priest.</p><p>Rionna cast a quick glance around, hoping no one had witnessed that particular exchange. It wouldn\u2019t do for people to think she was afraid of her new husband. Even if she was.</p><p>Ewan McCabe, the oldest McCabe brother and the first man she was supposed to have married, stood by his brother\u2019s side, his arms crossed over his broad chest. He looked anxious to be done with the whole thing.</p> <p>Alaric McCabe, the man she\u2019d very nearly wed after Ewan got himself married to Mairin Stuart, also looked impatient and kept glancing toward the stairs as if he might run out at any moment. Rionna couldn\u2019t blame him, though. His new wife, Keeley, was above stairs recovering from a wound that had nearly ended her life.</p><p>Third time was a charm, right?</p><p>King David wasn\u2019t standing for the occasion. He sat regally by the fire, looking on with approval as the priest droned on. Around him, also sitting, were the many lairds from neighboring lands. All waiting for the alliance between the McDonalds and the McCabes. An alliance that would be sealed upon her marriage to Caelen McCabe, the youngest\u2013and last\u2013McCabe brother.</p><p>It was important to denote last because if anything went amiss with this wedding, there were no more McCabes for her to marry, and at this point, her pride couldn\u2019t withstand another rejection.</p><p>Her gaze skittered from the king and assembled lairds to her dour-faced father who sat away from the assembled warriors, an unmanly, sullen pout twisting his features.</p><p>For a moment their stares locked and then his lip turned up into a snarl. She hadn\u2019t supported him in his bid to keep his position of laird. It was probably disloyal of her. She wasn\u2019t sure that Caelen McCabe would be a better laird, but surely he was a better man.</p> <p>She became aware that all eyes were on her. She glanced nervously toward the priest and realized that she\u2019d missed her cue to recite her vows. Even more embarrassing, she had no idea what the man had said.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you promise to obey me, cleave only unto me, and remain faithful all your days,\u201d Caelen drawled.</p><p>His words stiffened her spine and she couldn\u2019t call back the glare as she speared him with her gaze.</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly are you promising me?\u201d</p><p>His pale green eyes stroked coolly over her, assessing and then lifting as if he found nothing of import. She didn\u2019t like that look. He\u2019d all but dismissed her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll gain my protection and the respect due a lady of your station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>She whispered the words, and she\u2019d have given anything not to have let them slip. It was no wonder she\u2019d been left wanting, though. Ewan McCabe clearly adored his wife, Mairin, and Alaric had just defied king and country to be with the woman he loved\u2014effectively casting Rionna aside in the process.</p> <p>Not that she was angry. She dearly loved Keeley, and Keeley deserved happiness. That a man as strong and handsome as Alaric had publicly proclaimed his love for Keeley gladdened Rionna\u2019s heart.</p><p>But it also brought home how sterile her own marriage would be.</p><p>Caelen made a sound of exasperation. \u201cExactly what is it that you want, lass?\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin and stared back at him every bit as cool. \u201cNothing. \u2019Tis enough. I\u2019ll have your respect and your regard. I won\u2019t be needing your protection, though.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow rose. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I can see to my own protection.\u201d</p><p>Caelen chuckled and more laughter rose from the assembled men. \u201cSay your vows, lass. We don\u2019t have all day. The men are hungry. They\u2019ve been waiting a feast for nearly a fortnight now.\u201d</p><p>Agreement rumbled through the room and her cheeks burned. This was her wedding day and she wouldn\u2019t be rushed. Who cared about the food and the men\u2019s stomachs?</p><p>As if sensing that she was working herself into a righteous fury, Caelen reached over, snagged her hand, and pulled her up next to his side until his thigh burned into hers through the material of her dress.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Caelen said respectfully, \u201cif you\u2019ll tell the lass what she needs to say again.\u201d</p><p>Rionna fumed the entire way through the recitation. Tears pricked her eyelids but she couldn\u2019t even say why. It wasn\u2019t as if she and Alaric had been a love match any more than she and Caelen were. The entire idea of wedding one of the McCabe brothers had been hatched by her father and embraced by the McCabes and the king himself.</p><p>She was but a pawn to be used and discarded.</p><p>She sighed and then shook her head. It was ridiculous to be this maudlin. There were worse things. She should be happy. She\u2019d rediscovered the sister of her heart in Keeley, who was now happily married even if she faced a long recovery in the days ahead. And Rionna\u2019s father would no longer be laird of their clan.</p><p>She chanced another look only to see her father throw back yet another goblet of ale. She supposed she couldn\u2019t entirely blame him for being so deep into his cups. His entire way of life was gone in a moment\u2019s time. But she couldn\u2019t muster any regret.</p><p>Her clan could be great\u2014would be great\u2014under the right leadership. It had never been her father. He\u2019d weakened the McDonald name until they\u2019d been reduced to begging for the aid and alliance of a stronger clan.</p><p>Her free hand curled into a tight fist at her side. It had been her dream to restore their glory. To shape the soldiers into a formidable fighting force. Now it would be Caelen\u2019s task and she would be relegated to a position of observation rather than the participation she craved.</p><p>She gasped in surprise when Caelen suddenly leaned in and brushed his lips across hers. He was gone almost before she registered what he\u2019d done and she stood there staring wide-eyed as she raised a trembling hand to her mouth.</p><p>The ceremony was done. Even now the serving women were flooding into the hall, bearing a veritable bounty of food, much of which came from her own stores after her father\u2019s foolish wager several months ago.</p><p>Caelen watched her a moment and then gestured for her to walk ahead of him toward the high table. Rionna was gratified to see Mairin join her husband. In a sea of gruff, indistinguishable faces, Mairin McCabe was a ray of sunshine. Tired sunshine, but warm nonetheless.</p><p>Mairin hurried forward with a bright smile. \u201cRionna, you look so beautiful. There isn\u2019t a woman here who can hold a candle to you today.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s cheeks warmed under Mairin\u2019s praise. \u2019Twas the truth Rionna was a little ashamed to be wearing the same dress she\u2019d worn when she nearly married Alaric. She felt wrinkled, rumpled, and worn through. But the sincerity in Mairin\u2019s smile bolstered Rionna\u2019s flagging spirits.</p><p>Mairin gathered Rionna\u2019s hands in hers as if to offer further encouragement.</p><p>\u201cOh, your hands are like ice!\u201d Mairin exclaimed. \u201cI did so want to be present for your joining. I hope you\u2019ll accept my regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Rionna said with a genuine smile. \u201cHow is Keeley fairing this day?\u201d</p><p>Some of the worry lifted from Mairin\u2019s gaze. \u201cCome, sit so we may be served. And then I\u2019ll tell you of Keeley.\u201d</p><p>It irked Rionna that she first looked to her new husband only to catch his nod of permission. She gritted her teeth and moved to the table to sit beside Mairin. Already she was acting like a docile nitwit and she hadn\u2019t been married five minutes.</p><p>But in truth, Caelen frightened her. Alaric hadn\u2019t. Even Ewan didn\u2019t intimidate her. Caelen scared her witless.</p><p>Rionna slid into the chair beside Mairin, hoping for a brief reprieve before Caelen joined her. She wasn\u2019t so fortunate. Her husband pulled out the chair next to her and scooted to the table, his leg so close to hers that it pressed to the whole of her thigh.</p><p>Deciding it would be rude\u2014and obvious\u2014were she to slide toward Mairin, she decided instead to ignore him. She couldn\u2019t forget that it was acceptable for him to be so familiar now. They were wed.</p><p>She sucked in her breath as the realization hit her that he would of course exert his marital rights. Indeed, there was the whole wedding night, virginal deflowering. All the things women tittered about behind their hands when the men weren\u2019t around.</p><p>The problem was that Rionna was always with the men and she\u2019d never tittered in her life. Keeley had been separated from her at a young age, long before Rionna had grown curious over such matters.</p><p>With a lecher for a father and Rionna\u2019s constant fear for Keeley, the mere thought of coupling nauseated her. Now she had a husband who\u2019d expect ... Well, he\u2019d expect certain things, and God help her, she had no idea what.</p><p>Humiliation tightened her cheeks. She could ask Mairin. Or one of the McCabe women. They were all generous to a fault and they\u2019d all been kind to Rionna. But the idea of having to admit to them all just how ignorant she was of such matters made her want to hide under the table.</p><p>She could wield a sword better than most men. She could fight. And she was fast. She could be ruthless when provoked. She didn\u2019t suffer a gentle constitution nor did she faint at the sight of blood.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know the way of kissing.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to eat?\u201d Caelen asked.</p><p>She looked up to see that the places had been set and the food was on the table. Caelen had thoughtfully cut a choice piece of meat and placed it on her plate.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth, she was fair to starving.</p><p>\u201cWould you like water or ale?\u201d</p><p>\u2019Twas also true she never partook of spirits, but somehow today ale seemed to be the wise choice.</p><p>\u201cAle,\u201d she said, and waited as Caelen poured a gobletful. She reached for it but to her surprise, he put it to his mouth and first sniffed and then drank a small portion of the ale.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not poisoned,\u201d he said as he slid it toward her place.</p><p>She gaped at him, not comprehending what he\u2019d just done.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it had been poisoned?\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek. Just once. It was the only affectionate gesture he\u2019d offered her and it might not even be construed as affectionate, but it was soft and a little comforting.</p><p>\u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t have partaken of the poison, nor would you have died. We already nearly lost one McCabe to such cowardice. I\u2019ll not risk another.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! Think you that you dying somehow makes it all better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRionna, I just took sacred vows to protect you. That means I\u2019d lay down my life for you and for any future children we have. We\u2019ve already a snake in our midst trying to poison Ewan. Now that you and I are wed, what better way to prevent the alliance between our clans than to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you,\u201d she felt compelled to point out.</p><p>\u201cAye, \u2019tis a possibility. But if McDonald\u2019s only heir is dead then his clan effectively crumbles, which makes it easy pickings for Duncan Cameron. You are the heart of this alliance, Rionna. Whether you wish to believe it or not. Much rides on your shoulders. I guarantee you it won\u2019t be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I never imagined differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart lass.\u201d</p><p>He piddled with the goblet before sliding it toward her. Then he solicitously lifted it and held it to her mouth, just as a new husband would do for his bride during the wedding feast.</p><p>\u201cDrink, Rionna. You look exhausted. You\u2019re on edge. You\u2019re so stiff that it can\u2019t be comfortable. Take a drink and try to relax. We\u2019ve a long afternoon to endure.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t lied.</p><p>Rionna sat wearily at the table as toast after toast was given. There were toasts to the McCabes. Toasts to the new McCabe heir. Ewan and Mairin were the proud parents of a newborn lass, who also happened to be the heir to one of the largest and choicest holdings in all of Scotland.</p><p>Then there were toasts to Alaric and Keeley. To Keeley\u2019s health. Then the toasts to her marriage to Caelen began.</p><p>At one point they degenerated into lewd toasts to Caelen\u2019s prowess, and two lairds even began a wager as to how fast Rionna would find herself with child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rionna\u2019s eyes were glazing over and she wasn\u2019t entirely sure it was due to the lengthy accolades being tossed about. Her goblet had been refilled more times than she remembered but she drank on, ignoring the way it swirled around in her belly and made her head swim.</p><p>Laird McCabe had decreed that despite the many issues that bore discussion and the decisions that must be made, today would be spent in celebration of his brother\u2019s marriage.</p><p>Rionna suspected that Mairin had everything to do with that decree. She needn\u2019t have bothered, though. There was little cause for celebration in Rionna\u2019s mind.</p><p>She glanced sideways to see Caelen sitting back in his chair, lazily surveying the occupants of the table. He tossed back an insult when one was flung his way by one of the McCabe men. Something to do with his manhood. Rionna shuddered and purposely blanked her mind to the innuendo.</p> <p>She gulped down another mouthful of the ale and put the goblet back down on the table with a bang that made her wince. No one seemed to notice, but then it was unbearably loud.</p><p>The food before her swam in her vision, and the idea of putting it to her mouth, despite Caelen having cut the meat into bite-sized morsels, turned her stomach.</p><p>\u201cRionna, is anything amiss?\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s soft inquiry jolted Rionna from her semi-daze. She glanced guiltily up at the other woman and then blinked when Mairin suddenly became two people.</p><p>\u201cI should like to see Keeley,\u201d she blurted.</p> <p>If the laird\u2019s wife thought it odd that Rionna would wish to visit with Keeley on Rionna\u2019s wedding day, she didn\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up with you if you like.\u201d</p><p>Rionna sighed in relief then started to rise from her seat. Caelen\u2019s hand snapped around her wrist and he tugged her back down, a frown marring his features.</p><p>\u201cI wish to see Keeley since she wasn\u2019t able to attend my wedding,\u201d Rionna said. \u201cWith your permission, of course.\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked on the words.</p><p>He studied her for a brief moment then relaxed his grip on her wrist. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded so imperious. So ... husbandlike.</p><p>Her stomach heaved as she excused herself to the laird. Married. Jesus wept, but she was married. She was expected to submit to her husband. To obey him.</p><p>Her hands shook as she followed Mairin toward the stairs. They walked quietly up, one of Ewan\u2019s men tagging along behind, but then Mairin went nowhere without an escort.</p><p>Merciful heaven, would she be expected to be led about by the reins now that she was married to Caelen? The idea of being unable to go anywhere or do anything without someone breathing down her neck suffocated her.</p><p>At Keeley\u2019s door, Mairin knocked softly. Alaric answered, and Mairin spoke in low tones with her brother by marriage.</p><p>Alaric nodded and stepped out but then said, \u201cTry not to be overlong. She tires easily.\u201d</p><p>Rionna glanced at the man who would have been her husband and couldn\u2019t help a silent comparison between him and his younger brother. The man she now found herself wed to.</p><p>There was no doubt both were fierce warriors, but she still couldn\u2019t help but feel she would have preferred marriage to Alaric. He didn\u2019t seem as ... cold ... as Caelen. Or indifferent. Or ... something.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it, but there was something in Caelen\u2019s eyes that unsettled her, that made her wary, like prey poised to flee a predator. He made her feel tiny, defenseless. Feminine.</p><p>\u201cRionna,\u201d Alaric said with a nod. \u201cCongratulations on your marriage.\u201d</p><p>There was still a hint of guilt in his eyes, and truly, she wasn\u2019t resentful. Not of why he hadn\u2019t married her. His falling in love with Keeley hadn\u2019t quite managed to banish her humiliation of being jilted, though. She was working on it.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She waited until Alaric passed her and then she entered Keeley\u2019s chamber.</p><p>Keeley lay propped on an abundance of pillows. She was pale and lines of fatigue etched grooves on her forehead. Still, she smiled weakly when her gaze met Rionna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry I missed your wedding,\u201d Keeley said.</p><p>Rionna smiled and went to her bed. She perched on the edge so she wouldn\u2019t cause Keeley pain and then gingerly reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twas not of import. I barely remember it myself.\u201d</p><p>Keeley snorted and a spasm of pain crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cI had to see you,\u201d Rionna whispered. \u201cThere was something ... I wanted to seek your counsel on something.\u201d</p><p>Keeley\u2019s eyes widened in surprise and then she glanced beyond Rionna to Mairin. \u201cOf course. Is it all right if Mairin stays? She\u2019s completely trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>Rionna cast a hesitant glance in Mairin\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should go down and fetch us some ale,\u201d Mairin suggested. \u201c \u2019Twill give you time to speak freely.\u201d</p><p>Rionna sighed. \u201cNay, I\u2019ll wait. \u2019Tis the truth I could use the counsel of more than one woman. Keeley is newly married after all.\u201d</p><p>A soft blush suffused Keeley\u2019s cheeks and Mairin chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll send for the ale then, and we\u2019ll talk. You have my word, naught will pass the doors of this chamber.\u201d</p><p>Rionna looked gratefully at Mairin, and then Mairin went to the door and conversed with Gannon, the warrior who\u2019d accompanied them up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHow easily is sound carried through the doors?\u201d Rionna whispered to Keeley.</p><p>\u201cI can assure you that nothing can be heard from the halls,\u201d Keeley said, a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cNow what matter would you like to discuss?\u201d</p><p>Rionna dutifully waited until Mairin returned to Keeley\u2019s bedside and then she licked her lips, feeling the worst sort of fool for exposing her ignorance.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis about the marriage bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Mairin said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cAh, indeed,\u201d Keeley said with a nod.</p><p>Rionna blew out her breath in frustration. \u201cWhat am I to do? What am I supposed to do? I know nothing of kissing and coupling or ... anything. \u2019Tis a sword and fighting I have knowledge of.\u201d</p><p>Mairin\u2019s expression softened and the amusement fled from her eyes. She covered Rionna\u2019s hand with her own and squeezed. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth that not too long ago, I was in your same position. I sought out the counsel of some older ladies of the clan. \u2019Twas an eye-opening experience to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, as did I,\u201d Keeley admitted. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as though we\u2019re born with such knowledge, and none of us had mothers to guide us through such things.\u201d She cast an apologetic look to Rionna. \u201cAt least I assume your mother never discussed such delicate issues with you.\u201d</p><p>Rionna snorted. \u201cShe despaired of me from the time I grew breasts.\u201d</p><p>Keeley\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cYou grew breasts?\u201d</p><p>Rionna flushed and glanced down at her bosom. Her flat bosom. If Keeley\u2014or anyone\u2014actually knew what lay beneath the wrappings ... Her husband would know soon enough, unless Rionna figured out a way to consummate a marriage fully clothed.</p><p>Mairin smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis not so difficult, Rionna. The men do most of the work, as they should in the beginning. Once you learn your way around, well, then you can certainly do all manner of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaric is wonderful at loving,\u201d Keeley said with a sigh.</p><p>Mairin colored and cleared her throat. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I didn\u2019t think Ewan overly skilled at first. Our wedding night was hastened by the fact that Duncan Cameron\u2019s army bore down on us. \u2019Twas an insult Ewan took exception to and made great effort to remedy. With very satisfying results, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s cheeks warmed as she glanced between the two women. Their eyes became all dreamy and soft as they spoke of their husbands. Rionna couldn\u2019t imagine ever having such a reaction to Caelen. He was simply too ... forbidding. Aye, that was an apt description.</p><p>A knock at the door interrupted the discussion and the women went silent. Mairin issued a summons, and Gannon stepped inside, a disapproving look on his face.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gannon,\u201d Mairin said, as he set the flagon and the goblets on the small table beside Keeley\u2019s bed. \u201cYou may go now.\u201d</p><p>He scowled but backed out of the room. Rionna glanced up at Mairin, curious as to why she accepted such insolence from her husband\u2019s man. Mairin simply smiled smugly as she poured the ale into the goblets.</p><p>\u201cHe knows we\u2019re up to mischief and it\u2019s killing him to say nothing.\u201d</p><p>She handed Rionna a goblet and then carefully placed one into Keeley\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth it will dull the pain,\u201d Keeley said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Keeley. Would you like me to go? I have no wish to cause you further distress,\u201d Rionna said.</p><p>Keeley sipped at the ale and then leaned back against her pillows with a sigh. \u201cNay. I\u2019m about to go mad being sequestered in my chamber. I welcome the company. Besides, we must ease your fears about your wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Rionna gulped at her ale and then extended the goblet to Mairin for it to be refilled. She had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to like this conversation.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis no reason to fear,\u201d Mairin soothed. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt Caelen will take care with you.\u201d Then she wrinkled her nose. \u201cGive thanks you don\u2019t have an army bearing down on you. \u2019Tis the truth I had no liking for my wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Rionna felt the blood drain from her face.</p><p>\u201cHush, Mairin. You aren\u2019t helping,\u201d Keeley chided.</p><p>Mairin patted Rionna\u2019s hand. \u201cAll will be well. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what is it that you know?\u201d Keeley asked. \u201cLet\u2019s start there.\u201d</p><p>Rionna closed her eyes in misery and then downed the entire contents of her goblet. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Mairin said. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I was ignorant, but the nuns at the abbey did see fit to provide me cursory information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should be honest with Caelen about your fears,\u201d Keeley suggested. \u201cHe\u2019d be a brute to ignore a maiden\u2019s worry. If he has half of Alaric\u2019s skill, you\u2019ll not be left wanting.\u201d</p><p>Mairin giggled at the boast, and Rionna held out her goblet for another round of ale.</p><p>The very last thing she wanted was to talk to Caelen about her maidenly fears. The man would probably laugh at her. Or worse, give her that cool, indifferent gaze that made her feel so ... insignificant.</p><p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d she strangled out.</p><p>Mairin\u2019s lips pursed in thought. Keeley\u2019s brow wrinkled a moment.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth it\u2019s not overly pleasant. At first. But the pain passes quickly and if the man is skilled, it\u2019s quite wonderful in the end.\u201d</p><p>Mairin snorted. \u201cAgain, as long as there isn\u2019t an army bearing down on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the army,\u201d Keeley said in exasperation. \u201cThere is no army.\u201d</p><p>Then the two women looked at each other and laughed until Keeley groaned and went limp against her pillows.</p><p>Rionna just stared at them, never more certain that she had no desire to indulge in this marriage bed business. She yawned broadly and the room spun in curious little circles. Her head felt as though it weighed as much as a boulder, and it was harder and harder for her to hold it up.</p><p>She stood from her perch on the edge of Keeley\u2019s bed and started for the door, disgusted with her cowardice. She was acting ... Well, she was acting just like a woman.</p><p>To her utter dismay, she ended up at the window and she blinked in confusion as a blast of cold air hit her in the face and the corner of the furs blew up.</p><p>\u201cCareful, there,\u201d Mairin said in her ear.</p><p>She guided Rionna to a chair in the corner of the room and eased her down.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps \u2019tis best if you sit here awhile. It wouldn\u2019t do for you to navigate those stairs, and we don\u2019t want the men to know what we\u2019ve been about.\u201d</p><p>Rionna nodded. She did feel a bit peculiar. Aye, it would be best if she sat awhile until the room stopped spinning in such spectacular fashion.</p><p>Caelen looked toward the stairs for what seemed like the hundredth time, and Ewan looked impatient as well. Rionna and Mairin had been gone for some time. It was late into the night and Caelen was ready to have done with the entire wedding celebration.</p><p>Some celebration. His bride had been stiff and distant throughout the entire ceremony, and afterward she\u2019d sat silent while the room celebrated around her.</p><p>If her demeanor was anything to go by, she was even less thrilled than he with the match. It mattered naught. They were both bound by duty. And right now his duty was to consummate his marriage.</p><p>His loins tightened, and the surge of lust took him by surprise. It had been a long while since he\u2019d had such a strong reaction to a woman. But it had been thus since the day he\u2019d laid eyes on Rionna.</p><p>He\u2019d been shamed by his reaction to his brother\u2019s betrothed. It was disloyal and disrespectful to feel such a keen burning in his gut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But no matter that he damned himself, it didn\u2019t change the fact that she had only to walk in the room and his body leapt to life.</p><p>And now she was his.</p><p>He searched the entrance to the stairs one more time and then sent a pointed stare toward Ewan. It was time to collect his wife and take her to bed.</p><p>Ewan nodded then stood. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that the king was still heartily enjoying himself. Ewan merely announced that the festivities were at their end and that everyone should seek their beds.</p> <p>Everyone would reconvene in the morning and talks would begin. Ewan had a legacy to claim on behalf of his daughter and there was a war to wage against Duncan Cameron.</p><p>Caelen followed Ewan up the stairs where they were met by Gannon.</p><p>\u201cLady McCabe took to her chamber an hour ago when the babe awoke for feeding,\u201d Gannon said to Ewan.</p><p>\u201cAnd my wife?\u201d Caelen drawled.</p><p>\u201cStill within Keeley\u2019s chamber. Alaric is in Keeley\u2019s old chamber, but he\u2019s losing patience and fair itching to get back to Keeley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou may tell him Rionna will be gone within the minute,\u201d Caelen said as he strode toward the door.</p><p>He knocked, only because \u2019twas Keeley\u2019s chamber and he had no wish to alarm her by barging in. \u2019Twas an insult for Rionna to have spent so much time above stairs, missing most of their wedding celebration.</p><p>Upon hearing Keeley\u2019s soft summons, he opened the door and entered.</p><p>His expression eased when he saw Keeley propped haphazardly on her pillows. She looked as though she was about to slide off the bed, and he hurried to prop her up. Exhaustion ringed her eyes and she grunted as he positioned her better.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis all right,\u201d she said with a small smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come for Rionna.\u201d He frowned when he realized she wasn\u2019t present.</p><p>Keeley nodded toward the far corner. \u201cShe\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned and, to his surprise, saw her propped in a chair against the wall, sound asleep, her mouth open and her head tilted back. Then as he took a closer look around the room, he saw the tankard of ale and the empty goblets.</p><p>With a suspicious frown, he peered into the tankard only to find it empty. He glanced back at Keeley, whose eyes looked precariously close to rolling back in her head, and then back to Rionna, who hadn\u2019t stirred a wit. He remembered all the ale she\u2019d consumed at the table below stairs and how little she\u2019d eaten.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soused!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Keeley mumbled. \u201cAll right, probably.\u201d</p><p>Caelen shook his head. Foolheaded females.</p><p>He started toward Rionna when Keeley\u2019s soft entreaty stopped him.</p> <p>\u201cBe gentle with her, Caelen. She\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, stared down at the passed out woman in the chair, and then slowly turned to look back at Keeley. \u201cIs that what this is about? She got herself soused because she\u2019s afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>Keeley\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cNot of you particularly. Well, I suppose that could be part of it. But, Caelen, she\u2019s frightfully ... ignorant of ...\u201d</p><p>She broke off and blushed to the roots of her hair.</p><p>\u201cI understand your meaning,\u201d Caelen said gruffly. \u201cNo offense, Keeley, but \u2019tis a matter between me and my wife. I\u2019ll be taking her now. You should be resting, not consuming ridiculous amounts of ale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re too rigid?\u201d Keeley groused.</p><p>Caelen leaned down and slid his arms underneath Rionna\u2019s slight body and lifted her. She weighed next to nothing, and to his surprise, he liked the feel of her in his arms. It was ... nice.</p><p>He strode toward the door, barked an order to Gannon whom he knew to be standing on the other side, and the door quickly opened. In the hall Caelen met Alaric, who raised his eyebrow inquiringly.</p><p>\u201cSee to your own wife,\u201d Caelen said rudely. \u201cShe\u2019s probably unconscious by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alaric demanded.</p><p>But Caelen ignored him and continued on to his chamber. He shouldered his way in and then gently laid Rionna down on his bed. With a sigh, he stepped back to stare down at her.</p><p>So the little warrior was frightened. And to escape him, she\u2019d drank herself into oblivion. Hardly complimentary to Caelen, but then he supposed he couldn\u2019t blame her. He hadn\u2019t been ... Well, he hadn\u2019t been a lot of things.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he began peeling away her clothing until she was down to her underclothes. His hands shook as he smoothed the thin linen garment over her body.</p><p>He could see nothing of her breasts. She was a slight woman and she didn\u2019t have much in the way of a bosom. Her body was lean and toned, unlike any other woman he\u2019d ever encountered.</p><p>He ached to lift the hem of her underdress and pull it away from her body until she was naked to his gaze. It was his right. She was his wife.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it.</p><p>He could wake her now and assert his husbandly rights, but he had a sudden desire to see her eyes flame with the same want he felt. He wanted to hear her soft cries of pleasure. He didn\u2019t want her to be afraid.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. When she woke in the morning, she\u2019d likely have a raging headache, and she\u2019d wonder what the hell happened the night before.</p><p>He might have a conscience about taking what was rightfully his until she was prepared to surrender herself body and soul, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to know it right away.</p><p>He slid into bed beside her and pulled the heavy fur over the both of them. The scent of her hair curled through his nose, and the warmth from her body beckoned to him.</p><p>With a muttered curse, he turned over until he faced away.</p><p>To his utter dismay, she murmured in her sleep and then snuggled up against his back, her warm, lush body molded so tightly to his that he hadn\u2019t a prayer of sleeping this night.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Something or someone was sitting on Rionna\u2019s head. She moaned softly and batted at the offending object only to find herself swatting at air.</p><p>She forced her eyelids open and promptly regretted that action. Though it was dark, just the air sliding over her eyeballs made her twitch in agony.</p><p>As she lay there she became aware of other peculiarities. Such as the very warm, very hard body next to her, and the fact that she was clad in only her underdress.</p><p>Her hand flew to her bosom and she felt the linen binding around her breasts. It was still in place, which meant her husband hadn\u2019t been too invasive, nor did he realize the fullness of her breasts. Not that she cared if he knew. He was her husband after all. He\u2019d know soon enough. It wasn\u2019t as if she could hide them forever.</p><p>She searched her memory but couldn\u2019t summon a single image of what had happened the night before. The last thing she remembered was standing in front of Keeley\u2019s window.</p><p>Now she was lying in bed next to her ... husband.</p><p>Did it count as consummation if she couldn\u2019t remember it? Shouldn\u2019t she have shed more clothing than she had? Keeley and Mairin hadn\u2019t gone over specifics such as that. Then she realized that if she had no memory of the event, it couldn\u2019t have been so bad, could it?</p><p>Humiliation burned her cheeks and tightened her chest. What on earth was she to say to him? How could she face him? What if she\u2019d acted like a harlot? What if she\u2019d disappointed him, or worse, what if her lack of skill had disgusted him?</p><p>Despite the throbbing in her head and the nausea boiling in her stomach, she eased from the bed and shivered as the cold slid over her body. The warrior put off a lot of heat and it had been toasty warm in the bed.</p><p>Thank the good lord she couldn\u2019t see him. She\u2019d been close enough to him to know he hadn\u2019t worn a tunic. What if he ... What if he were completely naked?</p><p>She was torn between wanting to run from the room with all haste and succumbing to the absurd urge to peek under the covers.</p><p>Close on the heels of that dilemma came the realization that this was his chamber, not the one afforded to her as a guest.</p><p>She stumbled over her wedding finery that lay on the floor and heat singed her cheeks all over again. Had he undressed her? Had she?</p><p>She yanked on the gown and held it up as best she could before cracking the door open to peer into the hall. It was dimly lit by half-burned wall candles and, as best she could tell, empty.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>She pushed out of the chamber and fled down the hall to hers. She stripped off the dress and donned what she was more comfortable in. Warm trews, a worn tunic, and leather boots. She needed to clear her head despite its horrendous ache, and the only way she knew to do that was with a good fight.</p><p>Caelen awoke to find his bed empty and a cold draft blowing over his privates. He yanked up the furs with a muttered curse and then searched the room for his wife\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>She was nowhere to be found, which irritated him. He was always the first one up and about in the keep. Even Ewan, who rose early and retired late, never managed to rise earlier than Caelen.</p><p>It was a time he had grown to crave for its solitude. While the rest of the keep slept, he began the day, sometimes with a swim in the loch and other times honing his fighting skills.</p><p>He tossed aside the furs and stood naked as he stretched and allowed the first brush of cold to blow over his skin, awakening him. His blood surged to life, throwing off the lethargy of sleep.</p><p>He poured water from a pitcher into the washbasin and then splashed his face and washed out his mouth. Either his wife was mortified or she was sending a clear message about her feelings on the marriage. Either way, parameters had to be set, and there was no time like the present to let his new bride know the way of things.</p><p>After he found her.</p><p>After dressing, he slipped into the hall. Normally he\u2019d not worry about being quiet, but the king was in residence and everyone had stayed up late into the night, plus he had no wish for anyone to know his wife had fled his bed.</p><p>He scowled as he stopped outside her chamber door. To hell with knocking. He pushed open the door and was greeted by darkness and ... cold. No fire was lit.</p><p>It occurred to him that he hadn\u2019t lit a fire in his own chamber, a practice he was accustomed to, but Rionna was a slight lass and no doubt she\u2019d woken with chattering teeth.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t used to accommodating others. Particularly in his private rooms. But he was married now, and he supposed some concessions would have to be made. He\u2019d show his wife that he could be a reasonable man.</p><p>He strode inside but found the bed empty and undisturbed. Slung over a chair was her wedding dress. The one he\u2019d taken off her the night before.</p><p>Where had she gotten off to at this hour?</p><p>Suspicion nipped at his gut until his belly clenched. Surely the lass wouldn\u2019t be fool enough to sneak to a lover\u2019s bed on her wedding night. What other reason would a woman have for leaving the warmth of her bed in the middle of the night?</p><p>If there was a problem, she should have awakened him. He was her husband now, and it was his duty to solve any issues that arose.</p><p>The more he pondered, the angrier he got. Old betrayals still soured his belly, despite his best effort to put them behind him.</p><p>It was hard not to dwell on all that Elsepeth had done when she\u2019d changed the entire course of the McCabe clan. His current marriage was the result of her betrayal. His attempt to remedy the foolishness of youth and allowing emotion to cloud his judgment.</p><p>For years, his clan had struggled to survive its near decimation at the hands of Duncan Cameron. Only in recent months, with Ewan\u2019s marriage to Mairin and the birth of Isabel, were things finally looking up for his kin.</p><p>How could he refuse to do the one thing that would solidify a union that would bring about the destruction of a man hated by him and his brothers above all others?</p><p>By God, he may have had no choice but to wed Rionna McDonald, but it didn\u2019t mean he was going to be made a cuckold, or that he\u2019d let his wife run wild as her father had done for years.</p><p>He was now her laird whether she liked that fact or not, and if she did nothing else, she\u2019d obey him.</p><p>The sound of steel striking steel drifted through her window. He frowned and strode over to lift the fur. Her room overlooked the courtyard, but who would be sparring so early. And why?</p><p>He leaned out to see torches surrounding a small area in the middle of the courtyard. Two men were sparring furiously. One of the fools was going to get himself killed. As one turned, Caelen caught the flash of golden hair and the decidedly feminine set of the lips pursed in concentration.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>One of the fools was his wife.</p><p>He let the furs fall back to cover the window and he turned to stalk from her chamber. Shaking his head, he descended the stairs only to have Cormac fall in next to him when he strode into the great hall.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Rionna was out sparring?\u201d Caelen bit out.</p><p>Cormac\u2019s eyes widened and he looked abashed\u2014and uncertain as to what to say.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI only just arose.\u201d</p><p>Caelen glanced at him in disgust. \u201cAre you growing soft and lazy on me?\u201d</p><p>Cormac grinned, undisturbed by Caelen\u2019s censure. \u201cI find now that I have a soft, warm lass in my bed every night, \u2019tis hard to find motivation to rise so damn early.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caelen grunted.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, why your lass is out of your bed the morning after she wed with you. One might draw some interesting conclusions.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sent him a chilling glare.</p><p>Not in the least bit worried over Caelen\u2019s mood, Cormac continued. \u201cWhy, the very fact that she has the strength to spar suggests that you did something ... well, not right.\u201d</p> <p>Cormac\u2019s smug teasing made Caelen\u2019s lips turn up into a snarl. \u201cI\u2019d wager that Christina wouldn\u2019t care too much for a toothless husband.\u201d</p><p>Cormac held up his hands in surrender, but he wore that stupid grin all the way outside.</p><p>Caelen welcomed the brisk chill. It was a reminder to him never to get too comfortable. Never let his guard down. When men became too ensconced in their own comfort, it was inevitably their downfall.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t happen to him. Not if he could help it. Nor would it happen to his clan\u2014both new and old.</p><p>\u201cShe has skill,\u201d Cormac noted.</p> <p>Caelen scowled again as they approached the area lit by the torches.</p><p>\u201cRionna!\u201d he barked.</p><p>Her head yanked in his direction just as the other man\u2019s sword flew. Directly at her exposed neck.</p><p>Caelen thrust his sword forward to deflect the blow, and Rionna\u2019s eyes widened as the tip of her sparring partner\u2019s blade stopped within an inch of her flesh.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Caelen knocked the sword from her opponent\u2019s hand and sent him a look that had him backing away in a hurry.</p><p>If he expected his wife to be frightened, abashed, or grateful that he\u2019d prevented her death, he was wrong.</p> <p>She was bloody furious.</p><p>Her eyes sparking with demonic light in the glow of the torches, she turned on him, reminding him of a spitting kitten. The comparison would probably only make her angrier, but it was an amusing enough thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think you were doing?\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou could have gotten me killed! You don\u2019t bellow at someone when they\u2019re sparring!\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and he advanced on her, furious that she\u2019d address him thusly in front of others.</p><p>\u201cThink you that distractions don\u2019t exist on the battlefield, Rionna? Think you that no one will ever shout at you? A warrior is strong, not just physically but in the mind as well. Allowing yourself to become distracted during battle will get you killed.\u201d</p><p>She flushed and looked away, her sword lowered toward her feet.</p><p>\u201cNor do you ever lower your sword. You\u2019re now completely vulnerable to attack.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted in anger. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point, husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave I? I think not. I\u2019m only about to begin to make my point. You will take yourself inside at once. You\u2019ll not indulge in such activities again. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open and those golden eyes flashed with rage\u2014and humiliation.</p><p>\u201cWhen you present yourself to the table to break your fast, you\u2019ll do so as a credit to the McCabe clan, and you\u2019ll show respect due the king and the laird of this clan.\u201d</p><p>Her lips snapped shut and formed a mutinous frown. He took another step forward until there was no space separating them. He\u2019d never admit it, in a thousand years, but the sight and smell of her, all disheveled from swordplay, had his cock about to split at the seams.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have her running about in this manner of dress or doing battle with the men because he\u2019d be naught but a walking erection.</p><p>He waved a hand to dismiss her and to let her know she was dismissed. As she turned away, he called after her.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Rionna? Take a bath. You stink.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Stink. He\u2019d told her she stank! Rionna slid farther down in the tub until water lapped at her ears. They still burned with mortification, and she could still hear the men\u2019s laughter ringing in her ears as she\u2019d all but fled into the keep.</p><p>He\u2019d humiliated her. Not just with words but by actions. He\u2019d proven her inept and she\u2019d committed the sin of allowing herself to become distracted.</p><p>She knew all of this. She wasn\u2019t an idiot. She could hold her own with a sword, and yet from the moment she\u2019d become aware of his presence, all sense had flown right out of her mind.</p><p>She\u2019d become nothing more than a bumbling fool playing at being a man. Her disgust knew no bounds.</p><p>A knock sounded at her door. She frowned and sunk so low in the tub that only her nose and eyes stuck out of the water. A moment later, the door opened and Maddie stuck her head in.</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are, lass. Caelen thought you might be needing help. He wants you below stairs to break your fast in half an hour\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh he does, does he?\u201d Rionna muttered.</p><p>\u201cLet me help wash your hair. \u2019Twill take some doing to get it all dry in such a short time. You have such long, thick hair. \u2019Tis as beautiful as a sunset over the loch.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s praise bolstered Rionna\u2019s flagging spirits. She knew she wasn\u2019t beautiful. Keeley was beautiful. Rionna ... Well, part of it was her fault. She could have practiced being more feminine when she was younger.</p><p>Now her body had lost some of her youthful softness and she had muscles that no lady should ever have. Her arms were firm. Her waist slender. Her legs were hard with muscle, and no flab gathered at her hips. In fact she was quite narrow.</p><p>The only womanly place on her was her breasts, and she despaired of them. They simply didn\u2019t match the rest of her.</p><p>Which is why she kept them bound. They simply got in her way and they were a great distraction.</p><p>There were occasions when her father insisted she dress as a woman, the few times the McDonalds hosted honored guests. Her mother\u2019s gowns had been altered, but the bodice had still been too tight. Her breasts had strained the limits of the bodice, and the result was men making twits of themselves as they stared lasciviously at her cleavage.</p><p>Men were ridiculous. Show them a breast and they became slobbering fools.</p><p>And one man was a fool above all others and \u2019twas him she feared the most. As long as she remained boyish in figure, she didn\u2019t have to worry about drawing unwanted attention.</p><p>\u201cWell, lass? Are you going to sit there all day while the water grows cold or are you going to let me wash your hair so we can get you ready to go below stairs?\u201d</p><p>Rionna shook herself from her thoughts and then nodded. Maddie briskly fetched a wooden bucket from the window and then motioned for Rionna to sit forward in the tub. As Rionna sat up, Maddie\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWell now, where have you been hiding those?\u201d</p><p>Rionna looked down and flushed as she became aware that Maddie was staring at her exposed breasts. They bobbed in the water and Rionna laid her arm across her chest to push them down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cursed,\u201d Rionna muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lordie, no you\u2019re not cursed. Lasses would kill to have a shape like that. Does your husband know what he\u2019s got?\u201d</p><p>Rionna scowled.</p><p>Maddie let out a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. Oh my but is he in for a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be seeing them for a while if I have my way.\u201d</p><p>Maddie hooted again and then poured a bucket of water over Rionna\u2019s head. \u201cSurely you aren\u2019t going to hide them forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Not forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s not going to want a peek at your treasures when he beds you?\u201d</p><p>Rionna frowned. \u201cHow do you know ...\u201d</p><p>Maddie made a tsking sound. \u201cOh come now, lass. You were as drunk as an old warrior put out to pasture and there was no stain on your bed. Unless you\u2019re going to tell me you weren\u2019t a maiden.\u201d</p><p>Another flush crawled over Rionna\u2019s face. Maddie was as forward as they came, and Rionna wasn\u2019t used to the counsel of other women. It made her distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time to warm your husband\u2019s bed,\u201d Maddie advised. \u201cUntil then you need to give him a taste of what he\u2019s missing so far. The lad\u2019s tongue will be hanging out his mouth if you show those breasts to their best advantage.\u201d</p><p>Rionna shook her head. \u201c \u2019Tis not my husband\u2019s reaction I\u2019m concerned with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you Caelen would allow another man to get near his wife? Come now, lass. You may have worried before about untoward advances, but if a woman can\u2019t look her finest at her own wedding celebration, then when can she? A man would be a fool to approach you with your new husband there beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Rionna asked warily.</p><p>Maddie shot her a smug smile as she began rinsing away the soap. \u201cYou leave that to me. I think I have just the thing.\u201d</p><p>Caelen was growing more irritated by the minute. The king had already sat down to break his fast and yet they still awaited Rionna\u2019s presence. Even Mairin, who was still weak from childbirth and nursing a babe, was seated at her husband\u2019s side, waiting for the meal and the talks to commence afterward.</p><p>He was about to go drag her down the stairs himself when a hush fell over the room. Indeed, the silence was so pronounced that unease prickled over his nape.</p><p>When he saw all attention focused on the entrance to the hall, he turned to follow the stares. His first reaction was one of aggravation, given that she\u2019d made them wait so long. But then he took in her appearance, and he was puzzled by what was different.</p><p>He was slower to catch on than those around him, maybe because he was more focused on the fact that she was late. But realization, when it hit him, made his mouth drop open. He snapped it shut and glanced hastily around to make sure no one had caught his reaction.</p><p>Then he jerked his gaze back to his wife.</p><p>There had never been a doubt that she was a comely woman. She had eyes of an unusual shade. Amber and golden. Much like her hair. Not red or even auburn, but not exactly blond either. Depending on which way the sun hit her, the locks were golden, sometimes russet, lighter and darker. A fascinating blend of the sky at sunset.</p><p>Aye, she could even be considered beautiful, if she weren\u2019t always dressed as a man with dirt on her face and hands.</p><p>But now ...</p><p>Jesus wept. The woman had breasts. Who knew? He swallowed back the instant knot in his throat. He wouldn\u2019t be expected to have such a reaction. By all accounts, he should have discovered this most interesting detail last night. When he was supposed to have bedded his new bride.</p><p>Where the hell had she hidden such a bounty of femininity?</p><p>And furthermore, why?</p><p>She was attired in a fine gown, one that seemed familiar to him. He glanced in Mairin\u2019s direction, realizing that it had been made for her. On Mairin it had been handsome enough, but on Rionna it was spectacular.</p><p>Rionna looked ... dainty. Not a word that would have ever come to mind before. Fragile and feminine. Her hair was swept up atop her head, and strands slid down her neck like little sips of sunshine.</p><p>She also looked extremely uncertain.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow at his little warrior as fear crowded into her eyes. He would have thought she\u2019d cut her own throat before allowing anyone to see her fear.</p><p>But now, twice in less than a day, he\u2019d seen fear and vulnerability in his bride\u2019s eyes and it made him want to do daft things.</p><p>Like lie beside her all night because he worried he\u2019d frighten her more if he bedded her.</p><p>He almost snorted. Of all the stupid things, that was probably the most. If his men knew of his sudden patience, they\u2019d laugh him out of the keep.</p><p>Which was why he had to pretend he\u2019d already seen the feast of feminine flesh that his wife now had on display.</p><p>He scowled at the ogling men and then stepped forward to assist his wife into her seat. He was still scowling when he greeted her, which was likely why tight lines appeared around her eyes and mouth.</p><p>He meant to tell her that she looked nice and he wholeheartedly approved of the change. What came out, however, was not what he planned.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cover yourself properly? \u2019Tis indecent.\u201d</p><p>She yanked her arm from his hand, fixed him with a glare that would shrivel a man\u2019s cods, and then elegantly seated herself, leaving him to feel like the worst sort of tyrant.</p><p>He glared again at his men when they continued to stare with their tongues wagging about like they\u2019d never set eyes on a lass.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Rionna,\u201d Mairin said from across the table.</p><p>Guilt crept up Caelen\u2019s neck. It should have been him who acknowledged how regal and, yes, beautiful, his wife looked. It shouldn\u2019t be left to others to comment in order to remove his insensitive remarks.</p><p>And yet he couldn\u2019t open his mouth to remedy his error.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a finer bride,\u201d the king said with a broad smile.</p><p>Caelen scowled at the king and ignored Ewan\u2019s look of reprimand.</p><p>David merely laughed and dug into his food.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a good thing we\u2019ve done, Ewan,\u201d David said heartily as he wiped his mouth with the back of his arm.</p><p>Caelen wished he could be so sure this alliance was necessary. Still, his brother looked more at ease than he had in many months spent worrying over Mairin and Isabel and Duncan Cameron. And Alaric looked ... content. For too long Alaric had been tormented by an impossible choice. The woman he loved or his loyalty to his clan. Having chosen wrong before, Caelen didn\u2019t feel qualified to decide on such matters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With everyone so bloody happy around him, it was hard to make the argument that the right thing hadn\u2019t been done. The only problem was that he and Rionna seemed to be the only ones not happy.</p><p>Ewan cast a glance in Caelen\u2019s direction before turning back to the king. \u201cAye, we\u2019ve done a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the babe is well enough to sustain the journey, you must make haste to claim Neamh \u00c1lainn. \u2019Tis important to secure the last link in our stronghold.\u201d</p><p>The king turned to Caelen. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth a winter storm is nigh, but \u2019tis also important that you travel back to McDonald keep. The alliance has been made, but I do not trust the former laird not to stir up dissension. It will be your task to bring the McDonalds under control and to honor the alliance with the McCabes.\u201d</p> <p>Rionna stiffened at the insult, and her head jerked up as she shot daggers at the king. Caelen\u2019s hand shot out to grasp hers and he squeezed a warning.</p><p>\u201cForget you that I am a McCabe? Think you I would betray my kin? My brother?\u201d He fought to keep his own anger under control. He and Rionna were sacrificing much for the good of their clans. He wouldn\u2019t allow the insult to pass. \u201cJust because the McDonald laird is without honor does not mean that his people are lacking as well.\u201d</p><p>Rionna eased back into her chair, her rigid shoulders sinking as she relaxed the tiniest bit. When she turned her liquid golden stare on Caelen, he saw gratitude for his defense. And grudging respect.</p><p>\u201cI meant no disrespect,\u201d David said. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth, you\u2019ll not have an easy time of it. The McDonalds won\u2019t readily accept you as their laird. You\u2019ll have to be on guard at every turn. Duncan Cameron will use any means to weaken our alliance. He\u2019s a viper who must be disposed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt that my brother will do all that is necessary to shape the McDonalds into a formidable fighting force,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cHe is largely responsible for the McCabes\u2019 invincibility. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ll be sorely disappointed to lose him even if by doing so I gain a strong ally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not lose me, brother,\u201d Caelen said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll be neighbors now.\u201d</p><p>Alaric, who\u2019d been silent until now, frowned and glanced between his two brothers. \u201cWhat will you do, Ewan? You cannot be in two places at once. Neamh \u00c1lainn will have to be defended well and Mairin and Isabel must be protected at all costs. But neither can you neglect our keep. Our clan.\u201d</p><p>Ewan smiled and exchanged conspiratorial glances with the king. \u201cNay, Alaric. \u2019Tis the truth you speak. You are the only McCabe without land and holdings to call your own now. It only seems fitting that you will defend McCabe keep when Mairin and I take up residence at Neamh \u00c1lainn.\u201d</p><p>Alaric appeared stunned. He looked between his brothers and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot be laird any longer,\u201d Ewan murmured. He turned to Mairin, his eyes full of love. \u201cSurely you see that. Upon the birth of Isabel, my destiny\u2014all our destinies\u2014changed as soon as she took her first breath. \u2019Tis my duty to protect my daughter\u2019s legacy. I cannot split my duties between my clan and my wife and daughter and be fair to either. Which is why you\u2019ll become laird. I cannot think of a better man for the duty.\u201d</p><p>Alaric dragged a hand through his hair and stared at Ewan in disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say, Ewan. You\u2019re the laird. Since our father died. It\u2019s the way of things. I never considered that I would take over.\u201d</p> <p>The king arched an eyebrow. \u201cAre you saying you have to think on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety and future of my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept marry me, apparently,\u201d Rionna muttered under her breath.</p><p>But Caelen heard and he glanced sharply at his wife. He hadn\u2019t considered that perchance she harbored tender feelings for Alaric. Surely they hadn\u2019t been together for long enough. But then how did anyone explain the workings of a woman\u2019s mind?</p><p>Alaric wasn\u2019t as cold as Caelen, and Caelen knew he could be unforgiving. Harsh even. Alaric seemed more in tune with the lasses. They adored him. Found him bonny.</p><p>Was she upset over the fact that she found herself married to the wrong McCabe? \u2019Twas something Caelen hadn\u2019t considered, and now that he was he didn\u2019t like the thought at all.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis settled then,\u201d the king announced as he put down his goblet. \u201cWe\u2019ll gather the lairds and Ewan can name his brother the new laird of the McCabe clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of our men?\u201d Alaric asked Ewan.</p> <p>Caelen leaned forward, for he had need to hear this as well. The McCabes had an awesome fighting force, but it would have to be split, which benefitted no one.</p><p>Ewan grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ll take a large enough contingent with me to see to the protection of Mairin and Isabel. Once we\u2019ve arrived at Neamh \u00c1lainn, I can afford to send some back provided I am well satisfied with the king\u2019s guard there.\u201d</p><p>He looked to Caelen. \u201cI thought to leave Cormac here since he is newly married and \u2019twould be more difficult for him to relocate to the McDonald holding with a new wife. I can\u2019t spare men to give to you but I can send Gannon with you to aid in the training of the McDonald soldiers.\u201d</p><p>Caelen viewed his brother with surprise. \u201cBut Gannon is your most senior man, your most trusted. He has protected you and your wife and child faithfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is why I would send him with you,\u201d Ewan said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ll need an ally, someone you can trust without question.\u201d He glanced apologetically at Rionna as he spoke.</p><p>Rionna stared stoically past the men to the tapestries hanging over the fireplace. You could have broken stone on her face. No hint of emotion. Her eyes were guarded, no betrayal of her thoughts.</p><p>Then she turned as if deigning to acknowledge the men sitting around her. She gave a delicate, feminine sniff, but somehow Caelen knew it had cost her not to let out a decidedly male snort.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you allowed yourself to consort with people such as the McDonalds. Why bother with an alliance when we\u2019re so clearly inferior and untrustworthy?\u201d Rionna said.</p><p>Caelen nearly crushed her hand in his. His nostrils flared and he would have chastised her for speaking to the king and his brother thusly, but something in her gaze held him back. It wasn\u2019t so much the anger, but hurt lurked where before she\u2019d allowed no hint of what she was feeling to show.</p><p>It was gone so quickly he wondered if he\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>The king chuckled while Ewan grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI realize this isn\u2019t easy for you to hear, Rionna. You have my apologies. I would not send my brother into a hostile environment without support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is more protected by being my husband than he is by your man,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cPerhaps you should concern yourself more with not insulting me.\u201d</p><p>At that Ewan\u2019s eyes narrowed. He was angry at the implied threat. Caelen was merely amused.</p><p>\u201cNow, Rionna. You\u2019ll have him worried you\u2019re going to split my gullet while I sleep,\u201d Caelen drawled.</p><p>He leaned over, wrapped his hand around her nape, and did what he\u2019d been dying to do ever since she floated into the room. His lips mashed against hers. It was no kiss of seduction, accompanied by sweet gestures and honeyed words.</p><p>It was a command to be silent. To cede to his authority. It was a reminder of whom she belonged to.</p><p>The feisty little wench nipped at his lip. He tasted blood but he also tasted her sweetness. He didn\u2019t rear back as she likely expected. He deepened the kiss until his blood was forced onto her tongue. When she tried to pull away, he hauled her against him until she was flat against his chest, her ample breasts straining at her bodice.</p><p>Only when she went slack against him and the fight leeched from her body did he pull slowly away. He wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand, all the while staring into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSee, Ewan, she\u2019s perfectly harmless. You just have to know how to handle her.\u201d</p><p>She sprang to her feet, her eyes flashing furiously. \u201cYou are the worst sort of braying ass!\u201d</p><p>He battled a grin as she turned and flounced dramatically from the room. She\u2019d be insulted to know that her usual long, mannish stride was completely ruined by the yards of material flowing at her feet. She looked like a woman in a pique.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t that infuriate her.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cJesu, Rionna, where did those come from?\u201d Keeley exclaimed.</p><p>Rionna shut the chamber door with a scowl and then looked down as she realized what Keeley referred to.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re breasts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see that. The question is how you grew them overnight.\u201d</p><p>Rionna stared at Keeley for a moment and then burst into laughter. It was either that or cry, and she\u2019d poke her own eye out before she let that happen.</p><p>Keeley\u2019s eyes were full of mirth as Rionna walked over to collapse on the bed next to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ... He\u2019s a ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Rionna? He\u2019s a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dolt! A pompous, overstuffed ... windbag!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see your education is sorely lacking in the area of insults,\u201d Keeley said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to be circumspect,\u201d Rionna muttered.</p><p>\u201cI assume you were referring to your new husband?\u201d</p><p>Rionna sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to work, Keeley. I look at you and Alaric. I see how Ewan is with Mairin. And then I look at Caelen.\u201d</p><p>Keeley\u2019s face filled with sadness and worry. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be so very unhappy?\u201d</p><p>Rionna felt immediate guilt. Here Keeley lay recovering from a terrible injury. She\u2019d married the man Rionna was supposed to marry and she likely felt horrible that Rionna was unhappy.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019d be miserable with either McCabe, so you needn\u2019t feel guilty for marrying Alaric. At least one of us is happy and I\u2019m delirious with joy that you have someone who loves you so very dearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was last night?\u201d Keeley asked carefully.</p><p>Rionna\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. The last thing I remember is standing by your window. I woke up next to Caelen in naught but my underdress. Surely it couldn\u2019t be so bad if I don\u2019t even remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say you were still dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I wasn\u2019t completely naked if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>Keeley giggled. \u201cNothing happened, Rionna. He didn\u2019t bed you. You were passed out in the chair over there. He came in, picked you up, and carried you out. He must have undressed you and put you to bed.\u201d</p><p>Rionna gave a mournful sigh and her shoulders slumped. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019d hoped it was over and done with. Now I have to dread the deed all over again.\u201d</p><p>Keeley patted Rionna on the hand. \u201cYou worry over much. \u2019Tis naught but a pinch and then it feels very nice.\u201d</p><p>Rionna wasn\u2019t convinced but she wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me why you suddenly have such a generous ... bosom.\u201d</p><p>Rionna rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve always bound them. \u2019Tis the truth that when I began to grow more womanly, my breasts got way ahead of the rest of me. I can\u2019t wield a sword and dodge and be quick when I have these things bouncing at my chest. \u2019Tis obscene, to borrow Caelen\u2019s word.\u201d</p><p>Keeley gasped. \u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe muttered something about covering myself and mentioned the word obscene. I\u2019m inclined to agree with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s a dolt.\u201d</p><p>Rionna grinned and then sighed. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth this dress is driving me daft. I\u2019m going to go change and maybe take in some fresh air. The walls of the keep are closing in on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were more comfortable outside,\u201d Keeley said with a smile. \u201cGo then. I\u2019ll not tell Caelen I\u2019ve seen you if he asks.\u201d</p><p>Rionna leaned forward to kiss Keeley\u2019s cheek. It was on the tip of her tongue to relate all that had been said below about Alaric being the new laird, but she wouldn\u2019t ruin the news for Alaric. \u2019Twas the truth the new couple needed all the good moments they could manage. They\u2019d been through hell already.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to see you later. Rest now, sister of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Keeley shot her a mischievous grin. \u201cWhen you return, I\u2019ll tell you all I\u2019ve learned about matters of the flesh. \u2019Tis the truth you can tame the gruffest of men with a few touches and a most inventive use of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s face burst into flames. She clapped her hands over her ears with a groan.</p><p>Keeley leaned back into the pillows and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here, Rionna. I missed you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>Rionna hurried down the hall to her chamber where she all but tore the frothy confection of a gown from her body. She embraced her anger because the alternative wasn\u2019t bearable. What she really wanted was to curl into a ball on the bed and shut out her humiliation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was stupid of her to allow Maddie to interfere. Playing dress up was for beautiful women who knew all the social niceties. How to talk. How to walk. How to be quiet and deferential. All the things Rionna wasn\u2019t.</p><p>All Rionna had accomplished was making an even bigger fool of herself. And she\u2019d given Caelen yet another opportunity to humiliate her.</p><p>She hated him.</p><p>It was bad enough he thought himself some noble self-sacrificer for taking on his brother\u2019s discarded bride, but he had to be a smug, overbearing jackass to boot.</p> <p>If only she\u2019d had a sister to marry off. Then Rionna could have dressed the way she wanted, acted as she wanted, and she could damn well pick up a sword when she wanted.</p><p>Realizing she was standing in the nude and it was quite cold, she pulled on the scruffy trews and then pulled her favorite tunic over her head. Her boots were old. There was a hole in the heel, but they fit her like a glove and they\u2019d never let her down.</p><p>Taking only a few extra moments to plait and secure her hair, she slid her sword into the scabbard and enjoyed the comfort of being herself once more.</p><p>Then she turned and strode from her chamber.</p><p>To hell with Caelen McCabe. To hell with the lot of them. Her clan might not be the mightiest or the cleverest. They might not have the fighting skills of another clan. But they were hers and she wouldn\u2019t allow them to be spoken poorly of. Her father had done enough of that. Self-righteous bastard.</p> <p>She slipped silently down the stairs, hoping the men would still be involved in talks. She cocked her head when she reached the base of the stairs and heard the sound of voices echoing through the great hall.</p><p>She hurried the opposite way and out one of the side exits into the courtyard.</p><p>Soldiers from the various neighboring clans sparred. They jested and laughed. The smell of sweat filtered through her nose, and the sounds of metal banged in her ears, welcome and familiar.</p><p>Still, she moved away from the assembled soldiers and made her way through the trees toward the loch.</p><p>\u201cRionna!\u201d</p><p>She turned hastily, seeing her father standing in the direction she\u2019d just come from. He was frowning, his arms crossed over his chest. Then he loosened one hand and motioned her to come.</p> <p>She contemplated ignoring his summons, but \u2019twas not the time. He was still her laird, albeit for not many days longer. Her new husband would take over the mantle of leadership and, God help her, she didn\u2019t know who she dreaded in the position more.</p><p>Her jaw tight, she walked back to her father and stopped a short distance away. \u201cYes, father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to have a word with you. We cannot allow Caelen McCabe to take over the McDonald clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have little choice in the matter,\u201d she said carefully. \u201c \u2019Tis either ally ourselves with the McCabes or face Duncan Cameron on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, \u2019tis not our only choice.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cThink you that you\u2019re a little late to be saying such? You couldn\u2019t have come to me with this solution before I married Caelen McCabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence that mouth of yours before I do,\u201d her father roared. \u201cI am still your laird and, by God, I\u2019ll not tolerate your insolence.\u201d</p><p>Rionna stared defiantly at the man she\u2019d lost all respect for over the years. He was a pathetic excuse for a man, even if he was her laird\u2014and her father. She couldn\u2019t help the circumstances of her birth. Would that she could.</p> <p>\u201cTell me, father. What is this plan you\u2019ve hatched to save us all from the McCabes and Duncan Cameron?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then and Rionna shivered. \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat a man, you should consider joining with him. I\u2019ve a mind to strike a bargain with Cameron. He allows me to remain laird of my clan and I\u2019ll aid him in his endeavors.\u201d</p><p>Rionna paled, all the blood draining from her face. \u201cYou speak of treason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d her father hissed. \u201cLest we be overheard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d she bit out. \u201cI\u2019m married already. There is naught to be done. Duncan Cameron is a man without honor. You can\u2019t seriously think to ally ourselves with one of his ilk.\u201d</p><p>He slapped her across her cheek, shocking her into silence. She stumbled back, her hand cupping her jaw.</p><p>Then she regained her footing, her rage so fierce that she feared exploding.</p><p>She drew her sword and flew toward him, the tip notched against his neck. His eyes bulged and sweat beaded his forehead as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not ever touch me again,\u201d she ground out. \u201cIf you ever raise your hand to me, I\u2019ll carve out your heart and feed it to the buzzards.\u201d</p><p>Her father raised his hands slowly, his fingers shaking like leaves in autumn. \u201cDon\u2019t be rash, Rionna. Think what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI speak the truth,\u201d she said in a harsh voice she didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cYou\u2019ll not lead our clan to dishonor. Nor will you drag me into the mire you\u2019ve created. We\u2019ll not ally ourselves with Cameron. We\u2019ll not betray our bond with the McCabes.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back and lowered her sword.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my sight. You sicken me.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s lip curled into a grimace of distaste. \u201cYou were always a sore disappointment, Rionna. You play at being a man and yet you\u2019re neither a man nor a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He turned and stalked away, leaving her standing, shivering in the cold.</p><p>Slowly she turned back toward the loch and walked closer to the water\u2019s edge. Today the water was dark and ominous. The wind whipped along the surface, boiling the water into waves that beat at the shoreline.</p><p>Her face throbbed. Her father had never struck her. She had always feared him but for another reason entirely. In truth she\u2019d avoided him when at all possible, and until she became a valuable pawn, her father had ignored her as well.</p><p>She stared sightlessly over the water, and for the first time since this whole mess began, felt a wave of despair slide over her shoulders, weighing her down.</p><p>What did she know about being a wife?</p><p>She glanced down at her attire as shame tightened her cheeks and swelled in her chest. Caelen McCabe had managed to do what no other person had ever managed. He\u2019d made her ashamed of who she was, and it infuriated her.</p><p>She rubbed her hands together and then tucked them under the hem of her tunic. She hadn\u2019t donned gloves\u2014an oversight. She\u2019d been in too big a hurry to leave the keep and the walls closing in around her.</p><p>But even the brisk wind and the biting chill couldn\u2019t drive her back toward the warmth of indoors. Back to her future with a man as cold as the mist blowing off the loch.</p><p>\u201cRionna, you shouldn\u2019t be out in the cold.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened but didn\u2019t turn around as her husband\u2019s terse reprimand reached her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take ill.\u201d</p><p>He came to stand beside her and stared over the loch in the direction of her gaze.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to make your apology?\u201d she asked as she glanced sideways at him.</p><p>He jerked in surprise and turned to stare at her, eyebrow raised. \u201cApologize for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, \u2019tis not a sincere apology you\u2019ll issue.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll not apologize for kissing you.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the kissing I was referring to, but you had no right to do something so intimate in front of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife. I\u2019ll do as I like,\u201d he said lazily.</p><p>\u201cYou humiliated me,\u201d she said in a tight voice. \u201cNot once but twice this morn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou humiliated yourself, Rionna. You have no discipline. No restraint.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on him, her fist balled. Oh, she\u2019d love to hit him. But she\u2019d only bounce off and probably break her hand in the process.</p><p>She opened her mouth to let him have it, when his expression stopped her.</p><p>It was positively murderous.</p><p>His eyes went flat, and his jaw twitched.</p><p>His roar nearly flattened her. \u201cWho struck you?\u201d</p><p>Her hand flew to her cheek, and she took a step back. But he was having none of that. He pushed forward and reached up to pull her hand down. With his other hand he touched a finger to the still sore spot.</p><p>\u201cWho dared raise their hand to you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and dropped her gaze. \u201c \u2019Tis not of import.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not. Tell me and I\u2019ll kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>When she finally dared to lift her gaze back to his, the terrible rage in his eyes puzzled her. He was furious.</p><p>\u201cDid your father do this?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise and his lips tightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him this time,\u201d Caelen muttered.</p><p>\u201cNay! He isn\u2019t worth your anger. He won\u2019t touch me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took care of the matter. I don\u2019t need your protection.\u201d</p><p>Caelen gripped her shoulders. \u201cNo one touches what is mine. No one does harm to one of my own. You may not think you need my protection, but by all that\u2019s holy, you\u2019ll have it. You may be used to going your own way, Rionna, but that\u2019s done with now. You and I have a responsibility to our clans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResponsibility. And what is my responsibility, husband? So far I only see that you wish me to dress and act feminine, never gainsay you, and pretend I\u2019m a witless ninny in front of others.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYour responsibility is to be loyal to me first and foremost. You\u2019re to be a credit to your clan and mine. You\u2019ll give me heirs. Do that and you\u2019ll find I\u2019m an easy man to get along with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want someone I\u2019m not,\u201d she whispered in a fierce voice tinged with tears. \u201cYou want a woman I cannot be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not engage me in a battle of wills, wife. You\u2019ll only suffer for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it have to be a battle? Why can you not accept me the way I am? Why must I change while you go on as before?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and he dropped his hands from her shoulders. For a moment he turned away from her and stood, legs apart as he stared over the water. When he glanced back at her, anger and impatience simmered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThink you that nothing changes for me? I\u2019m married, Rionna. I had no wish to be married. I certainly didn\u2019t prepare for it and certainly not so soon. I\u2019m a warrior. Fighting is what I do. I see to the protection of my clan. Now I\u2019m to be uprooted and must go away from my clan and bind myself to another. I\u2019m expected to lead a people I\u2019ve never met, who won\u2019t trust me any more than I\u2019ll trust them. On top of that, Duncan Cameron wants my brother dead. He wants Mairin for himself, and now Isabel\u2019s life has been in danger since the moment she was set in her mother\u2019s womb.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tried to kill Alaric. He\u2019s sent traitors into the very heart of our clan. I should be here. Where I can protect my family. Not playing laird to a people who have no more desire for me as their laird as I have to be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my choice,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know it. \u2019Tis no matter, though. We are both bound by duty. We have no choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and turned away so that they stood side by side, gazes fixed anywhere but on each other.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it then, Caelen? Why did you really do it? You could have remained silent. Why did you step forward to marry me if \u2019twas such a distasteful chore?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment before he finally acknowledged her question.</p><p>\u201cBecause I could not bear to see my brother wed to you when he loved another.\u201d</p><p>Pain tightened her chest again.</p><p>\u201cI hope one day your answer will be different,\u201d she said quietly as she turned to walk back toward the keep.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>It was late when Caelen mounted the stairs to go up to his chamber. He and his brothers had planned late into the night, and on the morrow, he would make his journey to McDonald keep with his new wife to take over his duties as laird.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Gregor McDonald had taken his leave, and a dozen of his best soldiers had departed with him\u2014men that Caelen couldn\u2019t afford to lose.</p><p>The former laird had slunk away like a defeated coward. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to bid his daughter goodbye. Not that Caelen ever wanted him close to Rionna again.</p><p>Aye, \u2019twas a good thing for the McDonald clan. The question was whether they\u2019d recognize that fact and embrace Caelen as their new laird. Of course they would not. Maybe a few. But Caelen could only imagine how he would feel if he was suddenly presented with a new laird he had no knowledge of.</p><p>He\u2019d never considered that he\u2019d have the duties of laird. That had always fallen to Ewan and then to his heirs. Caelen was a third son and his duty had always been to support his laird. To be unfailingly loyal and offer his life for Ewan and his wife and children.</p><p>It was a daunting task before him. He didn\u2019t know if he was up to it. What if he failed not only his new clan, but his brother and his king? Not to mention his new wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caelen hated the insecurity that plagued him and he\u2019d never admit it to anyone save himself. He may not be convinced that he was the best man to lead the McDonalds, but they\u2019d never know that. Any show of weakness would be a clear sign to them that he was not worthy of the mantle of leadership, and he\u2019d die before he\u2019d allow that to happen.</p><p>Nay, he must be strong. And show no mercy right from the start. It was imperative that Caelen have their respect, for he had much work ahead of him in order to shape them into as formidable a force as the McCabe warriors.</p><p>To his surprise, when he opened the door to his chamber, Rionna was inside, still awake. She was sitting by the fire, her hair unbound and streaming to her waist. The tresses reflected the glow of the flames and shone like spun gold.</p><p>He\u2019d fully expected her to retreat to her chamber and avoid him at all costs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him at first, and he took the opportunity to study her slender shape. It amused him that she\u2019d re-bound her breasts. It was quite remarkable how well the binding hid her lush curves. \u2019Twas a sin to hide such beauty.</p><p>As if sensing his stare, she turned slowly, her hair sliding over one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou should be asleep,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201c \u2019Tis late and we depart in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. We must make haste.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis snowing. The storm has set in.\u201d</p><p>Caelen nodded and sat on the edge of the bed. He pulled at his boots and tossed them aside. \u201c \u2019Tis likely to snow the night through. The going will be slow, but if we wait for the weather to break, we\u2019ll be here until spring.\u201d</p><p>Rionna went quiet. Confusion mirrored in her eyes. But she hesitated, her lips drawn as if she battled indecision.</p><p>He waited, not wanting to do any more that would put them at odds. He seemed to have the ridiculous habit of shoving his foot into his mouth every time he opened it.</p><p>\u201cWill you be wanting to get on with it tonight?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together and his forehead wrinkled as he stared back at her. \u201cGet on with what, lass?\u201d</p><p>She gestured toward the bed, color surging into her cheeks, painting them a dusky rose he found fascinating. Realization hit him, and again he was struck by how protective her hesitancy made him.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Rionna.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he thought she was going to disobey him. Then with a sigh, she rose gracefully from her place by the fire and walked toward him, her hair shimmering down her back like a lighted torch.</p><p>When she was close enough, he drew her between his thighs and gathered her hands in his.</p><p>\u201cIf I expect you to mount a horse tomorrow, and \u2019tis obvious I do, then I\u2019ll not be doing anything tonight that would make you too tender for the ride.\u201d</p><p>Her blush deepened and she ducked her head.</p><p>He squeezed her hands so she\u2019d look back at him. \u201cHowever, when we do get around to consummating our marriage, you have nothing to fear, lass. I\u2019ll not do anything that frightens or hurts you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look entirely convinced. She nervously licked her bottom lip, leaving it shiny and moist in the glow of the firelight.</p> <p>Unable to resist the unintentional invitation, he tugged at her hands until she was perched on his thigh. With a gentleness and grace he didn\u2019t know he possessed, he stroked his hand over her cheekbone and then delved his fingers into the mass of hair behind her ear.</p><p>Warmed by her sitting by the fire for so long, it was indeed like caressing sunshine. Mesmerized by the feel and sight of the strands spilling and sliding over his fingers like liquid silk\u2014he was sure he\u2019d never touched anything so fine\u2014he drew her closer until their mouths were just a breath away.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he said in a voice he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>The directive unsettled her. She sat rigid in his lap, so tense she resembled a stone pillar. She looked at him, then at his mouth, and licked her lips again.</p><p>Ah hell.</p><p>His cock was as rigid as she was. He shifted his position, not wanting to alarm her, but every time he moved, he only became more aware of the fact that a beautiful, fiery woman was sitting in his arms. A woman he\u2019d told he wasn\u2019t consummating their marriage tonight.</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>Surely he could put her on the horse with him so she experienced no discomfort.</p><p>Nay, that wouldn\u2019t work either because then he\u2019d have to endure the entire ride in agony.</p><p>He sighed and resigned himself to a night of extreme discomfort. He had no intention of bedding her, but neither would he allow her to sleep in her own chamber.</p><p>His brothers never spent a night away from their wives. He\u2019d give them no cause to think he was lacking.</p><p>Hesitantly, she pressed her lips to his. Just barely a touch, but it was like a streak of lightning. Hot. His toes even tingled as if they\u2019d been dipped in fire.</p><p>It took every bit of his restraint not to roll her onto the bed and kiss her senseless. His newfound patience and desire to not frighten the daylights out of her was one of his more stupid decisions.</p><p>She drew away immediately, her eyes wide, a touch of pink suffusing her soft cheeks. Then she slid one hand up his chest and over his shoulder, staring warily at him the whole while as if she expected him to bite her for daring to touch him. Jesu, but he was nigh to the point of begging her to touch him.</p><p>Her fingers wandered to his neck and then she put her mouth carefully to his again. This time she remained there as she tentatively explored his mouth. With her tongue. Sweet mother of God, this was killing him.</p><p>She stirred restlessly against him as she pressed closer, her mouth hotly fused to his.</p><p>A surge of lust rolled through his body, but he held back, not wanting to destroy the sweetness of her offering. She was an innocent for all her warrior ways and attempts at acting like a man. She deserved all the gentleness and wooing he could muster, though God only knew he\u2019d deserve sainthood before this was over with.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not unpleasant, this kissing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNay, lass, \u2019tis not unpleasant at all. Who told you such?\u201d</p><p>She paused and pulled farther away, her eyes faintly glazed as she stared back at him. \u201cNo one. I\u2019ve never kissed anyone before. \u2019Tis the truth I don\u2019t know the way of it.\u201d</p><p>He nearly groaned. It pleased him that he was the only man she\u2019d ever kissed\u2014provided she told the truth\u2014but such innocence couldn\u2019t be faked, surely, and what would she have to gain by such a falsehood? Nay, he was allowing past transgressions to color the present, which was hardly fair to his bride.</p><p>And that she said she didn\u2019t know anything of kissing made him want to snort. The lass was a born temptress. She kissed with a mixture of bold vixen and sweet innocence that inspired so many conflicting reactions that he was tongue-tied and cross-eyed.</p><p>\u201cI think you have it just right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut just in case, perchance you could practice a bit more on me.\u201d</p><p>She shook with nervous laughter, the sound tinkling over his ears like little silver bells.</p><p>\u201cKissing can be wondrous if done correctly,\u201d he said. Even as he spoke, he thought on how long it had been since he\u2019d truly enjoyed something as sweet as a simple kiss.</p><p>\u201cCorrectly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pulled her lower, then bent and pressed his lips to the pulse at her neck. She jumped and then let out a breathy sigh just before melting against him. He nibbled a path to her ear and licked the lobe like she was a delicious treat.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his arms. She was turned in his lap so that her bound breasts were pressed tight to his chest. It was killing him, now that he knew what lurked behind that binding.</p><p>\u201cOh aye, kissing is nice.\u201d</p><p>There was no way in heaven or hell that he was going to content himself with lying beside her in the bed all night. He\u2019d promised himself and her that he wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt her or make tomorrow\u2019s journey uncomfortable, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t indulge himself in the feast of her silken skin.</p><p>He tugged at the sleeves of her gown until her shoulders were bared. She immediately went still and then pushed away from his chest, her mouth pursed as if to protest. She opened her mouth then sealed it shut as she continued to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI want to look at you. Then I\u2019m going to show you that there\u2019s quite a bit more to kissing, not to mention a lot more places that kissing brings pleasure to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>The word slid from her lips with breathless excitement. Her pupils flared and a flush danced across her throat and cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot a damn thing, lass. I\u2019ll be doing what needs to be done. All you have to do is lie back and enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Rionna couldn\u2019t help her reaction to Caelen\u2019s husky drawl. It prickled over her skin, eliciting a feminine longing deep within. And then he stood, nearly carrying her upward as he set her away from him.</p><p>Before she could process the emptiness that suddenly besieged her at the loss of his touch, he began inching her gown up her legs, baring her ankles and then her knees.</p><p>She felt sinful and brazen and it perplexed her that she decided she quite liked it. Who would have ever accused her of being sensual? A woman to turn a man\u2019s head?</p><p>An indecent thrill sent chill bumps racing across her belly as the gown inched higher. She quite liked that, too. Panic scuttled through her chest about the time Caelen finally pulled the gown free of her head.</p><p>Clad now in her most intimate underthings, hardly barriers to his seeking gaze, heat scorched over her flesh and her cheeks tightened as she blushed furiously. He looked at her as though he wanted to devour her whole, like he was a beast closing in on his prey. She should be afraid, but what she really felt was ... anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI should do this slower so that I can savor the sight of you, but I\u2019m an impatient man, and I can\u2019t bear the excitement a moment longer. I simply have to see you, lass. I want to touch you so much, I\u2019m shaking with it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never been a woman to swoon. She\u2019d never fainted in her life, but her knees were precariously weak and she was so light-headed that she feared falling right over.</p><p>She had no sense of herself. She felt as though she were floating in some delicious dream she never wanted to awaken from. Only, her dreams had never been this erotic, and they certainly didn\u2019t include a magnificent warrior standing before her, trembling because he wanted her so. Staring at her like she was the only woman in the world.</p><p>With urgency he hadn\u2019t displayed so far, he quickly divested her of the last remaining material and suddenly she was clad in only the binding around her breasts. A shiver overtook her though she was far from chilled.</p><p>He stared at the binding for a long moment before lifting his gaze. \u201c \u2019Tis a travesty to hide such a wealth of feminine beauty. Are you ashamed?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks tightened in mortification. \u201cNay, I mean aye. Maybe. They\u2019re inconvenient,\u201d she finally managed. \u201cThey get in the way.\u201d</p><p>Caelen chuckled, his voice husky with amusement. \u201cI\u2019m torn between forbidding you to ever hide them and only allowing you to reveal them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... You like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye, lass. We men are fond of such things. However, I\u2019ll like them more when I get this binding from around you.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around and gently untied the ends. Holding one of the strips of material, he walked around to the front and then began unwinding, transferring from hand to hand and reaching around her until her breasts pushed forward and at last, sprang free from confinement.</p><p>He stared unabashedly, though he didn\u2019t just focus on her breasts. Finally, she was completely nude, and he took his time, sweeping his gaze over her body from head to toe. Then he stared into her eyes. His breath came out in a ragged exhale.</p><p>\u201cYou are magnificent.\u201d</p><p>His palms glided over her, stroking reverently. Her breasts grew heavy. Aching. And so very tight. Her nipples puckered and became hard, pouty, begging for his touch.</p><p>She sucked in her breath when his fingers brushed over both of her nipples. Shards of exquisite pleasure streaked through her abdomen and down to her groin. Her womb clenched and her most intimate flesh grew damp. She was swollen and ... hot.</p><p>Any idea that she could maintain her footing disappeared as soon as he lowered his head and his mouth closed around one taut nipple. She gasped and her knees buckled.</p><p>With a groan, he caught her against him, turned, and took a step to the bed. His arms wrapped tightly around her, he fell forward, coming down on top of her as her back hit the straw mattress.</p><p>His mouth melted over hers, taking until she couldn\u2019t draw breath. When he tore his lips away, they both gasped for air. Before she could regain her senses, he ran his mouth heatedly down her jaw then to her neck and lower until he shaped her nipple and suckled strongly.</p><p>With each pull of his mouth, she moaned and wave after wave of excitement tugged relentlessly at her womb. He swirled his tongue around each peak, one and then the other. He licked and teased until she squirmed in frustration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He acted like a man starved. And yet he was exceedingly gentle and in turns rough. It confused her.</p><p>She wanted more. She needed more. But she wasn\u2019t at all sure what it was she wanted or needed.</p><p>He slid his tongue around and then up the underside of her breast until the bud balanced precariously on the edge of his lip. Then he sucked it inside, sweeping it past his teeth, pulling and tugging at it until she cried out and dug her nails into his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCaelen, please! Have mercy.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his head, his eyes reflecting the dancing flames in the hearth. \u201cMercy? Lass, I have none. Furthermore, you won\u2019t want it. But you\u2019ll beg for more. Aye, you will.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the hollow between her breasts and murmured softly against her skin. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Rionna. Never hide what God has given you. You are a woman blessed.\u201d</p><p>His words soaked into her heart, giving comfort she hadn\u2019t realized she needed. How could a man who was so harsh and unyielding speak with a poet\u2019s soul? He was a hard man. His words were harder. He was quick to offer criticism. He hadn\u2019t spared her feelings at any point. And yet now he wooed her as gently as a man wooing his lover.</p><p>He kissed a path down to her navel, moving his big body as his mouth moved lower. He tongued the indention, then grazed his teeth over the sensitive flesh.</p><p>More goose bumps scattered across her belly and still he moved lower, shocking her with his daring.</p> <p>He parted her thighs and positioned his body so that his head was above her pelvis. Her eyes widened as he lowered his head. He couldn\u2019t. Surely he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Oh God, he did.</p><p>He slid his fingers through the patch of hair covering her throbbing center and parted the swollen, aching folds. She was so mystified that she couldn\u2019t form a single objection as he pressed a kiss to her damp flesh.</p><p>She trembled uncontrollably. Her thighs shook. Her knees shook. Her belly quivered and her breasts strained upward, so unbearably taut that she wanted to writhe right out of her skin.</p><p>And then he licked her.</p><p>A long, positively sinful swipe of his tongue, from her opening to the hood of flesh where he circled the throbbing bundle of nerves at her very heart.</p> <p>He followed it with a simple kiss and then he sucked ever so gently at the little bud until she was a sobbing mess of incoherency.</p><p>Oh aye, he\u2019d certainly told the truth about kissing.</p><p>Her sense of urgency mounted. Her body tensed and coiled, tighter and tighter. Pleasure bloomed and became nearly painful through her breasts and her womb and centered at the pulsing nub that he so unmercifully teased.</p><p>It felt as though she\u2019d simply break apart at some point, but each time she thought she\u2019d surely split, the pressure and indescribable pleasure only increased, driving her further into the state of madness.</p><p>\u201cCaelen! Please, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her center again and then raised his head, his eyes glowing with feral light. \u201cJust let go, lass. You\u2019re fighting the inevitable. I won\u2019t hurt you, I swear it. \u2019Twill feel good. Relax now and let me love you.\u201d</p><p>His words soothed over her, sinking in and relaxing her tense muscles and frayed nerves. When his mouth touched her once more, she shivered and closed her eyes as the build began all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like honey. Never have I had anything sweeter. You make me daft with wanting. You\u2019re all that a woman should be, Rionna. Never hide that or be ashamed of it.\u201d</p> <p>Tears pricked her eyelids. She trembled from head to toe, not just from the onslaught of pleasure, but from the emotions welling from her chest. Emotions that he\u2019d unleashed.</p><p>She felt like a woman tonight. She felt beautiful and desired. Like a bride should. How she should have been made to feel on her wedding day, instead of an inferior replacement.</p><p>His tongue circled her entrance and then slid inside, shocking her with the sheer intensity of the sensation. She arched upward just as she finally, finally broke free of the excruciating pressure building from deep within.</p><p>It was the single most bewildering, most powerful, most absolutely wonderful experience of her life. She flew. Soared impossibly high and then floated ever so gently back toward the ground.</p><p>She closed her eyes and melted into the bed, so boneless, so positively sated that she couldn\u2019t even imagine moving so much as a finger.</p><p>Her body quivered in the aftermath and tiny little shocks simmered through her blood, humming and buzzing. There was still a pulse between her legs, a slight ache and a throb, a reminder of the attentions he\u2019d just given her with his mouth.</p><p>She\u2019d never imagined such a thing. Surely this wasn\u2019t normal. She\u2019d never heard other women speak of such. He hadn\u2019t just kissed her as he\u2019d promised. He\u2019d licked her. He\u2019d suckled her.</p><p>Surely there was no more intimate act a husband could perform for his wife. Contentment warmed her entire body and she smiled in satisfaction, marveling at how happy she was at this precise moment. No matter what tomorrow brought, she\u2019d always hold tonight close.</p><p>She felt Caelen leave the bed, but she couldn\u2019t summon the energy to open her eyes to see what he was about. A moment later, he pulled the furs up over her and climbed in beside her, his heated flesh a shock against her still quivering body.</p><p>Having no experience in such matters, she wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to do. Her mother and father never slept in the same chamber. Certainly not in the same bed. She knew Mairin and Keeley both slept with their husbands every night. Their husbands would allow nothing less, not that either woman wanted it any differently. Perhaps \u2019twas a McCabe thing. Maybe they were so possessive of their women that they couldn\u2019t bear to let them out of their sight. Or maybe they were just protective.</p><p>She decided she didn\u2019t care. What was the worst that could happen? She\u2019d gain Caelen\u2019s censure? It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t done that many times over the past few days.</p><p>She turned into his body and snuggled up tight against him. For a moment she worried she\u2019d done something wrong because he stiffened against her. Gradually he relaxed and then he slid an arm around her waist and hauled her even closer until her nose was pressed against the hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cCaelen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I right about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing. \u2019Tis a most wondrous thing.\u201d</p><p>She could sense his smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were right about another thing. There are so many other ... places ... where kissing brings much pleasure to.\u201d</p><p>This time he chuckled softly over her head. \u201cGo to sleep, Rionna. We must rise early in the morn. We have a hard journey ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes and just before she drifted off, she had the thought that this whole consummation thing wasn\u2019t so bad after all.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Caelen was in a black mood. He hadn\u2019t slept a wink the entire night. He\u2019d finally given up when he couldn\u2019t take the torture of Rionna\u2019s naked body wrapped around his a minute longer.</p><p>He had a raging erection, and even after prying himself from the bed and seeking privacy to take care of the matter, he was still hard and aching.</p><p>Her taste was still on his tongue. Her scent still filled his nostrils. Her lean body with her lush curves still haunted him. Whether he shut or opened his eyes, he couldn\u2019t rid himself of the images of her writhing beneath his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesu,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Panting after a woman had already caused him\u2014and his clan\u2014a lifetime of trouble.</p><p>He would bed her as soon as they arrived at McDonald keep and then he\u2019d distance himself from her. A good tupping was what he needed. He\u2019d been a long time without a woman. Aye, that was the issue. He needed relief and then he would regain his senses and he could function without being led about by his cods.</p><p>Knowing the others wouldn\u2019t be up for some time yet, he went below stairs and into the courtyard. Snow had blown into drifts, barring the usual walkways. He cursed as he stared around at the heavy blanket of freshly fallen snow.</p><p>At least it had stopped and the sky was clear above. The moon and countless stars shone and reflected off the snow until it appeared nearly daytime.</p><p>\u201cGood morn, Caelen.\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned to see Gannon standing a short distance away.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis cold, Gannon. Where are your furs?\u201d</p><p>Gannon grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t want them wet before our journey. \u2019Twill be freezing on the ride to McDonald land.\u201d</p><p>Caelen studied the warrior who\u2019d long served Caelen\u2019s brother. A more loyal man Caelen had never known. He was glad to get him, but he worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat think you of Ewan sending you with me?\u201d</p><p>Gannon stared around at the keep, the courtyard where they\u2019d trained for so many years. At the still-crumbling walls that were even now being repaired, thanks to Mairin\u2019s dowry.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twill be hard to leave the home I\u2019ve known for so long. But things are changing. Ewan is newly married and he leaves for Neamh \u00c1lainn as soon as Isabel is strong enough for the journey. Alaric will become laird. Aye, things are changing, and \u2019tis the truth I\u2019m looking forward to a new challenge. Going with you to McDonald keep will give me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to have you,\u201d Caelen said. \u201c \u2019Twill be a hard task to train the McDonalds to be warriors on par with the McCabes. We\u2019ve not much time to whip them into shape. Ewan is impatient to be rid of Duncan Cameron once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs is our king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, for different reasons, but aye, David is eager to be rid of Cameron as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we are both awake, perhaps we should ready the horses for the journey. I had some of the men bring down the trunks last night to load into the carts. Will you wait for your lady wife to awaken before we depart?\u201d</p><p>Caelen scowled. His lady wife had slept like a babe while he\u2019d lain awake in pain. \u201cI\u2019ll wake her once we\u2019ve readied the carts and the men. I\u2019ll want to say my goodbyes to my brothers and their wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a new page in your life you\u2019re embarking on,\u201d Gannon said in a sage voice. \u201cA fortnight ago, did you imagine that you\u2019d be laird of your own clan, newly married to a beautiful lass and on your way to a life away from the McCabes?\u201d</p><p>For a moment Caelen didn\u2019t acknowledge Gannon\u2019s question. It caused him too much discomfort. The truth was an ugly, unforgiving thing. Always there. Never changing.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis my fault we\u2019ve struggled for as many years as we have,\u201d Caelen said quietly. \u201cI owe my brothers more than I can ever repay. My agreeing to this marriage gives Alaric what he most wants in the world, and it aids Ewan in keeping his wife and child safe. It wouldn\u2019t matter if Rionna McDonald were a pox-riddled whore. I\u2019d marry her for those reasons and never feel regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fortunate for you that I\u2019m nay pox-riddled nor a whore.\u201d</p><p>Caelen swung around to see Rionna standing a short distance away, her face drawn into an impassive mask as she stared at him and Gannon. He cursed under his breath just as Gannon muttered \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Caelen was forever making a muck of things around Rionna.</p><p>\u201cRionna ...\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand to silence him and he did so before it sunk in that she was giving him a command and he\u2019d meekly followed it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for speaking the truth, husband. \u2019Tis the truth I had no more desire to marry you than you did me, but as you said last eve, neither of us had a choice. Perhaps it would be better to move forward rather than to keep rehashing the reasons why over and over.\u201d</p><p>He hated the hurt in her voice even as her gaze flickered coolly over him and Gannon. Her face had the perfect you-can\u2019t-touch-me expression, but her voice told the truth. He had wounded her.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be outside the keep. \u2019Tis frigid this morn. What are you doing up at this hour?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze was as chilled as the wind. She showed no reaction to the biting cold even though the clothing she wore was ill-suited for such weather.</p><p>\u201cI woke when you rose and I knew you\u2019d want an early start. \u2019Tis not an overlong journey but the snow will hinder us. I thought to aid you in preparing.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a thoughtful gesture, my lady,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cBut \u2019tis my duty to assist your husband. I would feel better if you were inside where \u2019tis warm and you don\u2019t chance taking ill.\u201d</p><p>Caelen glared at Gannon for his well thought-out words. The sentiment should come from him, not his commander. He could see the effect it had on Rionna. Her eyes lost some of their frost, and her stance relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want to bid my farewells to Keeley as well as Mairin and the babe.\u201d</p><p>Caelen nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll summon you when \u2019tis time to depart.\u201d</p><p>She gave a stiff nod of her own and then turned back into the keep. Caelen sighed and glanced over at Gannon.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twill be a task to clear the pathways. We may as well begin now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rionna waited until she was certain Alaric had risen before she went to Keeley\u2019s chamber. Though all the McCabe warriors were notoriously early risers\u2014they somehow functioned on but a few hours\u2019 sleep every night\u2014Alaric had devoted most of his time for the last weeks to Keeley\u2019s bedside.</p><p>After she saw Alaric reenter his chamber with food for Keeley to break her fast, she waited a few moments and then knocked.</p><p>Alaric opened the door and Rionna straightened her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019d like to say my farewell to Keeley if she\u2019s feeling well enough this morn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come in. She\u2019s breaking her fast and grumbling about being held captive in her bedchamber.\u201d</p> <p>Rionna grinned at Alaric\u2019s exasperated tone. She walked inside to see Keeley sitting up in bed, more color in her cheeks than had been there the day before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to bid you farewell.\u201d</p><p>Keeley\u2019s lips turned down into an unhappy frown. \u201cSo soon? I had hoped to spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>Rionna perched on the edge of the bed, taking Keeley\u2019s hand in hers and squeezing. \u201cYou\u2019ll come to visit when you\u2019re well. Perhaps I\u2019ll come back to visit you. We\u2019re married to brothers. We\u2019ll see each other often. I still expect you to attend me when I bear my first child, so make sure you do nothing foolish like injuring yourself again.\u201d</p><p>Keeley\u2019s eyes danced with merriment. \u201cHow went it last night with Caelen?\u201d</p> <p>Rionna\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI hate him. He has a wicked, silken tongue, but he turns into the worst sort of ass outside the bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>Keeley sighed. \u201cGive him time, Rionna. He\u2019s a good man. You just have to dig below the surface to uncover that man.\u201d</p><p>Rionna made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t have your faith, Keeley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy. Promise me you\u2019ll give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only promise not to stick my dagger in his gut while he sleeps,\u201d Rionna grumbled.</p><p>Keeley laughed. \u201c \u2019Tis all I can ask then. Be well, Rionna. And be happy. Send word when you\u2019re established at McDonald keep and let me know you\u2019ve arrived safely. I\u2019ll be awaiting word on the news of your first child as well.\u201d</p> <p>Rionna rose then leaned down to kiss Keeley\u2019s cheek. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ll never bear a child if he doesn\u2019t learn to close his mouth at the appropriate time.\u201d</p><p>Keeley grinned. \u201c \u2019Tis a skill I don\u2019t think any man has yet learned. But remember all I counseled you on. Use your skills as a woman and I guarantee he\u2019ll shut his mouth, for a time at least.\u201d</p><p>Rionna sat atop her horse surveying the line of McDonald men that was smaller than it had been when they\u2019d arrived. Her chest ached for the men who\u2019d chosen to side with her father. These were men she\u2019d grown up around. Some of them were young and were probably swayed by her father\u2019s talk of loyalty and distrust of the McCabes. The older warriors were likely outraged over the ousting of her father as laird and had followed him without coercion.</p><p>There was no telling what would happen when Rionna and Caelen returned to her keep and announced that Caelen was their new laird. Not that the people hadn\u2019t been expecting Rionna to marry and for her husband to one day lead their clan, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen overnight.</p><p>She shivered as the wind knifed through her. The fur she wore was threadbare and the clothes underneath weren\u2019t suitable for traveling in such cold. When they\u2019d made the trip to McCabe keep the weather had been unseasonably warm. That was no longer the case and she hadn\u2019t the wardrobe to withstand being outdoors in the biting cold for any length of time.</p><p>Caelen and his commander led the way. Rionna hung several horse lengths back, surrounded by four McDonald soldiers as they trudged through the crisp snow.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t once looked back, not that Rionna expected him to. She may as well not exist for all the mind he\u2019d paid her since the journey began.</p><p>Apart from assisting her onto her horse, he hadn\u2019t acknowledged her at all since she\u2019d overheard his words to Gannon earlier that morn.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him, Rionna,\u201d James muttered beside her.</p><p>She jerked her head up to make sure Caelen hadn\u2019t overheard the disloyal remark and then she turned to the young warrior. Beside him, Simon, his father, nodded his agreement.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him either, lass. The king and the McCabes have given us a bad turn. \u2019Twasn\u2019t right what they did to your father.\u201d</p><p>Rionna clenched her jaw until it ached. She could hardly reveal her true feelings. She couldn\u2019t very well say that she didn\u2019t like her new laird either, but she wasn\u2019t about to go as far as to defend her father.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis best to give him a chance,\u201d she murmured in a low voice, all the while keeping her gaze on Caelen\u2019s back. \u201cHe seems a good and fair man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t treat you with the respect you\u2019re due,\u201d Arthur said angrily from her other side.</p><p>Rionna turned in surprise and then surveyed all the men who rode back from Caelen and Gannon. None of them looked happy to have Caelen lead them back to their home. Their mouths were set in firm lines and their eyes were angry and hard.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth neither of us wanted this marriage,\u201d she said. \u2019Twill be an adjustment for the both of us. He never considered that he\u2019d be laird of our clan. Think you how you would feel if you attended your brother\u2019s wedding only to end up being saddled with his unwanted bride.\u201d</p><p>The men winced and James nodded his commiseration.</p><p>\u201cStill, he has no cause to treat you as he\u2019s done,\u201d Simon argued. \u201cThe McCabe warriors have a reputation for being fair. Fierce but fair. You bring him much through your marriage. He should treat you gently as he would any other gently bred lady.\u201d</p><p>Rionna snorted. \u201cWell, now, there\u2019s the rub. I\u2019m no gently bred lady, remember?\u201d</p><p>The men laughed around her and Caelen turned to look over his shoulder at the sudden noise. For a moment his gaze connected with Rionna\u2019s and she stared back, unwilling to let him cow her.</p><p>After a time, he let his gaze slide away and he turned away from her once more.</p><p>\u201cHe has to prove himself to us,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI care naught what the king has decreed. If he is to be laird of our clan, he\u2019ll have to prove he\u2019s worthy of the mantle of leadership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay he prove more worthy than my father,\u201d Rionna whispered.</p><p>The others went silent, perhaps out of loyalty to the man they\u2019d called laird for so many years. Rionna was through acting the dutiful daughter. She had plans for when she returned to her keep.</p><p>Whether her husband liked it or not, she intended to be a major force in the reshaping of her clan. For too long her people had suffered under the poor leadership of a greedy, belligerent fool.</p><p>Perhaps they\u2019d traded one for another. She knew not yet. She hoped Caelen proved a good man and an even better warrior.</p><p>War was imminent. Ewan McCabe was preparing to fight Duncan Cameron and he was taking the whole of the highlands with him to battle.</p><p>Her clan wouldn\u2019t be the sacrificial lamb on the battlefield, if she could help it.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>It was nearing dark when Caelen called a halt to the procession. Rionna was so cold that she\u2019d long since lost feeling in her hands and feet. Her cheeks were numb and she felt cold on the inside.</p><p>She was sure she\u2019d never be warm again. The fires of hell would be welcome at the moment.</p><p>She pried her hands from the reins and tucked them under the fur, hoping to rub some feeling back into them. She dreaded dismounting. She had no wish to set her feet into the snow. She had no wish to do anything that required movement.</p><p>With a fortifying breath, she gripped the saddle and started to dismount. Caelen appeared by her horse and reached up to assist her.</p><p>She was so pathetically grateful that she nearly tumbled into his arms.</p><p>Somehow she managed to put her hands on his shoulders and allow him to lift her down. But when her feet made contact with the ground, her legs buckled and she went down into the snow.</p><p>Caelen immediately reached for her, but when his hands came into contact with her icy skin, he swore a string of blasphemies that singed her ears.</p><p>As he swung her into his arms, he barked out orders for fires to be built and for shelter to be constructed.</p><p>\u201cCaelen, I\u2019m quite well. Just c\u2014cold.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her lips together as the last stammered out. \u2019Twas the truth she was so cold she burned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not well,\u201d he said in a grim voice. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth, woman, are you just trying to kill yourself? Why aren\u2019t you dressed for the cold? And why the hell didn\u2019t you tell me you were so miserable?\u201d</p><p>She would have bitten her tongue off before complaining to him of anything.</p><p>As soon as the fires were laid and began to burn, Caelen carried her and perched on a log as close to the flames as he could without singeing their clothing.</p><p>He opened his fur and put her directly against his chest, where only his tunic and hers separated them. Then he wrapped her firmly into his embrace and allowed some of his warmth to seep into her body.</p><p>Oh \u2019twas wondrous. For a moment.</p><p>As soon as some of the numbing chill began to wear off, her skin began to prickle like a thousand ants were eating her flesh. She whimpered and struggled against him but he only held her tighter and wrapped his arms around her so that she was trapped.</p><p>\u201cHurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know it does, and I\u2019m sorry for it, but \u2019tis the feeling coming back into your body. Be grateful you can feel anything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lecture me. Not now. At least wait until I\u2019m not feeling as though my flesh is being torn from my bones.\u201d</p><p>Caelen chuckled softly. \u201cIt must not be too bad if you still have your sharp tongue. I wouldn\u2019t lecture you if you weren\u2019t such a stubborn lass. If you didn\u2019t have adequate clothing for the journey, you should have said something before we left. I wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to travel in such bitter conditions without proper protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lecturing again,\u201d she grumbled even as she snuggled closer to his body so she could absorb more of his warmth.</p><p>As more heat seeped into her body, she began to shake. Her teeth clattered so violently that she was sure they\u2019d fall right out of her head.</p><p>She burrowed her face into Caelen\u2019s neck as she tried to still the shivers that quaked over her body. \u201cC-cold. I c-can\u2019t get w-warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, lass. \u2019Twill be all right. Just sit still for a bit until I\u2019ve warmed you.\u201d</p><p>She all but crawled inside him. Her hands clutched at his tunic and she kept her face tucked beneath his chin as she breathed the warmer air at the hollow of his throat.</p><p>Eventually her shaking diminished to occasional muscle spasms and she lay limp and exhausted in Caelen\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you warm enough to eat?\u201d Caelen asked.</p><p>She nodded but the truth was she didn\u2019t want to move.</p><p>Carefully he got up and left her sitting on the fallen log. He tugged his fur tighter around her, sealing the opening against the wind. After he was satisfied she wouldn\u2019t teeter off her perch, he strode away, directing the men to finish erecting the shelters.</p><p>A few minutes later, he returned and offered her the heel of a bread loaf and a hunk of cheese. She stuck her fingers out of the fur and hunched over as she ate delicately at the offering.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t taste it. She was just too cold. But it felt good in her belly and it bolstered her flagging energy. As she ate, she watched with detached interest as snow was cleared in a wide arc around the fire. The tents were raised and snow was packed around the bases for extra stability against the stiff winds.</p><p>Extra wood was put on the fire until the flames soared skyward and the entire area glowed orange.</p><p>After she finished the cheese, she extended her fingers toward the fire, delighting in the intense heat that licked the tips.</p><p>Then Caelen was there, standing in front of her. He didn\u2019t speak. He simply hauled her up into his arms and carried her to the tent closest to the fire.</p><p>On the floor was a mound of furs made into a very comfortable-looking bed. He placed her in the middle of them and then pulled her boots off, frowning as he inspected them.</p><p>\u201cThese are a waste of good leather. It\u2019s a wonder you haven\u2019t lost your toes to frostbite. There are more holes than boot left.\u201d</p><p>She was too tired and cold to argue with him.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we have to do something about these,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou can\u2019t go about in the dead of winter with these miserable excuses for boots.\u201d</p><p>Still muttering under his breath, he crawled onto the furs beside her and lined his body up with hers so that she was flush against him. He rolled her to her side and then pulled the furs tight around them.</p><p>\u201cPut your feet between my legs,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>She slipped her bare feet between his thighs and slid them down, moaning at the instant warmth. The man was like a fire himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snuggled into his arms and pressed her face into his chest, sighing at how deliciously warm he felt. He smelled good, too. A mixture of wood, smoke, and his own natural scent. It was an intoxicating blend.</p><p>A groan of raw pleasure escaped her lips. He stiffened and then cursed softly under his breath. She frowned, unsure of what she\u2019d done to gain his displeasure.</p><p>\u201cCaelen? Is something amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Rionna. Go to sleep. We\u2019ll make McDonald keep by afternoon if we leave early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy hands are still cold,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He reached between them, gathered her hands and then guided them underneath his tunic over his belly to the warm, hair-roughened wall of muscle.</p><p>She knew her hands to be like ice, but he didn\u2019t so much as flinch as she pressed her palms into his flesh. The sensation was so ... intimate. Cozy.</p><p>She sighed and rubbed her cheeks along his shoulder, her eyelids growing heavy the warmer she became.</p><p>The slight rasp of hair tickled her fingers and she tentatively moved one hand, enjoying the hard ridge of muscle in his chest. Her eyes widened when she felt the puckered line of a scar.</p> <p>Then she reached the flat of his nipple and the taut bud and she stroked her finger absently over it.</p><p>\u201cRionna,\u201d Caelen growled.</p><p>She raised her head so fast that she caught him underneath the chin, which set him off to cursing again. She gulped. \u201cSorry!\u201d</p><p>He heaved out a long-suffering sigh. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She settled back against him and slipped her hands back under his tunic. She liked touching him. Aside from the wondrous heat he produced, there was something infinitely fascinating about his body.</p><p>Again she rested her palms over the flat of his chest but then she lowered them, sliding to his taut belly and the line of hair that trailed downward.</p> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d Caelen muttered.</p><p>He pulled her hands from his tunic, tucked them between their bodies and pulled her so tightly against him that she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and lay his chin on top of her head. Their legs were tangled up and she was effectively trapped. She couldn\u2019t move a muscle.</p><p>She yawned broadly, deciding she didn\u2019t mind the makeshift prison when she was so wonderfully warm. As she drifted off, it occurred to her that she hadn\u2019t indulged in more kissing with her husband.</p><p>Such a shame. She decided she quite liked kissing. Maybe on the morrow when Caelen wasn\u2019t so gruff and impatient. Aye, \u2019twas a good plan.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow what, lass?\u201d</p><p>Her lips moved but her eyes stayed close as she drifted between consciousness and the heavy veil of sleep. \u201cI\u2019ll kiss you. Tomorrow. Aye, \u2019tis a promise.\u201d</p> <p>His low chuckle drifted through her ears. \u201cAye, lass, you\u2019ll kiss me all right. You\u2019ll do a lot more by the time we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Caelen loosened his hold on Rionna only to see her head loll to the side. Her mouth was open and she was fast asleep. She was, perhaps, the most indelicate sleeper he\u2019d ever witnessed. The sight amused him and he decided she was ... cute. Aye. Cute.</p><p>Then he shook his head. All this talk of kissing and cuteness was going to drive him daft. He should be thinking of training and fighting. The woman was going to be the death of him and they hadn\u2019t been married two days yet.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>It was mid-afternoon the next day when they neared the gates of McDonald keep. It was important to Rionna for her to ride to greet her people under her own power. It seemed just as important to Caelen that she appear the hapless female under his rule.</p><p>She sat before him in the saddle, cradled in his arms, as she\u2019d ridden the entire day. He\u2019d declared she\u2019d ride with him since she wasn\u2019t adequately protected from the cold.</p><p>Rionna had insisted on returning to her own mount when they were a short distance from her keep, but he\u2019d ignored her and kept riding.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth she dreaded facing her people. Much had changed since she\u2019d departed some weeks before. She was returning with a different McCabe brother and without her father. And now she\u2019d be introducing her clan to their new laird.</p><p>A shout went up as soon as the guard in the watch-tower spotted them approaching. Caelen frowned and glanced sideways at Gannon.</p><p>Gannon shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rionna demanded, frowning at their silent communication.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis disgraceful that we got this close to the keep before we were spotted,\u201d Caelen said in disgust. \u201cIf Duncan Cameron gets this close, it will be too late to sound the battle cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps \u2019tis best if you greet your new clan before you criticize them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about their feelings,\u201d Caelen snapped. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned over their safety. And yours.\u201d</p><p>Rionna turned as best she could when the gate began to swing open. As she\u2019d feared, most of the clan had assembled in the courtyard, their curiosity great over Rionna\u2019s new husband.</p><p>\u201cPut me down so that I may introduce you,\u201d she ordered in a low voice.</p><p>His grip tightened around her but he didn\u2019t look at her. He kept his gaze focused on the gathered men and women. He pulled up the reins when he was but a few feet away and then, without a word, he dismounted, his hand going up to steady Rionna so she didn\u2019t tumble from the horse.</p><p>\u201cSee to my wife,\u201d he ordered Gannon.</p><p>See to his wife? See to his wife?</p><p>Rionna gaped at Caelen as he turned away from her to address her clan. Her clan, damn it. Gannon dismounted then reached up and plucked Rionna from the saddle as easily as if she weighed naught.</p><p>He promptly wrapped her in a fur and stood back from Caelen, his hand at her shoulder to keep her in place.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Caelen McCabe,\u201d Caelen said in a calm, direct voice. \u201cI\u2019m Rionna\u2019s husband and your new laird.\u201d</p><p>There were gasps of surprise, exclamations rose, and then everyone began talking at once.</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d Caelen roared.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Gregor?\u201d Nate McDonald called from the middle of the gathered clansmen.</p><p>Several others chimed in. \u201cAye, what happened?\u201d</p><p>Caelen leveled a stare at the crowd. \u201cHe is no longer laird. That is all you need concern yourself with. From this day forward you will swear allegiance and loyalty to me or you\u2019ll leave. My word is absolute. We have much work and training to do if we are to stand strong against the might of Duncan Cameron\u2019s army. Our alliance with my brothers, Ewan and Alaric McCabe, as well as your neighboring clans will make us invincible. If you want to keep what is yours and raise your children in peace, then we must fight. And if we must fight, then we must be ready when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>Her clansmen exchange wary, suspicious glances. They looked at Caelen and then beyond to her as if they expected her to speak up. She would have, too, if for nothing else than to ease their fears, but Caelen turned and fixed her with a glare that momentarily kept her silent.</p><p>As he turned back, she pulled from Gannon\u2019s grasp and hurried forward to address her clan.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis an alliance that pleases our king. He blessed our marriage himself. The agreement was always for whomever I married to take over as laird of our clan. Instead of at the birth of my first child, Caelen McCabe takes the mantle of leadership now. We need him. We need his direction if we are to prove victorious against those who take our land and homes from us.\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned his furious stare on her but she calmly faced her clan, taking in their indecision and their confusion.</p><p>\u201cMy father was without honor,\u201d she said in a clear voice devoid of emotion. \u201c \u2019Tis my hope that under the leadership of a new laird we will regain what was lost. We will hold our heads high as we defend our legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be silent,\u201d Caelen said in a low, dangerous voice. \u201cGo into the keep. Now.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes would have made a warrior tuck tail and run. But Rionna turned stiffly, her shoulders straight, and walked at a sedate pace toward the keep as if it had been her intention to do so all along after she finished with her speech.</p><p>As soon as she entered the keep, her legs sagged and she faltered her way into the hall. Sarah hurried to greet her, placing her gnarled hands on Rionna\u2019s shoulders with a grip that made Rionna wince.</p><p>\u201cTell me all, lass. What\u2019s this about you marrying Caelen McCabe and him replacing our laird? Where\u2019s your father? And our men!\u201d</p><p>Rionna carefully pulled Sarah\u2019s hands away and then sank wearily into one of the chairs at the table. \u201c \u2019Tis a long story, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, seems to me I\u2019ve got nothing better to do than listen if I\u2019m to know what\u2019s about here. How on earth did you find yourself married to Caelen McCabe? \u2019Tis common enough knowledge he\u2019s foresworn to never marry. He was a young lad when he made the vow. Fresh after a betrayal by a lass he loved.\u201d</p><p>Rionna emitted a gloomy sigh. Wonderful. Foresworn to never marry and yet he\u2019d sacrificed himself for an emotion he had no use for. Love. Alaric\u2019s and Keeley\u2019s love.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d decided it mattered naught if he never had plans to give his heart to another woman.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the story, Sarah? Why did his love betray him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be telling me a story, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will,\u201d Rionna cut in impatiently. \u201cRight now I\u2019m more interested in this vow my husband made and why.\u201d</p><p>Sarah blew out her breath, then looked around. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll tell you what I know. Eight years ago Caelen McCabe fell in love with Elsepeth Cameron. \u2019Tis the truth she seduced him. She was a wee bit older than the lad. More worldly, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rionna didn\u2019t but she wasn\u2019t about to admit it.</p><p>\u201cAll along she was in league with her kinsman, Duncan Cameron. She drugged the soldiers and opened the gate for Cameron\u2019s men. \u2019Twas a horrible massacre. Caelen lost his father in the attack and Ewan McCabe lost his young wife. The brothers were away at the time of the attack, and when they returned, they found the keep in ruins and their kin murdered. \u2019Twas a terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Rionna murmured. \u201cSo the dolt now believes all women are evil and has vowed never to open his heart to another.\u201d She shook her head and rolled her eyes heavenward. \u201cWhy are men so stupid?\u201d</p><p>Sarah threw back her head and laughed. \u201cWell now, lass, that\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve a tough path ahead of you, but if anyone can convince the laddie that a woman\u2019s heart is true and loyal, you can. There\u2019s no more loyal or fierce a lass than yourself.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Caelen thought her to be the price he had to pay for his brother\u2019s happiness and his clan\u2019s welfare.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what transpired at the McCabes and why your father has not returned nor all of our men.\u201d</p><p>Rionna quickly related all that had occurred while they had sojourned at the McCabes. Including Caelen\u2019s demand that her father cede the leadership of his clan to him and her father\u2019s subsequent departure.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how many of the men would have chosen to follow my father had they not wives and children back home. The men who left with my father had no close kin to worry over seeing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis more a concern what they are about now,\u201d Sarah said carefully. \u201cYour father is a vain man and not one to suffer insult lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fool,\u201d Rionna hissed. \u201cA lecherous old fool who placed his wants and desires above his clan\u2019s. He deserved to be removed as laird.\u201d</p><p>Sarah patted Rionna\u2019s hand comfortingly. \u201cThere, there, lass. No need to get worked up over a foolish old man. His time is over. \u2019Tis time to look to the future. The McCabes are a fierce clan. It took them long to rebuild but I believe Ewan to be honorable. I can only imagine his brothers would be the same. Perhaps Caelen is just what this clan needs if we are to survive the coming hard times.\u201d</p><p>Rionna didn\u2019t doubt that Caelen McCabe would be good for her clan. He was a fierce warrior with no equal on the battlefield. He commanded respect from the men around him. She knew the McDonald soldiers weren\u2019t the fittest. Nor were they the worst. But she\u2019d seen firsthand the might of the McCabe warriors and she wanted that for the McDonalds. Aye, Caelen was a better choice than even Alaric McCabe.</p><p>She just wished that she could be equally sure that he\u2019d be a good husband and father to her children.</p><p>If he\u2019d already closed his heart, what chance did Rionna have of opening it?</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Rionna didn\u2019t see her husband for the remainder of the day. He didn\u2019t even come in to sup, and Rionna ate in the cold great hall alone.</p><p>She hated the feeling that she didn\u2019t know her place among her own clan. She\u2019d remained in the keep ever since he\u2019d ordered her inside. Not because he\u2019d told her to, but because she simply had no idea what to do or what to say to her clan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cowardice made her choke. The food she\u2019d tried to consume stuck in her throat and she couldn\u2019t force it down no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>She alternated between wanting Caelen to put in an appearance so she could dress him down for humiliating her in front of her kinsmen and wanting him to stay as far away as possible so she didn\u2019t have to face him. Not until she regained her courage and decided her next course.</p><p>Disgusted with her sudden timidity, she pushed aside her food and backed from the table. She wasn\u2019t going to sit around arguing with herself about whether she wanted to see her husband. He could rot. She was tired. Beyond exhausted. It was past time she sought her bed.</p><p>She braced herself for the cold when she swung her door open. Her room lacked a hearth for a fire, but there were no windows so no wind blew through the chamber. She collected two candles and returned to the hall to light them from one of the torches lining the walls.</p><p>The meager light brightened the tiny chamber and the warm glow chased away some of the chill, although it was all in the perception. The half-burned candles could hardly provide enough warmth to make a difference. But still, they cheered her and made her feel a little warmer.</p><p>\u2019Twas cold enough that she decided to leave her clothing on. All she did was remove her boots and then she donned her one luxury. A pair of wool stockings that Sarah had darned for her.</p><p>She sighed as the soft, warm material slid over her feet. She flexed her toes and then climbed beneath the furs on her bed.</p><p>Her eyes closed immediately but she didn\u2019t fall asleep. Her mind was too occupied with all that had transpired in the last fortnight.</p><p>If she were honest with herself, she\u2019d admit to more than just passing trepidation. She was afraid of her future. Afraid for the future of her clan.</p><p>No matter that she\u2019d always dressed as a man and indulged in swordplay while other girls dreamed of marriage and children. She harbored secret girlish dreams of her own. She imagined beautiful dresses and a warrior with no equal falling to one knee in front of her to pledge his undying love and loyalty.</p><p>She smiled dreamily and snuggled deeper into the covers. Aye, \u2019twas a nice fantasy. Her warrior wouldn\u2019t only love her beyond reason. He\u2019d accept her faults and he\u2019d be proud of her accomplishments in warfare. He\u2019d boast to his men that his wife was a warrior. A warrior princess with unrivaled beauty and accomplishment.</p><p>They\u2019d fight side by side and then return to the keep where she\u2019d dress in fine gowns gifted to her by her husband. She\u2019d serve him a fine meal directed by her own hand. Then they\u2019d sit by the fire and sip fine ale before retiring to their chamber where he\u2019d hold her and whisper words of love to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she muttered, self-loathing suddenly consuming her. No man would ever accept one such as her. A man wanted someone like Keeley. All soft and gentle with traits acceptable to a gentle lady. Like healing. Or needlework. Or a woman who could run a keep and always have a fine meal on the table.</p><p>All Rionna could do was cause injuries that required women of Keeley\u2019s skill to patch them up and send them back into battle. Rionna had neither a gentle touch nor womanly softness.</p><p>She frowned but kept her eyes shut. So what if she wasn\u2019t as other women? She wasn\u2019t lacking. Nor was she less. She was simply ... different. Aye, she was different and a good man would celebrate those differences. If Caelen McCabe couldn\u2019t appreciate his wife the way she was, then he could sit on his sword and have a good spin.</p><p>The room was suspiciously warm. And the bed was softer and more luxurious than what she was accustomed to. She was aware that something was entirely different, but she couldn\u2019t force herself awake long enough to take stock of the situation.</p><p>Determined not to ruin a perfectly good dream, she snuggled deeper into the warm haven and sighed.</p><p>A soft chuckle intruded on her euphoria just as a lingering brush along the swell of her breast sent a shiver racing through her belly.</p><p>Her breast? She\u2019d gone to bed with them bound. Indeed, she hadn\u2019t undressed. She\u2019d fallen into bed fully clothed and had been asleep in a matter of minutes.</p><p>She cracked one eye open to see her husband undressing a mere foot from where she lay. She wasn\u2019t in her chamber. Nor was she in her father\u2019s. Best she could tell she was in one of the chambers reserved for honored guests. Not that there had ever been many of those at the McDonald keep.</p><p>Rather than bolt upward and demand how she\u2019d gotten from her chamber to here, she silently observed Caelen as he removed his tunic.</p><p>His back was to her and his muscles rippled as he pulled the material over his head and tossed it aside. He spent a moment stretching before he began to divest himself of his trews.</p><p>Her cheeks burned when his buttocks came into view. Hard but with enough shape to appeal to her feminine senses. Paler than the rest of his body and supported by two tree trunks for legs. There wasn\u2019t a spare inch of flesh anywhere that she could see. All tight muscles, hair roughened and dark.</p> <p>She shivered again but it had naught to do with being cold.</p><p>He was a beautiful warrior. All that a woman like herself admired. Not perfect. But beautiful still.</p><p>Scars ran the length of his body, from his ankles to his nape. She found herself eager to explore each of them with her fingers and her ... mouth.</p><p>Would he enjoy the same attentions as he\u2019d given her on their wedding night? The idea of kissing and tasting him so intimately tightened areas of her body that didn\u2019t bear mentioning.</p><p>She glanced down, once again cognizant of the fact that she was naked. Not a single stitch of clothing remained.</p><p>The furs felt sensual against her bare skin. Her entire body was in a state of heightened sensitivity. Her nipples were hard points, thrusting upward as if begging for her husband\u2019s mouth.</p><p>She almost groaned. He did indeed possess a wicked, wicked mouth. And tongue. She couldn\u2019t forget the wonders of that talented tongue.</p><p>Her most intimate flesh twitched and drew up until an ache bloomed deep in her womb. What was happening to her that merely viewing her husband and remembering his attentions wreaked such havoc with her body?</p><p>She stirred restlessly, no longer able to lie still. Caelen heard and turned to look at her, unabashed by his complete nudity.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the sight of his manhood, so rigid and ... erect. It, like the rest of him, was hard and fierce looking. She swallowed nervously as her gaze finally lifted to meet her husband\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo you are awake.\u201d</p><p>She nodded dumbly. Of course she was awake. Any fool could see that.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you sleeping in that tiny, airless chamber? Were you hiding?\u201d</p><p>His look suggested he was amused by that prospect. She scowled and sat up, realizing too late that the movement bared her entire upper body to his gaze.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis my chamber. Where else would I sleep?\u201d</p><p>He cocked one eyebrow as if to tell her the absurdity of her statement.</p><p>She bared her teeth in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t see you once, not even at the evening meal. How am I to know what your expectations are?\u201d</p><p>He curled his hand around the base of his erection and pulled upward, his gaze never leaving her. A faint smile hovered on his lips, one that told her whatever it was he\u2019d say would infuriate her.</p><p>\u201cHave I neglected my new wife?\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnd here I thought I was attending to important matters like the defense of your clan and asserting my authority.\u201d</p><p>She curled her fingers into the bedcovers until they were bunched in her fists. \u201c \u2019Tis your clan now. Not only my clan. You speak as though you do us a grand favor, but \u2019tis the truth you gain much in this bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fierce you look, wife. Have I told you how appealing I find you when you scowl at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not my purpose to be appealing!\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he moved closer to the bed, his hand still doing curious things to his swollen shaft. She couldn\u2019t help but stare. It seemed it was all she could focus on.</p><p>\u201cWhether \u2019tis your purpose or not, it doesn\u2019t change the way of things. I go as hard as a stone every time you open that saucy mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>He loomed over the bed\u2014and her\u2014leaving her feeling small and vulnerable. The look in his eyes made her nervous. There was promise there, but of what she was unsure. She licked her lips and edged back, clutching for the furs to cover herself with.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis no use hiding your charms, lass. I\u2019ll find them soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mean you?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u2019Twas the truth it was becoming increasingly more difficult to draw air into her lungs. Her chest was tight and an odd squeezing sensation gripped her until she was light-headed.</p><p>He tugged the furs from her clenching fingers and tossed them down toward her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is that tonight I\u2019m not going to stop short of my complete and utter satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed as his fingers stroked over one full breast to her nipple. He thumbed it gently until it puckered into a taut bud.</p><p>\u201cAnd my satisfaction?\u201d she asked crossly. The man sounded selfish and arrogant.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be complaining, lass. You certainly weren\u2019t the night after our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>She had nothing to say to that because the man was certainly right.</p><p>Her legs trembled. Her fingers shook. Butterflies danced in her belly and up into her throat.</p><p>He bent over and then slid one knee onto the bed until he was over her, so close that she could feel the heat of his breath.</p><p>Instead of pressing his mouth to hers as she expected, he angled his head and brushed his lips over her neck.</p><p>It was like being caught in a fierce lightning storm.</p><p>She gasped and arched upward, her head falling back in an invitation for him to nuzzle below her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou have beautiful skin, lass.\u201d</p><p>His voice purred over her throat, vibrating and husky until her entire body tingled in anticipation of where he\u2019d kiss her next.</p><p>His teeth sank into the column of her neck, light and grazing, a gentle nip and then one a bit harder.</p><p>\u201cYou taste as sweet as you look.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. \u201cYou have a wicked mouth, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think I\u2019ve only just begun.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Rionna reached up to grasp Caelen\u2019s shoulders, her fingers digging into his hard muscles. She strained upward, wanting more of his mouth. Shivers of delight raced in patterns over her flesh, like raindrops on a warm summer afternoon.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, lass. Hold on to me.\u201d</p><p>Gently he lowered her until her back met the bed and she landed with a soft bounce.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a feast for a man\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it the bed chamber is the only place you have a kind word for me?\u201d she said with a twist of her lips.</p><p>He reared back, a faint smile curving his mouth. \u201c \u2019Tis the only time you\u2019re obedient, wife.\u201d</p><p>She balled her fist and hit him ineffectually on the shoulder. He captured her wrist and pulled it over her head, holding it there as he cupped one of her breasts and caressed the swell.</p><p>He stroked lazily with his fingers, tracing soft lines to her nipple. He captured the peak and pulled, gently at first and then sharper. Each tug sent a streak of pleasure straight to her core. Her womb clenched. She squeezed her thighs together and arched farther into his touch.</p><p>Then he lowered his head until his breath blew warm over the puckered bud. She moaned in anticipation, hardly recognizing the breathy, feminine sounds sliding from her throat.</p><p>Warm and rough, his tongue slid sensuously over her nipple, leaving a damp trail to the top of her breast. He released her wrist and lowered his hand to cup her other breast. He kneaded and massaged and then plumped them together.</p><p>He licked over one nipple and then pressed a tender kiss to the tip before moving to the other. She stared down at his dark head as he suckled. With each pull, her body tightened more until she was rigid beneath him.</p><p>Unable to resist, she thrust her fingers into his long, black hair. She stroked the braids at his temples, pulling when he stopped sucking. With a chuckle, he resumed and she relaxed her hold so that she threaded through the strands, enjoying the slide over her hands.</p><p>\u201cI have a mind to taste you again, to feel your honey on my tongue,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let her hands fall away as he kissed a path over her belly and lower to the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>He leaned over on his side, his big hand splayed over her pelvis. He propped himself up on his other elbow and idly toyed with the curls shielding her femininity. It mortified her and fascinated her with equal measure.</p><p>Part of her wanted to squeeze her thighs shut and turn away and the other part wanted to open them to give him easier access.</p><p>Carefully he delved inward and gently parted her flesh until she was open and damp to his touch. With one finger, he stroked down and then back up again to circle the tiny sensitive nub.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fair to bursting, lass. I want to bury myself deep inside your warmth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes widened at the image his words provoked. She went still beneath his fingers and stared down at him. He tilted his head back so he met her gaze, and the intensity in his eyes made her mouth go dry.</p><p>His hand left her and slid up her belly to cup her breast and he leaned down to kiss the tip, forming it into a tight peak. Then he shifted his body and moved up so their lips were just a breath apart.</p><p>He touched her cheek with the back of one finger and trailed over her cheekbone to her jaw. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, lass. You were afraid our wedding night. \u2019Tis why I didn\u2019t bed you. I\u2019ll be as gentle as a man can be when he\u2019s shaking with want for his bride.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to refute his assertion that she was afraid of anything but the protest died as she blew her breath out and closed her lips once more.</p><p>Then he kissed her, his mouth moving with infinite tenderness over her lips. All the while his hands slid over her body, stroking, caressing. Soothing.</p><p>Somehow he managed to shift over her, his body covering hers like a warm blanket. One muscled thigh wedged between hers and nudged them farther apart.</p><p>She was so senseless from his kisses that she hadn\u2019t registered that his very large, very naked body was pressing tightly against hers, and another very hard, very large portion of his anatomy was prodding insistently at her most intimate flesh.</p><p>He found her opening and went still as she stretched around the tip of his manhood. Her startled gaze flew to his face. She tensed, unable to prevent the unease that gripped her.</p><p>\u201cRelax, lass,\u201d he whispered against the corner of her mouth. \u201c \u2019Twill be easier if you give over. I\u2019ll give you pleasure. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs around me and hold on to my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her legs and twined them around his, sliding her calves up the hairy, muscled wall of his legs to lock them behind his knees.</p><p>Her hands felt small on his shoulders. Her fingers barely left dents in the hard flesh. She stared into his eyes and found gentleness there. It comforted her that he worried over frightening her. Surely she could find courage. How could she expect him to respect his \u201cwarrior princess\u201d if she never showed her to him?</p><p>\u201cCome to me, husband,\u201d she said boldly.</p><p>His hardness found her again, firm against her softness. Probing and insistent.</p><p>She gave a little gasp when he slipped the barest inch inside her body. She stretched to accommodate him but the fullness unsettled her.</p><p>It was an odd combination of hesitancy and urgency. She wanted him to stop and yet she wanted him to continue.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and lifted her hips, urging him on.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass, how sweetly you beckon me.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and a shudder rolled over his shoulders. Beneath her fingertips, he trembled and shook, so tense, as if he fought against his every instinct to hold back.</p><p>She ran her hands up and down his shoulders and arms, caressing as her heart softened. He truly was taking the utmost care with her.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His lips were thin, white lines on a face etched in concentration.</p> <p>\u201cAye, but I must, lass. I must break through your maidenhead and \u2019twill pain you no matter what I do.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a kiss across her mouth and then he wooed her gently, feeding and sipping at her lips. \u201c \u2019Tis sorry I am for it, but there is naught to do for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be done with it. There is no sense in both of us being in pain. I can feel the tension in your body. \u2019Tis uncomfortable for you to hold back as you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>He gave a soft laugh. \u201cYou have no idea, lass. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, she initiated an intimate gesture. Her hands framed his face, her thumbs feathering over his firm cheekbones. She caressed his angular jaw and then smoothed her fingers over his lips.</p><p>Raising her head, she framed his face once more and pulled him down into a long kiss. Their tongues tangled hotly. She had no breath but she refused to pull away. His kiss was intoxicating. The sweetest nectar she\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>Her body opened under his insistent push. \u2019Twas like having a fiery sword invade her depths. So hard and velvety. Her body resisted his intent to conquer but he held her in place, his hands grasping her hips as he thrust again.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, lass. \u2019Twill be over in an instant.\u201d</p><p>Just as their mouths met in a breathless rush, he thrust hard and deep. She was unprepared for the pain. Aye, she\u2019d known what had to happen, but she\u2019d expected a twinge. Maybe even a brief piercing pain. But not this tearing sensation that had her insides feeling brushed by fire.</p><p>She cried out and tears sprang unbidden to her eyes, burning as they trailed down her cheeks.</p><p>Caelen immediately stilled, his cock buried deep inside her passage. There was matching pain in his expression as he clenched his jaw tightly. His nostrils flared and he took in several deep breaths as he shuddered against her.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, her eyelids, each cheekbone, and even her nose. Then he kissed away the trails of moisture sliding over her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, lass. So very sorry.\u201d</p><p>The ache in his voice made her heart twist. A knot formed in her throat, swelling until she couldn\u2019t shape the words she most wanted to say.</p><p>He kissed her again even as a harsh groan welled from his chest.</p><p>\u201cTell me when \u2019tis better. I\u2019ll not move until you say me aye.\u201d</p><p>She clenched experimentally around him, testing the tenderness of her sheath.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, lass. Have mercy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, relieved that some of the fiery pain had dulled to an odd ache deep in her womb. \u201c \u2019Tis much better now. The pain has dulled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI cannot hold out much longer.\u201d</p><p>She swept a hand over his damp brow and then thrust her fingers into his hair as she pulled him down into a deep kiss.</p><p>\u201cFinish it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He carefully withdrew and her eyes widened at the myriad of sensations that bombarded her. She was tender, aye, and the discomfort was there, but there was also an incredible burn that had nothing to do with pain.</p><p>\u201cEasy now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cGive it time, lass. You\u2019ll feel pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He pushed forward again, slowly and with such tenderness that she sighed. He seemed so determined that the experience be as pleasant as possible for her.</p><p>His fingers found her nipple and he rubbed the pad of his thumb over the peak until it stiffened and became erect. Then he caressed the other until both breasts were achingly tight.</p><p>He smiled down at her, a wicked gleam in his eyes. \u201cYou grow wet around me. The breasts you try so hard to hide bring you much pleasure. And me. They are beautiful like you and a credit to your womanhood. They are soft, as a woman should be, and pleasing to look upon. There is naught I can find fault with you, lass. God fashioned you a perfect woman. I am a lucky man, indeed.\u201d</p><p>Oh but she planned to remind him of his honeyed words the next time he turned his scowl of disapproval on her. And she\u2019d remember each and every one of his endearments. She\u2019d hold them close to her heart and pretend that she was his cherished love and not a bride thrust upon him for the sake of loyalty and honor.</p><p>Keeley had warned her that a man would say a lot when his cock was involved. Things he didn\u2019t necessarily mean. Now Rionna understood what Keeley had meant.</p><p>He withdrew and thrust again, this time with much more ease. He was right. She had grown damp the moment he fondled her breasts. For so long they\u2019d been such a source of irritation but now she was discovering that they had their uses after all.</p><p>For the first time she embraced the idea that somehow she was feminine. Beautiful even. She didn\u2019t despair of appearing softer and not as fierce. It felt good to be a woman in a strong warrior\u2019s arms. Aye, it felt good indeed.</p><p>\u201cDo I hurt you still?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She raised her mouth to his. \u201cNay, warrior. You feel very, very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you, wife.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands underneath her buttocks and cupped her, spreading her wider and holding her closer to him. He thrust, burying himself deeper than before.</p><p>Gone was the tender warrior who\u2019d strove not to cause her any pain. Now that he was assured of her comfort, he began planting himself inside her as if he were proving his possession, his right to possess her.</p><p>His teeth scraped her jaw and then moved lower to her neck. His breath blew hot over her skin, scorching a path from her ear to her shoulder.</p><p>He alternately nipped, sucked, and kissed her until she was sure she\u2019d wear the marks for an entire fortnight. He was insatiable, as if he\u2019d starved himself of her for too long and could no longer control his intense hunger.</p><p>She threw back her head, surrendering to his power. She offered her submission freely. He awoke a fierce longing within her. Feelings that she\u2019d never considered. She wanted to belong to him. She wanted to be cherished by him.</p><p>She was his wife. She closed her eyes and her heart to the reason for their marriage. Just because it had begun one way didn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t change to something else entirely.</p><p>She wanted his love.</p><p>Aye, she demanded it.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d had a taste of his regard and his tenderness, she knew he was capable. Aye, he was more than capable of more tender feelings. No matter what he thought, his heart wasn\u2019t completely closed to love.</p><p>It was up to her to show him.</p><p>Faster and harder he moved between her legs. Refusing to lie passively as he staked his claim, she returned each kiss and each caress with equal fervor.</p><p>He might be claiming her, but she was staking her claim as well.</p><p>This warrior was hers. He was her husband. Her lover.</p><p>Never would she let him go.</p><p>He slipped one hand between them and brushed his fingertips over her quivering flesh just as he thrust fiercely into her once more.</p><p>\u2019Twas all that was needed for her to lose all sense of herself. The flash bewildered her. One moment she was drawn as tight as a bowstring and the next she was being flung across the star-filled sky, scattering just like the twinkling lights.</p><p>Her mind went completely and utterly blank. All she could process was the incredible pleasure that flooded her veins and slugged like thick honey through her limbs.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t draw a breath. She panted, her nostrils flaring with the effort it took to pull air into her lungs.</p><p>Above her, Caelen gave a shout and then thrust forward so hard that he collapsed onto her body, driving them both deep into the mattress.</p><p>His forehead hit the pillow beside her head and he dug his arms underneath her so that he gathered her tight against his body.</p><p>Between her thighs, he flinched and flexed as his big body shuddered helplessly above her.</p><p>His chest heaved, and she knew that he had the same difficulty in drawing breath.</p><p>With a smile, she wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him tightly. She closed her eyes and rested her cheek in the curve of his neck as she absorbed the wondrous sensation of their bodies joined so tight that naught could separate them.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Rionna woke to blissful warmth. She was surrounded by heat. She flexed her toes experimentally and sighed when they dug into the warm furs. Lazily her eyelids fluttered open and she saw a fire blazing in the hearth. Waking to a fire was a luxury she was unused to, and she quickly decided that it was one she could quickly grow to like.</p><p>She glanced sideways to see the space beside her bare. There was not even any sign that Caelen had lain beside her, their limbs tangled together for most of the night.</p><p>She stretched her arm over the furs where Caelen had indeed spent the night and stroked the pillow where his head had rested.</p><p>Her body felt the effects of her husband\u2019s possession. When she moved, the tenderness between her legs was more pronounced and there was a soreness in her muscles like she usually felt after a vigorous sparring session.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth she had no desire to move from the bed.</p><p>Aye she was sore but it was a delicious soreness. One she\u2019d willingly suffer again and again. She closed her eyes and stretched leisurely, calling back the images of Caelen over her, inside her, stroking deep, his mouth making sweet, sweet love to her flesh.</p><p>A sound at the door had her opening her eyes and turning to see who was about. Sarah stuck her head in and once she saw Rionna was awake, she bustled in and shut the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObservant as ever,\u201d Rionna said dryly.</p><p>Sarah clucked under her breath and rolled her eyes in Rionna\u2019s direction. \u201cThe laird thought you\u2019d like a bath before you begin your instructions. I\u2019m having water brought up to fill the tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTub? What tub?\u201d</p><p>Rionna sat up, pulling the furs to her chest. She rubbed her eyes and stared around the room to see a large wooden tub situated in front of the fire. Such a thing had escaped her when she\u2019d just awoken. When had Caelen had a tub brought in? Likely before he carried her into his chamber the night before.</p><p>Then something else Sarah had said registered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cInstructions? What instructions?\u201d</p><p>Rionna swung her feet over the edge, still clutching the furs to her naked body.</p><p>Sarah smiled. \u201cThe laird wants me and the other women to instruct you on the duties of the lady of the keep. He said \u2019tis obvious you have no knowledge of such, and now that you are wife to the laird \u2019tis time for you to take your place.\u201d</p><p>Rionna sat in the tub, water up to her ears, silently fuming. After a night of pure heaven, a night when she was sure that she and Caelen would start anew, that he would actually act as though he cared something for her, he\u2019d gotten up from their bed and ordered her to start acting like his meek little wife.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Sarah was sitting by the tub, ticking off the list of instructions from Caelen.</p><p>She was not to dress as a man. She was not to indulge in activities unbecoming a lady, and he went on to specify swordplay, fighting, or any other activity assigned to a warrior. She wasn\u2019t to bind her breasts.</p><p>That directive had Rionna turning scarlet, her cheeks so scorched that the steaming water suddenly seemed tepid. Could he have humiliated her any further?</p><p>\u201cNow, lass, don\u2019t look like that,\u201d Sarah soothed. \u201c \u2019Tis not as if he told the entire keep. He pulled me aside, he did. Told me his wishes and instructed me not to say a word to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he had anything to say, he should have spoken to me,\u201d Rionna hissed.</p> <p>Sarah snorted. \u201cAnd you would have ignored him and gone about your usual practices.\u201d</p><p>Rionna bared her teeth. \u201cWhat is so wrong with my usual practices?\u201d</p><p>Sarah poured a bucket of water over Rionna\u2019s head and then shoved her underneath the water. Rionna came up sputtering and glaring at Sarah, who sat grinning with a look of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth, I\u2019ve waited a long time to get my hands on you, lass. Your father cared naught how you behaved even though he disapproved. He was a lazy man who should have taken you in hand long before you reached the age you are now. And your mother should have taught you the ways of the lady of the keep, but she was too busy keeping your father away from the other lasses. You\u2019ve not had a good example to be sure, but that\u2019s all going to come to an end starting today. I\u2019m going to mold you into the finest lady of the keep the McDonald clan has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>The determination in the older woman\u2019s eyes made Rionna\u2019s shoulders sag in resignation. There was unholy delight in Sarah\u2019s gaze. She was practically rubbing her hands in glee.</p><p>\u201cFirst we\u2019re going to measure you for new gowns. The bodices of your current dresses will never fit you with those breasts out of bondage. I\u2019ve already got three of the women altering one of the dresses that your mother wore. A few stitches here and there and you\u2019ll have dresses you can wear until we can outfit you in a new wardrobe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t the funds to outfit me in a new wardrobe,\u201d Rionna said darkly.</p><p>Sarah shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not to worry over that. The laird is expecting all manner of supplies from his brother in the next fortnight. He told me himself that he specifically sent word that you needed warm clothing and all the trappings befitting a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018All the trappings befitting a lady,\u2019 \u201d Rionna mimicked.</p><p>\u201cHush now. The water\u2019s growing cold. Your grumbling doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019ve a lot of learning ahead of you. \u2019Twill be better for all if you go about it with a good attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh let me sulk a bit,\u201d Rionna said. \u201cI know you have the right of it, but \u2019tis the truth I have no liking for the task.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled and reached over to pat Rionna\u2019s cheek. \u201cI love you like you were my own bairn. And I\u2019m going to treat you like my bairn, which means I\u2019ll cuff you on the back of the head if you give me any sass.\u201d</p><p>Rionna grinned and then sobered. \u201cWhat think you of the new laird?\u201d</p><p>Sarah cocked her head as she gave the matter consideration.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s a gruff man, but I think he\u2019s fair. He\u2019s hard, and he likes things a certain way. It might take the clan a bit to grow accustomed to his ways, but I think we\u2019ll be a better clan for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Rionna said grudgingly. \u201cI just want ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, lass?\u201d</p><p>Rionna pressed her lips together, determined not to show weakness in front of Sarah. What she wanted were things a girl wanted. Dreams a girl dreamed. Not what a woman full grown with a responsibility to her clan spent her day being foolish over.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis no matter what I want,\u201d she said quietly. \u201c \u2019Tis what the laird wants that matters.\u201d</p><p>Caelen stood in the courtyard, arms crossed, expression stony as he surveyed the McDonald soldiers training. Gannon stood beside him and every once in awhile shook his head in dismay.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not time to shape these men into a decent army,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cWe won\u2019t stand a chance against Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I have anything to say about it,\u201d Caelen said grimly. \u201cThey have the skill. They just haven\u2019t had the proper training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir best warrior is a woman,\u201d Gannon said in disgust. \u201cRionna bested Diormid, remember?\u201d</p><p>Caelen scowled. He didn\u2019t need a reminder of his wife\u2019s prowess with a sword. He had no intention of allowing her to get herself killed. The sooner he got her with child, the sooner she\u2019d settle down and turn her attention to more womanly pursuits. Then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry over what trouble she got into.</p><p>\u201cFind me the leaders,\u201d Caelen said to Gannon. \u201c \u2019Tis obvious they have no regard for my authority yet. I\u2019ll make my case to the most senior men and let them know I\u2019m no threat to their leadership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching,\u201d Gannon murmured. \u201cSimon McDonald wields much influence within his clan. The men listen to him and look to him for guidance. Arlen McDonald is another elder whom the younger soldiers look to for guidance. He\u2019s adept with a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them I want a meeting with them in the great hall. Invite them to have the noon meal and we\u2019ll talk then. We\u2019ll have need to break the men into smaller groups for training purposes. I\u2019ll need the help of the McDonald men in positions of leadership if we are to accomplish all we need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I agree. It won\u2019t be an easy task.\u201d</p><p>Caelen grinned at his commander. \u201cYou said you desired a new challenge.\u201d</p><p>Gannon shot him a disgruntled look. \u201cWhen I said that, whipping an entire army into shape wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sighed. \u201cNor is it what I had in mind either. \u2019Tis the truth I don\u2019t even know where to begin. The task before us is overwhelming in its enormity.\u201d</p><p>Gannon laid a hand on Caelen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cA more able taskmaster I\u2019ve never met. \u2019Tis the truth if anyone can do it, you can.\u201d</p><p>Caelen scanned the sparring warriors and grimaced. He hoped Gannon was right. The next weeks would be grueling, and his only chance of success was in gaining the cooperation of his new clan.</p><p>So far no one had greeted him with anything but reserve and suspicion.</p><p>\u201cFind Simon and Arlen,\u201d he ordered Gannon. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the hall waiting.\u201d</p><p>As he strode into the keep, he glanced at the serving women scurrying to and fro, in the midst of their chores. He searched for his wife but didn\u2019t see her. But then neither did he spot Sarah, who\u2019d promised to take Rionna under her wing and guide her with a gentle hand.</p><p>He entered the hall to find it barren. He frowned, knowing it was close to time for the noon meal. There was no activity to suggest such a thing was forthcoming. No fire burned in the hearth. No smells emanated from the kitchens. No places had been set at the table.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even know the name of someone to summon to answer his questions. In disgust, he left the hall and walked in the direction of distant voices.</p><p>When he entered the room he could only suppose was where the women did the washing, he found his wife in a state of agitation, her hands on her hips and her face red as she stared back at Sarah.</p><p>The dress she wore was fine, if a bit worn. The bodice was a little\u2014a lot\u2014too tight and Rionna\u2019s supple breasts pushed up and over the embroidered neckline. She looked ... beautiful. Dainty and feminine. He was hard-pressed to place her in the scruffy men\u2019s clothing, with a dirt-smeared face, shapeless bosom, and hair tightly plastered to her head.</p><p>She looked every inch the elegant mistress of the keep. She rivaled Mairin and Keeley in beauty and form.</p><p>That was until she opened her mouth and cut loose with a string of blasphemies he was certain had never crossed his sisters-in-law\u2019s mouths.</p><p>She was still cursing when she turned and saw him standing in the doorway. Her lips snapped shut and she glared at him as if peeved over his intrusion. He lifted one eyebrow when no request for pardon came forth.</p><p>Her palms dug deeper into her hips as she stared him down. Her eyes flashed, an odd mixture of amber and gold.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to check up on me, husband?\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened and he pinned her with a glare of his own.</p><p>\u201cI came to find out why no meal is being served in the great hall. It\u2019s past the time for the noon meal. The soldiers have already put in a hard day\u2019s work and will be hungry. As am I.\u201d</p><p>Rionna stared at him, her brows drawn together in puzzlement. The other women stared at him as well, as if he\u2019d said something utterly ridiculous.</p><p>Sarah was the first to speak. She glanced at Rionna and then took a step forward. \u201cWe don\u2019t serve a meal at noon, Laird.\u201d</p><p>He frowned again. \u201cAny particular reason why not? \u2019Tis important for the men to eat. Their strength must be kept up, especially now that they\u2019ll be training even harder.\u201d</p><p>Rionna cleared her throat. \u201cWhat she\u2019s so delicately trying to say is that we don\u2019t have the food. We break our fast with bread and cheese, when we have it to spare, and we end the day with whatever we\u2019ve been able to hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when the hunt isn\u2019t successful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t eat,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>He shook his head. None of this made sense. The McDonalds might not be the best trained when it came to the might of their army, but they\u2019d always been a well-placed clan.</p><p>\u201cYour father wagered my brother three months\u2019 worth of food from his stores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have it to wager,\u201d Rionna said bitterly. \u201cHe left us with nothing to eat and no coin to trade with other clans.\u201d</p><p>Caelen bit back a blaspheme of his own. \u201cShow me your larder.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, Rionna turned and walked down the hallway away from the great hall and past the kitchens to a small, airless chamber. He walked in and glanced around, his stomach sinking as he took in the empty shelves.</p><p>If possible, the McDonald clan was in poorer circumstances than his own clan had been before his brother married Mairin.</p><p>\u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cThe clan must eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re used to surviving on little,\u201d Rionna said matter-of-factly. \u201c \u2019Tis our way of life for some years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your father a complete wastrel?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy father was only concerned with his own comfort and filling his own belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a wonder you haven\u2019t been invaded long before now,\u201d Caelen said in disgust. \u201cYou certainly would have been an easy conquest.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s mouth tightened and her eyes narrowed in fury. \u201c \u2019Tis your clan you speak of with such disdain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, \u2019tis not my clan I have such disdain for. \u2019Tis your father. \u2019Tis a sin for a man not to provide for his clan. Do your children go hungry as well? And what of your old and the sick?\u201d</p><p>Rionna gave a weary sigh. \u201c \u2019Tis no use venting your outrage, husband. The man to whom you have need to direct your anger is not here. My clan has suffered long enough. We don\u2019t deserve your censure.\u201d</p><p>Caelen blew out his breath in disgust and turned to stalk from the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d she called after him.</p><p>\u201cHunting,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>\u201cChange the order,\u201d Caelen said to Gannon when he found his commander in the courtyard. \u201cHave Simon and Arlen pick their best hunters and pack the horses.\u201d</p><p>Gannon looked at him curiously but went immediately to do his laird\u2019s bidding.</p><p>A moment later, Gannon returned with a small group of warriors.</p><p>\u201cWe go hunting, McCabe?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>Caelen\u2019s eyes narrowed at the slight. Now wasn\u2019t the time to show any softness with his new clan. If he did, he\u2019d lose any and all credibility. They didn\u2019t have to like him, but they damn well better respect him.</p><p>He drew his sword before the other men could blink and he sliced the blade through the air, a bare inch from the older man\u2019s neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon blinked in surprise but didn\u2019t dare move lest he cut himself.</p><p>\u201cYou will address me as Laird,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cYou may not like the fact that a McCabe has replaced a McDonald, but you\u2019ll show the respect that\u2019s due or you\u2019ll find yourself on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bloody well try,\u201d Simon bit out.</p><p>Caelen had to hand it to the man. He might be older and he might be speaking from a clear disadvantage of having a sword to his throat, but he showed no fear or lack of courage.</p> <p>Caelen slowly lowered the sword and then tossed it in the air toward Gannon. He smiled slow and his lip curled as he stared at Simon. \u201cI\u2019ll do more than try, old man.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Simon charged. A shout went up through the courtyard and the men pressed forward, eager to see the impending clash.</p><p>Simon drove his shoulder into Caelen\u2019s abdomen, knocking him back several feet. But Caelen stood his ground and didn\u2019t go down under the onslaught.</p><p>The McDonald men quickly circled Caelen and Simon and began shouting encouragement to Simon. Shouts of \u201cTake him down\u201d and \u201cShow him what we think of our new laird\u201d filled the air.</p><p>Caelen rotated, wrapping his arms around Simon\u2019s waist. The movement coupled with Simon\u2019s forward momentum unbalanced the man. Caelen picked him up and swung, slamming him into the ground as he came down on top of him.</p> <p>They rolled, snow kicking up amid the flurry of arms and legs. Simon landed a punch to Caelen\u2019s jaw, knocking him back enough that he could scramble from Caelen\u2019s hold.</p><p>The two warriors stood and circled warily, feinting left and right as they waited for the other to make a move.</p><p>Caelen punched, landing a forceful blow to Simon\u2019s chin and knocking him back a few paces. Simon wiped at a trickle of blood at his mouth and then curled his lip into a snarl.</p><p>\u201cNow to see your measure, McCabe.\u201d</p><p>He lunged forward, wrapping his beefy arms around Caelen\u2019s waist and drove them both into the snow. The impact drove the breath from Caelen. He rolled then dodged the fist that flew at his face. He wasn\u2019t quick enough to avoid the full impact, though. He tasted blood on his tongue.</p><p>He drove his knee into Simon\u2019s midsection and then flipped the man over his head to land in the snow several feet away. Caelen was quick to his feet and he stood back as Simon picked himself out of the drift.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your issue?\u201d Caelen barked. \u201cYour laird was a waste of good, clean air. He left your clan in dire circumstances. He acted without honor. He has brought shame to all of you.\u201d</p><p>Simon spat blood onto the snow. \u201cYou are not our choice. Aye, the old man was not a good laird. He didn\u2019t deserve the mantle of leadership. But you haven\u2019t proved yourself worthy of it either. You walk onto our land, shouting orders by writ of the king who hasn\u2019t shown himself to us to make this decree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou treat Rionna without respect,\u201d James called from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d several others chorused.</p><p>Simon nodded. \u201cRionna is a good lass who cares only for her clan. She fights alongside us. She goes without when we go without. She is loyal to her bones,\u201d Simon said. \u201cShe deserves a husband who will see her for the treasure she is.\u201d</p><p>Caelen took advantage of the older man\u2019s momentary distraction and charged. They went down again and Caelen used his momentum to flip Simon over his back.</p><p>The man landed facedown in the snow and Caelen pressed his knee into Simon\u2019s back. He gripped Simon\u2019s hair and pulled until his face was clear of the snow.</p><p>\u201cIs that the way of things in the McDonald clan? You allow your women to do your fighting for you? Rionna is a laird\u2019s daughter. She is now wife to your new laird. Think you she should be gadding about as a man, putting herself at risk? She could be killed or grievously injured. If you want her treated as the treasure you say she is, doesn\u2019t it make more sense for her to remain inside the keep where she can be protected? How can you speak of respect when it\u2019s apparent none of you have any for her and her station?\u201d</p> <p>Caelen dropped his hold and eased back to stand over Simon.</p><p>\u201cWomen are to be protected, taken care of, and provided for. The day I need a woman to do those things for me is the day they\u2019ll put me in the ground and no longer call me a warrior.\u201d</p><p>Simon grimaced as he got to his feet and brushed the snow from his tunic. \u201cAye, you have the right of it. Rionna ... she\u2019s a different lass, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Caelen grunted in satisfaction at the manner of address Simon issued. \u201cAye, I know it. She\u2019s a strange lass to be sure. But \u2019tis not too late to instruct her on the proper ways of a lass. Soon she\u2019ll carry my child and your next laird. Would you have her risking her safety and that of her child by taking up a sword and fighting as a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d</p><p>The murmur went up through the crowd as each man shook his head. Not all were convinced, though. They may agree that Rionna was in need of protecting, but they weren\u2019t accepting of him as laird.</p><p>It would take time. Time that Caelen didn\u2019t have if he was going to transform this meager army into a fighting force as good as the McCabes\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go this day, Laird?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>The fact that Simon addressed Caelen as laird didn\u2019t meet with approval by many. The men scowled and shook their heads before turning away in a show of blatant disrespect.</p><p>\u201cWe go hunting,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cOur larders are empty. Our women and young go hungry while we stand out here acting as children. We have much training to do in the coming weeks. Our men will have need of adequate sustenance in order to keep their strength up. I\u2019m going to work you hard and without mercy. I\u2019ll make warriors of you if it kills me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son James is a good shot with a bow. He\u2019s our best hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll welcome him along. Gather your best. I want you and Arlen and whomever you choose to accompany us. We leave immediately.\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded and started to turn away but then paused. He took a breath as if he debated what he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cSpeak,\u201d Caelen ordered. \u201c \u2019Tis obvious you have something you want to get off your chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to have patience with the lass. Her ways are all she\u2019s ever known. She has a good and fierce heart.\u201d</p><p>Caelen frowned. It irritated him to receive advice at every turn for how to handle his wife. Even his brother had offered his opinion on the matter after marrying another woman. But then Alaric fancied himself an expert on women.</p><p>\u201cWhat the lass needs is a firm hand. She\u2019s been allowed to run wild for far too long.\u201d</p><p>A few snickers went up from the crowd. Even Simon grinned as if they all shared some secret amusement.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wish you luck, Laird. Something tells me you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Rionna stood in the window of the guard tower and stared over the snowy landscape. It had been three days since the hunting party had departed and there was still no sign of their return.</p><p>On the first evening, one of the younger warriors had returned with a fine stag. He bore Caelen\u2019s instructions for the meat to be dressed, stored, and properly cured with a generous portion to be prepared immediately for the women and children to eat.</p><p>The rest of the party was remaining on the hunt until they killed enough game to refill the larders.</p><p>She watched the men below training to Caelen\u2019s specifications. For three days she\u2019d held out against the temptation to join in the exercises. Instead she\u2019d remained indoors and listened to endless instructions about the preservation of meat, how to properly stock a larder, cleaning schedules, not to mention sleep-inducing lectures on proper etiquette for ladies and how to greet and be hospitable to important guests.</p><p>As if they ever had important guests at McDonald keep.</p><p>It was apparent that her husband wasn\u2019t returning this day, and there were several hours of daylight yet. She fairly itched to be down in the courtyard where she could vent her frustration with a good sword fight.</p><p>The problem was Sarah would have no compunction about ratting her out to her husband. Which meant she\u2019d have to sneak to the courtyard after telling Sarah that she was retiring to her chamber.</p><p>She turned, wrapping her cloak tighter around her as she began the descent from the tower. At the bottom, she was met by one of the serving women that Sarah had no doubt set to monitor her whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to retire to my chamber,\u201d Rionna said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you not feeling well, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Rionna smiled at the woman not much older than herself. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Beatrice. I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>Beatrice smiled knowingly. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping well since the laird\u2019s departure. He\u2019ll be home soon, my lady, and with meat to take us through the winter.\u201d</p><p>Rionna smiled faintly as she turned toward the stairs up to the chamber she shared with Caelen. While the men were not as accepting yet of Caelen as their laird, the women of the keep suffered no such hesitancy. Whatever he\u2019d done, he\u2019d inspired confidence in the female members of her clan. They all accepted that he\u2019d see them through their difficulties and restore their larders and their might.</p><p>Rionna supposed that if he did, indeed, accomplish all that, she should be well content with her marriage.</p><p>Should be.</p><p>When she entered the chamber where she\u2019d slept alone three nights past, she marveled at the mark her husband had already left on the room. It wasn\u2019t as though he had a lot of things. Indeed, he\u2019d packed very sparsely for his journey from his former home.</p><p>But whereas the chamber had been barren and nondescript before, it now felt masculine, as if he\u2019d breathed his very essence into the small space.</p><p>The furs he\u2019d brought from McCabe keep covered the bed. Luxurious, thick furs that she\u2019d already grown accustomed to sleeping beneath at night. Even the furs covering the windows had been replaced by his own.</p><p>There was a small table with a chair by the fire that housed his scrolls and quill and ink. They roused her curiosity. She\u2019d love to know what was contained in the scrolls, but she hadn\u2019t the ability to read. The fact that her husband was so learned surprised and intrigued her.</p><p>Caelen had many hidden depths, which she hadn\u2019t even begun to plumb. He\u2019d certainly shut himself off from others, only allowing people to see what he so chose. It was frustrating for her because she desperately wanted to know everything there was to know about the man she\u2019d married.</p><p>She went to the chest that housed the dresses the women had fashioned for her. She stretched her hand behind it, in the small space between it and the wall, and pulled out the tunic and trews she\u2019d hidden there.</p><p>The material slid lovingly over her fingers. Worn but comfortable. Familiar. Anticipation tugged relentlessly at her until she hurriedly stripped the dress from her body and began pulling on the tunic.</p><p>When she was dressed, she pulled her boots from the corner where they\u2019d rested ever since they\u2019re arrived back on McDonald land. First she pulled on her precious stockings and then the boots over them.</p><p>The stockings made the boots a bit snug, but they weren\u2019t uncomfortable. More important, her feet were warm.</p><p>She practically danced to the wall where Caelen had hung her sword. She was grateful he hadn\u2019t had it melted down for armor. \u2019Twas a sin to abuse so fine a weapon.</p><p>She slid her fingers over the hilt and carefully lifted it from its perch. It felt glorious in her hand. The weight. The grooves, fashioned just so for her grasp. Light enough that she could wield it with a deft hand but heavy enough to inflict a mortal wound.</p><p>She tested the sharpness of the blade, satisfied when the hair she brushed across fell neatly into two.</p><p>Now to brave the stairwell and hope she didn\u2019t run into Sarah.</p><p>A few moments later, she burst into the courtyard and hurried through the line of men so she could position herself at the fartherest point away from the entrance to the keep. If Sarah came looking, she wanted to be well out of sight.</p><p>The mixed greeting from the men bewildered her. A few looked genuinely glad to see her and called out a greeting. Others seemed more reserved and exchanged uneasy glances. A few were more bold and stepped in front of her, though their stance wasn\u2019t in the least aggressive.</p><p>No, they looked concerned. And protective.</p><p>Hugh McDonald frowned and then swallowed uncomfortably. \u201cRionna, perhaps \u2019tis better if you remain indoors. \u2019Tis cold today. You shouldn\u2019t be indulging in a man\u2019s training.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s mouth gaped open as she stared back at the burly warrior. Hugh was directly responsible for most of her skill. Aye, he\u2019d taught her almost everything she knew. He\u2019d knocked her on her arse more times than she could count and always taunted her to get up and try again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gotten to you, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHe\u2019s not been here a week and already he\u2019s turned you against me!\u201d</p><p>Hugh put out a placating hand. \u201cNow, Rionna. \u2019Tis not what\u2019s happened at all. The laird has made us see that \u2019tis not the best course for you to be fighting. \u2019Tis not a seemly pursuit for a woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She scowled at him and drew her sword. \u201cHow seemly would it be for a woman to put you on your arse?\u201d</p><p>Hugh put up his hand to the others. \u201cThe man who puts sword to hers will answer to me.\u201d</p><p>Hurt squeezed her chest, turning her insides into a knot. \u201cYou\u2019ll forbid the men to spar with me?\u201d</p><p>Hugh looked as though he\u2019d swallowed a mace. \u201c \u2019Tis sorry I am, lass. Aside from the fact the laird would have my hide, I\u2019d not have you hurt. Or any bairn you might find yourself pregnant with.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes and turned away. Desolation swept through her, leaving her empty and aching. Tears pricked her eyelids and her shoulders slumped in defeat.</p><p>\u201cGive me your sword, lass,\u201d Hugh said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll put it away.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see the rest of the men standing behind Hugh, their faces set in agreement. None would battle her now. Biting back tears, she slowly extended the sword to Hugh. He took it and then handed it back to one of the other men. She didn\u2019t wait to see what they did next. She turned and hurried out the back of the courtyard, never looking back.</p><p>Her chest felt near to bursting.</p><p>The wind blew cold over her damp cheeks. Tears she hadn\u2019t registered froze on her skin. Her sense of loss was keen. It cut deep and festered like a week-old wound.</p> <p>She felt horribly betrayed. Like her life would never again be the same. The people she loved, who loved her, had been swayed by her husband\u2019s firm beliefs about a woman\u2019s place.</p><p>How she longed for the days when she\u2019d run free and her only worry had been avoiding her father. She missed the euphoric rush of victory when she bested one of her father\u2019s men with a sword.</p><p>Out here, with her blade, her faults fell away. She didn\u2019t feel inadequate. She was just another sword in a sea of warriors. Strong and capable. Not just a woman in need of protection.</p><p>She was no good at simpering or playing coy. She didn\u2019t have the social graces necessary not to embarrass herself or her kin. \u2019Twas why her father had never shoved her in front of the noses of anyone of import.</p><p>She trudged down the hill toward the bubbling brook that connected the two lochs on McDonald land. \u2019Twas a pretty sight with ice crusted on the banks, reaching toward the middle where water still rushed over rock. Snow drifted on either side, framing the icy-cold water and blanketing the land in white.</p><p>She stopped at the water\u2019s edge and hugged her arms to her chest. She closed her eyes and breathed deep of the crisp winter air. The faint smell of smoke from the keep\u2019s chimney wafted through her nostrils, and for the first time in a long while, the smell of meat over a spit.</p> <p>For how long she stared over the water she wasn\u2019t sure, but shivering with cold she had the realization that what she hated wasn\u2019t the loss of her freedom. It was the fear of the unknown.</p><p>She was acting like a petulant child whose favorite toy had been taken away. She could be part of the rebuilding of her clan. Perhaps not in the way she had the most knowledge, but everyone else was having to cope with change. She wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>If her husband wanted the perfect lady, a well-kept manor, the epitome of feminine grace, she could give him all of that even if it killed her.</p><p>She\u2019d give him no reason to be shamed by her.</p><p>Her chin notched upward and her gaze settled across the brook. To her shock, men on horses bolted from the trees and charged toward her.</p><p>She turned and let out a yell just as the horses splashed into the water. She ran along the shore, knowing she had no chance trying to run up the hill to the keep. She\u2019d never outrun the horses.</p><p>She opened her mouth to yell another alarm, praying the men would hear from such a distance, but a boot slammed into her back, knocking her to the ground.</p><p>She landed in the snow with such force, it knocked the wind from her chest.</p> <p>Ignoring the pain, she planted her palms down and got her feet under her once more to flee.</p><p>A hand twisted in her hair and her attacker yanked her backward and then flipped her onto her back. She stared up at a group of five men. The taste of fear was vile on her tongue. She faced them down, unwilling to show them just how terrified she was.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The man holding her backhanded her across the face, shocking her into silence. Furious, she attacked, her fingers flying into his eyes. He howled in pain and stumbled back, giving her just a moment to make a break for it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get far before another of the men tackled her, driving her face into the snow. It filled her nose and mouth, numbing the throbbing ache from the vicious slap a moment ago.</p><p>Again she was turned and this time the second attacker clipped her with his fist on the cheek. His hand closed around her neck, squeezing with enough force to prevent her from drawing breath.</p><p>He held her there until she went slack. The other men gathered near and then the first attacker staggered up, blood dripping from one of the scratches she\u2019d inflicted.</p><p>\u201cLittle bitch,\u201d he spat.</p><p>He grabbed the neckline of her tunic and ripped downward until her breasts were bared. Once more she began to struggle but the man holding her neck squeezed again until she was forced to quit.</p><p>She tried to scream but no sound came out. Tears of rage blurred her vision as one of the men fondled her breasts and then tweaked one nipple.</p><p>Just before she blacked out, the hand relaxed at her throat and she sucked in deep breaths. As soon as she had enough air, she opened her mouth to scream just as her face exploded in pain again.</p><p>He administered methodical, forceful slaps to her face, alternating sides until a haze of pain enveloped her. The other hands continued their lewd groping, twisting, and pawing her like an animal.</p><p>Hot tears slipped over her battered cheeks. Never had she felt so helpless in her life. Where was her sword? How was she expected to defend herself?</p><p>She would be raped here on her own land, helpless to do anything but lay there and cry.</p><p>When she was barely conscious, her attacker leaned in close until his hot, fetid breath blew over her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to deliver a message to the new laird,\u201d he hissed. \u201cTell him no McCabe is safe from Duncan Cameron. Not Mairin McCabe or her new daughter. Nor anyone the McCabes call dear. Cameron will destroy all who ally themselves with Ewan McCabe. He won\u2019t rest until Neamh \u00c1lainn is his. You can tell him that your pretty face is a token of Duncan Cameron\u2019s esteem.\u201d</p><p>He climbed over her, kicking snow on her face as he walked back to his horse.</p><p>The sounds of horses crossing the stream filtered through her muddled mind. She tried to raise her head but pain swamped her. Her stomach revolted and nausea boiled up into her throat.</p><p>She closed her eyes and took small, steadying breaths until the nausea abated. Then she slowly rolled to her side and lay there for a long moment collecting her strength.</p><p>When she tried to get to her knees, she pitched forward. Tears of frustration bit angrily at her eyes. By all that was holy, she had to make it back to the keep even if she had to crawl.</p><p>She nearly passed out again when she pushed herself upward. She glanced up the hill and sighed wearily at the seemingly interminable distance.</p><p>And then she began to crawl.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>\u201cMy lady! My lady!\u201d</p><p>It took all Rionna\u2019s effort to raise her head and stare ahead, though she couldn\u2019t make out who was yelling. Her right eye was nearly swollen shut and her vision was blurry out of the other one. Her ears still rung from the blows she\u2019d received.</p><p>\u201cDear God, lass, what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHugh,\u201d she whispered. She made a feeble attempt to hold the tattered tunic to her breasts.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, \u2019tis Hugh. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and tasted blood. \u201cMen.\u201d Her voice was raspy, barely recognizable. Her throat was swollen from the attacker\u2019s grip. \u201cCame across the brook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo arms!\u201d Hugh roared.</p><p>Rionna pitched forward, the last of her strength gone as she listened to Hugh shout orders for the men to get to their horses.</p><p>\u201cRionna!\u201d</p><p>Gentle hands touched her shoulders and carefully turned her. Then shoved the mass of hair from her swollen face.</p><p>\u201cOh, lass,\u201d Sarah moaned. \u201cWhat has happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC-Cold. Help me inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll have one of the men carry you. Does anything feel broken?\u201d</p><p>For some reason Rionna found amusement in that. She grinned crookedly and promptly regretted moving any part of her mouth. \u201cJust my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMangan, come carry your mistress to her chamber,\u201d Sarah ordered.</p><p>Rionna groaned when she was lifted by the burly warrior.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis sorry I am, lass,\u201d Mangan said gruffly. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mangan. Just a little bruised.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis disgraceful for a man to abuse a woman so,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAye, \u2019tis,\u201d she whispered. She shivered, remembering Caelen\u2019s reaction to her father striking her. He would be furious when he learned of the attack.</p><p>Mangan bore her inside and up the stairs, with Sarah and several serving women following along the entire way.</p><p>\u201cPut her on the bed. Careful now!\u201d Sarah said briskly. \u201cNeda, fetch me warm water and rags and have hot water brought up for the lass to have a bath. She\u2019s going to catch a chill. Mangan, bring up wood for the fire. I need a brisk flame to warm her.\u201d</p><p>Rionna sank onto the bed and moaned softly. Now that she was safe and inside the keep, the battle to remain conscious was lost. The room grew dimmer and dimmer, and despite Sarah\u2019s attempt to keep her awake darkness crowded in and she let go with a weak sigh.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a fine shot you made,\u201d Caelen said to James as he stood over the fallen stag. \u201cYour father is right. You\u2019ve a steady aim with a bow.\u201d</p><p>The younger man grinned in acknowledgment. \u201cThat makes two. Three, counting the stag we sent back to the keep. One more and \u2019twill be enough meat for many weeks to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, perhaps on the morrow we\u2019ll down another one. \u2019Tis getting dark. We should seek a place to camp for the night and start a fire.\u201d</p><p>Little more than an hour later, the men sat in front of a warm fire with one leg of the stag roasting over the flames. Simon pulled a piece from the bone with his knife and tossed it toward Caelen.</p><p>Caelen took a bite and nodded in approval. \u201c \u2019Tis a fine piece of venison.\u201d</p><p>Simon carved pieces for the rest of the men until the bone was picked clean. Gannon hunkered down next to Caelen and leaned back against the log.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been on a long hunt. All I\u2019ve done of late is trail after difficult women.\u201d</p><p>Caelen snorted and coughed as a piece of meat got stuck in his throat. Gannon pounded him on the back and both laughed.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth I didn\u2019t envy your duty,\u201d Caelen said ruefully. \u201cI took my turn at trailing after Mairin. \u2019Tis not something I want to do again. I oft wondered what bad thing you\u2019d done to make my brothers choose you to look after their women.\u201d</p><p>Gannon shook his head. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve oft wondered if Cormac got himself married just to avoid the duty.\u201d</p><p>Caelen chuckled. \u201c \u2019Tis possible, I suppose. You have to admit Mairin ran him ragged.\u201d</p><p>Simon took a seat on the other side of Caelen as the rest of the men settled around the fire. \u201cTell me something, Laird. Do we stand a chance against the might of Duncan Cameron\u2019s army? Would we even be in his sights if we hadn\u2019t allied ourselves with your kin?\u201d</p><p>Caelen\u2019s eyes narrowed at the innuendo. \u201cGregor approached us because he feared Cameron. This alliance was at his instigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not intended as an insult, but the fact of the matter is, Gregor commanded a poor army. The benefit we see from this alliance is the joining of McCabe land on either side. McDonald land was all that separated Neamh \u00c1lainn from McCabe keep. But the main benefit is the other lairds who were willing to join with us once Gregor agreed to an alliance. Our strength is in our numbers and the McCabes\u2019 superior fighting force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cocky lot,\u201d Simon said.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a force who can match our skill,\u201d Caelen said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you wait to destroy Cameron?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d one of the other men said as he sat forward. \u201cWhy wait?\u201d</p><p>The other McDonald men who\u2019d accompanied them on the hunt also leaned forward, taking a keen interest in the turn of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cBecause patience is required when vanquishing one\u2019s enemy,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited many years to rid the world of Duncan Cameron. He\u2019s a dangerous, ambitious man who will stop at nothing to control all he sees. He\u2019s set his sights on our land. All of our land. We believe he has struck a bargain with Malcolm. If Malcolm leads another rebellion against David and takes the throne, Scotland will once more be split in two. Cameron\u2019s reward will be the highlands. He will in effect be king without the title while Malcolm will rule over Cumbria. No more will lairds rule over their own lands. Cameron\u2019s power would be absolute. No distinction. No legacy to hold for our children and our children\u2019s children. All would be controlled by him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe cannot allow this,\u201d James muttered.</p><p>\u201cNay, we cannot,\u201d Caelen agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of Gregor? Where has he gone? Where does his loyalty lie?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>Caelen turned his gaze on the older man. \u201cThat I do not know. He disappeared with many McDonald men. He was not content with the king\u2019s decree. We must be wary, not only of Cameron but of Gregor as well. He may well try to take back what he believes is rightfully his.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe should have voted him out long since,\u201d Simon said grimly. \u201c \u2019Tis as much our fault. Aye, he was a poor laird and he did much damage to our clan, but we allowed it and we must answer to God for our sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not too late to right the wrongs of the past,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cOnce we have provided food for our clan, we must turn our focus to strengthening our men. We must send a message to our enemies. We are not an easy conquest.\u201d</p><p>Simon leaned back and stared intently at Caelen. \u201c \u2019Tis the first time you\u2019ve called it your clan, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Caelen\u2019s brows came together. \u201cSo it is. Perhaps \u2019tis settling well with me.\u201d</p><p>The men nodded their satisfaction. There was still wariness in their gazes, but Caelen felt as though he\u2019d scored much needed headway with the men he now commanded. His acceptance wouldn\u2019t be overnight, but at least they weren\u2019t ignoring him outright.</p> <p>Gannon put his hand on Caelen\u2019s arm and put his finger to his lips. The men immediately went quiet. Not waiting to hear for himself what had alarmed his commander, Caelen got to his feet and drew his sword.</p><p>The others followed suit, impressing Caelen with their speed and quiet. Perhaps they could be formed into skilled warriors yet.</p><p>\u201cLaird! Laird! Laird Caelen!\u201d</p><p>Hugh McDonald rode into the encampment, four men right behind him. \u2019Twas evident the horse had been ridden hard and without rest. Hugh slid from the saddle and staggered in Caelen\u2019s direction.</p><p>Caelen resheathed his sword and grabbed the much larger man by his tunic. \u201cWhat is it, Hugh? What has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis your wife, Laird.\u201d</p> <p>Caelen\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cWhat mean you?\u201d</p><p>Hugh caught his breath. \u201cShe was set upon by intruders two days past. They came across the brook between the two lochs. From the forest. They were hiding in the trees.\u201d</p><p>Caelen got into Hugh\u2019s face, his pulse pounding harshly at his temples. \u201cIs she all right? Was she hurt? What did they do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was badly beaten, Laird. I know nothing more. I saw her when she crawled back to the courtyard, but I left soon after to pursue her attackers. When I lost their trail, I came directly to find you.\u201d</p><p>Caelen thrust him away, his hands shaking as he attempted to collect his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cShe is alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird. She was alive when I left. I do not think the injuries were serious enough to cause her death.\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned to Gannon. \u201cYou ride with me.\u201d Then he gestured at Simon. \u201cYou and the others pack the meat and return to the keep at once.\u201d</p> <p>Gannon strode swiftly to ready the horses and Caelen turned back to Hugh. \u201cWho were they?\u201d he asked in a deadly voice.</p><p>\u201cI know not that either, Laird. The lass barely spoke a word. I did not wait for her to relate the tale before I left in pursuit of the ones who launched the attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did right, Hugh.\u201d</p><p>Simon pushed forward, his expression serious. \u201cLaird, I would ride back with you and Gannon. \u2019Tis not safe for two men alone.\u201d</p><p>Caelen raised one eyebrow. \u201cYou seek to protect me?\u201d</p><p>Simon paused a moment before he finally answered. \u201cYou\u2019re my laird. My duty is to watch your back at all times. I cannot do that if I am left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Simon. I\u2019ll be glad of your escort. Let us make haste so that I may see to my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>The sun hadn\u2019t yet risen when Caelen, Gannon, and Simon rode into the courtyard. Caelen was off his horse before it had fully stopped. Sarah met him at the bottom of the steps leading into the keep.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Sarah wrung her hands, her face creased with worry. \u201cThank God you\u2019ve come home, Laird. I don\u2019t know what to do with her. She\u2019s not left her chamber since the attack. She\u2019s not herself. She won\u2019t eat. She just sits and stares out her window.\u201d</p><p>Caelen grasped Sarah\u2019s arms, shaking her from her hysteria. \u201cIs she well? How badly is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in Sarah\u2019s eyes. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I don\u2019t know what all was done to her. Once she regained consciousness she was so quiet. She refuses any company. She won\u2019t confide in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to her,\u201d Caelen said as he brushed past Sarah.</p><p>Dread gripped him as he hurried up the stairs. He realized when he reached the door to his chamber that he was afraid. It was an odd sensation and even odder to admit such. He\u2019d watched his brothers go through hell with the women they loved, but he hadn\u2019t imagined he could feel that same fear that had gripped his brothers.</p><p>He shook his head. He\u2019d feel concern for any woman who\u2019d been abused. And outrage that another man had dared to touch what was his.</p><p>He stood in the hallway, his hand raised to knock when he realized what he was doing. He dropped his hand and then opened the door.</p><p>He\u2019d expected to find her asleep but when his gaze fell over the bed, it was empty. It didn\u2019t look as though she\u2019d slept in it recently. He turned his head, scanning the room to find her sitting by the fire, her head cocked to the side.</p><p>His breath caught at the bruises shadowing her face. He could see only her profile, but her eye was swollen and even from across the room he could see fingerprints around her neck.</p><p>Carefully he shut the door, not wanting to awaken her. Then he crossed the room so that he could look more closely at her.</p><p>Sweet Jesu, but someone had sorely beat the lass. His hands tightened in rage as he stood over her. She looked so fragile. So delicate. How had she ever survived such brutality? Worse, just how much had been done to her?</p><p>His stomach heaved as he imagined just what could have occurred. Sarah had said she had closed herself off in her chamber ever since the attack and would confide in no one. Had she been violated?</p><p>His hand trembled as he reached out to caress her cheek. Dear God, he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of someone touching her. Of hurting her. He had to sit down on the stone hearth before his legs gave way.</p><p>She stirred when his hand left her face. Her eyelids blinked and then she squinted as if opening her right eye had caused her pain.</p><p>\u201cCaelen,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, \u2019tis me. Are you well? Do you hurt still?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and then raised a hand to massage her throat. The delicate movement only brought more attention to her fragility, and fury sizzled through him like a whip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sore, but I am well. \u2019Tis nothing serious. Was your hunt successful?\u201d</p><p>The formality of their conversation baffled Caelen. \u2019Twas as if nothing amiss had occurred during his absence and he\u2019d come home to a polite greeting from his wife.</p><p>The shadows around her eyes troubled him, for they went deeper than the bruises. The fragility that he\u2019d already noted was more pronounced the longer she was awake. There was something off about her, and now he realized why Sarah was so concerned.</p><p>\u201cRionna,\u201d he began gently. \u201cCan you tell me what happened to you? \u2019Tis important I know all. Take your time. \u2019Tis no hurry for \u2019tis just you and I alone in our chamber. There is naught you can\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered dispassionately as her gaze rested on him. He wanted to touch her but, God\u2019s teeth, he didn\u2019t know where he could lay hand on her that wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI was standing at the brook. When I looked up, I saw men on horses across the water. I knew I would never be able to run up the hill before they caught me so I ran along the bank, but they quickly caught up to me.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand over the top of hers where it rested on her lap. He eased his fingers underneath hers and rubbed his thumb along her knuckles. Her hand was tiny in his, and he was reminded of how small and slight she was.</p><p>\u201cOne knocked me to the ground and backhanded me. I put my fingers in his eyes and scratched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Caelen said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI escaped a moment but was caught by another man.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, her voice wavered, fringed with emotion as she broke off and fixed her stare into the fire.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twas naught I could do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe hit me. He tore my clothing. He ... touched me,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>Caelen went completely still. He tried to swallow but couldn\u2019t manage it. \u201cDid he rape you?\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze back on him, her eyes wide and startled. \u201cNay. He groped my breasts. He bruised me and humiliated me. He gave me a message for you.\u201d</p><p>Relief that she hadn\u2019t been molested was tempered by the fact that she\u2019d still been sorely abused. And now it appeared as though it had all happened because someone wanted to hurt what was his.</p><p>\u201cTell me his message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that no McCabe is safe from Duncan Cameron. Not Mairin. Not Isabel. Not anyone who a McCabe calls dear. He said to tell you that my face is a token of Cameron\u2019s esteem.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together so hard that he feared breaking them. His jaw ached as he tried valiantly to keep his rage at bay. His wife needed gentleness and understanding from him. Not a warrior bent on killing everyone in his path.</p><p>\u201cWhat then, Rionna?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>Her eyes found his again, so dark and troubled. There was shame and pain in the golden depths. She looked ... beaten. Not just in body, but in spirit. It was like a dagger to his gut.</p><p>\u201cThey left and I crawled up the hill to the courtyard. I don\u2019t remember much else.\u201d</p><p>His chest hurt. His stomach heaved. The idea that his proud, spirited wife was beaten so badly that she had to crawl on the ground like an animal. Crawl.</p><p>It was too much for him to bear.</p><p>He stood abruptly and turned away so she wouldn\u2019t see the ugly rage on his face. It took him a moment before he could breathe normally again. Then he turned back to see Rionna staring into the fire, so still and rigid.</p><p>He went back and knelt beside her, touching her chin until she turned to look at him. \u201cHave you slept?\u201d</p><p>She was confused by his question. Her eyes became cloudy. The fact that she couldn\u2019t answer told him that she likely hadn\u2019t slept at all beyond brief moments by the fire.</p><p>Not waiting longer for her to respond, he carefully looped his arms underneath her body and lifted her as gently as he was able. He held her close to his chest and rested his lips atop her head as he carried her to the bed.</p><p>He settled her onto the mattress and pulled the furs over her body so that she\u2019d be warm. \u201cI want you to rest. You have need of your sleep, Rionna. I\u2019m here now. Nothing will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She dutifully closed her eyes, but she was still tense. He leaned down and brushed his lips across her brow. \u201cSleep now, lass. I\u2019ll be here when you awaken.\u201d</p><p>At his words, she relaxed a bit and seemed to sink deeper into the bed. Some of the strain around her eyes and mouth eased and she let out a tiny sigh.</p><p>He stroked a hand over her hair until she seemed at ease and then he rose and backed from the bed. Her eyes opened and she locked her gaze with his.</p><p>\u201cBe at ease, Rionna. I won\u2019t leave. I have need to speak with my men and to see to your care. Sarah says you\u2019ve refused food.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond but the look in her eyes suggested she still had no desire to eat.</p><p>\u201cYou have to keep your strength up. I\u2019m going to bring up some broth, something that won\u2019t hurt your mouth or jaw to chew. You\u2019ll eat it.\u201d</p><p>He expected sparks in her eyes at his command. He\u2019d never issued one yet that hadn\u2019t elicited a scowl or outright defiance on her part. But her eyes remained dull, and she turned into her pillow, closing her eyes. He\u2019d all but been dismissed.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, he turned to the door to find Gannon standing against the wall just outside. Gannon straightened when Caelen softly closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Gannon asked.</p><p>\u201cThey beat the hell out of her,\u201d Caelen bit out.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron\u2019s men. They gave her a message to give to me. The sons of bitches brutalized her. There isn\u2019t a part of her face or neck that isn\u2019t bruised.\u201d</p><p>Anger glittered in Gannon\u2019s eyes. \u201cCameron has no compunction about waging war against women. But why now? Why Rionna? What is the point? Why not just attack? They obviously knew you\u2019d gone out on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to draw me out,\u201d Caelen said grimly. \u201cHe wants to make me angry enough that I do something foolish like charge after him in the dead of winter with inferior warriors, where if we survive the cold and starvation, we\u2019d be easily defeated once we confront him at his holding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe must think you a fool,\u201d Gannon said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cIt matters naught what he thinks. What matters is what he will know when my sword slides through his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you may have to fight your brothers for that honor. He has brought much harm to Mairin and Keeley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rionna,\u201d Caelen said. \u201cHe thinks to weaken us through our women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Tis not much mark of a man when he wages war against those weaker than himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to send word to Ewan and tell him what has happened. Tell him there are new threats against his wife and daughter and that Cameron has escalated his attacks. Then I want you to put men on an around-the-clock watch. I want someone watching all approaches to the keep at all times. I want you working with the men immediately. They\u2019re going to train and train hard. They should have plenty of motivation now if they had none before.\u201d</p><p>Gannon nodded and started down the hall.</p><p>\u201cTell Sarah to bring up water and broth for Rionna,\u201d he called after Gannon.</p><p>Gannon held up a hand in acknowledgment before disappearing down the stairs.</p> <p>Caelen quietly reentered the chamber to check on Rionna. She hadn\u2019t moved from where he\u2019d put her on the bed. The furs were pulled over her shoulders and her eyes were closed.</p><p>Wanting to see if she was truly sleeping, he leaned close and listened to her soft, even breathing. When she didn\u2019t stir, he drew away and went to add more wood to the fire so she\u2019d be warm.</p><p>When the flames were blazing once more, he sank into the chair and bowed his head. He\u2019d been so cavalier in leaving for the hunt. Food had seemed like the most important priority. He\u2019d thought to feed his clan and then see to its protection. His first action and decision as laird and he\u2019d made a huge mistake. A mistake his wife had paid dearly for.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Rionna pressed gingerly at her still swollen eye, wincing when she touched a particularly sore spot. Caelen was below in the courtyard directing the training of the men. He\u2019d left her after making sure she ate a good meal and instructing her to rest.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth, she\u2019d had more rest over the last week than she could bear. She\u2019d wallowed. She\u2019d sulked. She\u2019d dealt with her fear and her sense of failure. Now ... Now she was just furious.</p> <p>Furious with the men who\u2019d trespassed on her lands. Furious with the cowardice of Duncan Cameron. Furious that she\u2019d been rendered helpless against a vicious attack.</p><p>No longer could she accept her husband\u2019s decree that she become a meek, feminine version of whatever fantasy he\u2019d built in his mind of the perfect wife. That wasn\u2019t who she was. He should have given more thought to stepping in to marry her if he wasn\u2019t prepared to accept a wife he considered wholly unsuitable.</p><p>She dressed in trews and a tunic she saved for what she viewed as special occasions. It was soft. No holes, no stains, and the hem was finely stitched.</p><p>It was overlayed in red velvet with gold stitching. It had taken every coin she\u2019d saved for three years, but it was the finest thing she\u2019d ever owned.</p><p>She wiped at the dirt on her boots and rubbed a finger over the toe where the leather was so thin that a hole had nearly been worn. She had need of a new pair, but it was a luxury she couldn\u2019t contemplate, not when everyone else in her clan had shoes and boots just as worn, if not worse.</p><p>Still, she could dream of how a new pair would feel on her feet. Fur lined. She could practically feel the softness surrounding her toes.</p><p>She stood and her hand went automatically to her throat where she tested the soreness. It still hurt to swallow and her voice had a soft rasp that hadn\u2019t yet gone away. She probably looked a fright, but after so many days, she was ready to be out of her chamber.</p><p>She took to the stairs, feeling a moment\u2019s panic that she\u2019d left the safety of her chamber. She stopped midway down, black dots swimming in front of her eyes as she panted for breath.</p> <p>Such weakness infuriated her. She clenched her fist, slammed her eyes shut, her nostrils flaring as she sucked in deep breaths.</p><p>For too long she\u2019d hidden in her chamber because the idea of going out terrified her. It was a weakness she\u2019d never admit. The attack and the days following were a humiliation she\u2019d live with for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, you shouldn\u2019t be out of your chamber. Do you need my aid returning? Is there something you have need of? I would be happy to fetch it for you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to see Caelen\u2019s commander standing on the stairwell, blocking her path down. His hand gripped her arm and concern burned bright in his gaze.</p><p>She brushed off his hand with a push of her own and nearly took a step back from the warrior before she caught herself. She forced her chin up and then leveled a calm stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI am well and nay, I do not require anything. I\u2019m on my way below stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps \u2019tis best to wait the laird. I\u2019ll summon him and tell him you\u2019d like to leave your chamber.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAm I a prisoner in my own home? Am I not allowed out of my room without the laird\u2019s permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mistake me, my lady. \u2019Tis my concern for your well-being that drives my statement. I\u2019m sure the laird would want to escort you himself once he\u2019s ascertained whether you\u2019re well enough to be below stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ascertain for myself that I am well enough to be up and out of my chamber. Kindly remove yourself from my path so that I may continue downward.\u201d</p><p>Gannon didn\u2019t look happy with the dictate. He wavered a moment, clearly trying to decide whether he should cleave to his initial idea.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t wait. Knowing he would do nothing to harm her, she pushed at his chest until he relented and stepped aside. He didn\u2019t allow her to pass, though. He cupped her elbow and took her hand in his, tucking it around his arm.</p><p>\u201cAt least allow me to escort you. I would not want you to fall on the stairs.\u201d</p><p>She nearly yanked her hand from his, so great was her frustration. But she was getting what she wanted and she didn\u2019t want to risk him forcing her back to her chamber and summoning Caelen, who\u2019d likely burst a blood vessel over her apparel and the fact that she was out of bed.</p><p>When they reached the bottom, she retrieved her hand and hurried away from the warrior. She had no clear direction in mind, only that she wanted to be away from Gannon.</p><p>Fresh air was top on her list of priorities, but she couldn\u2019t go into the courtyard. Caelen was there training with the men. She opted to go through the kitchens and out the side where the distance between the keep and the stone skirt was greater and she could see the mountains in the distance.</p><p>Ignoring several of the women\u2019s surprised exclamations on her way out, Rionna breathed deep as soon as the crisp air hit her in the face.</p><p>It was heavenly. Freeing. Her throat and lungs seemed to open up and loose the horrid constriction she\u2019d lived with for so many days.</p><p>She stepped into the snow, enjoying the loud crunch and the coldness seeping around her toes. Finally, she felt alive again. Reinvigorated.</p><p>The wind whipped at her hair and sent a shiver down her spine. She\u2019d completely forgotten her cloak, so in a hurry had she been to get out of her chamber.</p><p>Clutching her arms around her waist for warmth, she walked along the wall of the keep, leaving small footprints in the fresh powder.</p><p>As a child, she had lain in the snow and made shapes with Keeley. They\u2019d pretended to be snow princesses waiting for their prince to rescue them. He wore only the warmest furs and the finest clothing. His steed was unmatched in beauty and speed. He\u2019d ride in, wrap her in his furs, and bear her away to a land where it was always warm and sunny.</p><p>Rionna laughed softly. Such imaginations she and Keeley had. Always with their heads in the clouds. The worst day in Rionna\u2019s life had been the day her father had attacked Keeley. And then Rionna\u2019s mother had cried Keeley a whore and banished her from the clan.</p><p>Keeley had been her only friend. The only other girl who\u2019d understood Rionna\u2019s odd tendencies. Keeley had encouraged Rionna\u2019s practice with a bow. She\u2019d applauded every time Rionna had struck the center of the target. She\u2019d exclaimed over Rionna\u2019s skill with a knife, swearing that Rionna could hold off an entire army just by wielding a dagger.</p><p>Rionna had tried to teach Keeley those skills, warning that lasses needed to know how to protect themselves. But Keeley had laughed and said she was hopeless in such matters and that she would one day have her prince to protect her anyway.</p><p>Well, Keeley had gotten the prince, and Rionna had gotten the skills to protect herself. She wasn\u2019t sure who had come out ahead in the bargain.</p><p>She found a large bolder and eased down onto the cold surface. Her arse would freeze if she stayed long, but she wasn\u2019t quite ready for the confrontation that must be forced with her husband.</p><p>Caelen walked through the kitchens, his expression grim. Rionna shouldn\u2019t be below stairs yet. Hell, she shouldn\u2019t even be out of bed. He intended to keep her there at least another fortnight.</p><p>But what worried him more than her being out of bed was her state of mind. The attack had deeply affected her. She\u2019d been quiet, reserved, timid even. And Rionna was not a timid lass. He feared that the attack had irrevocably changed her or damaged her in some way. And he was helpless to change it.</p><p>He stopped at the doorway leading outside, after the women in the kitchens reported that she\u2019d not paused on her way out. As he stepped into the snow, he looked up to see her sitting in the distance, her back to him as she stared up at the mountains.</p><p>The knot he suffered so frequently since his return from the hunt clutched his throat as he watched her hair blow this way and that in the breeze.</p><p>She seemed so slight. Fragile. It was a word he kept coming back to over and over, but it aptly described her appearance.</p><p>She looked alone and vulnerable, as if she had no one in the world to protect her. No one had protected her when she\u2019d needed it the most. It was something he\u2019d have to live with for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cLaird, do not be angry. What she wears is a comfort to her. She needs that right now.\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned in surprise at Sarah\u2019s words. The woman stood behind him, watching Rionna with worried eyes.</p><p>\u201cThink you I give a damn what she wears? I\u2019m more concerned with her well-being.\u201d</p><p>Sarah nodded approvingly and Caelen gestured her away.</p><p>He stepped softly through the snow, not wanting to frighten or disturb Rionna. He thought she resembled a doe, poised to run at the slightest sound or provocation. But as he drew closer, he could see the vacant, distant look in her eyes as she stared away from the keep.</p><p>Had the attack damaged her permanently? Would she never be right again? It was early to worry over such possibilities, but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder at how deep the scars would run.</p><p>\u201cRionna,\u201d he called softly.</p><p>He heard her quick intake of breath as if he had indeed startled her. She whirled around, her eyes a little wild until her gaze settled on him and then she quieted.</p><p>She went so still and continued to stare at him in a way that unsettled him. It was eerie. She studied him as if she were about to announce judgment on him and find him lacking. Perhaps \u2019twas his own guilt speaking volumes, but he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was angry. Very, very angry.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis cold. You should be indoors where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>He slid a hand over her shoulder and squeezed, trying to bring her comfort.</p><p>To his surprise she laughed. \u2019Twas not a joyous sound that bubbled from her throat. It was harsh and hoarse. It sounded pained.</p><p>\u201cYou probably think I\u2019m daft,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he said gently. \u201cNot daft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also probably think I\u2019m a scared rabbit now, afraid to leave my chamber, afraid to venture outside for fear of being attacked again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, lass. I think what you need is time to heal. Your courage will come.\u201d</p><p>She turned then and pinned those glowing eyes upon him until he felt unsettled by the directness of her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, Laird. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m furious.\u201d</p><p>Anger was an appropriate response under the circumstances, and she did look furious. Sparks fair shot from her eyes and her entire body trembled. For the first time he relaxed, relief sudden and fierce. He knew how to respond to an angry Rionna. But the beaten, worn-down, fragile woman who\u2019d occupied her body for the last week baffled and confused him.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis good you\u2019re angry,\u201d he offered sagely.</p><p>She shot to her feet and spun around, glaring at him. Her fists were formed into tight balls at her sides, and she looked like she wanted to take a swing at him.</p><p>\u201cEven if \u2019tis you I\u2019m furious with?\u201d</p><p>Now that he wasn\u2019t prepared for. He frowned, knowing that he had to tread lightly here. The lass wasn\u2019t right yet. Her emotions were all over the place, and he didn\u2019t want to upset her further.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis sorry I am that I wasn\u2019t here to protect you, Rionna. \u2019Tis something I\u2019ll regret my life through. I should have better seen to your protection. \u2019Tis not a mistake I\u2019ll make again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A garbled sound of rage roared from her throat. She looked as though she wanted to clench her fingers around her hair and pull.</p><p>\u201cNay, you shouldn\u2019t have protected me better, husband. What you should have done was allowed me to protect myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense, lass. Calm down. Let\u2019s go inside. You should be above stairs in your chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what had just happened before those men attacked me?\u201d she asked, ignoring his suggestion to return indoors. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened. My sword had just been taken by Hugh because he said he didn\u2019t want me to be harmed and \u2019twas not a womanly thing to be wielding a sword. He warned the other men that any who engaged me in swordplay would answer to him.\u201d</p><p>She advanced on Caelen and poked a finger into his chest. \u201cIf I had my sword, those men would have never gotten close to me. They wouldn\u2019t have shoved me to the snow. They wouldn\u2019t have touched me. They wouldn\u2019t have hit me.\u201d</p><p>Ah, but the lass had worked herself into a fit of rage that was impressive to behold. It shamed him that he fair quivered with lust as she bore down on him aggressively as a warrior about to deliver a death blow.</p><p>\u2019Twas all he could do not to bear her into the snow and divest her of her tunic and those hated trews.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted a meek lady of the manor with all the social niceties and the proper grooming and breeding to be a perfect hostess and compliment to you, then you should have thought before you stepped forward to marry in your brother\u2019s stead. He knew what he was getting.\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips and stepped forward again until her chest was pressed against his midsection.</p><p>\u201cI am none of those things. I have no desire to be those things. I had set my mind to relent and to apply myself to be the perfect wife, and then the men came across the brook and overpowered me as easily as they would a child. What good am I to you or to my clan if I cannot even defend myself? How am I supposed to protect my kin? The children? The other women of the keep? Will I stand over the graves of others and murmur that I was a good wife and a gracious lady? Will that be of comfort to their families? Will they forgive that I stood by and allowed their loved one to die because my husband wanted a wife who could smile prettily and curtsy without getting her feet tangled?\u201d</p><p>Caelen battled the smile that threatened. He bit at his bottom lip and valiantly tried to keep his amusement at bay, for if he laughed now, she might well spit him on her dagger.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth he should be angry at her blatant show of disrespect. He should even now be reprimanding her. But \u2019twas the first sign of life he\u2019d seen in the week since her attack, and God\u2019s truth, she was glorious in her rage.</p><p>\u201cThink you this is funny?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She shoved at him with all her might, surprising him with her sudden move. He went down in the snow, landing with a thud. He glared up at her as he dusted the snow from the tops of his legs.</p><p>She stood over him now, holding him captive with her fiery gaze. Then her expression became pained, and the shadows returned to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet me be who I am, Caelen. I would not ask you to change who you are. I can help you if you\u2019d let me. Don\u2019t relegate me to the shadows, pulling me out only when \u2019tis convenient for you. Maybe \u2019tis the way of things in the world, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way for us.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sighed as her impassioned plea made a direct hit to a region of his heart he\u2019d long thought dead. \u201c \u2019Tis so important to you to dress as a man and wield a sword?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and shook her head. \u201c \u2019Tis not the manner of dress that \u2019tis important. If you can show me how to successfully wield a sword in a woman\u2019s gown, I\u2019ll not gainsay you if you tell me not to wear this manner of dress again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go about swinging a sword in a gown,\u201d Caelen muttered. \u201cYou\u2019d trip over the hem.\u201d</p><p>For the first time she smiled, her eyes lighting up with more life than he\u2019d seen in quite some time. \u201cThen I have your permission to wear these garments?\u201d</p><p>He sighed in disgust. \u201cWhen have you ever sought my permission for anything, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be accommodating,\u201d she defended.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cWhen it suits your purposes, aye.\u201d Then he narrowed his gaze to stare intently at her. \u201cThere are conditions, Rionna. Henceforth, my commander will accompany you everywhere. And I mean everywhere. You\u2019ll go nowhere unescorted. I\u2019ll not have happen again what happened in my absence. If I have need of Gannon to accompany me, then Hugh will take over as your escort.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded her acceptance.</p><p>\u201cSecond, you\u2019ll train with me and only with me. You are to spar with no other man. If you want to learn, you\u2019ll be trained by the best, and I won\u2019t be easy on you because you\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>She grinned cheekily. \u201cI would expect no less, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not take to binding your breasts.\u201d</p><p>At that she raised an eyebrow and looked suspiciously at him.</p><p>He grinned lazily up at her. \u201c \u2019Tis not just for my pleasure. \u2019Tis nonsense. I may let you dress as a man, but you\u2019ll not try to look like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else, husband?\u201d she asked as she tapped her foot in the snow.</p><p>\u201cAye, help me up.\u201d</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she reached down to give him her hand. The lass would never learn. He grasped her wrist and with a quick yank, tossed her into the snow beside him.</p><p>She rose up, snow covering her face, blinking at him as if she had no idea why he\u2019d done such. He merely smiled back. \u201cRevenge, lass. Revenge.\u201d</p><p>With a disgusted look she launched herself at him, rolling them both into the snow. He gave a laugh and then came astride her. With a free hand, he balled some of the snow and held it menacingly over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d she said.</p><p>He let fly and laughed again as she blinked away the snow from her face. It slid over her cheeks, revealing her look of shock. Then her eyes flashed with the light of battle.</p><p>Worried that her mistress and the laird had been out in the cold for so long, Sarah hurried to the doorway. When she opened the door, she was shocked to see the laird atop Rionna in the snow.</p><p>How could he have so little care when she was so fragile from her attack? The man had gone mad. It was on the tip of her tongue to issue a sharp reprimand to her laird when she heard Rionna\u2019s laughter ring out through the cold air.</p><p>Rionna rolled atop the laird and began stuffing snow in his face. The laird fought back and snow flew fast and furious.</p><p>A wide smile formed on Sarah\u2019s face and she quietly retreated back indoors, closing the door behind her to give them privacy.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>For the first time since the attack, Rionna came down to the hall for the evening meal. She could feel the stares of the men and women alike and it was all she could do not to cover the bruises and hie herself back up to her chamber.</p><p>But she\u2019d spent enough time hiding. She wouldn\u2019t do so any longer.</p><p>Caelen looked up in surprise and then stood as she neared the table. The other warriors did the same and then Caelen motioned for Simon to vacate the seat so that Rionna could sit next to Caelen.</p><p>\u201cI would have made sure you had your meal in our chamber,\u201d Caelen said in a low voice when he retook his seat.</p><p>She smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis sweet of you to attend me so, but \u2019tis time I came out of hiding. The bruises make me look hideous, but \u2019tis nothing wrong with the rest of me.\u201d</p><p>He tipped her chin upward and turned her face this way and that in the light, a pensive expression on his face. He didn\u2019t offer false compliments or tell her she really didn\u2019t look hideous. Strangely she found that comforting.</p><p>\u201cThe bruising is fading. In a few days\u2019 time, \u2019twill be completely gone.\u201d</p><p>His fingers rubbed over the faint fingerprints at her neck, and his nostrils flared before he pulled his hand away and resumed eating his meal.</p><p>At the meal\u2019s end, Rionna stood to excuse herself. The meal had been quiet, as if the men feared upsetting her in some way. It would take time to convince them she wasn\u2019t going to fall apart at the least provocation. \u2019Twas her fault they\u2019d gained that impression with the way she\u2019d acted, but how could she explain in words how helpless and angry she\u2019d felt at the hands of her attackers?</p><p>\u2019Twas not something the men would understand. She much preferred to move ahead and not dwell on past events. In time they\u2019d forget as well.</p><p>Caelen stayed her with his hand and then nodded toward Gannon. \u201cI\u2019ll go up with you,\u201d he said to Rionna, surprising her.</p><p>Caelen made a point of relaxing with the men after the evening meal. \u2019Twas his way of building camaraderie after a long day\u2019s training. He listened to their ideas, indulged in ribald jests, most of which made Rionna\u2019s eyes roll, and talked about the day\u2019s events. He and Gannon both made attempts to reach out to the McDonald warriors, a fact Rionna appreciated even if the men still hadn\u2019t fully accepted or embraced Caelen as laird.</p><p>But tonight he excused himself, his fingers still wrapped gently around Rionna\u2019s wrist. Then he guided her toward the stairs and they went up to their chamber.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twasn\u2019t necessary for you to come up with me,\u201d Rionna said when he shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know it. \u2019Twas my choice. Perhaps I preferred to converse with my wife instead of the men tonight.\u201d</p><p>She turned and rested her gaze on his face, searching his eyes for some sign of his intent. \u201cHave you something specific in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Make ready for bed, wife. You look tired. I\u2019ll add more wood to the fire, and we\u2019ll retire early this night.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled by his odd mood, she did as he bade and began to undress. She reached for her nightdress when he made a sound of disapproval. She looked up to see him bending over the hearth, wood in hand and shaking his head at her.</p><p>\u201cNay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would feel your skin next to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u2019Twas not an unreasonable request, but tonight it made her feel shy and a little uncertain, and it angered her that she would feel this way.</p><p>As if sensing her uncertainty, Caelen rose from the hearth and crossed the room. Gently he took the nightdress from her grasp and laid it over the chair by the fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not make any demands of you, Rionna. I would do nothing to frighten you. But I\u2019ve missed the feel of you next to me and your warmth and scent on my skin. I would have that tonight if it causes you no upset.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his chest and stared up at him, her heart going soft at the tenderness in his voice. \u201cYou do not frighten me, Caelen. \u2019Tis the truth I feel safest when I\u2019m near to you.\u201d</p><p>He laid his hand over hers and then pulled it to his mouth. He kissed the inside of her palm and left it against his lips for a moment before lowering it once more.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed. \u2019Tis cold tonight and the wind howls through the furs at the window.\u201d</p><p>Rionna climbed underneath the furs and watched as Caelen disrobed in the glow of the fire. When he turned to the bed, she pulled back the furs, an invitation.</p><p>As soon as he got into bed, she snuggled close, sighing as his warmth enveloped her.</p><p>Caelen chuckled against her hair. \u201cYou sound near to purring, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. You feel good, husband.\u201d</p><p>He laid the flat of his palm over her back and stroked up and down, his even breathing sounding close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking on things,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned against his neck. A conversation never ended well that started with such words. She pulled away and his hand stilled on the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat matters have you been thinking on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why you dress as you do and why you\u2019ve put so much practice in with a sword.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Of all the subjects she thought he might broach, this wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis plain to see you\u2019ve devoted a lot of time to the practice of warfare. You have to admit \u2019tis an odd undertaking for a lass. Your father wasn\u2019t approving. I saw his reaction when you bested the McCabe warrior when you were visiting McCabe keep.\u201d</p><p>When she remained quiet, he stroked over her back again, his touch light and soothing.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, when you were attacked and sorely beaten, a traumatic event for anyone, much less a lass as slight as you are, I thought it had made you afraid, but you were angry because you\u2019d been stripped of the ability to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt made me feel helpless. I hated it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has made you so fierce in your determination to protect yourself, Rionna? \u2019Tis not something a lass usually thinks upon. \u2019Tis up to her kin, her father, brother, or husband to watch over her and protect her from harm, and yet you ask no one to do these things for you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as shame crowded in. Caelen knew of her father\u2019s disgraceful actions, but saying her fears aloud only made it worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRionna?\u201d</p><p>He pulled away and tipped her chin up so that he could look into her eyes. The candles he\u2019d left burning provided just enough light that she could see his grim expression and the determination in his eyes to uncover her secrets.</p><p>She sighed and looked away. \u201cYou know what kind of man my father was. And that when my father tried to force himself on Keeley, my mother made her an outcast. She was my cousin. And Keeley wasn\u2019t the only young lass my father targeted. I knew of his evil from a very young age and I always feared ...\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath and looked back at Caelen. \u201cAll I could think was what if he turned his attention to me? If he could do such a thing to his niece, what would it matter if I was his daughter?</p> <p>\u201cI grew breasts at a young age. I had a pleasing shape that I knew men liked to look at. So I began to hide my attributes and make myself look more like a lad than a woman. And I learned to wield a sword because I swore if my father ever tried to force himself on me, I would be able to protect myself.\u201d</p><p>Anger and disgust simmered in Caelen\u2019s eyes. He touched her cheek, stroking his finger from her jawline to her temple and back down again.</p><p>\u201cYou were right to do so,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHis obsession with Keeley never ended. Even years later. He would have raped her just weeks past if I hadn\u2019t intervened when he dragged her into a chamber at McCabe keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis desires are unnatural, and he cares not who he hurts. He thinks only of himself and his pleasure. I would kill him for what he did to Keeley alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he ever touches you again, whether in anger or with lust, I\u2019ll feed his carcass to the vultures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Tis when you\u2019re not near that I worry,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know it, lass, and as much as it pains me to admit, you have a solid argument for why I should allow you to continue with your training. \u2019Tis the truth I gifted Mairin with a dagger so she would have means to protect herself. It only stands to reason I\u2019d afford my wife the same opportunity and the skills to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt means much that you support me in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019ll not be easy on you just because you\u2019re a lass. If you are to protect yourself, then you\u2019ll have to learn to best a man twice your size and with twice your strength.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but he continued on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a brutal taskmaster and I\u2019ll work you long and hard until you\u2019re ready to cry mercy. I\u2019ll expect the same from you that I expect from my men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, I understand,\u201d she said. \u201cNow hush and let me thank you properly, husband.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow went up. \u201cDefine properly.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and wrapped her arms around his strong body. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll issue any complaints.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cGet up and try it again, Rionna.\u201d</p><p>Rionna staggered to her feet and rubbed her poor abused bottom. Her arm felt near to falling off. She\u2019d long since lost feeling in her hand. She was so weary that her eyes crossed, and still, her husband pressed on.</p><p>There was no impatience in his command. He had to be the most patient man she\u2019d ever come across. Even Hugh, when he\u2019d instructed her, had often thrown up his hands and stomped away, grumbling about the impossibility of teaching a lass to fight.</p><p>But she\u2019d shown him. Just like she\u2019d shown all her father\u2019s men who\u2019d mocked her early efforts. And she\u2019d show her husband, who seemed determined to see how many times he could knock her on her butt.</p> <p>The tip of her sword nearly dragged on the ground as she stepped forward to face Caelen again. But she was careful to prevent the blade from doing so. Caelen had already taught her a lesson about abusing her weapon.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, lass, you\u2019re making me daft,\u201d Gannon grumbled. \u201cPivot this time. You weigh naught. Should be easy for a lass your size to be quicker than a man of the laird\u2019s size. Use that quickness to your advantage.\u201d</p><p>Sucking in painful breaths, Rionna circled warily around her husband, looking for any movement.</p><p>\u201cStop. Just stop a moment, Caelen.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sighed and lowered his sword as Gannon strode forward.</p><p>\u201cA word, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Not trusting that this wasn\u2019t a trick devised by Caelen to distract her, she backed slowly away, holding her sword toward Caelen the whole time. Her husband grinned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s learning, Gannon. Don\u2019t be overharsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want this done with so we can go eat,\u201d Gannon muttered.</p><p>He drew Rionna to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as though this is an exercise with set rules and parameters. Battle is anything but, lass. You circle Caelen waiting for him to make the first move and then you react. As a result you\u2019re always on the defensive and he always has the advantage. This time, you initiate the action. Go after him and use your quickness. You\u2019ve not his strength. \u2019Tis foolhardy to try and stand your ground against a man who is three times your size. Think of other ways to compensate and be quick about it. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Rionna grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best not to further inconvenience you, Gannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll stay here all night. Don\u2019t think he won\u2019t, lass. He\u2019ll either get the result he wants or he\u2019ll completely wear you down. Whichever comes first. My suggestion is to give him the result he wants so we can all go indoors where it\u2019s warmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning into an old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou best hope he never allows me to spar with you. I\u2019ll show you old woman. And I won\u2019t be as merciful as he\u2019s being.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho says he\u2019s being merciful? My arse would disagree that he\u2019s shown any mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bleeding. That\u2019s merciful.\u201d</p><p>Rionna shrugged and turned back to face Caelen who stood waiting, no sign of fatigue or annoyance in his eyes. He looked as though he were on a casual outing. Nothing ruffled him. She wondered if he\u2019d ever been caught off guard in his life.</p><p>Remembering Gannon\u2019s advice, she began to circle, just as she\u2019d done every time before. There was truth in Gannon\u2019s words. She was predictable by the sheer fact that she performed the same ritual every time and waited for Caelen to strike.</p><p>Digging deep to find the last of her flagging strength, she raised her sword, let out a yell to rival any warrior, and charged.</p><p>Caelen grinned then let out a whoop of his own as their swords met. The clash could be heard all over the courtyard. Invigorated, Rionna thrust, parried, and kept driving him back, using her quickness and the fact that she swung a much lighter sword keep him from launching a counterattack.</p><p>Aye, he was on the defensive now. Just where she wanted him until he provided an opening.</p><p>Despite the frigid air, sweat poured from her brow. Her jaw ached from her clenched teeth and her eyes were narrowed in intense concentration.</p><p>Caelen swung his sword but she turned and thrust out her blade to block. The force drove her to one knee and before she could recover, with a flick of his wrist, he knocked the sword from her hand.</p><p>\u201cBetter, wife. But not good enough.\u201d</p><p>Deciding she\u2019d had enough of that smug superiority, she ducked low and launched herself at him. She lined up her shoulder and hit him right below the waist.</p><p>He let out a string of curses that blistered her ears. Then he slipped to his knees, his hand cupping his cods. His sword fell from his other hand and landed in the snow.</p><p>Rionna stumbled back, retrieved her sword, and then put the tip to his neck. \u201cDo you yield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I yield or you\u2019ll likely slice off what\u2019s left of my cods.\u201d</p><p>The strain in his voice and the pain creasing his forehead might have ordinarily concerned her, but then she remembered the hours of hell he\u2019d just put her through and all sympathy disappeared.</p><p>Gannon stepped forward, wheezing with laughter. Caelen sent him a dark scowl.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up, Gannon.\u201d</p><p>Gannon let out another guffaw and then pounded Rionna on the back, nearly knocking her to the ground. \u201cAnd that, my lady, is how you fell a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her to rearrange my balls?\u201d Caelen demanded.</p><p>\u201cNay. I only told her to go on the offensive. I\u2019d say she thinks well on her feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesu,\u201d Caelen said as he struggled to his feet. \u201cI was rather fond of that portion of my anatomy, wife.\u201d</p><p>Rionna grinned cheekily and then leaned close to Caelen so Gannon wouldn\u2019t overhear. \u201cSo was I. I do hope there\u2019s no permanent damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisrespectful baggage,\u201d Caelen complained. \u201c \u2019Tis a situation I\u2019ll remedy later.\u201d</p><p>Then he touched her cheek where one fading bruise still smudged her skin. \u201cDo your injuries still pain you? Did you overreach today with your training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d she whispered. \u201c \u2019Tis naught but a twinge now and then. \u2019Tis been a fortnight and I can see near to perfect from my eye again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird! A messenger approaches the gates!\u201d</p><p>Caelen shoved her against Gannon and picked up his sword from the snow. \u201cTake her inside at once and alert the rest of the men.\u201d</p><p>Knowing this wasn\u2019t the time to protest, Rionna allowed Gannon to hustle her inside the keep. He relinquished her in the hall next to the fire and then he shouted orders that were echoed throughout the keep.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, what is about?\u201d Sarah asked as she hurried into the hall.</p><p>\u201cI know not, Sarah. A messenger approaches our gate. We\u2019ll know when the laird tells us what is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit then and let me bring you hot broth. You tremble with cold and your clothing is wet through. Warm yourself by the fire before you catch your death of cold.\u201d</p><p>Rionna looked down at her bedraggled clothing and shook her head ruefully. She\u2019d put in a hard day\u2019s work. She hadn\u2019t even registered the dampness spreading over her clothing, but now that Sarah had mentioned it, Rionna could feel the chill wrought by the wet material clinging to her body.</p><p>She moved closer to the fire and stretched out her hands as the keep buzzed with activity around her. She sighed as some of the heat thawed her fingertips and warmth traveled up her arms.</p><p>She turned when she heard her husband\u2019s footsteps. How quickly she\u2019d become attuned to him. She knew even with her back turned that he\u2019d entered the room.</p><p>\u201cIs aught amiss?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNay. \u2019Twas a McCabe man bearing a message from my brother. He is to arrive soon and requested shelter. He travels to Neamh \u00c1lainn with Mairin, Crispen, and Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this weather?\u201d</p><p>It shocked Rionna that Ewan would chance traveling in such conditions when Isabel was so young.</p><p>\u201cHe fears waiting longer. I sent him word of your attack and the message they delivered. He wants them safely ensconced at Neamh \u00c1lainn where he can avail himself of the contingent of soldiers who have guarded the holding since Alexander\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would excuse myself to see to their arrival,\u201d Rionna murmured.</p><p>Caelen nodded then turned to Gannon. The two men strode from the hall, deep in conversation. Rionna took a deep breath and tried to recall the few lessons that Sarah had imparted. She instructed the women to ready food and drink. Thank God, Caelen had been successful in his hunt. Now they wouldn\u2019t shame Caelen in front of his kin by setting an inferior table.</p><p>She set several of the women to cleaning the hall. The fire was built up and the furs shoved aside to usher in cleaner, sweet-smelling air.</p><p>Content that the women knew their tasks and would perform them quickly, Rionna hurried up the stairs to her chamber to change her clothing.</p><p>She wet cloths in the washbasin and wiped the sweat and dirt from her face and body. She shivered as chill bumps dotted her damp flesh and she hurried to pull on a gown from her wardrobe. It was the first opportunity she\u2019d had to wear one of the dresses Sarah and the other women had altered for her and she was well satisfied with the result.</p><p>Caelen would find no fault with her appearance. She looked every bit the lady of the keep. He had made concessions\u2014important concessions\u2014for her, and she felt compelled to do the same for him.</p><p>She sat by the fire and brushed out her hair until it sparkled and shone like liquid gold. Then she plaited the long tresses and used a leather tie to secure the end.</p><p>Satisfied that she looked presentable, she rose and hurried back down to oversee the preparations.</p><p>The hall was busy as the tables and floors were hurriedly cleaned. Just airing the room out had made a remarkable difference.</p><p>\u201cVenison stew is being warmed and we have several loaves of bread leftover from the noon meal. We even have a bit of cheese left that I put back for just such an occasion,\u201d Sarah told Rionna.</p><p>\u201cAnd ale? Have we a sufficient amount for our guests? Have one of the men melt some snow for fresh water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah nodded and hurried away once more.</p><p>An hour later, Caelen strode back into the hall and searched out Rionna. His eyes widened and the glint of approval warmed her to her toes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re riding to our gate now. Gannon and I will go out to greet them. You stay inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him and then nodded.</p><p>Caelen sniffed the air appreciatively and then glanced around the hall. Then he leaned in and brushed his mouth over her temple. \u201cThank you for making my brother and his wife welcome.\u201d</p><p>An odd flutter began in her belly and worked its way up to her throat as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cWarm some cider in case Lady McCabe would like a hot drink by the fire,\u201d Rionna said to Sarah. \u201cAnd have ale ready to pour for the men.\u201d</p><p>Rionna paced back and forth as she waited for Caelen to return with his guests. She\u2019d never suffered such unease when she and her father had traveled to McCabe land. But she hadn\u2019t cared about impressing them. Such was not the case now. They were coming to her keep, her home, and how they viewed her reflected on Caelen, and it was suddenly all important to her not to shame her husband.</p><p>She wanted him to be proud of her, to look upon her with favor and not find fault.</p><p>Several long moments later, the door burst open and Ewan McCabe hurried inside with Mairin and his son, Crispen, tucked against his side. Rionna rushed forward to take Mairin\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cCome by the fire before you unwrap the babe,\u201d Rionna urged. \u201cI have cider waiting.\u201d</p><p>Ewan took Crispen with him to the table where the men had already gathered, as Rionna ushered Mairin toward the hearth.</p><p>Mairin gifted her with a sweet smile. \u201c \u2019Tis good of you to offer, Rionna. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m cold to my bones.\u201d</p><p>She and Mairin stopped in front of the fire and Mairin began unwrapping the heavy furs from around her. Nestled against her bosom was baby Isabel, sound asleep, looking remarkably unperturbed by all the goings on.</p><p>Rionna was transfixed by the babe. She was a beautiful lass, with a head full of black hair just like her parents. Tiny, delicate features and a bow-shaped mouth.</p><p>Mairin reached out to gently touch Rionna\u2019s eye. Startled, Rionna drew away and stared at the other woman.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis sorry I am you were drawn into our fight,\u201d Mairin said in a low voice. \u201cCaelen said you were badly beaten.\u201d</p><p>Rionna pressed her lips together in a frown. \u201cNay, \u2019tis my fight as well. I\u2019m married to a McCabe.\u201d</p><p>Mairin smiled. \u201cCaelen is lucky to have one as fierce as you. I worried so about him leaving our clan to become laird here, but I think my worry is misplaced. You\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I will. I\u2019ll not let harm come to him, if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>Mairin squeezed Rionna\u2019s hand and then let out a weary sigh that spurred Rionna to action. \u201cPlease do sit,\u201d she urged Mairin.</p><p>Mairin nodded gratefully. \u201cIsabel will be wanting her meal soon. We\u2019ve traveled since yesterday morn. Ewan was afraid to stop.\u201d</p><p>Rionna waved to one of the men standing nearby and bid him to add wood to the fire. Then she sent one of the women for cider.</p> <p>\u201cThe meal will soon be served,\u201d she told Mairin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think me ungrateful, but \u2019tis the truth I\u2019d prefer to sit by the fire. I\u2019m too tired to go to the table and \u2019twill be more comfortable here holding Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit with you and hold the babe while you eat,\u201d Rionna replied. \u201cThe men can have the table so they can discuss matters. \u2019Tis likely they\u2019ll be at it all night. You and I can escape upstairs and they\u2019ll never notice.\u201d</p><p>Mairin chuckled. \u201cAye, I think you\u2019re right. Thank you, Rionna. You\u2019re sweet to look after me so.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s cheeks warmed at the other woman\u2019s praise. She glanced over at Caelen, expecting to find him deep in conversation with his brother, but to her surprise, she found him watching her and Mairin, a most peculiar expression on his face.</p><p>She smiled hesitantly. He nodded in her direction, but his gaze continued to linger as she looked away.</p><p>\u201cYou must tell me how marriage is suiting you, Rionna. I must confess you look quite well. And ... happy. You have a glow about you that was absent before. You\u2019ve always been a beautiful lass, but now you outshine the sun.\u201d</p><p>Flustered by Mairin\u2019s words, Rionna ducked her head and then reached clumsily for Isabel when Sarah arrived with cider and a trencher for Mairin.</p><p>The babe squawked in protest but then nuzzled against Rionna\u2019s breast when Rionna held her close. Mairin chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s not a picky child. Any breast will do. \u2019Tis amusing to watch Ewan\u2019s face when she roots against his chest.\u201d</p><p>Rionna laughed softly and touched her fingertip to Isabel\u2019s tiny palm. Isabel promptly curled her fingers tight around Rionna\u2019s finger and waved it about as her unfocused gaze found Rionna.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just beautiful, Mairin.\u201d Rionna sighed.</p><p>\u201cI thank you. She is a true treasure. Ewan and I delight in her every day.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to hold Isabel and not imagine holding her own babe in her arms one day. A son or daughter with Caelen\u2019s green eyes. Aye, that would be perfect.</p><p>Mayhap she was already breeding.</p><p>The thought sent a jolt through her veins, shocking in its discovery.</p><p>Could she be carrying his child already? It had been some weeks since they\u2019d arrived here on McDonald land. Even now, a child could be growing in her womb.</p><p>She slid her hand from Isabel\u2019s bottom to her flat belly and splayed out her fingers. \u2019Twas a marvel she hadn\u2019t considered it until now.</p><p>Oh, she knew children were inevitable if God chose to bestow such a gift on them. But she hadn\u2019t considered that it could happen so soon, even though Caelen had all but guaranteed she\u2019d deliver a child within a year of their marriage.</p><p>She\u2019d thought his prideful statement to be a natural boast of a newly married man.</p><p>She caught her bottom lip between her teeth and nibbled as she contemplated the possibilities. She knew it was her duty to provide heirs for Caelen. \u2019Twas a duty she owed her clan as well, to provide them with the next laird.</p><p>But \u2019twas God\u2019s truth, she wasn\u2019t sure she was up to the task quite yet.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t cause her distress if \u2019twas a little while longer before her womb bore fruit.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Rionna was fair to falling over by the time Caelen sought their chamber. She\u2019d sat by the fire yawning for the past hour, waiting for him to come to bed.</p><p>When he opened the door and stepped inside, he looked surprised to see her. Then a faint frown drew his brows together.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have waited up for me. \u2019Tis late and you have need of your rest.\u201d</p><p>It would have been a thoughtful statement if he hadn\u2019t accentuated it with that frown.</p><p>Ignoring his gruffness, she rose and went to help him undress. He went still as she unlaced the leather ties of his trews. So still that she wasn\u2019t sure he was even breathing.</p><p>When her fingers brushed his firm belly, he flinched. She was sorely tempted to run her palm up his midriff to his chest, but she was going to properly attend him first.</p><p>She guided him toward the chair she\u2019d vacated by the fire and urged him down. He watched through half-lidded eyes as she tugged at his tunic and then pulled it over his head, baring his broad, hair-roughened chest.</p><p>She sucked in her breath. The man was beautiful. Never had she seen his equal. She fingered a puckered scar across his right shoulder and slid her hand lower to a much older, nearly flat scar on his left flank. She frowned as she studied it. \u2019Twas a knife wound.</p><p>\u201cSomeone stabbed you from behind,\u201d she mused as she knelt to give it a closer look.</p><p>He stiffened, his muscles coiling and going rigid. His profile was set in stone as he stared into the fire.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>She waited but he offered nothing more.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one of import.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed the scar. He reacted in surprise, turning, his arm raised so he didn\u2019t elbow her in the head. Then he lowered his hand to her hair and stroked his fingers through the strands.</p><p>He ran his fingers over her jaw and then cupped her chin, tilting it so that she looked up at him. A teasing glint twinkled in his green eyes.</p><p>\u201cI barely recognize the woman before me. She\u2019s acting almost like a wife. What has happened to my fierce warrior? I came in to a fine table. The lady of the keep directed the welcoming of my kin and she played hostess to my brother\u2019s wife. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she awaited me in my chamber to attend me with a gentle hand and a soft mouth?\u201d</p><p>She scowled up at him. \u201c \u2019Tis true what they say of men.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. They never know when to keep their mouths shut.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and rubbed his thumb over her bottom lip and then lowered his mouth to hers until they touched in a most gentle fashion.</p><p>\u201cI was proud of you this day, Rionna. You speak of having none of the social graces of a lady and yet you performed as a laird\u2019s wife would be expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not shame you in front of your kin,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her again and then drew away to pull at his boots. When he was done, he sat there, laces undone at his waist, shirtless, his flesh gleaming in the firelight. He was a feast for her eyes and she was determined that on this night she\u2019d have him.</p><p>Her gaze skittered downward to the bulge at the apex of his thighs. With only a little encouragement, he would be free of his trews.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>Caelen regarded her lazily, the spark of amusement back in his gaze. \u201c \u2019Tis a universal truth that when a lass says she\u2019s been thinking, a man ought to be wary.\u201d</p><p>She moved between his legs and ran her hand up his thigh to cup him intimately. \u201cI was thinking that since I did harm to a portion of your anatomy you favored that I could make it up to you. But if you\u2019re wary....\u201d</p><p>He caught his breath. \u201cNay. Not wary. Not wary at all.\u201d Then he reached down to cup her chin again, his thumb brushing over the spot where her bruising was fading. \u201cAre you sure \u2019tis something you wish to do, lass?\u201d</p><p>Her heart clenched at the concern in his voice. He\u2019d treated her with the utmost care since her attack. He\u2019d only touched her to offer comfort or to ensure himself that she was all right. It was almost as if he\u2019d worried that he would frighten her or remind her in some way of the men who had hurt her.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis my wish that you allow me to have my way this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour way? \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ll grant such a wish every night if you desire it.\u201d</p><p>She reached inside his clothing and caressed the long, rigid length of him. His breath hissed out in the silence. He gripped her shoulders with both hands and then abruptly stood. In a moment\u2019s time he\u2019d torn the offending material from his body and tossed it across the room.</p><p>Her gaze slid up his body, illuminated by flame, so exquisitely rendered. The body of a warrior, not a lad. Heavily muscled. Scarred. Rough.</p><p>At his groin, his manhood extended from the dark whorl of hair, thick and heavy.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a sight destined to seduce a man,\u201d Caelen rasped as he stared down at her kneeling at his feet.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou like a woman at your feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a stupid man. Admitting such would be akin to cutting off my cods.\u201d</p><p>She shifted and rose up, her hands skimming along the outsides of his thighs. \u201cBut you like it.\u201d</p><p>He groaned when she cupped his sac and massaged the weight in her hand.</p><p>\u201cAye, I like it. I like it very much. \u2019Tis no sweeter sight than you between my legs on your knees ready to pleasure me.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively she circled his length with her other hand and lightly caressed. \u2019Twas the truth that she\u2019d begun this seduction, but she had no idea how to go through with it. Keeley hadn\u2019t been overly detailed with the how. Just what to do in the beginning.</p><p>Caelen was a man who valued control. He liked the sight of her on her knees enough. \u2019Twas clear he liked a submissive wife. \u2019Twas entirely possible that the best seduction she could give him would be to allow him to conduct it. And then she wouldn\u2019t have to admit just how ignorant she was of such matters.</p><p>\u201cInstruct me, husband,\u201d she said in a husky, sweet voice she hoped was pleasing. \u201cShow me what you like for your lass to do.\u201d</p><p>The flicker in his eyes should have alarmed her. \u2019Twas a fierce, animalistic light that sent a shiver down her spine. His fingers tangled in her hair and he pulled back just enough that her head tilted back and her neck arched forward as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI want you naked so I may look upon you and know that every inch of your beauty is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I rise then so that I may do your bidding, husband?\u201d</p><p>She watched desire smolder like coals in his eyes and realized that the coy game she played pleased her husband very much. The intricacies of a man\u2019s mind never ceased to fascinate her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not awaiting his answer\u2014\u2019twas needless after all\u2014she slowly got to her feet and then backed away a pace so that the warmth from the fire flickered over her skin.</p><p>Hiding her smile, she turned until her back was presented to him and then she began untying the sash at her waist. She glanced over her shoulder to find him watching her with avid fascination.</p><p>\u201cI have need of your help, husband.\u201d</p><p>His hands shook against her nape as he unfastened her dress. When he\u2019d undone enough that she could step from the folds of the material, she let it fall to the floor so that she stood in only her undergown.</p><p>Turning so that she faced him once more, she reached up and threaded her fingers underneath the straps over her shoulders. Then she hesitated before pulling ever so slowly until they eased over her shoulders and down her arms.</p><p>The neckline caught at her breasts but with a gentle tug, it slid over her nipples and fell into a pool at her feet.</p><p>\u201cNow shall I attend you, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye, wife. Aye, indeed.\u201d</p><p>She slid to her knees in front of him, her hands gliding down the sides of his legs. She memorized every swell, the bulge of his muscles, the uneven puckers of scars, new and old.</p><p>Then she tilted her head back and stared up at him. \u201cShow me what pleases you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, but you\u2019re beautiful, lass. Your eyes shine like a thousand sunsets. And your mouth, so perfectly formed. I cannot wait another moment to feel such sweetness around my flesh.\u201d</p><p>He grasped his straining erection with one hand and cupped her nape with his other before guiding himself toward her mouth. Such intimacy shocked her, though it shouldn\u2019t. After all, he\u2019d loved her thoroughly with his own lips and tongue until she\u2019d been senseless with pleasure.</p><p>The idea that she could make him just as insensible thrilled her. She licked over her lips in a nervous gesture just as the tip of his cock brushed against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOpen for me, lass. Take me inside your heat.\u201d</p><p>His husky drawl drifted over her, bringing her body alive with the images his request invoked. She was alternately nervous and excited. And restless. She wanted to rub her body against his and purr her satisfaction like a cat being stroked.</p><p>She parted her lips and tentatively took him on her tongue. His fingers rubbed impatiently at her nape and then threaded upward into her hair.</p><p>Growing bolder and more confident in his reaction, she slid her lips farther up the base, taking more of him into her mouth. \u2019Twas a sensation like she\u2019d never imagined. She shook from head to toe, her body tight and aching with need.</p><p>Letting her instincts guide her, she began to suck lightly, using her tongue to further torment him. His taste was wholly masculine and a hint of musk danced through her nostrils.</p><p>The sound that came from his throat was one of agony. His hand tightened in her hair and he moved his other hand from his cock and cupped her face as he slid deeper into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never known such fire and sweetness,\u201d he said behind clenched teeth. \u201cYou are a temptress, wife. \u2019Tis the truth you kneel at my feet, but \u2019tis I who am for all practical purposes at yours.\u201d</p><p>His words brought her feminine power roaring to life. She\u2019d always considered that embracing her womanhood somehow made her weak, but \u2019twas the truth, she\u2019d never felt more powerful than at this moment.</p><p>Here was this man, a fierce warrior, and he was completely and utterly at her mercy. She held his pleasure, his pain, his satisfaction in her very hands.</p><p>She curled her fingers around the base of his manhood and followed the path of her mouth, up and down, exerting pressure as she served him with her lips and tongue.</p> <p>He dragged both hands over her head, clenching and unclenching as if he were in unspeakable agony. His face was drawn into harsh lines and his head thrown back, eyes closed as he thrust his hips forward.</p><p>She sucked to the tip and pulled his erection away before leaning in to press her lips and tongue to the plump vein on the underside. She licked a sensual trail from base to tip before sucking the head back into her mouth.</p><p>Warm liquid seeped onto her tongue as his harsh groan split the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, wife. Cease this torture, for I cannot take any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know not what you speak of, husband,\u201d she said innocently. \u201c \u2019Tis for you to show me the way of things.\u201d</p><p>He reached down, grasped her arms, and dragged her up his body. He found her mouth in a heated, impatient rush. Breathless. Raw. Bone-melting and shiver-inducing.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and returned his kiss with a fervor equal to his own.</p><p>He turned and carried her to the bed, his mouth never leaving hers. \u201c \u2019Tis what I like most about you, lass. You give no quarter in loving. You\u2019re so passionate and wild in your responses.\u201d</p><p>She landed with a thump and he came down over her, his body pressing urgently to hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought \u2019twas my submissive side you liked so well,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the entire package. You can be so devilishly coy and yet so sweetly innocent that you make me daft with wanting.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her neck, sucking wetly at her pulse before nibbling a path to her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an unselfish lass. Willing to do much to please me. I\u2019ve never had a woman willing to put my pleasure before hers.\u201d</p><p>She thumped him on the chest and scowled. \u201cNow \u2019tis not the time to speak of other women. Even if I compare more favorably.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and lowered his mouth to her breast. \u2019Twas her turn to groan as he sucked at one nipple. He teased it over and over, sucking and nipping, alternating until she writhed beneath him and begged him to cease his torment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered the next way you may please me, wife.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him suspiciously.</p><p>He toyed with her breasts, touching the plump swells and then tracing lines around her nipples.</p><p>\u201cYou have beautiful breasts. So very beautiful. I wager they\u2019re the most perfect breasts I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain with the comparisons,\u201d she growled. \u201c \u2019Twould seem you\u2019re destined to bring harm to that portion of your anatomy you love so.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and then rolled, bringing her atop him. She sprawled rather indelicately across his body, her hair spilling over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI am trying to pay homage to your beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could just say I am beautiful and that my breasts are incomparable and that my face is worthy of a bard\u2019s poem. No need to bring other women into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful. Your breasts are incomparable. Truly, truly incomparable ...\u201d</p><p>She thumped him on the chest and broke into laughter. \u201cEnough. Now tell me this way you mentioned to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a simple enough thing,\u201d he murmured as he curled his fingers around her hips. He lifted and positioned her so that his erection was tucked against her opening. Her eyes went wide as she caught on to his intention. \u201cYou simply ease down ... here ...\u201d he breathed as he slid inside her. \u201cAnd then you ride me.\u201d</p><p>She braced her palms on his shoulders, her entire body rigid as she adjusted to the unfamiliar position.</p><p>\u201cSurely such a thing is not done,\u201d she whispered as she stared down into his eyes that were cloudy with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI care not if such a thing is not done. \u2019Tis done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome might consider me a wanton for indulging in such activities,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>He groaned and closed his eyes when she clenched down on his cock. \u201cI care not what others think. Only what I think. And what I think is that you astride me is the most desirable thing I\u2019ve ever encountered in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh very good,\u201d she murmured as she leaned forward. \u201cSee? You didn\u2019t ruin it by saying that me astride you was better than the other women you\u2019ve had astride you.\u201d</p><p>His body shook with laughter and he wrapped his arms around her to pull her down to his chest. \u201c \u2019Tis an easy omission since you\u2019re the only lass to ever have me between her knees thus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must make the experience a memorable one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, indeed. By all means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to have you insensible,\u201d she warned as she took his mouth with hers. She kissed him, tangling her tongue wetly with his.</p><p>\u201cLass, if you make me any more insensible, I\u2019ll be a blithering idiot.\u201d</p><p>Mimicking his earlier attentions, she grazed his neck with her teeth and kissed her way up to his ear. He went even more rigid inside her, stretching her until she was unbearably tight around him. Such delicious friction. She moved the tiniest bit and they both let out sighs as she tugged relentlessly at his length.</p><p>His arms felt so strong around her. She felt safe. Protected. Cherished even. \u2019Twas a wondrous sensation. One she didn\u2019t want to end.</p><p>Astride her warrior, she didn\u2019t feel small and insignificant. The look in his eyes, the tight coiling of his body told her that he enjoyed her wanton seduction. And in this moment, \u2019twas all she desired. To please him and make him want her more than he\u2019d ever wanted another woman.</p><p>If she had her way, he\u2019d never even consider another female. Forgotten would be the one he used to love, the one who had betrayed him. Rionna would prove to Caelen that she was fierce and loyal and that she\u2019d never waver.</p><p>He would love her. It was a vow she made herself.</p><p>She would give him every reason to love her. She would fight beside him to make their clan strong, but she\u2019d also be a proper wife, as proper a wife as she knew how to be in the privacy of their chambers. She\u2019d even temper her demeanor outside the bedroom, if \u2019twas a more submissive wife he wanted.</p><p>\u201cHow close are you to your woman\u2019s pleasure, wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not important,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. \u201c \u2019Tis your pleasure that is important this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pleasure is my pleasure,\u201d he murmured back.</p><p>Oh, but the man knew exactly how to pierce a woman\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cThen \u2019tis not long I think. \u2019Tis the truth each time I move I feel as though I\u2019m going to tumble down a steep mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let go, lass, because I already have one foot over that peak.\u201d</p><p>She fused her mouth to his as his arms tightened around her. She rocked forward and then back, moaning into his mouth as bliss flooded her veins, warm and whispering to her of deeper, darker pleasures to be had.</p><p>He gripped her hips, and his fingers dug into her buttocks. She was sure she\u2019d wear his marks tomorrow, and it only heightened her excitement.</p><p>He took over, pulling her downward as he bucked upward into her body. Hot and slick. The sharp slap of flesh meeting flesh echoed through the chamber. Their low sighs and moans rose erotically and danced in time with the flames from the fire.</p><p>He slammed her back down and held her tightly, so tightly she felt stretched in places he\u2019d never reached before. His large hand splayed over the swell of her behind and he squeezed and caressed, his touch firm and possessive.</p><p>Unable to keep still, she bucked and writhed over him, squirming, undulating until she knew not what she did.</p><p>When she finally regained awareness, she was sprawled limply over her husband\u2019s chest, her hair covering her face as he ran one hand idly up and down her back in a soothing, caressing motion.</p><p>They were still tightly joined. Indeed, he was still hard within her, even though the sticky feel between them told her that he\u2019d found his release as well.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head and gently smoothed the hair from her face. \u201cI find I like this submissive side of you, wife. \u2019Tis pleasing when you obey my every command.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at the amusement in his voice, but she was too sated and tired to move a muscle.</p><p>\u201cAnd you make a fine pillow, husband. I plan to sleep here tonight.\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened around her and his cock pulsed once again deep inside her.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a good thing, because I have no plans for you to move.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Rionna woke to hands at her hips and a rigid cock sliding deep into her sheath. She gasped and came more fully awake, blinking as pleasure sizzled through her body.</p><p>She was belly down on the bed, face turned sideways with her legs over the side. Her behind was perched high in the air, held up by his firm grip.</p><p>Caelen stood behind her, mounted over her, tucked deep inside her body. He uttered not a single word as he pushed into her again and again.</p><p>His silent intensity only spurred her excitement to greater heights. He was firm, unyielding. The thoughtful, careful lover of before had been replaced by a fierce warrior intent on slaking his own desire.</p><p>Her release, when it came, shocked her. It happened so fast, and was so sharp, it took her breath away, leaving her panting and sagging against the bed.</p><p>Still, he hauled her up higher, supporting her as he continued to drive into her, over and over. Pleasure stirred within her once more, rising and tightening her body all over again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned over her until she could feel the ripple of each and every muscle. Tension whipped through his body and bled into hers. Then he let go of her hips and planted his hands on either side of her shoulders. She fell forward and he came with her, still thrusting deeply.</p><p>A shudder rolled through him and then he stilled, deep inside her. He pulsed and warmth flooded her, easing his passage. She went slick around him and uttered a soft moan as he strained against her.</p><p>Then he raised himself just enough that he pressed a gentle kiss to the center of her back.</p><p>\u201cSleep now,\u201d he whispered. \u201c \u2019Tis too early for you to rise yet.\u201d</p> <p>He eased out of her and returned a moment later with a damp cloth and cleansed her. When he was done, he positioned her properly in the bed and tucked the heavy furs around her.</p><p>She listened as he dressed in the dark. He added more logs to the fire and stoked it until the flames burned brightly. Then he quietly left the chamber, leaving her to sleep once more.</p><p>She snuggled deeper into the warmth, her body still tingling from his masterful possession. This time when she drifted back to sleep, a smile curved her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up late this morn, Caelen,\u201d Ewan said when Caelen entered the hall.</p><p>Caelen eyed his brother, who sat by the fire breaking his fast. \u201cI was detained.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan smothered a grin and nodded. \u201cAye, \u2019tis interesting how that happens when a man is married, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up,\u201d Caelen growled.</p><p>Ewan sobered when Caelen took his seat and motioned for his goblet to be filled. \u201cI\u2019ll not tarry long, Caelen. I want to reach Neamh \u00c1lainn as soon as possible. Cameron would use this opportunity to attack us as we travel. We departed McCabe land in the middle of the night and traveled straight through without stopping. I plan to do the same tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>Ewan shook his head. \u201cNay, you have much to do here. How goes it thus far? How does Rionna fair after her attack?\u201d</p><p>Caelen frowned. \u201cThe lass was badly beaten. \u2019Twas a coward\u2019s attack meant to anger me into foolhardy action. Cameron seeks to lure me to him. He has no desire to launch an attack in winter. He remains behind the walls of his keep, warm and sated with food while he has hired mercenaries to do his cowardly deeds for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you any luck in training the McDonald soldiers?\u201d</p><p>Caelen sighed. \u201cThey work hard and are diligent in their efforts. \u2019Tis not that they aren\u2019t worthy soldiers. They\u2019ve just not had proper training until now. \u2019Tis hard to correct years\u2019 worth of inefficiency in a few week\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Ewan clapped his hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf anyone can do it, you can. I have every faith in your ability to fashion your men into a formidable army of warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does Alaric fare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken over the duties of laird as if he were born to the position. The clan is in good hands. He will be a good laird and Keeley will be a credit to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis good that he is happy,\u201d Caelen murmured.</p><p>Ewan glanced sharply at his younger brother. \u201cAnd you, Caelen? Are you well satisfied with your marriage and your position as laird?\u201d</p><p>Caelen thought for a moment. He hadn\u2019t stopped to analyze whether or not he was well content with his new wife and clan. There had been too much to tend to. Was he happy? Before, his happiness hadn\u2019t come into the picture. It mattered not whether he was happy. It only mattered that the alliance would be kept and that he would be able to aid his brother in the fight against Duncan Cameron.</p> <p>Happy?</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twas not a trick question I was putting to you,\u201d Ewan said dryly.</p><p>\u201cIt matters not if I\u2019m happy. What matters is that we have the might to destroy Cameron. I have more reason than ever to want his blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you do,\u201d Ewan agreed. \u201cWe all do. He\u2019s brought much harm to our clans. To our wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed our father.\u201d</p><p>Ewan sighed. \u201cYou cannot still blame yourself for that, Caelen.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not a martyr I make of myself. I was young and foolish and we all paid the price. The signs were there for me to see but I purposely blinded myself to them. Our clan paid the price. We lost our father and you lost your wife. Crispen lost his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never blamed you,\u201d Ewan said in a low voice. \u201cNot once. If Elsepeth hadn\u2019t done the deed, Cameron would have found another way.\u201d</p><p>Impatient with recounting the past, Caelen waved his hand dismissively. He didn\u2019t like to dwell on just how young and stupid he\u2019d been. Elsepeth had found an easy mark in him. She\u2019d turned his head, seduced him, and kept him under her spell. He would have done anything for her.</p><p>He\u2019d loved her.</p><p>He still winced when he made that admission, but he made it freely to remind himself of his past sins. It was a mistake he wouldn\u2019t make again. Dealing with a woman required a clear head, one unclouded by emotions.</p><p>\u201cAre you up for a little exercise, or has marriage and fatherhood made you soft?\u201d Caelen challenged.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cAre you prepared to be humiliated in front of your men?\u201d</p><p>Caelen snorted. \u201cYou can certainly try, old man.\u201d</p><p>Rionna stretched languidly and smiled even before she opened her eyes. \u2019Twas a wonderful morning. Her feet were toasty warm and she had no desire to get up from bed.</p><p>Then she opened her eyes and blinked sleepily as she gave another lazy stretch. She turned on her side and her gaze rested on a pair of leather boots on the floor next to the bed.</p><p>She blinked more rapidly and sat up, clutching the covers to her breasts.</p><p>New boots. Not just newly fashioned, but fur-lined.</p><p>And beside them, was a neatly folded fur-lined cloak with a hood.</p><p>Her feet hit the floor and she dove toward the treasures. She grabbed one boot and turned it over and over, inspecting the fine stitching and craftsmanship. Then she plunged her hand inside and sighed at the luxurious feel of the warm fur.</p><p>With a delighted squeal, she clutched the boots and the cloak to her chest and danced around the room.</p><p>She stopped in front of the fire and buried her face in the soft fur. What a wonderful, wonderful thing for Caelen to do. How had he laid hands on such fine things?</p><p>Not able to wait a minute longer to try them on, she hurriedly donned her gown and then sat on the bed as she pulled her boots on.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sighed idiotically as her heel slid into the boot. She stood and paced about the chamber, testing the feel and the size. They fit her perfectly. Not too big and not even a pinch too small.</p><p>She ran to the window and threw aside the fur then stuck her head out. Snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky and collected on the ground below. \u2019Twas a perfect day to try out her new treasures.</p><p>With a grin, she spun around, donned the cloak, and hurried out of her chamber.</p><p>\u2019Twas remiss of her to not even check the hall to see if her guests were in attendance, but she didn\u2019t care. Caelen would be outdoors with the men, as he was every day, and he was the one she wanted to see.</p><p>Her boots crunched over the snow but no dampness seeped into her toes nor did any hint of cold grip her feet.</p><p>Caelen stood with his brother and \u2019twas obvious the two were set to spar. She was too excited to consider whether \u2019twas appropriate for her to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cCaelen!\u201d she called as she approached.</p><p>As soon as he turned in the direction of her voice, she launched herself at him. So surprised was he that he stumbled back even as he caught her against him and they both tumbled into the snow.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s teeth, woman, whatever is the matter? Is someone hurt?\u201d</p><p>She sat astride him, grinning so big that her cheeks hurt. She leaned down, framed his face in her hands, and proceeded to pepper his face with kisses. Then she fused her lips to his in a hot, lusty kiss that certainly had her toes curling in her new boots.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cI love them. \u2019Tis the best gift anyone has ever given me.\u201d</p><p>There were sounds of amusement on all sides of them, but she ignored the men as they gathered. She pushed herself off Caelen, who looked dazed and befuddled by what had just transpired.</p><p>She gifted the men with an equally dazzling smile and then she performed a perfect curtsy in Ewan\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your duties,\u201d she said.</p><p>She chanced one more look at Caelen, who still lay sprawled in the snow, a look of complete bemusement on his face, and then she turned and all but skipped back toward the keep.</p><p>Caelen blinked and stared after his wife as she hurried through the snow. Then he glanced around at the men gathered and scowled at their looks of amusement.</p><p>Ewan stood to the side, contorting his mouth so he didn\u2019t laugh aloud, and then he extended a hand down to Caelen.</p><p>\u201cI take it Rionna liked her gifts.\u201d</p><p>Caelen grasped Ewan\u2019s hand and hauled himself out of the snow.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, the woman has no self-control,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ewan laughed softly and then clapped Caelen on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d say you just scored some points with the lass. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all understand if you chose to excuse yourself for a time.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rose from the assembled warriors and Caelen scowled even harder. Then he punched Ewan directly in the gut, satisfied when his brother let out a pained grunt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d Ewan demanded.</p><p>\u201cPayment for the time you did the same to me when I needled you about your wife.\u201d</p><p>Ewan laughed as he rubbed his belly. \u201cI believe you made mention of me missing my cods. Strange that you seem to suffer the same affliction when it comes to a certain, golden-haired lass.\u201d</p><p>Caelen went to hit him again but Ewan dodged this time and both men went down in the snow. The men pressed forward and shouts rose as they urged the two brothers on. Wagers were quickly placed and the snow began to fly.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Crispen threw his arms around Rionna\u2019s waist, surprising her with his exuberance. He was a sweet child but a typical boisterous lad. She kissed the top of his head and he bounced away to pounce on his Uncle Caelen.</p><p>\u201cFarewell, Rionna, and thank you for your hospitality,\u201d Mairin said as she hugged Rionna.</p><p>Rionna kissed her cheek and then pulled aside one of the small blankets that encapsulated Isabel and nuzzled the baby\u2019s soft cheek. Oh but babies smelled so sweet. It filled her with longing for her own babe, and then she shook her head at the insensible urge.</p><p>\u201cSafe journey, Mairin. I\u2019ll pray for you and Isabel.\u201d</p><p>Mairin smiled and then went to say her farewell to Caelen, while Ewan waited by the horses. Rionna watched in amusement as Caelen softened into a pile of mush as he stared down at Ewan\u2019s tiny daughter.</p><p>There was something powerful about a warrior brought to his knees by a babe. Rionna stifled her laughter as Caelen uttered something nonsensical to Isabel. He followed it with a promise to cut off the heads of all men who\u2019d pursue her in the future.</p><p>Rionna and Mairin exchanged eye rolls. At least he hadn\u2019t suggested another part of the male anatomy.</p><p>Ewan and his men mounted and then Caelen lifted Mairin and Isabel up onto Ewan\u2019s horse. Ewan wrapped his arms securely around his wife and child and then gave the order to ride.</p><p>They filed out of the courtyard, over the wooden drawbridge, and into the moonless night.</p><p>Caelen returned to her a moment later. \u201c \u2019Tis late. We should retire now.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and allowed him to take her arm as he escorted her inside. He paused at the bottom of the stair to discuss the next day\u2019s events with Gannon while Rionna proceeded up the stairs.</p><p>She had plans for her husband this evening. Daring plans that no lady should ever entertain, which delighted her even more.</p><p>Once inside her chamber, she quickly added logs to the fire and straightened the furs on the bed. Soon she heard her husband\u2019s heavy step on the stairs and then right outside the door.</p><p>She turned, hiding her smile, so that her back was presented when Caelen stepped inside the chamber.</p><p>\u201cRionna, there is something we should discuss,\u201d he began sternly.</p><p>\u201cHmm, can you help me with my dress?\u201d</p><p>She turned in time to see him frown. But he crossed the room and began to unfasten the buttons of her gown.</p><p>\u201cNow what is it you\u2019d like to discuss, husband?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cThere are certain things that should not be done in front of others.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the sleeves of her gown and turned, holding the bodice barely over her nipples. She stared innocently up at him as she allowed one side to slip, baring the tip of her breast.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>His gaze tracked downward and he sucked in his breath. It took him a moment before he continued. \u201cDisplays of affection should be contained to our private chamber.\u201d</p><p>She turned away again and let the gown fall, stepping from it and reaching for her sleeping gown. She tossed her head, allowing her hair to skim along her buttocks, and then she arched as if stretching before tossing aside the gown, seeming to change her mind about donning it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuch displays are never appropriate in front of my men,\u201d Caelen continued in a strangled voice.</p><p>Rionna turned once more and stepped forward to loosen the ties of his trews. \u201cAye, husband, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. No show of affection in front of others. \u2019Tis unseemly.\u201d</p><p>She reached inside and cupped his heavy sac, squeezing gently.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not just ... What on earth are you about, wife?\u201d</p> <p>She stroked up and down and then withdrew her hand. \u201cI\u2019m undressing you. \u2019Tis my duty, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aye, \u2019tis sometimes. But right now \u2019tis important we have this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree. Do continue. Where were you? Ah yes, you said \u2019tis not just ... \u2019Tis just not what?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and shook his head as her hand grazed over his chest and then began pulling at his tunic.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not just unseemly. \u2019Tis a matter of respect. The men\u2019s respect for me. I cannot command their respect if I\u2019m being tumbled to the ground by my wife.\u201d</p> <p>He had mustered another grim scowl, but she tugged at his trews and freed his cock into her greedy grasp.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to tumble you to the ground in the privacy of our chamber?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She hooked her leg behind his knee and gave him a mighty shove. He stumbled back against the bed and went down on his back.</p><p>She climbed atop him and stared triumphantly down at him. \u201cNow what is it you were saying, husband? I am ever obedient and am awaiting your instructions.\u201d</p><p>He tucked his hands behind his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t saying a damn thing. Not a thing. Carry on, wife.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled in satisfaction. \u201c \u2019Tis what I thought you said.\u201d She lowered her mouth to his as she reached down to grasp his cock to fit it to her opening.</p><p>As he sank deep into her welcoming body, he sucked in his breath and then murmured against her mouth, \u201cYou have my permission to tumble me anywhere and as often as you like.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Rionna viewed the courtyard with an unhappy grimace as Caelen lit into a group of the warriors. The McDonald men weren\u2019t happy with Caelen\u2019s dressing down. Many of them glared defiantly at their new laird while others cast sullen glances in his direction and then openly defied him by turning away.</p><p>Simon and Hugh did their best to back their laird, but even they weren\u2019t successful in rallying the men from their anger.</p><p>\u2019Twas hard to hear that they were deemed inferior. \u2019Twas even harder to hear that they weren\u2019t putting in enough work and they fought like women.</p><p>That last line drew Rionna\u2019s ire, considering she fought better than most of the men. There was no need to insult women when drawing attention to the men\u2019s inadequacies.</p><p>For a week now, since Caelen\u2019s brother\u2019s departure, Caelen had worked the men from dawn well into the night. The warriors had grown increasingly more vocal in their displeasure and more defiant with each day. Rionna worried that if things continued on their present course, Caelen would have a full-scale rebellion on his hands.</p> <p>She shivered and pulled away from the window. She didn\u2019t want Caelen to know she was observing. He had very distinct ideas on how he handled the men and he didn\u2019t brook any interference. \u2019Twas the truth she wanted to step in and soothe the warriors. Remind them of what they fought for. And Caelen likely knew how tempted she was because he headed her off by warning her that he\u2019d tolerate no intervention on her part.</p><p>She trudged back to the great hall and stood by the fire, smothering the yawn that overtook her. She was weary to her bones and it was God\u2019s truth she hadn\u2019t done much this day.</p><p>Malaise had gripped her for days and at first she\u2019d worried she was taking ill, but she suffered no malady other than fatigue. \u2019Twas the truth her husband interfered with her sleep with his insatiable demands. Demands she met with many of her own.</p><p>She woke every single morning before dawn to him deep inside her, possessing her with ruthless determination. Always he left her with a gentle kiss after taking her roughly, and then he\u2019d leave her to sleep when he departed the chamber.</p><p>They began the night with loving and they ended it thus.</p><p>She yawned again and wondered if she shouldn\u2019t take to her bed a little earlier this night in preparation for the vigorous bout of loving she knew they\u2019d indulge in. How Caelen met the daily demands of training and survived on so little sleep she\u2019d never know.</p><p>She stuck out her hands to the fire to ward off the chill that had set in deep and stared into the flames as her eyes grew heavier and heavier. \u2019Twas unlike her to be so listless.</p><p>She shook herself out of her fog when Gannon strode into the hall.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, Caelen is ready for your lesson. He says if you\u2019re wanting to practice, you\u2019re to hasten. He\u2019s only set aside an hour\u2019s time for you today while the men are breaking.\u201d</p><p>Rionna frowned. \u201cDoes he never plan to take a break?\u201d</p><p>Gannon looked at her oddly as if \u2019twas a ridiculous question, and she supposed it was. Caelen was inhuman in his stamina.</p><p>\u201cLet me fetch my sword,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch it for you, my lady. You go to Caelen.\u201d</p><p>Rionna murmured her thanks and then hurried toward the door. She stepped into the snow and grimaced. Caelen would lecture her about forgetting her cloak but \u2019twas much easier to spar without it.</p><p>He waited for her on the outer perimeter of the training area where they practiced every day. Rionna had never been tempted to beg off, but today she\u2019d give most anything to crawl into her bed and stay there the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>She refused to say a single word to Caelen. She\u2019d fought too hard to get him to agree to let her continue practicing with the sword. She\u2019d give him no reason to forbid her from it again.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sword?\u201d he asked impatiently.</p><p>His mood was black. He\u2019d be unrelenting today. She wanted to groan but bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cGannon is fetching it.\u201d</p><p>Caelen cast an impatient glance over his shoulder and then turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll practice hand to hand until he arrives. If you lose your sword in battle, you must rely on your wits and your hand-to-hand skills to remain alive.\u201d</p><p>She looked warily at the glint in his eye. He was spoiling for a fight today, but she didn\u2019t want to give him one. He\u2019d crush her like a bug.</p><p>She nearly wilted in relief when Gannon strode up and handed her the sword. Caelen looked faintly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t disappoint me today,\u201d Gannon muttered before he retreated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d Rionna said with heavy sarcasm.</p><p>As soon as her hand curled around the hilt, she let out a yell and charged. Surprise glinted in Caelen\u2019s eyes a mere second before blistering satisfaction set in.</p><p>He met her attack and she was jarred to her toes when she blocked his forceful swing. Her teeth threatened to vibrate right out of her head.</p><p>For several minutes they fought furiously, but her strength quickly flagged. Every movement was like slogging through mud and her arms grew heavier with each passing second.</p><p>She was forced back when he advanced, circling his sword around his head and cutting in a downward slash. She blocked and then took another step back as her sword dipped precariously.</p><p>The tip swung down and dug into the earth. Her vision blurred and she gripped the hilt with both hands and hung on to keep from falling. Caelen\u2019s look of surprise and then worry faded in and out of her sight as blackness crept in.</p><p>She sank to her knees, still gripping the sword, and then pitched sideways, hitting the snow as she lost consciousness.</p><p>Caelen reached her at the same time as Gannon. Both men went to their knees, and Caelen reached underneath her to pick her up before the dampness seeped into her clothing.</p><p>His heart thundered, pounding against his chest like a mace. Had he injured her? Had he in some way hit her with his sword? Surely he would have realized it.</p><p>He\u2019d lost his concentration at a time when he could least afford it. He was sparring with his wife, not a warrior of equal size and strength. He\u2019d been thinking of his difficulties with the men and how to remedy it, instead of taking care and ensuring that no harm came to his wife.</p><p>He gathered her close, holding her tightly to his chest, as he ran through the snow toward the entrance to the keep. He ignored the startled shouts around him and bounded up the stairs, Gannon hot on his heels.</p><p>He burst into his chamber and carefully laid Rionna on the bed. Then he began a thorough examination from head to toe, looking for any sign of injury. What he found baffled him.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a single mark on the lass. No blood. No bruises. No reason whatsoever for her to have lost consciousness.</p><p>It appeared that she had simply fainted. Was she ill?</p><p>\u201cSend for Sarah,\u201d Caelen ordered Gannon. \u201cAnd tell her to hurry.\u201d</p><p>When Gannon had gone, Caelen touched Rionna\u2019s pale cheek and cursed under his breath. He should have never allowed this foolishness.</p><p>\u201cRionna. Rionna, lass, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stir and he became even more worried. What if she were gravely ill? She was a stubborn lass. It would be just like her not to say anything.</p><p>He looked up in relief when he heard a noise in the hall. Sarah hurried in, followed by Neda, who served as their healer.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Laird?\u201d Neda asked.</p><p>Caelen stood so that the women could crowd in around Rionna to examine her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe were sparring and she fainted. I can find no sign of injury.\u201d</p><p>Sarah made a shooing gesture in Caelen\u2019s direction. \u201cWait in the hall, Laird. Give us some breathing room. We\u2019ll see to the lass. I suspect \u2019tis not a serious matter. She\u2019s been tired of late.\u201d</p><p>Caelen frowned and reluctantly allowed Gannon to herd him outside the chamber. He hadn\u2019t noticed that Rionna had been tired. Guilt crowded his mind. He woke her early each morn with his demands and kept her up late into the night. He hadn\u2019t considered the toll on her. She\u2019d become a need he couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>He woke beside her, needing her, wanting her so badly that \u2019twas no longer desire that motivated him. It was a bone-deep need to possess her, to imprint her on his skin.</p><p>And at the end of the day, he was eager and impatient to retire to their bedchamber where they took turns being the aggressor. His favorite times were when she climbed astride him, as determined to have him as he was her.</p><p>He was possessive, aye, but so was she. He\u2019d decided he liked it very much.</p><p>\u201cWhat can be keeping them?\u201d Caelen bit out as he paced back and forth in front of the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few moments,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the lass is fine. She might have a touch of upset. Perhaps \u2019twas something she ate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah said she\u2019d been tired of late. Why didn\u2019t I notice this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy training the men. It doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room to notice much else. She\u2019s a sturdy lass. I\u2019ve no doubt she\u2019ll be up and kicking your arse again in short order.\u201d</p><p>Caelen scowled and shook his head but before he could give voice to the fact that he had no intention of accommodating her swordplay any longer, the door opened and Sarah poked her head out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a word with you, Laird. Out here since the lass is awake now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Caelen demanded. \u201cI would see for myself.\u201d</p><p>Sarah held up a hand. \u201cNow don\u2019t go getting yourself worked up. The lass is fine. Nothing a little rest won\u2019t cure. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t know she was carrying.\u201d</p><p>Caelen gave her a blank look. \u201cCarrying what?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cA babe. She\u2019s pregnant she is.\u201d</p><p>Caelen stood there processing what Sarah had just related but he couldn\u2019t quite grasp it. Fury tightened his muscles and he shook his head at his wife\u2019s daring. Sarah obviously thought it an odd reaction to the news, but at the moment he didn\u2019t much care beyond the thought that he was going to blister his wife\u2019s ears just as soon as she\u2019d sufficiently recovered from her current weakness.</p><p>He turned to Gannon and pointed at the door. \u201cShe is not to leave this room for the remainder of the day, nor is she to rise from her bed. See to it.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stalked down the hallway. He had a sudden need to shed some blood. Whose wasn\u2019t of consequence. He\u2019d had enough of the McDonald men and their unseemly reluctance to put in the work required to shape them into a decent fighting force.</p><p>\u2019Twas a shame when their mistress was more of a man than they were.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>\u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t ever encourage gainsaying your husband, but the men think he has done something to harm you, lass, and \u2019tis the truth they\u2019re not happy over the prospect. If you don\u2019t make an appearance, the laird is likely going to have an unruly mob on his hands.\u201d</p><p>Rionna glanced up at Sarah and then pointedly over to where Gannon stood, arms crossed over his chest, as he listened to the conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah cast a look of exasperation in Gannon\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYou said he didn\u2019t take the news of the babe well,\u201d Rionna said, bringing Sarah back to the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cNow I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Sarah began.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t,\u201d Rionna persisted.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t rightly know what his reaction was. He ordered his man to make sure you didn\u2019t rise from bed or leave the chamber and then he stomped down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you find nothing unusual about such a reaction to siring a child?\u201d Rionna asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cGive the man time. \u2019Twas obvious was news he was unprepared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t any more prepared,\u201d Rionna muttered.</p><p>Sarah shook her head and muttered under her breath. She stood, shaking her head, and threw her arms up in agitation. \u201cThe two of you are dense. Why it should surprise either of you to find you are with child is a mystery to me. It\u2019s not as if you haven\u2019t worked hard enough at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rionna said defensively.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think a babe waits until his parents are ready?\u201d Sarah made a rude noise and continued shaking her head. \u201cYou have months yet to become ready. You\u2019ll get used to the idea quick enough. Be happy you haven\u2019t suffered from sickness. It would seem fatigue is your only symptom thus far.\u201d</p><p>Rionna wrinkled her nose. \u201c \u2019Tis likely now that I know I am carrying that I\u2019ll promptly be sick tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed. \u201cYou might at that, lass. The mind plays interesting tricks.\u201d</p><p>Rionna laid a hand over her still-flat belly and felt a tremor of uncertainty roll through her. She glanced up at Sarah. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not a fit mother?\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze softened and she sat on the bed next to Rionna. Then she glared up at Gannon and motioned him to go away. Gannon frowned but took his leave, though he made it clear he was standing guard outside the door.</p> <p>Then Sarah turned back to Rionna and took her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a wonderful mother, lass. You\u2019re fiercely loyal and protective of your people and those in need of protection. How could you be any less with your own bairn? You worry overmuch. After you\u2019ve had time to grow used to the idea, you\u2019ll find that all will be well.\u201d</p><p>Rionna heaved out a sigh. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. So far my husband doesn\u2019t seem thrilled with the idea of fatherhood, and yet he seemed eager enough to plant his seed. He boasted that I\u2019d deliver an heir within a year of our marriage. I guess he knew what he was about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird has a lot on his mind. His responsibilities are great right now. He\u2019ll come around. \u2019Tis likely a shock to him at the moment. You watch. He\u2019ll be boasting and spreading tales of his virility before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just seemed so ... angry,\u201d Rionna said softly.</p><p>Sarah shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over the shock of it soon enough. Now about the men ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I should reassure them that I am well and that Caelen hasn\u2019t murdered me. He\u2019s had enough trouble with them of late.\u201d Rionna sighed unhappily. \u201cI know not what is going on with my clan, Sarah. Only a few have given Caelen their loyalty and support. I know not what they wait for or why they hold back. Surely they cannot have been more content under my father\u2019s rule.\u201d</p><p>Sarah patted Rionna on the hand. \u201cSome men just don\u2019t like change. They don\u2019t like anything that isn\u2019t their idea. Having a new laird forced on them\u2014an outsider to our clan\u2014\u2019tis a hard thing for many of them to swallow. And \u2019tis pride that gets in their way, for the laird is pointing out their shortcomings and \u2019tis a humiliation to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me up and into a gown. \u2019Twill ease my husband\u2019s mood if he sees me in womanly apparel. Perhaps he\u2019ll not bellow at me too loudly for gainsaying his order to remain abed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it,\u201d Sarah said wryly. \u201c \u2019Tis enough if you soothe the men\u2019s worry that he\u2019s dispatched you and is even now having his man bury you.\u201d</p><p>Rionna rolled her eyes at the amusement in Sarah\u2019s voice and threw her legs over the side of the bed. A few moments later, she was attired in a gown of amber cloth with gold-colored threads. \u2019Twas the first time she\u2019d worn the gown since Sarah had sewn it for her. She\u2019d wanted to save it for a special occasion. Avoiding her husband\u2019s ire seemed good enough.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, lass. Already, carrying the babe has given you a softer glow about you.\u201d</p><p>Rionna paused on her way to the door and turned with a sigh. \u201cGannon.\u201d</p><p>Sarah frowned as if just remembering Caelen\u2019s commander herself. Then she shrugged. \u201c \u2019Tis unlikely he\u2019ll lay a hand on you. Oh he\u2019ll bluster and try to bar your way, but between the two of us we should be able to make him back down.\u201d</p><p>Rionna didn\u2019t have Sarah\u2019s confidence that Gannon wouldn\u2019t physically subdue her.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps \u2019twould be better if you called Gannon inside. I\u2019ll stand behind the door and when he comes in, I\u2019ll hurry out behind him.\u201d</p><p>Sarah chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve a devious mind, lass. \u2019Twill work if I inject enough panic into my cry. Take your position, but remember to be quick. He won\u2019t like our trickery.\u201d</p><p>Rionna gathered her skirts in her grip and then hastened to stand behind the door. Sarah positioned herself across the room and then cried Gannon\u2019s name.</p><p>Immediately the door burst open and Gannon ran inside the room. Not taking even a moment to see his reaction, Rionna grasped the door, darted around it, and ran down the stairs. His bellow of outrage followed her all the way down.</p><p>Urged on by the heavy tread of his footsteps on the stairs, she ran for the door leading out into the courtyard. She nearly slipped in the snow, righted herself, and ran toward her husband, whose back was to her.</p><p>But the men saw her. They lowered their swords in the midst of one of Caelen\u2019s instructions and stared curiously as she skidded to a stop just beyond Caelen\u2019s right elbow.</p><p>They glanced between her and Caelen, their expressions wary, and when he turned so that she could see his face, she knew why.</p><p>His expression was so coldly furious that she took a step back, her heart leaping into her throat. Gannon strode up behind her and suddenly she was pinned by two extremely angry warriors.</p><p>\u201cYou were not to allow her from her chamber,\u201d Caelen snapped at Gannon.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twas not his fault,\u201d Rionna said softly. \u201cSarah and I tricked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a deft hand at trickery, wife, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>His tone took her aback. Her mouth fell open at his accusation. She couldn\u2019t be sure exactly what he accused her of, but whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>Her chin went up a notch. \u201cI merely wanted to assure the men that I was well.\u201d</p><p>He gestured widely, his hand sweeping over the assembled warriors. \u201cAs they can see, you are hale and hearty, no thanks to your foolishness. Now if that is all, we\u2019ve training to finish.\u201d</p><p>Her chest clutched at his dismissive, caustic tone. \u201cMy foolishness? What is it you speak of, husband?\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward and stared down at her, his face so cold that she shivered. \u201cI will speak to you later, when I am not so gripped by anger. Until then, return to our chamber and do not leave it. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. She gaped incredulously at him. What on earth could she have done to anger him so?</p><p>She was sorely tempted to knee him in the cods and leave him writhing on the ground in agony. She pressed her lips into a thin line and sent him a stare that would wither a flower in full bloom.</p><p>She turned and when Gannon would have taken her arm, she jerked away and gave him an equally icy stare. Over her lifeless body would she obey her husband\u2019s dictate to wait in their chamber for him to take her apart for some imagined slight.</p><p>She stomped inside and went in search of Sarah. Caelen should be filled with joy. He was going to be a father. It had been his wish for his seed to bear fruit with all haste so as to further seal his leadership over his new clan.</p><p>Now the McCabes and the McDonalds would be joined by blood. Caelen had everything he wanted. Why then did he look upon her as though she\u2019d handed him the worst betrayal?</p><p>\u201cYou cannot avoid the laird forever,\u201d Sarah warned.</p><p>Rionna shot her a glare. \u201c \u2019Tis not avoiding as much as it is me not obeying his almighty dictate. He can go to the devil. And to think I wore a dress for him.\u201d She looked down in disgust at the beautiful amber gown that had a fair number of wrinkles in it now.</p><p>Sarah chuckled and resumed her knitting. The two women sat in Sarah\u2019s cottage as the fire blazed in the hearth. \u2019Twas past the hour of the evening meal but Rionna had eaten\u2014at Sarah\u2019s insistence\u2014in the quiet of Sarah\u2019s cottage.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t miss meals now, lass,\u201d she\u2019d cautioned Rionna. \u201c \u2019Tis likely what made you faint. You didn\u2019t break your fast and then you overexerted yourself.\u201d</p><p>Rionna had given in to Sarah\u2019s prodding and eaten a bowl of stew but she couldn\u2019t even remember the taste. The only thing firmly entrenched in her memory was her husband\u2019s furious expression. And his coldness to her. She had no explanation for it. One moment they were sparring, and aye, he\u2019d been in a black mood because of the men, but surely that couldn\u2019t be blamed for the horrible way he\u2019d reacted to her pregnancy. Was he really so angry because she was carrying? It made no sense. Not when her bearing an heir was of such import to the alliance between the McCabes and the McDonalds. Her babe could go a long way in mending the animosity the McDonald men currently bore Caelen.</p><p>\u201cI admit, I\u2019ll never understand the mind of a man,\u201d Rionna said with a sigh.</p><p>Sarah tsked under her breath. \u201c \u2019Tis good you learn that now, lass. \u2019Tis a foolhardy endeavor to even attempt such. The mind of a man changes on a daily basis and a woman is never sure which way it bends from one moment to the next. \u2019Tis why \u2019tis best to allow them to think they are the master of their domain and go quietly behind them and do things the way you like.\u201d</p><p>Rionna laughed. \u201cYou are a wise woman, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving outlived two husbands already, I\u2019ve gained more wisdom about men than a woman needs to know.\u201d She shrugged. \u201c \u2019Tis not hard once you\u2019ve learned they\u2019re mostly bluster and gruff. If you can look beyond that and ignore their bite, they\u2019re not hard to live with. You give them a little petting, stroke their pride a bit, and follow it with a kiss here and there, and they\u2019re well content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I used to think you were right,\u201d Rionna said as she stared into the flames. \u201cBut my husband ... \u2019tis disloyal of me to discuss him so, but he drives me daft. One moment he is as tender as a man can be and the next he\u2019s as cold as the winter\u2019s snow.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled. \u201cBecause he\u2019s not yet decided what he thinks of you, lass. You\u2019ve got him so flustered that he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming or going. He\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow typical that I must wait on him to make his mind up before we can be at peace,\u201d Rionna grumbled.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis hard to soothe a savage beast when you\u2019re here and he\u2019s there,\u201d Sarah pointed out.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis cold and I\u2019m not venturing out,\u201d Rionna grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is you\u2019re both as stubborn as an old mule. Neither of you will give an inch. \u2019Tis no way to make a success of a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I make a practice of yielding so easily, then I\u2019ll always be yielding and he\u2019ll never bend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what am I supposed to do?\u201d Rionna asked in exasperation.</p><p>Sarah chuckled. \u201cIf I knew that, no one would ever be discontent, now would they? I think \u2019tis something you\u2019ll have to muddle through on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Rionna said grudgingly. \u201cBut \u2019tis nothing I\u2019ll discover tonight. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd grumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, lass. Your husband will be looking for you soon enough and you\u2019ll not be getting to sleep then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not hide from him,\u201d Rionna vowed.</p><p>Sarah raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh? And what exactly do you call what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m defying his order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hiding while you do it,\u201d Sarah said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019ll not hide from him. \u2019Tis high time I discovered why it is he\u2019s angry.\u201d</p><p>Rionna stood, her fingers curling into fists.</p><p>\u201cYou be careful on the walk back, lass. \u2019Tis snowy and icy out tonight. The good Lord doesn\u2019t seem to be able to decide if he wants it to rain or snow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful, Sarah. Thank you for your company. And your counsel. \u2019Tis good sometimes to have someone to listen.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled. \u201cAye, lass, it is. Go now and make peace with the laird. \u2019Tis celebrating the two of you should be doing now.\u201d</p><p>Rionna said her farewells and hurried through the snow back to the keep. By the time she made it to the steps she was shivering, as a mixture of snow and rain drizzled down her neck.</p><p>She went inside, stomping her boots free of the ice and snow, and walked into the great hall to warm herself by the fire before going in search of her husband.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have to look far.</p><p>He was sitting at the table with Gannon and many of the McDonald warriors. When he saw her, he rose, his eyes narrowed and his lips set into a fine line. He crossed his arms over his chest and stared her down. The man hadn\u2019t even realized she hadn\u2019t obeyed his command to retire to their chamber. Had he planned to starve her to death?</p><p>Ignoring his less-than-pleased look, she marched over to the fire and stuck out her hands to warm them, presenting her back to the laird.</p><p>The more she gave thought to the matter, the more furious she became. She\u2019d done nothing to gain his ire. And if he wasn\u2019t happy about the babe, \u2019twas his own fault. He certainly hadn\u2019t done anything to prevent her becoming with child.</p><p>When she was sufficiently warmed, she turned without looking in her husband\u2019s direction and walked calmly toward the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cYou sorely try my patience, wife,\u201d Caelen called out.</p><p>She halted at that and slowly turned until she pinned him with a glare that hid none of her own mounting ire.</p><p>The men stared between their laird and Rionna with ill-disguised curiosity. It didn\u2019t suit Rionna to have it out with Caelen in such a public fashion, but she was just furious enough not to care.</p><p>\u201cAnd you try mine, husband. Perhaps when you\u2019ve figured out what it is that I\u2019ve done to displease you, you can let me know. Until then, I\u2019m going to bed. \u2019Tis been a most eventful day.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Rionna was shaking by the time she reached her chamber. It had taken all her courage to calmly walk out of the hall with Caelen\u2019s face a storm cloud of anger. \u2019Twas wrong of her to show such disrespect in front of the men, but \u2019twas just as wrong for him to air his grievance with her in front of others.</p> <p>She had no desire to remain in this chamber, or wait his convenience, stewing all the while she waited for him to make an appearance. But neither would she give the impression that she was hiding by retreating to her former chamber.</p><p>But \u2019twas God\u2019s truth all she really wanted was to be alone so she could sleep in peace. She was so weary and tense that she wanted to melt into her bed and remain there an entire day. And her head was beginning to throb.</p><p>She paced back and forth in front of the fire until she realized that he was going to make her wait. With an irritated sigh, she undressed and put her gown carefully away so that it wouldn\u2019t be ruined. \u2019Twas a beautiful gown and perhaps one day she\u2019d have a chance to wear it when it could be appreciated.</p><p>She was chilled in just her nightdress so she donned her cloak and curled into the chair by the fire. A bath would feel next to heaven, but \u2019twas late and she had no desire to be caught in the tub when her husband decided to make his appearance.</p><p>As warmth invaded her limbs, her eyelids grew heavier and heavier. By the time she heard Caelen\u2019s footsteps outside the door, she was so drowsy that she couldn\u2019t muster any outrage that he\u2019d taken so long to retire.</p><p>The door quietly opened and shut much the same. She didn\u2019t turn to greet him, opting to remain exactly where she was.</p><p>For several long moments, silence loomed in the chamber. Then finally his footsteps sounded again, closer this time, before he came to stand just behind her.</p><p>\u201cI have battled my anger all day today and yet I find I\u2019m as angry now as I was before.\u201d</p> <p>At that, Rionna turned in her chair, clutching her cloak tightly around her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what sin have I committed, husband? Are you so displeased at the thought of becoming a father? Did I misunderstand your boasts that I would deliver within a year of our marriage?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together and he stared at her in obvious consternation. \u201cThink you I\u2019m upset that you are pregnant with my child?\u201d</p><p>She stood, her cloak swirling around her legs. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing to make me think otherwise! From the moment you discovered that I was pregnant, you\u2019ve been coldly furious. I\u2019ve done nothing to gain your ire and yet you\u2019ve cut me to ribbons with your gaze at every turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing? God\u2019s teeth, woman, but you are a test of my endurance. You don\u2019t tell me that you are with child. At what point were you going to confide in me? When I held the point of my sword to your swollen belly? Or maybe when \u2019twas time for you to push the babe into the world?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open as she understood his meaning. \u201cYou think I purposely kept secret my condition? You think I would put our babe at risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were participating in activities no pregnant woman should ever be doing,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cYou had to know I would have never allowed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think so little of me that you think I would resort to subterfuge so that I could continue to indulge in training, never mind that I was pregnant with the next laird of my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not tell me then?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Tears of disappointment and frustration burned her eyelids. His opinion of her hurt. Did he truly believe she\u2019d be so selfish and foolhardy as to put her child at risk?</p><p>\u201cI did not know!\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI did not know until I awakened and Sarah told me. I would have told you. It would have given me great joy to do so.\u201d</p><p>Caelen looked shocked for a moment, as though he\u2019d given such a possibility no thought. \u201cJesu,\u201d he muttered. Then he ran a ragged hand through his hair and turned swiftly away. His hand fell to his side, curled into a tight fist. \u201cWhen I think of what could have happened, what almost did happen. When you fell, I thought I had hurt you. I could have harmed our child. I could have harmed you.\u201d</p><p>Realization was quick to dawn on Rionna. Her anger and hurt melted away and her heart throbbed a little harder. She crossed the distance between her and her husband and laid her hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou were afraid,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He jerked around, his eyes blazing. \u201cAfraid? I was bloody terrified! I carried you to our chamber sure that I would find some grievous wound. I looked for blood or a bruise, something to suggest that I had harmed you.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his waist and leaned her head against his chest. For the longest time he stood rigid in her arms, not returning her embrace. Then slowly, he circled her shoulders and crushed her to him.</p><p>He rested his cheek on the top of her head and held her so tightly that she could scarcely breathe. He trembled against her, and it awed her that this fierce warrior had been afraid. For her. That he shook with it. It shamed her that she\u2019d thought even for a moment that he didn\u2019t want their child, even if it was a logical conclusion at the time.</p><p>Now she wanted confirmation. She wanted to hear it from his own lips that he was joyous over her pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re happy about the babe?\u201d</p><p>Her question was muffled by his chest, but he went still and then slowly drew her away so that he looked down into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHappy? I think happy is too mundane a word. There are many words that accurately describe my reaction. Wonder. Aye, wonder. \u2019Tis not something I\u2019ve contemplated until recently, and even then I spoke as a man boasting to be boasting. It didn\u2019t really settle with me that I would become a father until Sarah bore the news to me in the hallway. The image hit me with force enough to stagger me. I had to quit the keep and go out alone lest I completely unman myself in front of others.\u201d</p><p>His fingers touched her cheek and grazed along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cFear. I was immediately filled with such fear like I\u2019ve never felt. Fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to protect our child from men like Duncan Cameron. That if we had a daughter she would be as Mairin had been for most of her life. Always hiding, always living in fear of discovery. Wary of being used by a man for what she could bring through the birth of a child.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to palm his cheek and he turned into her hand, brushing a kiss across her flesh.</p><p>\u201cAnd joy, Rionna. \u2019Tis God\u2019s truth I experienced a burst of joy that is indescribable. I imagined a daughter with your beauty and strength and a son with your spirit and stubbornness.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd you, husband? What think you that our children will inherit from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care not as long as they are healthy and that you deliver them free of complication.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I worried you. \u2019Tis the truth I didn\u2019t know I was with child, I swear it. I would have taken more care in our training.\u201d</p><p>He clutched her shoulders and pulled her away from him, his expression one of utmost seriousness. \u201cYou\u2019ll not lay hands on a sword again. \u2019Tis done with, this foolish idea of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Caelen, now that we know, we can fashion our sparring so that no harm is done to our child. \u2019Tis important I am able to protect myself and our child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will protect what is mine,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI will take no chances with your health or that of our child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201c \u2019Tis not up for debate. \u2019Tis my final word on the matter.\u201d</p><p>She sighed but couldn\u2019t bring herself to be irritated when she could still see the worry shadowed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow come here, wife. I have need to hold you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and went into his arms. He kissed her hungrily, framing her face and holding her in place as he ravaged her mouth.</p><p>He slid his hands down her body, coming to stop at her waist. Then he placed his palm over the flat of her belly through the folds of her cloak. Suddenly impatient, he pulled at the material until she was free of the garment and standing only in her nightdress. Then his hand returned to her stomach and he held it there as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy son or daughter,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019d not thought I\u2019d ever have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like the thought now?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh aye,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI find I like the idea very much. I owe you an apology, Rionna.\u201d</p><p>She put her finger to his lips and then followed it with a kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s been an eventful day for both of us. Perhaps \u2019twould be best if we go to bed and start fresh on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a very generous spirit, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something I want in return,\u201d she said as she slid one hand down to cup him intimately.</p><p>His eyes gleamed with quick understanding. \u201cOh? And what is that?\u201d</p><p>She continued to caress him through the material of his trews. \u201cA good husband would be mindful of his wife in her present condition. She needs lots of care and attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye, she does,\u201d Rionna whispered. \u201cLots of tender, loving handling by her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can accommodate her.\u201d</p><p>He bent and picked her up and walked to the bed where he lowered her onto the straw mattress.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I think I should give her lots of extra loving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, too,\u201d Rionna breathed.</p><p>He stood back and stripped off his clothing, and then he leaned over her and worked the gown over her head until she was naked and breathless beneath him.</p><p>For a long moment he simply stood over her and stared down at her body. Then he cupped both hands over her belly before kneeling on the floor in front of her. He parted his hands and then pressed a kiss to her stomach, so soft and tender that her heart felt near to bursting.</p><p>She smoothed her hands over his hair and then dug her fingers into his scalp, holding him against the very heart of her.</p><p>\u201cYou hold our future in your womb, lass,\u201d Caelen murmured against her belly. \u201c \u2019Tis what binds our two clans and makes them one.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis an important obligation you give our child.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again and then kissed a path down to the juncture of her legs. With gentle fingers, he parted her flesh and pressed his tongue to the sensitive flesh at her core.</p><p>She moaned softly and writhed beneath his mouth as he loved her with his lips and tongue. He was exceedingly patient, never tiring as he brought her wave after wave of pleasure.</p><p>He pushed her to the brink only to let up and let the tide slowly recede. Then he\u2019d work her back up again, each time more intense than the last.</p><p>He left her panting for breath and so tense that her muscles ached. She begged for him to stop and then for him never to stop. Her hoarse pleas rose, each one making less sense than the last.</p><p>Then his mouth left her and he fitted his cock to her opening and slid deep in one forceful lunge. His body blanketed hers, warming her to the bone. Never had she felt quite so safe, like nothing could ever hurt her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was inside her, not just physically, but in her heart and soul. He was all she could think of, all she could see and hear. He\u2019d spoken of her carrying their future, but he was her future. He was all she wanted. All she needed.</p><p>There was no sign of her rough, possessive lover this night. The man who\u2019d so ruthlessly taken her so many nights past had been replaced by a gentle warrior who treated her as though she were infinitely fragile, a priceless treasure to be cherished above all else.</p><p>He held her to him and stroked back and forth, gliding effortlessly through her damp heat. Through it all, his mouth never left her flesh. He kissed her lips, her cheeks, her eyelids, and then he nuzzled down to her ear and below to her neck.</p><p>Never had she been so thoroughly worshipped by a man, not even by her husband till now. He\u2019d loved her, aye. He\u2019d loved her as well as a man could ever love a wife, but there was a marked difference this night.</p> <p>Tonight ... \u2019twas as if he loved her with his heart instead of just his body. Tonight, she loved him not just with her body, but with her very soul.</p><p>When she cried out with her release, he held her against him, not taking his own until he\u2019d seen to her pleasure. Then and only then did he thrust deep and empty himself into her depths.</p><p>Afterward, she snuggled into his arms and laid her head on his shoulder. He was hard and sticky between her thighs, but she cared not. She didn\u2019t want to separate herself from him for the time it would take to cleanse them both.</p><p>She held him close until his breathing became deep and even. He was wholly relaxed against her, limp and sated and so very warm.</p><p>She sighed and stroked a hand over his shoulder, knowing he was already asleep.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, husband. \u2019Tis the truth I never expected to give you my heart. I know not if it\u2019s even what you want from me, but \u2019tis yours all the same. Someday ... Someday I\u2019ll have yours in return,\u201d she whispered against his skin.</p><p>She closed her eyes and settled against him, fatigue sliding over her skin like a blanket. Within moments she, too, slept.</p><p>Caelen lay in the dark, his arms tight around Rionna as she slept. Her words echoed in his ears, playing over and over again until he knew they were no trick of his hearing.</p><p>His wife loved him. He knew not what to make of this development. He\u2019d loved before and it had come to no good and yet he knew that love existed. He\u2019d seen it between his brothers and their wives. He knew his brothers loved their women with a ferocity uncommon to most marriages.</p><p>Love required sacrifice. It required trust and faith. It required making yourself completely vulnerable to the one you loved.</p><p>The thought sent a knot deep into his belly.</p> <p>The last time he\u2019d offered a woman his complete trust and faith, she\u2019d destroyed his clan.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>When Rionna woke the next morning, it was early still and the only light in the chamber came from the hearth and one lone candle on the wooden desk that housed Caelen\u2019s personal belongings. He sat in silence, quill in hand as he scratched ink onto one of his scrolls.</p><p>She watched, fascinated by the image he presented. His brow was creased in concentration and every once in awhile he dipped the quill back into the inkwell and then went back to his writings.</p><p>\u2019Twas the first time she\u2019d seen him using the scrolls, but now she wondered if he did so every morn before she woke. So many times she\u2019d awakened to him sliding deep into her body, but perhaps he tended to personal matters first.</p><p>She lay still, waiting for him to come to her, and took the opportunity to study her husband in secret.</p><p>He was such a handsome man. He had a ruggedness that appealed to every one of her feminine instincts. Strong. Scarred, not perfect. Perhaps that would be a strike against him with another woman, but not Rionna. Her warrior\u2019s heart embraced each mark as a badge of honor.</p><p>There was a slight ridge on his nose that suggested it had been broken in the past. But his face was otherwise unblemished, chiseled by strong cheekbones and a firm jaw. His pale green eyes mesmerized her. They were an odd shade shared by his two brothers, and Rionna imagined her own babe with the same green eyes.</p> <p>A lass with her father\u2019s dark hair and beautiful eyes. Rionna would need all of her fighting skills to keep the warriors from her daughter\u2019s doorstep.</p><p>She held her breath when Caelen put away his quill and carefully rolled the scroll closed. He stood and walked quietly over to the bed. Her entire body tingled in anticipation of his possession.</p><p>But instead of grasping her hips and pulling her to the edge of the bed, he leaned down and brushed his lips across her forehead, letting them linger just a moment before he backed away and silently left the room.</p><p>She stared after him, mystified and ... disappointed. Her entire body was on edge. A pulsing ache had begun deep at her center and now her husband was gone and she was lying, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>She let out a sigh and turned on her side to stare into the fire. Her gaze skirted over the writing table and the scrolls lying neatly to the side. What was it that Caelen wrote when he was alone with his thoughts?</p><p>Caelen stood before the assembled clan, Rionna at his side. He addressed them from the balcony that jutted over the courtyard. Men, women, and children had gathered to hear the laird\u2019s announcement and when he declared that Rionna was with child, the response was cheers from some and silence from others.</p><p>Simon and Arlen stepped forward, their swords thrust high in the air, but even their stamp of approval didn\u2019t sway many of the warriors.</p><p>Hugh stepped up beside Simon and Arlen and glanced back at his kin before turning and looking up where Caelen stood with Rionna.</p><p>\u201cWill the bairn be a McDonald or a McCabe?\u201d</p><p>Caelen frowned. \u201cA McCabe of course.\u201d</p><p>Scowls spread through the assembled clansmen and grumbles rose. Many turned their backs and walked away.</p><p>Rionna slid her hand into Caelen\u2019s. He could feel her tremble. He squeezed to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not tolerate disrespect toward my wife,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not Rionna we disrespect,\u201d one hollered up before also turning away.</p><p>Caelen\u2019s nostrils flared as he viewed the dismay on Rionna\u2019s face. He\u2019d had enough of his new clan and their animosity. \u2019Twas as if they wanted to be conquered and destroyed. He\u2019d never been so sorely tempted to take his wife and return to McCabe lands and let the lot of them rot.</p><p>It was time to take a much harder line. He\u2019d coddled them too long. They\u2019d either come around or they\u2019d leave.</p><p>Some of the joy had dimmed from Rionna\u2019s eyes as she watched her clan turn their backs on her. She stared for a long moment before Caelen gently guided her back inside the keep.</p><p>As soon as they walked in, Rionna tugged her hand from Caelen\u2019s and tossed up her hands in disgust. \u201cHow can they be so foolish? If Cameron marches on us tomorrow, we wouldn\u2019t have a chance. Our only hope is to hide behind a larger, stronger clan and allow them to do our fighting for us. \u2019Tis shameful. Never once have I been ashamed to call myself a McDonald, but today I weep over the disgrace.\u201d</p><p>Caelen touched her shoulder in an effort to offer comfort. She didn\u2019t need to be so distressed. Surely it couldn\u2019t be good for the baby.</p><p>It was hard to stand there and offer support when he was so furious he could barely see straight.</p><p>She wrung her hands and paced back and forth on the landing above the stairs. \u201cMaybe I should address them. I know you are against it, but perhaps I can make them see reason.\u201d</p><p>Caelen held up his hand and waited for her to go quiet. \u201c \u2019Tis not your place to command these men, Rionna. I am their laird and we will not be a clan until they accept that. I cannot make them embrace their duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not blame you if you took your leave of this place and returned to your family,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSurely the McCabes can make a more honorable alliance than with my clan.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and rested his chin atop her head. \u201cWe have time. Ewan will not make war when the winter is so harsh around us. I\u2019ll not quit my duty. \u2019Tis not just a matter of your clan and mine now. This is my son or daughter\u2019s future and I\u2019ll not walk away from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do then?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her away. \u201cI want you to remain indoors. \u2019Tis cold today and a storm is brewing to the north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cI have matters to attend to with the men.\u201d</p><p>Rionna looked fearful, but he wouldn\u2019t back down. Not even for her. \u2019Twas past time for him to beat some sense into his clansmen. Talking had done no good. Neither had explaining their inadequacies. \u2019Twas time to show them.</p><p>Leaving Rionna inside the keep, he strode out to the courtyard. \u201cAssemble the men,\u201d he said to Gannon. \u201cI want every one accounted for. If one refuses, use whatever force necessary. Spare them no humiliation. \u2019Tis time to stop this senseless coddling.\u201d</p><p>Gannon\u2019s mouth twisted into a savage smile of satisfaction. \u201c \u2019Tis about bloody time.\u201d He drew his sword and stalked away, shouting the order to assemble once again.</p><p>Caelen stood in the middle of the courtyard as the men gathered round, their expressions rife with speculation. He stared them down, his gaze stony and unyielding.</p><p>When Gannon gestured to him that the last man had assembled, Caelen drew his sword and leveled the point toward the crowd and turned so they were all included in his gesture.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis time to make a choice. If you are with me and accept me as your laird, you will step forward, make your pledge, and swear your allegiance. If you are nay accepting of me as your laird, then step forward with your challenge. If you are able to best me in battle, I\u2019ll leave McDonald land and never return.\u201d</p><p>A series of guffaws and sounds of disbelief spread through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou intend to challenge us all?\u201d</p><p>The jeer came from the crowd.</p><p>Caelen\u2019s lip curled into a snarl. \u201cI intend to show you that one McCabe warrior is worth a hundred of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that challenge,\u201d Jamie McDonald said as he stepped forward.</p><p>He was a cocky lad, still afflicted by a brush of youth. He hadn\u2019t yet proved himself a man, and Caelen shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting easy on me, I see.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face flushed a dull red, and before Caelen could draw his sword the boy ran at him with a yell. Caelen dodged the clumsy charge, drew his sword, and brought his fist down on the boy\u2019s head as he stumbled past. The lad went sprawling, his sword flying several feet in the other direction.</p><p>Caelen shook his head in disgust. \u201cNo restraint. My wife wields a sword a hundred times better.\u201d</p><p>Jamie picked himself up, his face a tight knot of fury at the insult.</p><p>\u201cHard to fight without a sword,\u201d Gannon drawled. He bent to retrieve the weapon and then tossed it to the side. \u201cStand aside, lad. You\u2019ve been bested already.\u201d</p><p>As the afternoon wore on, the swords piled higher, with Gannon tossing aside one after another. As Caelen dispatched the men, they were directed to sit to the side and watch as the next clansmen took up the charge.</p><p>\u2019Twas obvious the more skilled warriors waited until last, when Caelen was tiring. It took him longer than he had liked to dispatch Oren McDonald, and the man actually managed to stagger Caelen before Caelen sent his sword flying toward the discard pile.</p><p>When the next McDonald stepped forward, Caelen issued a silent groan. \u2019Twas Seamus McDonald, and he was a mountain of a man. Heavily muscled with legs and arms like tree trunks, a chest as broad as a boulder, and no neck to speak of.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t terribly adept with a sword, but he could smash a man with his bare hands.</p><p>Sensing Caelen\u2019s dismay, the McDonalds who were sitting surged to their feet and let out raucous cheers as Seamus and Caelen circled each other.</p><p>Seamus thrust first and Caelen blocked it. The clash of steel rang out over the courtyard and more cheers went up.</p><p>On the perimeter, the women had gathered as well as the older men who no longer acted as soldiers. The children were even present and a chant of \u201cSeamus! Seamus! Seamus!\u201d went up on all sides.</p><p>Except one.</p><p>Amidst the noise and chanting came a clear call of \u201cCaelen! Caelen! Caelen!\u201d</p><p>His wife had pushed her way through the crowd and stood just on the outside of the fighting circle. To his eternal surprise she wore no man\u2019s garb nor did she wield a sword. She was adorned in her wedding finery and her hair was upswept into an elegant knot, with tendrils escaping on all sides.</p><p>She was so damn beautiful she took his breath away.</p><p>Right before Seamus plowed into him, taking his breath away, and not in the metaphorical sense.</p><p>The two men hit the ground and rolled. Caelen was at a decided disadvantage the moment his sword was knocked from his hand. Seamus was larger by half and he hadn\u2019t had to fight every other McDonald warrior already.</p><p>Seamus landed a beefy fist to the side of Caelen\u2019s face and Caelen\u2019s vision blurred. Colorful spots appeared before his eyes and he shook his head to clear his rattled brain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caelen punched and then followed with another forceful punch with his left hand. He\u2019d always been equally adept with either hand, not favoring one over the other as so many men did, but Seamus wasn\u2019t fazed by either blow.</p><p>It soon became obvious after the third time Caelen picked himself up off the ground that direct methods weren\u2019t going to work. Seamus was inhuman. He wasn\u2019t fast. He lacked finesse, but what he possessed was brute strength and an ability to withstand any blow delivered. Caelen needed fifty more where he came from, and then maybe they\u2019d stand a chance against Cameron.</p><p>Caelen wiped the blood from his mouth and circled Seamus, looking for his opportunity. Quickness would be a decided advantage if Caelen weren\u2019t ready to fall over from exhaustion. The fight with the other McDonalds had taken its toll. While he\u2019d dispatched each of them easily enough, no man could take on an entire army and come out victorious. But he was determined to give it his best try. Everything rode on this victory. The McDonalds hadn\u2019t played fair by holding back their best man until Caelen was worn down and near defeat, but a wager was a wager and if Caelen lost, he\u2019d be forced to step aside as laird and return home a failure.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath. Failure wasn\u2019t an option he would entertain.</p> <p>He glanced at Rionna and saw the fire in her eyes. She urged him on with her gaze, infusing much needed strength into his muscles.</p><p>Drawing on reserves he didn\u2019t think he had and bolstered by Rionna\u2019s absolute faith that he\u2019d win the day, he quickened his step and danced around Seamus until the larger man was looking left and right to keep pace with Caelen\u2019s movements.</p><p>As soon as Seamus presented his back, Caelen leaped. He wrapped his arms around Seamus\u2019s neck and held on with all his strength.</p><p>Seamus let out a roar to rival a wild beast and began to shake to and fro. When he didn\u2019t loosen Caelen\u2019s hold, he turned and ran toward the walls of the keep, Caelen holding on the entire way. At the last moment, Seamus turned and bashed Caelen into the wall.</p><p>Caelen grunted in pain but didn\u2019t give even an inch. He dug his forearm into the front of Seamus\u2019s throat and squeezed tighter until he felt the man begin to tremble and fight to draw breath.</p> <p>Seamus threw himself into the wall again, trying to shake Caelen loose. But Caelen sensed victory now and strength flooded his veins.</p><p>Seamus grabbed at Caelen\u2019s arms and tried to pry them loose. He staggered back toward the circle and then went down on one knee.</p><p>\u201cDo you yield?\u201d Caelen rasped out.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Seamus roared.</p><p>Caelen jerked his arm and tightened his hold.</p><p>Seamus went down to both knees and hunched over, Caelen still atop his back like a burr. Then Seamus simply pitched forward and landed with a thump on the ground.</p> <p>Caelen pried his arms from beneath the fallen man and stood, dusting the snow from his tunic. The McDonald warriors stared with open mouths at Seamus, who was soundly unconscious on the ground. Then they lifted their gazes to Caelen, who regarded them with arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll ask again. Who is with me?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence before one stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cI am, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Another moved from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAnd me, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the entire crowd rumbled with agreement. The cries of \u201cAye!\u201d echoed across the courtyard until the sound nearly deafened him.</p> <p>Gannon came to stand beside Caelen, his grin wide as he clapped Caelen on the shoulder. But Caelen turned, looking for his wife in the madness.</p><p>She stood to the side, her smile as bright as the sun. She held up a fist and then pointed directly at Caelen. He motioned her over, suddenly eager to have her near.</p><p>She came at once, her skirts swinging as she made her way through the crowd. The men were solicitous of her, stepping out of her way. Some even offered their hand as she picked her way across the snow. Still others called for her to have caution now that she carried a babe.</p><p>She stopped in front of Caelen, her smile still wide and beautiful. Then she lifted her finger to wipe the blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou bleed, husband.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him, slid his hand behind her neck, and pressed his bloody mouth to hers. Around them, a roar went up and finally, finally, the McDonalds decided they had something to celebrate.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>\u201cThe men improve,\u201d Sarah said as she and Rionna watched from the balcony above the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cAye, they do. They have dedication now. \u2019Tis good, for the time to fight draws near.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed the slight swell of her belly as she spoke. Battle was inevitable, but it troubled her still. She worried for Caelen, for her clan, for Caelen\u2019s family. She worried for the future of her babe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning, lass. Are you feeling poorly? Perhaps you should lie down a spell and rest.\u201d</p><p>Rionna shook her head. Caelen worried endlessly and fussed over her night and day. He\u2019d undertaken the task of ensuring that she rested and never lifted a finger so as not to overexert herself. Unfortunately, his obsession had bled over to Sarah as well.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Sarah, did you rest endlessly when you were pregnant with your bairns?\u201d</p><p>Sarah frowned. \u201cThere was work to be done, lass. Of course I didn\u2019t lay around.\u201d</p><p>Then as if realizing what she\u2019d said, she scowled and leveled a stare at Rionna.</p><p>\u201cI was not pregnant with the next laird nor was I a slight lass like yourself. Your husband worries. You should accommodate his request that you be at ease during your confinement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfinement is right,\u201d Rionna muttered. \u201c \u2019Tis most ridiculous. You are right about one thing. There is work to be done and we need all the hands we can manage and yet I\u2019m pushed aside and told to rest. It makes no sense. I am healthy. I haven\u2019t even been ill, not one day. The tiredness left me after my third month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird is a determined man. It won\u2019t be me who goes against his decree. The whole clan knows of his wishes for you, lass, so it\u2019s not just me who\u2019ll be reminding you of your duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t have something to do soon, I\u2019ll go daft. I cannot stay inside the keep day after day moving from one chair to the next. I\u2019ll grow fat and lazy and then what will happen? Caelen will set me aside for a prettier, fitter wife.\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed. \u201cCome now, lass, you won\u2019t be pregnant forever.\u201d</p><p>Caelen paused in his training and looked up as if knowing he\u2019d find Rionna there watching. A slight smile lifted his lips and he nodded his acknowledgment to her. It gave her a ridiculous thrill every time he looked her way. Even though she despaired of the fact that he was oversolicitous, at the same time, she took great joy in the fact that he was so mindful of her well-being.</p><p>He may not admit that he had any soft feelings for her, but \u2019twas obvious he hadn\u2019t hardened his heart to her.</p><p>\u201cSoon you\u2019ll give me the words I want, husband,\u201d she whispered fiercely.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you say, lass?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis nothing. I was but talking to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome away. \u2019Tis starting to snow.\u201d</p><p>Rionna allowed Sarah to pull her back inside the keep and the two women walked down to the great hall so Rionna could warm herself by the fire.</p><p>Despite Rionna\u2019s earlier misgivings about learning the managing of the keep, after Caelen\u2019s insistence that she remain inside, she had decided she needed something to occupy her time, so many a day had been spent by the fire as Sarah went over Rionna\u2019s duties as mistress.</p><p>As Rionna stood by the fire, her mind wandered, as it often did when she was left alone with her thoughts. One of her duties as mistress was to ensure the comfort of her husband and to see to his care as surely as he did to hers.</p><p>Of late, he\u2019d fussed endlessly over her. He pampered her and coddled her until she was positive she was going to be thoroughly spoiled by the process of bearing a child. Perhaps \u2019twas his aim in order to gain her agreement to have more in the future.</p><p>She smiled at the thought. He wouldn\u2019t have to do much convincing.</p><p>Still, it only seemed fair that she reciprocate.</p><p>Deciding that an evening of pampering was in order for her husband, she had one of the large tubs delivered to her chamber and directed the women to be on standby with buckets of hot water when her husband retired to their chamber.</p><p>She laid out the plain soaps that had no scent and made sure she had clean bathing cloths. She bade Gannon to carry up wood since Caelen would suffer apoplexy if she were to do it herself. Then she laid a fire in the hearth and called for a flagon of ale and the evening meal to be served in their chamber.</p><p>Satisfied with her effort, she surveyed her handiwork and then went below stairs to await her husband\u2019s arrival from the courtyard.</p><p>She fidgeted and paced while she waited. Finally, an hour later, the men began to filter into the hall, all ready for the evening meal. As soon as Caelen made his appearance, she hastened to greet him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arranged our meal to be served in our chamber,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cCome above stairs so that I may attend you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look but allowed her to lead him toward the stairs. They were nearly run over by the women scurrying out of the chamber, buckets in hand, as they went below to fetch more hot water.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about, wife?\u201d he asked when she sat him by the fire.</p><p>She pulled at his boots as he regarded her with lazy amusement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arranged for a hot bath followed by a hot meal. \u2019Twill soothe your aches and warm you through.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one eyebrow as she tugged one boot free of his foot. \u201cWhat is the occasion?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and began work on the other boot. \u201c \u2019Tis no special occasion.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded and Rionna gave the call to enter. Four women came in bearing more water and added it to the already steaming tub. As the women left, Rionna trailed her fingers over the surface.</p><p>\u201cI think \u2019tis ready.\u201d</p><p>When Caelen would have begun undressing himself, she put her hand on his arm to stop him. Then she began pulling his clothing down until he was nude before her. She took his hand and guided him toward the tub. He stepped over the side and groaned softly as he sank into the hot water.</p><p>She let him sit there a moment with his eyes closed before she collected the washing cloth and soap and knelt by the tub. He opened his eyes to look at her as she pressed the cloth to his chest and began to wash.</p><p>\u201cI am unsure of what I\u2019ve done to deserve such attention, but you\u2019ll not hear a single complaint cross my lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been working tirelessly without rest for weeks now,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve insisted on my resting, but not your own. You indulge me and pamper me and yet no one does the same for you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a warrior, Rionna. No one pampers warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wife does,\u201d she defended. \u201cAn evening where you are waited on hand and foot will do you good.\u201d</p><p>She began washing his back in lazy, sensual strokes. His muscles rippled underneath her touch and his breath caught and expelled in a jerky rush.</p><p>\u201cI think you may just be right about that. I rather like the idea of my wife serving me in the privacy of our chamber. It opens up a lot of colorful possibilities.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and silenced him with a kiss. She dipped her hand into the water and trailed her fingers down his belly to his cock. Gently she rubbed up and down over his hardness.</p><p>\u201cI must be sure to clean everywhere,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh aye, you mustn\u2019t miss a single spot,\u201d he murmured back as he nibbled at her lips.</p><p>She leaned back and then went to collect the heavy pitcher from the washbasin. After directing him to scoot forward in the tub, she began to wash his hair.</p><p>She loved running her fingers through the long strands. She soaped and rinsed and dug her fingers through the thick pelt, massaging and stroking as she sought to give him comfort.</p><p>\u201cYour hands are magic, lass,\u201d he murmured. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019ve never had so much pleasure from something so simple as a washing of the hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you stand by the fire, I\u2019ll dry you,\u201d she said as she rocked back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not have to ask me twice if I want another opportunity for your hands on my body.\u201d</p><p>He stood, and water ran down his back, over his firm buttocks, and down his legs. He stepped from the tub and then turned to face her, his back to the fire. Her gaze was riveted to his body. Were she ninety, she\u2019d never grow tired of looking at this man. He fascinated her. He appealed to her feminine senses in a way a man had never before appealed to her.</p><p>\u201cIf you continue looking at me so, you\u2019ll find yourself on your back with me between your thighs,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She grinned then and stepped forward to began wiping the moisture from his body. She rose up on tiptoe to gather the strands of his hair and squeeze excess water away. When his hair no longer dripped, she began to rub down the rest of his body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2019Twas the truth she had every intention of pampering her husband this night, but she was so enjoying the experience herself that she felt guilty over the pleasure it brought her.</p><p>With his chest and arms now dry, she dropped to her knees to rub his hips, thighs, and lower legs. For now she avoided his groin, wanting to draw out that particular form of torture.</p><p>Then she rose up on her knees so that her mouth was mere inches from his swollen cock. \u201cTell me husband, will you be too weak to partake of your evening meal if I pleasure you now?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered at her mischievous teasing. He slid his fingers through her hair and pulled her roughly forward until the tip of his erection rested against her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage somehow.\u201d</p><p>Knowing what the image of her on her knees while he stood over her would do to him, she slid her mouth over his hardness and took him deep.</p><p>\u201cAh, lass,\u201d he moaned. \u201cYour mouth is the sweetest pleasure I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled into her hair and then he loosened his hold as if worried he\u2019d hurt her with his urgency. Then he tightened his grip again when she swallowed against the head.</p><p>This time she\u2019d not draw out his pleasure. She intended it to be quick and sharp, a precursor of what was to come.</p><p>She curled her hand around the base of his shaft and stroked down as she sucked down to the tip. Then she tightened her fingers and stroked back up as she swallowed him whole once more.</p><p>Over and over she took him hard and fast until he went up on tiptoe, straining to go deeper. He tried to pull away when \u2019twas obvious he was about to gain his release, but she resisted and took him to the back of her throat, holding him captive there until with a harsh shout he poured himself into her mouth.</p><p>She continued to slide her tongue and lips over his length until finally he framed her face in his hands and pulled gently from her grasp. He reached down to help her to her feet and pulled her close when she stumbled. After a moment she pulled away and offered him his trews.</p><p>\u201cCome to the bed so that I may brush your hair,\u201d she said as he reclothed himself. \u201cOur food will be here soon and then you can eat.\u201d</p><p>She perched on the edge of the bed, and he sat on the floor between her knees while she brushed the tangles from his hair. After awhile she put aside the brush and pulled her fingers through the strands, enjoying the feel against her skin.</p><p>He reached up and caught one of her hands and brought it around to his mouth. He kissed her palm and then turned it over to press a kiss to each of her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhat prompted this display of affection, wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did advise me that such displays were not appropriate in front of the men,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>He gave a shout of laughter. \u201cI\u2019d hope not, lass. Not that I don\u2019t love the sight of you with your lips wrapped around my cock, but \u2019twould incite a riot among my men. \u2019Tis best if we keep such matters private.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and leaned forward to hug him. She kissed his temple and then released him when a knock sounded at the door. \u201cThat will be Sarah with our evening meal. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll return in a moment.\u201d</p><p>She made Sarah wait in the hall and returned a few times to bear in the food. When she had everything, she dismissed Sarah and closed the door.</p><p>First she poured Caelen a goblet of ale and handed it to him. He watched her all the while she prepared a plate. His gaze was intense and possessive, like he\u2019d love nothing more than to strip her down and take her there on the floor.</p><p>\u2019Twas the truth, she\u2019d love nothing more as well, but there was food to be had and her husband was likely starving.</p><p>She curled up beside him on the floor, shivering softly. Her clothing was slightly damp from attending to Caelen\u2019s bath. Her husband frowned and put his hand out to touch the sleeves of her gown.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold. And wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, \u2019tis not of import.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shivering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire will warm me soon enough.\u201d</p><p>He took the plate from her and set it on the bed. Then he got to his feet and pulled her up beside him. In a reversal of roles for the evening, he divested her of her gown and then removed her underdress, leaving her naked to his avid gaze.</p><p>\u201cYour skin glows so warmly in the light of the fire,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI think \u2019tis the way I\u2019d like you to remain for the evening.\u201d</p><p>He settled back on the floor but instead of allowing her to sit beside him as she had before, he pulled her down so that she straddled his lap.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis too cold on the floor. You\u2019ll sit here on me so you\u2019ll not be cold.\u201d</p><p>He touched the tiny swell of her belly and then laid his palm over it. \u201cHow is our child this day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not felt him move yet, but I think \u2019twill be soon. I\u2019m small and Sarah says I\u2019ll feel him move sooner because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not too small,\u201d Caelen said with a frown. \u201c \u2019Tis God\u2019s truth you don\u2019t look big enough to push out a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She reached beyond him for the plate of meat, cheese, and bread. She set it on the floor next to them and picked up a piece of the meat.</p><p>She offered it to him from her hand. His mouth brushed over her fingers as he ate the offering.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the sweetest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten,\u201d he said in a husky voice. \u201cOffered from the hand of a naked goddess while she sits astride me. \u2019Tis heaven I\u2019ve gone to.\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to lean forward and kiss him long and hard, but she\u2019d kept him from his meal long enough. Alternating between the meat, cheese, and bread, she broke off smaller pieces and fed him with her fingers.</p><p>He made it difficult because all the while she tended his meal, he stroked his hands over her skin. He caressed her shoulders, her back, and then he moved around to cup her ample breasts, thumbing each nipple in turn until she was fidgeting all over his lap.</p><p>\u201cI should warn you that when this seduction of yours is at its end, I\u2019ll not last long. I mean to have you lass, but I\u2019m so eager, I\u2019ll spill my seed at the first thrust.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTonight is about your pleasure, husband. I am yours to do with as you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen free me of my trews right here so I can rest deep inside you. I\u2019m thinking of making it a rule that when you sit on my lap, you must rest atop my cock.\u201d</p><p>She pulled impatiently at his trews, for his words licked like fire over her body and she was as eager as he was to have him inside her.</p><p>She arched up as soon as he sprang free. He gripped her hips and guided her into place and then sank deep. They both made inarticulate sounds of pleasure. When she would have moved, he anchored her tight against him so that no space separated them.</p><p>\u201cRight there, lass. Don\u2019t move. Now feed me the rest of my meal.\u201d</p><p>Each time she moved to pick up a piece of bread or cheese from the plate, she clenched tighter around him and he swelled even larger until she was impossibly stretched.</p><p>\u201cYou clutch me like a velvet fist,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>He ran his hands up her arms and gripped her just below the shoulders. She dropped the last piece of bread when he fused his mouth to hers as if he hadn\u2019t just eaten his fill and was starving. For her.</p><p>The flats of his palms glided down her arms and then over her hips, where they came to rest. His fingers dug into her buttocks and he lifted her as he arched upward.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis too good,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cI can\u2019t make it last.\u201d</p><p>He thrust hard and she was filled by his warmth. He held her tightly to his groin as he pulsed inside her sheath. Then his hands left her hips and he pulled her against his chest, his hands stroking up and down her spine.</p><p>For several long moments he continued his gentle caresses as he softened inside her. Impossibly, he wrapped one arm around her and put his other hand to the floor to push himself upward.</p><p>He slipped from her body as he stood, but he continued to hold her as he turned toward the bed, the tub and the food forgotten.</p><p>He laid her down and crawled into bed beside her, pulling her against his body. They sprawled there on the mattress, limbs tangled, arms thrown possessively over each other. He kissed her forehead and sighed in contentment. She savored the sound of a well-pleasured man and smiled her satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI am unsure what warranted such affection from my wife, but do tell me so that I may do it again in the future,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>She squeezed him and kissed the hollow of his neck. Then she toyed idly with his hair, suddenly possessed to want to know more of her husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you write in your scrolls?\u201d</p><p>He drew away, seemingly surprised by the question. He looked faintly ... embarrassed, and she wondered if she hadn\u2019t been better served to not spoil the intimate moment between them.</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIt helps me make better sense of them when I write them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like an accounting of your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking. I find I express myself better with written words. I haven\u2019t an eloquent tongue and I don\u2019t like to speak overmuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Surely you jest,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He smacked her playfully on the arse. \u201c \u2019Tis something I\u2019ve done since I learned to read and write when I was a young lad. My father was a learned man and he taught his sons. He thought it an important skill. He oft said that intelligence served a warrior better than a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounded like a wise man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Caelen said quietly. \u201cHe was a great laird, beloved by his clan.\u201d</p><p>Rionna looked into her husband\u2019s eyes and knew that demons from his past gnawed at him this night. She sorely regretted making him think of his father, for \u2019twas impossible to separate his death and Elsepeth\u2019s betrayal. But at the same time, she wanted to know more and perhaps ease her husband\u2019s burden.</p><p>\u201cTell me of Elsepeth,\u201d she urged.</p><p>Caelen stiffened and his expression darkened. \u201c \u2019Tis nothing to speak of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would disagree. She\u2019s made you hard. She\u2019s taken something that should be rightfully mine.\u201d</p><p>Caelen looked at her in confusion. \u201cWhat is it you speak of?\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cYour heart. You cannot ever give it fully to me because she still occupies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he swiftly denied.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she argued. \u201cYou hardened the part of your heart that you offered to her. When she betrayed you, you locked that part away, never to open it again. She\u2019s trapped there. She has what is rightfully mine and I want it, husband. I\u2019m no longer content to wait.\u201d</p><p>He looked incredulously at her. \u201cYou make unreasonable demands, wife.\u201d</p><p>Rionna huffed impatiently. \u201c \u2019Tis unreasonable to want the whole of my husband\u2019s heart? Would you accept that part of my heart belonged to another man and you could never touch it?\u201d</p><p>He scowled at that. \u201cYou\u2019re making too much of it, Rionna. Elsepeth is part of my past. You are my future. The two have nothing to do with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me of her,\u201d Rionna challenged. \u201cIf she poses no threat, then \u2019tis nothing to speak of her.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sighed and ran his hand through his hair in frustration. He rolled to his back and stared up at the ceiling. Rionna remained still, waiting as he grappled with his irritation.</p><p>\u201cI was a fool.\u201d</p><p>Rionna didn\u2019t respond as she watched the emotion play out over her husband\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t believe for a minute he still harbored tender feelings for Elsepeth, but his past was still very much alive in his heart and mind. \u2019Twas like a poison he\u2019d yet to purge from his system.</p><p>She could still see the naked pain in his eyes and his regret at all that had transpired so many years ago.</p><p>\u201cShe was a few years older than I and she had more experience. I was but a young lad and she was my first ... She was my first lover. I fancied myself in love with her. I had our future all mapped out. I intended to marry her, though I had nothing in the way to offer a wife. I was the third son of a laird. We weren\u2019t a poor clan then but we were never rich either. \u2019Twas my intention to go to her cousin, Duncan Cameron, and ask for her hand in marriage.\u201d</p><p>Rionna grimaced, for even though she knew the tale, or the crux of it, the inevitable path still made her cringe.</p><p>\u201cMy father sent me, Ewan, and Alaric to barter with a neighboring clan. While we were gone, Elsepeth drugged the men and opened the gates so Cameron\u2019s soldiers could sneak into the keep in the dead of night. \u2019Twas a bloodbath. Our clan was sorely outnumbered and \u2019twas the truth we were not as well trained then as we are now. We didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>\u201cWhen my brothers and I returned, we found our father dead. Ewan\u2019s young wife had been raped and her throat cut. Only his son survived because he was hidden by women in the keep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe remaining members of our clan told me of Elsepeth\u2019s involvement, but my shame doesn\u2019t end there.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe them,\u201d he said in disgust. \u201cI was presented solid evidence that my head knew had to be true but my heart told me she couldn\u2019t have possibly betrayed me. I searched her out, determined to hear her explanation from her own lips. I was sure there had been some mistake.\u201d</p><p>Rionna winced and blew out her breath. This part of the story she hadn\u2019t heard before.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I confronted her, she laughed. She didn\u2019t try to make up a lie. She laughed to my face and when I turned away, she drew a knife and plunged it into my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scar above your side,\u201d Rionna whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye. \u2019Tis not a mark I wear with pride. \u2019Tis a reminder of how I allowed a woman I cared for to destroy my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I care not. One day she\u2019ll pay for her sins, just as I\u2019ll pay for mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve made good on your mistakes?\u201d Rionna asked. \u201cYour clan is rebuilt, your people thrive, you\u2019ve made an alliance that will save many from Cameron\u2019s ruthless ambition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I do will ever give me and my brothers back our father,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI learned a valuable lesson that day. One I\u2019ll never turn my back on. I allowed my heart to discount evidence that my mind knew was sound. I\u2019ll never second-guess what stares me in the face again.\u201d</p><p>Rionna frowned and slid her hand over his chest as she snuggled into his side. He sounded so ... cold. Not at all the warm, gruff warrior that she\u2019d grown to love with all her heart.</p><p>For the first time she wondered if Elsepeth had damaged a part of him that Rionna had no hope of repairing.</p><p>Caelen closed his hand over hers and squeezed as they lay in silence. She thought on all he\u2019d said and the more she thought on it, the more one thing didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cCaelen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did Cameron attack? What was his purpose? He didn\u2019t take over your land. He left it in ruins and returned to his own lands.\u201d</p><p>Caelen\u2019s chest heaved as he breathed deep. \u201cI don\u2019t know that. I\u2019ve never known. \u2019Twas as if he was sending a message, but \u2019tis one I\u2019ve never understood the meaning of. We were a clan at peace. We warred with no one. My father was not a man who condoned raiding or fighting for the sake of fighting. It sickens me that he met the end he met when he never brought harm to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Rionna rose up on one elbow so that she could stare down at her husband. It suddenly seemed all important that she say what it was that burned on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Elsepeth, Caelen. I need you to know that. I\u2019ll not ever betray you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a long moment before pulling her down for a kiss. \u201cAye, I know it, Rionna.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>May saw no break in the weather. Indeed, it was as if winter was making up for the mildness of January by stubbornly clinging on to spring.</p> <p>Their food stores were depleted and the men hadn\u2019t been able to hunt in an entire fortnight because of the heavy, blowing snow.</p><p>Everyone was forced indoors, hovering near the fires to keep warm. Caelen stewed with impatience, waiting a break in the weather and waiting for word from Ewan.</p><p>At the end of the third week of the month, the break finally came. A messenger arrived bearing news from Ewan that all was well at Neamh \u00c1lainn and that plans were underway to go into battle. Ewan was even now sending word to all the other lairds. The king had delivered to Ewan a contingent of soldiers, all loyal to the crown.</p><p>Much time had been lost due to the prolonged snows and bitter cold. Now Ewan was impatient to go to war, and he directed Caelen to make ready and await Ewan\u2019s summons.</p><p>Despite the fact that she knew this day was coming, Rionna was disturbed by the news. She had no desire to send her husband or her clan to war, but she bit her lip and kept her misgivings to herself. She wouldn\u2019t burden her husband when his mind was already looking ahead to the coming battle.</p><p>He was restless, and as the days wore on he became tense and silent. Finally, when they were distributing the last of the venison, Caelen rounded up his hunting party and declared that they\u2019d hunt as much meat as possible in the short time before they rode off to war.</p><p>Caelen\u2019s restlessness had carried over to the men, and a hunt was just the thing to quiet their minds before battle.</p><p>Caelen stood in the hall, Rionna on his right side and Gannon to his left. Rionna had twined her fingers with his and held on, drawing comfort from his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay behind and watch over the keep,\u201d Caelen said to Gannon. \u201cI don\u2019t expect word from Ewan for some days yet, but if you receive a message, send someone for me immediately. We won\u2019t venture far on our hunt. Watch over Rionna well for me.\u201d</p><p>Gannon nodded. \u201cOf course I will, Laird. May your hunt be successful and you return with a full bounty.\u201d</p><p>Gannon strode away, leaving Caelen alone with Rionna. She turned into his embrace before he could say anything else and she hugged him fiercely, uncaring of who looked on. \u2019Twas one time her husband would have to suffer displays of affection outside of their chamber.</p><p>To her surprise, he kissed her lingeringly and stroked his fingers over her cheeks as he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI can see the worry in your eyes, wife. \u2019Tis not good for you or our babe. All will be well. This day has been coming for many years. \u2019Tis the truth I am fair itching to get on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know it,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cGo on your hunt and clear your mind before you ride off to do battle with Cameron. I have every faith that you and your brothers will prove victorious.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glinted with satisfaction at her words. He leaned down to kiss her again and then turned to walk from the hall to where the hunting party waited in the courtyard.</p><p>Rionna watched him go and sighed. The next weeks would be a test of her fortitude. She loathed the idea that Caelen and her clansmen would be miles away on a battlefield while she remained behind at the keep, ignorant of the goings-on. She wouldn\u2019t even know the outcome until after it had already been decided.</p><p>A day later, Jamie rode back into the courtyard, bearing meat from the hunt. He dismounted and greeted Gannon while Rionna stood impatiently at the steps to the keep.</p><p>After speaking a moment with Gannon, Jamie strode toward Rionna.</p><p>\u201cThe laird bade me to bring this message to you, my lady. He says the hunt is successful and to expect him home by nightfall tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Rionna smiled. \u201c \u2019Tis good news you bear, Jamie. Come inside and get warm. Have something to eat while the others unpack your horse.\u201d</p><p>With no word forthcoming from Ewan, Rionna could look forward to at least a few more days of her husband being at home before he was called away to war. The news gladdened her heart and lifted some of the headache that had plagued her since his departure.</p><p>The afternoon was spent preserving the venison, but Rionna quickly discovered one unpleasant aspect of her condition. She hadn\u2019t been plagued with any sickness thus far. Indeed, other than fatigue at the beginning, she\u2019d enjoyed an unremarkable pregnancy so far. But as soon as she got close to the carcass of the stag, the smell of blood and raw meat made her stomach heave violently.</p><p>She humiliated herself by retching into the snow, and try as she might she couldn\u2019t rid herself of the odor that now seemed permanently implanted in her nostrils.</p><p>Gannon gently led her away from where the women were working and took her through the snow to the far side of the courtyard where she could look upon the loch in the distance and breathe crisp, clean-smelling air.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis humiliating,\u201d Rionna muttered.</p><p>Gannon smiled. \u201cNay, \u2019tis not an uncommon event for a woman in your condition. I think Lady McCabe retched from the time she discovered her pregnancy to the time she delivered. Cormac and I were forever fetching things for her to be sick in.\u201d</p><p>A shout from the gate distracted her from her still quivering stomach. She and Gannon both turned in time to see Simon ride into the courtyard, his face bloody, his horse lathered as though he\u2019d ridden the animal relentlessly.</p><p>When the horse came to a stop, Simon slid from the saddle and landed in the snow.</p><p>Fear hit Rionna square in the chest and she was running before Gannon could stop her. She reached Simon first and dropped to her knees next to the older man. Gannon got there a second later and helped her turn him onto his back.</p><p>He was barely conscious, and blood seeped onto the snow, staining it scarlet. There was a deep gash in the side of his neck. His shoulder was cut so deep that it had nearly severed his arm from the socket.</p><p>He blinked through swollen eyes and his lips parted as he tried to speak.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Rionna whispered, tears biting at her eyelids. \u201cDon\u2019t speak, Simon. Remain still until we can stop the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady,\u201d he rasped out. \u201cI must tell you this. \u2019Tis important. We were ambushed. An arrow struck the laird from behind. They waited until we passed and then attacked us from the rear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Rionna choked out. \u201cCaelen? Is he alive? Where is he? Where are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArlen is dead,\u201d Simon whispered.</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Jamie cried as he ran up. He dropped to his knees and gathered his father\u2019s head in his lap. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, lad,\u201d Gannon said grimly. \u201cHe\u2019s telling us of it now.\u201d</p><p>Simon licked his lips and moaned softly. \u201cHe fell from his horse but he was alive. They took him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Rionna demanded. \u201cWho did this to you?\u201d</p><p>Simon fixed her with his stare, his eyes brighter for just a moment as anger flared in their depths. \u201cYour father, lass. \u2019Twas your father and the men who sided with him. They take him to Duncan Cameron.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to allow you to leave this keep, you\u2019re daft,\u201d Gannon said bluntly as Rionna paced back and forth in the great hall.</p><p>Rionna gripped the scroll bearing the seal of Ewan McCabe and the king, the message that had arrived barely an hour after Simon rode in badly injured, bearing the news of Caelen\u2019s capture.</p><p>She turned urgently to Gannon, knowing she must convince Caelen\u2019s commander or all would be lost. \u201cThink, Gannon. Think on this and you\u2019ll know I\u2019m right. We cannot wait. Cameron will kill Caelen. If he doesn\u2019t, my father will. Caelen isn\u2019t being used as a pawn against Ewan McCabe. \u2019Tis my father\u2019s doing and his bargain with the devil, Duncan Cameron. He spoke of this before but I thought him daft. After my wedding, he approached me to entreat me to join with him in a way to rid our clan of Caelen. He was furious that he was being forced to give over his leadership. \u2019Tis the truth that now I don\u2019t think he ever had any intention of handing over the title of laird to Alaric when he first suggested the alliance. His plan was to marry me to Alaric McCabe and make Alaric laird upon the birth of my first child. But why wait? \u2019Twas an agreement that never made sense to me, given my father\u2019s reluctance to hand over leadership of the clan. I think he intended to make sure Alaric was never laird. I think he would have murdered him after I was with child. He could have made it look like an accident and then Ewan would never have broken the alliance if I was to bear Alaric\u2019s child. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to prove that my father was the cause of Alaric\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a complicated plot you speak of,\u201d Gannon said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds hysterical, that I\u2019ve made it all up because of my worry for Caelen, but it makes sense, Gannon. If you think on it, it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it does,\u201d Gannon admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot wait until Ewan is ready to wage war with Cameron. I need you to travel with all haste to Neamh \u00c1lainn and tell Ewan of my plan. I know not what this scroll contains. I cannot break the seal and have someone examine the contents, for it ruins my plan. But whatever instructions it contains, Ewan must do differently if we are to have the element of surprise.\u201d</p><p>Gannon shook his head vehemently. \u201cI will not leave you, my lady. Caelen would gut me and feed my innards to the wolves if I allowed you to go through with this plan of yours.\u201d</p><p>A sound of rage blew past her lips. She was so furious and so unbelievably terrified that she could barely hold it together. She wanted to curl into a tight ball and pretend none of this had ever happened. But Caelen\u2019s life depended on her being able to save him, and save him she would if she had to battle her way through every one of her clansmen to do it.</p><p>\u201cWill you just let him die while you wait for his brothers to gather their warriors and attack Cameron? Think you that Caelen will even still be alive? Think, Gannon. My father and his men bear an injured man with them. Caelen will slow their travel back to Cameron\u2019s lands. If I leave now and ride straight through, I can arrive on their heels, before they\u2019ve had time to determine Caelen\u2019s fate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gannon thrust his hand into his hair and turned away. \u201cWhat you ask me to do, my lady, is impossible. How can I abandon you while I run to Ewan for help? How can I face Caelen if something happens to you and his bairn? You underestimate Caelen\u2019s strength. It matters not if he took an arrow to the back. He will survive. He has much to live for.\u201d</p><p>Rionna tugged at Gannon\u2019s arm until he faced her again. \u201cMy clansmen will follow but only I will gain entrance to Cameron\u2019s domain. \u2019Tis important he thinks I came alone. Everything rides upon my ability to make him think what it is I want him to think. I must buy time for Ewan to arrive. I\u2019ll not ask your permission to do this, Gannon. What I ask for is your help. I need you to go to Ewan. If I send one of my men, after what has occurred, Ewan will think it a trick. He\u2019ll believe you. You were his most trusted man, a man he sent into service to his brother so that Caelen would have someone he trusted close by. Don\u2019t betray that trust, Gannon. I and my babe are counting on you to help us save my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play fair, my lady,\u201d Gannon said in disgust.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis nothing fair when it comes to the life of my husband,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI love him and I won\u2019t let him go to his death if there is anything I can do to prevent it. I\u2019ll take on my father and Duncan Cameron and his entire army if \u2019tis what it will take.\u201d</p> <p>Gannon\u2019s expression softened and he touched her arm in a gesture of comfort. \u201cCaelen is a fortunate man, my lady. \u2019Tis not often a man has a wife so fierce that she would risk her life to save his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll do it? You\u2019ll leave at once for Neamh \u00c1lainn?\u201d</p><p>Gannon sighed. \u201cAye, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Rionna threw her arms around him and hugged him, much to his dismay. He disentangled himself from her grasp and scowled.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis my hope you\u2019ll defend me as fiercely as you do Caelen, because when he discovers what I\u2019ve allowed you to do, he\u2019ll take off my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll gather the men in the courtyard to tell them what must be done.\u201d</p><p>Rionna stared nervously at the assembled warriors, their grim faces outlined by the blaze of torches. Gannon had already ridden out and Sarah was preparing Rionna\u2019s bag so that she would be ready to depart as soon as the men were apprised of the situation.</p><p>\u201cWill Simon live?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t register who called out the question. She was still numb and her thoughts were occupied with the task before her.</p><p>\u201cI know not,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cHe is being cared for. If God wills it, he\u2019ll live this day and long into the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did this thing, my lady?\u201d</p> <p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201c \u2019Twas my father, your former laird. He has allied himself with Duncan Cameron and seeks to destroy my husband so that he may regain leadership of this clan.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath as she waited their response. It was entirely possible that they\u2019d embrace the idea of her father returning as laird. Caelen had gained their respect, aye, but Rionna couldn\u2019t be assured that given the opportunity, they wouldn\u2019t turn away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is to be done?\u201d Seamus demanded as he stepped forward, his beefy arms crossing his chest as he glared his displeasure. \u201cSurely we aren\u2019t going to let such an insult to our laird pass.\u201d</p><p>It took all of Rionna\u2019s restraint not to throw her arms around the huge warrior and pepper his face with teary kisses.</p><p>\u201cWe ride to Duncan Cameron\u2019s land,\u201d she said when she could speak without her throat knotting up. \u201cGannon has ridden to Neamh \u00c1lainn to apprise Ewan McCabe of the situation. When we near Cameron land, you will all fall back and await my command to attack.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs rose from the men and Seamus stepped forward. \u201cWhat then will you be doing, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in to save my husband,\u201d she said in a tone that brooked no argument. She may not be laird of this clan, but in this moment, she\u2019d take down any man who tried to prevent her from going after Caelen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to require the biggest deception of my life. \u2019Tis possible my husband may despise me before it\u2019s over, but if I\u2019m successful, he\u2019ll be alive and \u2019tis all that matters. The question I pose to you, is whether you\u2019ll stand with me and risk your lives to save our laird.\u201d</p> <p>Seamus cleared his throat and then turned to stare over the assembled men. Then he slowly looked back at Rionna. \u201cI\u2019m with you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>One by one, the men stepped forward and declared their willingness to back Rionna in her plan.</p><p>\u201cThen we must go now and ride hard,\u201d Rionna said. \u201cI must arrive before \u2019tis too late.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Caelen barely held back the curse as he hit the ground. Pain speared through his shoulder, spreading agonizing flame until he had to close his eyes and grit his teeth to remain silent.</p><p>His hands were tied behind his back, making the wound in his shoulder all the more painful. Gregor McDonald had torn the arrow from Caelen\u2019s shoulder without care and Caelen had steadily bled on the rough journey to Duncan Cameron\u2019s keep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought you Caelen McCabe, Laird Cameron,\u201d Gregor called.</p><p>Caelen opened his eyes to see Cameron standing a short distance away. Hatred was bitter in Caelen\u2019s mouth. That the man was so close and yet Caelen was helpless to do anything but lie there made bile rise in his throat. If he could manage the feat, he\u2019d spit in Cameron\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cSo you have,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>He walked over to where Caelen lay on the ground and kicked at his wounded shoulder. Caelen grimaced but stared up at Cameron, allowing the full breadth of his hatred to show.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like to kill me, wouldn\u2019t you, Caelen?\u201d Cameron taunted in a low voice. \u201cYou hate me more than even your brothers do. \u2019Twas your foolishness that brought low your clan. My cousin is bonny, is she not? I haven\u2019t seen her in some time. She\u2019s likely spreading her legs for some other poor besotted fool.\u201d</p><p>Caelen continued to stare at Cameron until Cameron fidgeted uncomfortably and then booted Caelen in the shoulder again.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if given a choice between saving his brother\u2019s life or protecting his lovely wife and daughter, which would Ewan choose? Surely not the brother who once cost him everything. Tell me, Caelen, how would it make you feel to know you destroyed all your brother holds dear a second time?\u201d</p><p>Cameron knelt beside Caelen\u2019s head, wrapped his hand in Caelen\u2019s hair, and yanked upward so their faces were just inches apart.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t have to choose, because I plan to have both. You\u2019re of no consequence to me. I\u2019ll not blink an eye over your death, and then I\u2019ll destroy your clan and the king you\u2019re so loyal to.\u201d</p><p>As he stared into Cameron\u2019s eyes, the question that Rionna had posed floated back into his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy did you do it? If you\u2019re going to kill me anyway, then tell me why you destroyed my clan eight years ago. We were no threat to you.\u201d</p><p>Cameron rose and took a step back, a hatred that mirrored Caelen\u2019s own reflected in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never heard of me until that day, had you?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHow like your father to have never mentioned me or my father. You aren\u2019t the only one with reason to hate, Caelen. Your father took what was mine. I returned the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re daft,\u201d Caelen said hoarsely. \u201cMy father was a peaceful man. He wouldn\u2019t wage war against anyone. Not unless provoked.\u201d</p><p>Cameron pressed his boot to Caelen\u2019s throat, pinning him to the ground. \u201cOh aye, he was a peaceful man. Do you want to know why? He made a vow after my father\u2019s death. His guilt was too much for him to bear. He swore on my father\u2019s grave never to pick up arms again. I know. I was there. I heard his vow. I heard his apology to my mother. He patted me on the head as he walked away. Patted me on the head as if that would bring me a measure of comfort when my father was in the ground. If I\u2019d had a sword, your father would have died that day and bled to death atop my father\u2019s grave. I would have seen to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie,\u201d Caelen ground out. \u201cMy father never spoke of you or your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was a coward. He fought alongside my father and when my father was felled from his horse, he left him to die there. He turned his back on the man he called friend, and he ran from the battlefield. And do you know, just before your father drew his last breath, I reminded him of that boy he patted on the head at my father\u2019s grave. Do you know what his last words were, Caelen?\u201d</p><p>Caelen swallowed against the rage knotting his throat. His blood pumped so furiously through his veins that he feared exploding.</p><p>Cameron leaned down again so that he was close to Caelen\u2019s ear. \u201cHe said he was sorry again. And then he begged me to spare his grandson\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you murdered and raped the boy\u2019s mother instead,\u201d Caelen snarled.</p><p>\u201cIf I could have found the brattling, I would have spitted him on my sword. My only regret is that you and your brothers were not there the day I attacked. It would have brought me great satisfaction to have destroyed every last McCabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in hell for what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Caelen vowed.</p><p>Cameron straightened and motioned toward his men. \u201cTake him to the dungeon. I cannot bear to look upon his face a moment longer. Killing him now is too good a fate. I want him to suffer as my father suffered when he slowly bled to death on that battlefield.\u201d</p><p>Three of Cameron\u2019s men yanked Caelen to his feet and dragged him toward the small entryway with the steps leading into the darkness below. A fourth man bore a torch down into the cold, damp corridor.</p><p>At the end of it, a yawning hole opened in the floor, and without warning Caelen was shoved down. He pitched forward into the blackness and was suspended momentarily in the air before landing on the stone floor below. His injured shoulder took the brunt of the fall and he cried out as agony tore down his back and arm, numbing his hand.</p><p>He sucked in deep breaths as he battled unconsciousness. He tasted blood and realized he\u2019d bitten his lip.</p><p>As he lay there shivering, pain his only companion in the darkness, he closed his eyes and conjured an image of Rionna\u2019s smiling face. He imagined he was home, in the privacy of their chamber, as she thought up some new way to drive him mad with lust.</p><p>He imagined tracing the swell of her belly and talking with her long into the night of their hopes and dreams for their child.</p><p>\u201cProtect her well, Ewan,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFor I have failed her. And you.\u201d</p><p>Rionna was near collapse when she ordered her clan to surround Duncan Cameron\u2019s holding and remain in hiding until she gave the order to attack. If God was with them, Ewan McCabe would arrive with reinforcements before her clan was forced to take action. But if not, she and every one of the McDonald warriors would go down fighting.</p><p>She prayed for strength. She prayed for God\u2019s guidance for what she was about to do. She had to be convincing or she and Caelen would both die.</p><p>Gathering the reins of her tired horse, she started forward, her heart pounding as she broke from the cover of the forest, and rode down toward the gate of Cameron\u2019s fortress.</p><p>\u2019Twas an imposing sight of stone, wood, and metal. The walls were tall and she only prayed that her men could scale them rapidly enough to avoid detection.</p><p>Her plan had to work. If God truly sided with the righteous, her clan would win the day and she would return home with her husband.</p><p>Still, she prayed, for perhaps God needed convincing on the matter.</p><p>When she reached the gate, the watchman called down to her. Rionna surveyed the top of the wall and found at least three crossbows aimed in her direction.</p><p>She pushed down the hood of her cloak and then called up. \u201cI am Rionna McDonald and I wish to see my father, Gregor McDonald.\u201d</p><p>There was a long wait and then Duncan Cameron appeared at the top of the wall, her father beside him.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Rionna, have you come to beg for your husband\u2019s life?\u201d Cameron called down.</p><p>She fixed him with a haughty stare and twisted her lips in scorn. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see if what my men have told me is true. And if \u2019tis true, and my father has felled the McCabe warrior, I want to claim the right to kill him if the task is not already done.\u201d</p><p>Cameron arched his eyebrow in surprise and Rionna held her breath until she nearly swayed from the horse. Oh God, let him still be alive. They couldn\u2019t have arrived with Caelen too awfully long ago. She and her men had ridden without stop and they\u2019d picked up a fresh trail halfway here and followed it until they reached the keep.</p><p>\u201cOpen the gate,\u201d Cameron shouted.</p><p>A few moments later, the wood creaked and groaned and the heavy gate began to swing open. She remained atop her horse and waited for permission to enter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon enough, Cameron and her father appeared at the entryway and one of Cameron\u2019s men came forward to assist her from her horse. When her feet hit the ground, her knees nearly buckled, but by sheer force of will she remained standing and allowed her horse to be led away.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis an interesting tale you spin, mistress,\u201d Cameron said as he stared at her. \u201cYou have my attention.\u201d</p><p>Rionna looked at her father, wondering if he was too cowed by Cameron to offer words of his own. He stared back, his expression flat, and his eyes glittered with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead yet?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>Finally Cameron shook his head and she went weak with relief. \u201cNay, not yet. He\u2019s only just arrived. Tell me, how did you come so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my men bore me the tale of what occurred, I refused to believe my good fortune until I laid eyes on him myself. If \u2019tis true that my father captured Caelen McCabe, then \u2019tis my thanks I must offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this nonsense, daughter?\u201d Gregor finally demanded.</p><p>Cameron held up his hand. \u201c \u2019Tis only one way to solve this riddle. Come, my lady. \u2019Tis cold and you\u2019ve traveled a great distance.\u201d</p><p>Rionna slid her hand through Cameron\u2019s outstretched arm and smiled gratefully up at him. \u201cMy thanks, Laird Cameron. \u2019Tis the truth I\u2019m weary, but my relief was so great, I would not stop until I begged sanctuary at your door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSanctuary? My dear lady, what would make you cry sanctuary?\u201d he asked, as he guided her through the courtyard and up the steps to the keep.</p><p>A warm blast of air hit her as did the stench. Her nose curled and it took everything she had to keep her stomach from rebelling.</p><p>The tunic she wore disguised the swell of her belly and she wasn\u2019t far gone enough for her condition to be evident. The last thing she wanted was to reveal that she was carrying Caelen\u2019s child.</p><p>\u201cAye, sanctuary. Think you that I would be safe from Ewan McCabe once it was learned a McDonald took his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to kill your husband?\u201d Cameron asked bluntly.</p><p>He gestured for her to sit in one of the chairs in front of the fire, and it was with great relief she did so. She wasn\u2019t sure how much longer she could remain standing.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she asked in a level voice.</p><p>\u201cI find it hard to believe you left the protection of your clan in the dead of winter so that you could be the one to kill a man who is for all practical purposes already a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d Rionna spat. \u201cI hate all of the McCabes. They have run roughshod over my clan. \u2019Tis the truth, I had no great love for the leadership of my father, but at least he was a McDonald. I have been humiliated by the McCabes at every turn. If you won\u2019t allow me to do the killing, I would at least like to witness it. And I would seek your protection until this matter with the McCabes is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an odd woman, Rionna McDonald. Or should I say McCabe?\u201d</p><p>Rionna bolted to her feet, drew her sword, and leveled it at Cameron in a show of bravado she hoped impressed him or further convinced him she was just daft enough to want her husband dead. She was so desperate at this point, she was grasping for straws and she well knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not be called by that name,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He pushed aside the blade of her sword as if it were nothing more than a pesky fly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll not have a female brandishing her sword at me in my own home.\u201d</p><p>He motioned her back to her seat and then turned to glance at Gregor McDonald, who stood on Rionna\u2019s other side.</p> <p>\u201cYou have me curious, Rionna. What did Caelen McCabe do to draw your ire?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her father, knowing that it was here that he would be convinced and he would lend credibility to her tale, no matter how absurd it sounded to Cameron.</p><p>\u201cHe insisted I act and dress as a female. He took my sword from me and forbade me to pick it back up. He mocked and humiliated me at every turn. He ... He sorely abused me.\u201d</p><p>Cameron chuckled and then glanced at her father. \u201cWhat manner of woman did you raise, Gregor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks herself a lad,\u201d Gregor said in disgust. \u201cNothing I ever did made her act and dress as she should. I washed my hands of her years ago. \u2019Tis the truth he probably bedded her and this is the source of his \u2018abuse.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Cameron\u2019s gaze swept lingeringly over her body in a manner that made her grateful she\u2019d bound her breasts. He looked for sign that she was indeed womanly, but in her current manner of dress, she looked lean and shapeless, just as a young lad would.</p><p>She shivered at the lust in his eyes. In spite of, or perhaps because of, her eccentricities, Cameron looked upon her like he\u2019d like nothing more than to tumble her to the ground for a quick rut. Or perhaps \u2019twas because he coveted what Caelen had already had. Trying to discern the mind of a man was impossible.</p><p>But he turned instead and waved an arrogant hand to one of his men. \u201cBring Caelen McCabe up from the dungeon. His wife seeks a reunion.\u201d</p><p>The knot in her belly grew and fear nearly paralyzed her. She would have to act quick in order to convince Cameron and her father that all she\u2019d said was true. It hurt her to do what she must. It would be the hardest thing she\u2019d ever do, but she had to convince Caelen that she loathed the very sight of him and wanted his death.</p><p>All the while she waited, she steeled herself for the sight of her husband. She knew he was injured. He might be near death even now. She couldn\u2019t react, not as a horrified wife.</p><p>Rionna wanted to weep. She was beyond exhausted and she was more afraid than she\u2019d ever been in her life.</p><p>When they shoved Caelen into the hall, he fell to his knees and she could see his hands were secured behind his back. Before he could look up, she was on her feet. She stalked across the room but just as she reached him, he lifted his gaze to her.</p><p>Shock registered in his eyes and he parted his mouth as if about to speak. So she did the only thing she knew to silence him.</p><p>She reared back and slapped him as hard as she could across one cheek.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>Caelen\u2019s neck snapped back and he barely managed to stay on his knees. He whipped his head back around to stare at his wife. His wife. She stood before him, her eyes spitting fury, while Cameron and Gregor stood behind her looking faintly amused.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see you die,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIf God is willing and with Laird Cameron\u2019s permission, I aim to do the killing myself. \u2019Twould give me great pleasure to rid myself of you, Caelen McCabe.\u201d</p><p>He heard her words. He saw the very real anger in her eyes. But he couldn\u2019t make sense of any of it. Dread crept into his chest until it pained him more than the arrow wound in his back.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be happening again. He couldn\u2019t countenance history repeating itself in such a bizarre manner.</p><p>Duncan Cameron came up behind Rionna and slid a hand over her shoulder. \u201cYour wife is here to see you, Caelen. Isn\u2019t that thoughtful of her? She says she wants to be your executioner. What think you of that?\u201d</p><p>Before Caelen could muster a response\u2014what could he possibly say to that?\u2014Cameron turned Rionna, pulled her into his arms, and kissed her savagely.</p><p>Cold rage seared over Caelen\u2019s body. He could no longer feel the pain of his wound. All he felt was overwhelming fury. His mind was muddled enough that he still couldn\u2019t comprehend the whole of it, but what stared him in the face was betrayal.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Rionna yanked away from Cameron, slapped him soundly across the face as she\u2019d done to Caelen, and then went for her sword. Cameron grabbed her arm and hauled her up close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been abused by one man. I\u2019ll not suffer it at the hands of another,\u201d Rionna spat.</p><p>Caelen\u2019s brows went up. \u201cAbuse? Is that what you call it, wife?\u201d</p><p>Rionna glanced at Caelen, her beautiful, deceitful eyes flashing scornfully. She looked back to Cameron and pulled at her arm. Then she stilled and stared intently into Cameron\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou doubt me. \u2019Twas a test. You doubt that I\u2019m here because I seek the death of the McCabe warrior.\u201d</p><p>She wrested her arms from his grip and reached into the folds of her cloak to draw out a scroll. Even from where he knelt, Caelen could see two seals. One was his brother\u2019s. The other belonged to the king.</p><p>\u201cI brought this. Know you what this is, Laird Cameron? \u2019Tis a call to arms from Ewan McCabe. In it are likely detailed battle plans. All you need to know of the coming war. Would I give this to you if \u2019twas all a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Caelen roared.</p><p>He lunged forward but was restrained on both sides by two of Cameron\u2019s men. He twisted and fought against their strength, but with his hands bound, he could do nothing.</p><p>Cameron took the scroll from her hand and turned it over, examining the seals. Without a word, he broke the wax and unrolled the parchment. It took him several minutes to read the contents and when he was done, he carefully rolled it back and then leveled a stare at Caelen.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem that your wife and clan no longer want you, McCabe.\u201d</p><p>Caelen\u2019s nostrils flared and his lip curled as he stared coldly at the woman standing before him. \u201cI have no wife or clan save the McCabes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to look upon him any longer. Return him from whatever hole you dragged him from,\u201d Rionna said in an equally cold voice.</p><p>\u201cWell \u2019tis the matter of his death we need to speak on,\u201d Cameron drawled. \u201c \u2019Twould seem war is imminent if this message from Ewan McCabe and the king is to be believed. I did hope they\u2019d be more original in their planning, but \u2019twould appear they favor the straightforward method. I\u2019ll give you a day, my lady. He dies in the morn, and then I must make my own plans in accordance with Ewan McCabe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Rionna drew her sword and walked slowly toward Caelen. He refused to meet her gaze, refused to acknowledge her at all. His mind was such a mass of rage and confusion that he couldn\u2019t even process what played out before him.</p><p>When she reached him, she pressed the point of her blade to his neck, forcing him to look up or have his neck severed.</p><p>\u201cI could kill you now,\u201d she said in a voice devoid of emotion. She wore no expression, no indication of what she was thinking. She could be discussing something as mundane as the weather. Her demeanor chilled him to the bone, for \u2019twas a side of his wife he\u2019d never seen. \u201cBut \u2019twould be too quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he demanded hoarsely. \u201cYou betray not only me but also those you called friend. You betray Mairin, who has only been kind to you, and her child, who is innocent. You would send those who have been loyal to you to their deaths, and for what? So a man without honor can reclaim leadership of a clan that was once his?\u201d</p><p>She lowered the sword to his groin. \u201cBe silent or I\u2019ll remove your cods and feed them to the hounds.\u201d</p><p>She turned then as if she could no longer bear to look upon him. To his everlasting shame, he wanted to call after her. He closed his eyes, for it would seem some lessons were never learned.</p><p>\u201cBurn him at the stake at first light,\u201d she said calmly. \u201c \u2019Tis a fitting end for one such as he.\u201d</p><p>Even Cameron seemed taken aback by her ruthlessness, but there was also a glint of admiration in his eyes. Aye, the man would appreciate the same dishonorable qualities in others he himself possessed.</p><p>\u201cVery well, my lady. His sentence will be carried out in the morn.\u201d</p><p>He motioned his men to take Caelen away and then he turned back to Rionna. \u201cWould you like refreshment? \u2019Tis a long way you\u2019ve journeyed and you must be fatigued.\u201d</p><p>As Caelen was pulled from the hall, he watched as his wife smiled up at the man he hated most in the world.</p><p>Rionna glanced up at the last moment and caught his gaze. A shadow crossed over her eyes and then she looked quickly away.</p><p>Rionna stood by the window of her chamber, staring out at the snow-covered landscape. She was exhausted to the bone, but she would not sleep this night. Not when she imagined Caelen below in the dungeon, enduring unspeakable conditions.</p><p>She closed her eyes and replayed the look on his face, his angry words, and finally his acceptance that she had betrayed him. More than ever she was determined not to fail in her quest, for she would not have her husband die thinking she\u2019d played him false.</p><p>She cupped her hands over her belly and rubbed just as she felt a faint quickening deep in her womb. Tears sprang to her eyes as she realized that her babe had chosen this moment to move, as if reaffirming his mother\u2019s vow that his father would be saved at all costs.</p><p>\u201cYou are my future, Caelen McCabe. The future of my clan. Our son or daughter\u2019s future,\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cI\u2019ll not let you die in some dark hole where you\u2019re tethered like an animal.\u201d</p><p>She retreated to her bed and sank down onto the edge. Cameron had provided her adequate accommodations. He\u2019d even had one of his men lay a fire in the hearth. As soon as she was alone, though, she closed and barred the door with a heavy chair she dragged from the window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She would take no chances. Cameron was an arrogant bastard of the first order. He believed that whatever he looked upon was his for the taking. She didn\u2019t imagine for a moment that he was overcome by her beauty. She\u2019d purposely downplayed her features and her body so that she looked like the lad she mimicked, but she\u2019d seen the curiosity and lust in the laird\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She lay back on the mattress still fully clothed and closed her eyes for a brief moment of rest. She willed the hours to pass so she could end this once and for all.</p><p>Even now, her men would be taking position along the walls. Waiting for her cry to arms.</p><p>She alternated pacing and resting on the various pieces of furniture in the chamber until the knock came at her door the next morning. She took her time and even called out that she\u2019d be a moment, wanting to give the appearance that she\u2019d slept and was now dressing.</p> <p>She pulled back the furs and cast them this way and that and then pulled her hair over her shoulder to plait as she went to the door.</p><p>Shoving the chair to the side, she opened it to find her father standing in the hallway. She let her hands drop from the braid and stood there regarding him in silence.</p><p>\u201cThe laird bade you to come to the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and waited for him to precede her down the hallway but he hesitated and fixed her with his stare. \u201cWhat did McCabe really do to gain your ire? You turned from me in favor of him, refusing to back me as laird and now you welcome me back with open arms?\u201d</p><p>Knowing he wouldn\u2019t believe a sudden change of heart, she instead spoke the truth.</p> <p>\u201cI would not have you as laird either. You, Caelen McCabe, \u2019tis a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils.\u201d</p><p>Gregor McDonald\u2019s gaze narrowed and he glared at his daughter. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t learned to control your tongue or address your betters with a civil tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis not my better I address, and if you think to strike me as you did the last time we had this conversation, I\u2019ll make good on my threat and the McDonalds will seek a new laird this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with you in time,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She shrugged as if she didn\u2019t place much importance on his threats.</p><p>As they stepped into the courtyard, she pulled her cloak tighter around her to ward off the chill. Her heart nearly stopped when she saw that Caelen was already tied to a stake in the center. Wood was stacked in a circle around him, surrounding him on all sides.</p> <p>He looked even more battered than he had the night before. New bruising was evident on his face and fresh blood streamed down his side.</p><p>Her teeth ached from clenching her jaws and she blinked back tears of rage. Never had she hated someone as much as she hated her father and Duncan Cameron. \u2019Twould be so simple to draw her sword now and end her father\u2019s miserable life, but she must be patient, for Caelen would be killed before her father fell to the ground.</p><p>Cameron stood several paces in front of Caelen, surrounded by his men, all bearing torches. When she neared Cameron, he reached for one of the torches and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll do the honors,\u201d he said. \u201cBe quick about it. I find the smell of burning flesh to be distasteful and I\u2019ve other matters to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Her hand shook as she took the torch and turned to face her husband. She took a step forward, sucking in deep breaths as she mentally prepared herself for what was to come.</p><p>Their gazes met and held. His clear green eyes were pain-filled and dulled. He didn\u2019t seem entirely aware of his surroundings. She silently cursed, for she needed her husband\u2019s might this day.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Caelen watched as Rionna took the torch from Cameron\u2019s hand. Pain whipped and coiled through his body. He was racked by chills and he burned with fever. But he kept his gaze on his wife as she stared into his eyes.</p> <p>Something had bothered him the entire night as he\u2019d lain awake, huddled on the wet, cold floor of the dungeon. It had bothered him ever since he\u2019d seen the shadow cross her eyes when he\u2019d been dragged away the evening before.</p><p>And now his gut was screaming at him that nothing was as it seemed. He battled with himself, for he\u2019d vowed to never again doubt what stared him in the face. The evidence didn\u2019t lie.</p><p>But. But, but, but, he couldn\u2019t accept that Rionna had coldly betrayed him. In the heat of the moment, his surprise over seeing her and the shock of all that had transpired had rendered him unable to think.</p><p>But now when he thought back over the last months, he couldn\u2019t accept that Rionna had turned against him. Too much didn\u2019t make sense. She hated her father. She feared him. Why then would she support his return to her clan?</p><p>She\u2019d stood with him against her kin. She\u2019d supported him at the risk of alienating her people. Those were not the actions of a woman who\u2019d lied about everything.</p><p>Nay, \u2019twas not possible. Even if it made him a fool for once again trusting his heart and not his head. This time ... This time his heart wasn\u2019t wrong. He\u2019d wager his life on it.</p><p>Which meant that his wife was in a dangerous situation and he was helpless to protect her.</p><p>What was her aim? What purpose did this pretense of hers serve?</p><p>She gripped the torch and then he saw her free hand slide carefully into her cloak. And there, in her eyes, a plea. A plea for help. A plea for understanding. It was gone before he could blink but he hadn\u2019t mistaken it. Or maybe \u2019twas what he wanted to see. But his pulse ratcheted up and he tensed in anticipation.</p><p>He wanted to yell at her to get the hell away, to protect herself and their bairn. He wanted to tell her that whatever she planned, it wasn\u2019t worth her life. Not in trade for his.</p><p>But he remained silent, knowing his cry would mean her quick death.</p><p>Then she made her move. She turned abruptly and thrust the torch into Cameron\u2019s face. His howl of pain was instantaneous. At the exact moment of his cry, Rionna let out a war cry that rivaled any Caelen had ever heard.</p><p>She drew her sword, tore off her cloak, and ran for the stake. Caelen stared in disbelief as McDonald soldiers swarmed over the walls, dropping down, swords in hands.</p><p>The wife and clan he\u2019d vowed was not his own had come to save him.</p><p>\u201cAre you strong enough to fight?\u201d Rionna yelled as she slashed at the bonds securing him to the stake.</p><p>\u201cAye, I can fight.\u201d He wasn\u2019t dead yet and he\u2019d be damned if he let his wife risk everything for naught.</p><p>She disappeared before he had fully loosened himself from the ropes. He caught sight of her engaged in battle a short distance away but before he could think to aid her, he dodged a sword and rolled away, barely surviving with his head.</p><p>The first order of business was to find a sword. Caelen dodged again when one of Cameron\u2019s men slashed his blade mere inches from his face. Bending low, he rammed into the warrior\u2019s legs, knocking them both to the ground.</p><p>The sword went sliding through the snow and Caelen slammed his fist into the man\u2019s face until blood sprayed onto the snow. He rolled away and lunged for the sword. He gripped the hilt and yanked it to him just as another man appeared above him, sword over his hand as he slashed downward.</p><p>Caelen rolled, swinging his sword as he went. The blade cut through the warrior\u2019s leg. Caelen jumped to his feet, his pain and fever forgotten. All that occupied his mind was finding his wife and hunting Duncan Cameron.</p><p>He fought his way to the wall, his gaze scanning left and right. Only by sheer will was he even standing. What he saw as he surveyed the courtyard made his heart sink.</p><p>While fighting valiantly and with more fire than he\u2019d ever witnessed in the McDonald soldiers, they were vastly outnumbered, and they were tiring quickly.</p><p>He finally spotted Rionna again. She was backing a Cameron warrior to the wall. She quickly dispatched him by thrusting her sword in his chest, then yanked it away and turned, only to find another soldier in his place.</p><p>That was the problem. For every Cameron soldier felled, there was another right behind.</p><p>Caelen began to work his way in his wife\u2019s direction, determined to get her to safety, when he heard a chilling war cry so achingly familiar that he nearly went to his knees in relief.</p><p>He rallied his strength, threw back his head, and uttered a harsh call in return. Then he shouted to the McDonald soldiers. \u201cReinforcements are here! Hold your ground!\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned in time to see his brothers charge through the gates. Hundreds of McCabe warriors swarmed from every direction. \u2019Twas the most magnificent thing he\u2019d ever viewed. If he lived to be a hundred, he\u2019d never forget the sight.</p><p>The tide had swung decidedly in favor of the McDonalds. Where before they\u2019d looked haggard and near the end of their strength, they suddenly began fighting as though God himself had given then renewed strength.</p><p>Ewan, who\u2019d led the charge through the gate, slid from his horse a few feet from Caelen, sword in hand. Alaric rode up a moment later and did the same until Caelen was flanked by his brothers.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Ewan yelled as he looked at the blood running down his brother\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>The brothers cut a vicious path through Cameron warriors. They fought with determination, their attack fueled by rage and an overwhelming desire for revenge.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rionna?\u201d Alaric shouted when they reached the middle of the courtyard.</p><p>Caelen glanced around before ducking a blow from an advancing warrior. \u201cI know not. I lost sight of her when you came through the gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife has lost her mind,\u201d Ewan said as he cut through another soldier. \u201cShe has to be the most daft, infuriating, brave lass I\u2019ve ever had the occasion to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she is all that,\u201d Caelen agreed. \u201cAnd she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Alaric grinned then pivoted and delivered a death blow, his sword coming away bright with blood. \u201cYou\u2019re a most fortunate man, Caelen. Clearly your wife is too stubborn to let you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Cameron?\u201d Ewan shouted in frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll not let that bastard escape me yet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRionna thrust a torch in his face. I\u2019ve not seen him since she freed me.\u201d</p><p>They quieted as they greeted another onslaught of attacks. They came from every angle and it took all of Caelen\u2019s skill and concentration to block the agonizing pain and focus on the matter at hand.</p><p>His concern wasn\u2019t for Duncan Cameron. He searched for Rionna. He feared for her more than he\u2019d feared anything else in his life.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re running!\u201d Hugh McDonald shouted. \u201cClose in! Close in! Don\u2019t let them escape!\u201d</p><p>The courtyard was littered with bodies, and what was once a pristine covering of snow was now bathed in scarlet. The blood shone in the sun, stark against the white, and the acrid smell rose and scattered with the wind.</p><p>The ranks had thinned enough that Caelen could see more than a few paces and he frantically searched for sign of his wife. When he saw her, his blood froze in his veins.</p><p>She was battling her father, and the man fought wildly, with no discipline of a seasoned warrior. He fought like a man who knew he was going to die.</p><p>Her back was to Caelen, and she fought valiantly, holding off the frantic blows with her sword, but each forward attack backed her up and her strength was waning.</p><p>Caelen broke into a run, ignoring his own pain and overwhelming exhaustion. He was halfway across the courtyard when he caught sight of Duncan Cameron.</p><p>Typical of the coward he was, he\u2019d positioned himself behind a wall of his men, but now most had fallen and he was vulnerable to attack.</p><p>The left side of his face was blistered and smeared with blood from the burn Rionna had inflicted on him. He had a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other.</p><p>Before Caelen realized what he was doing, Cameron took aim and hurled the dagger in Rionna\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Caelen roared.</p><p>But it was too late. Cameron\u2019s aim was true and the dagger struck Rionna just inside her right shoulder blade. She staggered, deflected a blow delivered by her father, and then went down on one knee.</p><p>Gregor raised his sword again to deliver the killing blow when an arrow struck him in the chest. Caelen never turned to see who\u2019d let the arrow fly. His focus was solely on Rionna.</p><p>Rage like he\u2019d never known gave him the strength of a hundred men. He roared Cameron\u2019s name and launched himself at the man who\u2019d felled Rionna.</p><p>The two men met with a clash of swords, the sound of metal ringing throughout the courtyard. Caelen fought like a man possessed. He could taste Cameron\u2019s blood. He wanted to bathe in it right after he carved the bastard\u2019s heart from his chest.</p><p>But Cameron also fought like a man who knew he was marked for death. Much of the arrogance that Cameron wore like a cloak had disappeared. It was as if for the first time he sensed his own mortality and was desperate to survive.</p><p>Weakened by fever and blood loss and the ferocity of the battle thus far, Caelen stumbled back under the force of Cameron\u2019s attack. He dug in his heels and met Cameron\u2019s sword with his own, the impact jarring his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With the blades kissing, Caelen thrust his boot into Cameron\u2019s midsection, knocking him back. He followed, pressing his momentary advantage by launching a series of blows that had Cameron retreating.</p><p>The insistent clang of metal rang in his ears. Around him the smell of death was thick and cloying. Much of the roar had faded, as McCabes and McDonalds alike worked to dispatch the men who\u2019d sworn their loyalty to a man with no honor.</p><p>All Caelen could see over and over was Rionna staggering to her knees before pitching forward to the ground. A sound much like that of a wounded animal bellowed from his throat.</p><p>For all Cameron\u2019s cowardice, he was a skilled warrior, and he was fighting for his life. He knocked Caelen back and swung his sword. Caelen went to his knees and jerked his head back so the blade cut through empty air just an inch from his throat.</p> <p>His shoulder burned, stinging from sweat and slick with blood. His strength was fast ebbing and he had to end this quickly. His brothers were occupied with their own battle across the courtyard. There was no one to aid Caelen. He had no reserves to draw on.</p><p>He staggered to his feet after deflecting yet another blow and prepared to launch himself directly at his enemy. Cameron raised his sword over his head and, with a snarl, started to leap forward to meet Caelen\u2019s attack, when suddenly a sword thrust through Cameron\u2019s chest.</p><p>He was completely impaled on the length. The point sliced through the front, bathed in crimson. Cameron looked down in complete befuddlement, his eyes glassy as death crept over him.</p><p>As his knees buckled and he slipped to the ground, Rionna came into view. She gripped the hilt of her sword with both hands, her face as pale as death. When she lifted her gaze from Cameron\u2019s lifeless body to Caelen, her eyes were cloudy with pain and as dull and glassy as Cameron\u2019s had looked when he drew his last breath.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to die with honor,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe has none.\u201d</p> <p>She took one step forward then bobbled and put her other foot back to steady herself. Then she sagged and went to her knees in the snow.</p><p>All Caelen could see was the blood that soaked her tunic.</p><p>\u201cRionna!\u201d he cried.</p><p>He dropped his sword and ran forward, catching her as she pitched sideways. He gathered her close to his chest and gently lowered her to her side, mindful of the dagger still deep within her flesh.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered as she stared up at him, her eyes so dim that it was like all the life had leeched right out of them. The usual wash of gold and amber, so warm and vibrant, was a dull shade of brown, like trees in winter. \u201cI worried so. I couldn\u2019t find you during battle. I worried you\u2019d been killed.\u201d</p><p>A spasm of pain crossed her face and she gave a soft sigh as she closed her eyes.</p> <p>He touched her cheek, her mouth, her eyes, and even her ears. \u201cDon\u2019t you die, Rionna. Do you hear me? Don\u2019t you dare die on me. You\u2019ll live. I command it. Oh God,\u201d he said brokenly. \u201cPlease don\u2019t die, lass. You can\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her against his chest and rocked back and forth, grief so thick in his heart that he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201c \u2019Tis not true that I kept a part of my heart locked away from you. You own all of it, lass. You\u2019ve always owned it. I didn\u2019t give it to you. You took it from the very start.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek again, willing her to open her eyes, and as if she answered his unspoken demand, her eyelids fluttered and opened, but it was evident it cost her dearly.</p><p>She smiled faintly. \u201c \u2019Tis glad I am to hear it, husband, for \u2019tis the truth I despaired of you ever giving me the words I most wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay with me and you\u2019ll hear them every day for the rest of our lives,\u201d he said in a harsh tone that was rife with grief and desperation. \u201cAh, lass, I don\u2019t deserve you. \u2019Tis God\u2019s truth, I don\u2019t, but I want you all the same and I\u2019ll not live a single day without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pair we are,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBattered, bruised, and bloody. Too weak to help the other to our deathbed. \u2019Tis the truth we\u2019ll have to die here because I lack the strength to carry you.\u201d</p><p>The teasing in her tone was his undoing. The knot swelled in his throat and tears burned his eyes, crowding in until his vision went wet and blurry.</p> <p>\u201cAye, lass, you have the right of it. Perhaps my brothers will come along and carry the both of us to our sick beds. But if you think you get your own bed, you\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never before seen such a pitiful sight. What say you, Alaric?\u201d</p><p>Caelen looked up to see Ewan and Alaric standing over him and Rionna. Worry burned bright in their gazes but Ewan\u2019s tone was light and jesting, as if he was loathe to let his fear bleed over into his words.</p><p>\u201cMethinks marriage has made my brother soft,\u201d Alaric replied. \u201c \u2019Tis a shame when a puny lass has to save his arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome down here and I\u2019ll show you puny,\u201d Rionna grumbled.</p><p>Caelen didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry so he sat there, with Rionna gathered tight in his grasp, and buried his face in her hair. He shook from head to toe as it sank in just how close he\u2019d come to losing her, and in fact, he could lose her still.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Gannon demanded as he ran up.</p><p>\u201cGannon,\u201d she said in weak delight. \u201cSo glad you made it. I owe you my thanks. We couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p><p>Gannon looked much the same as Caelen felt. Awed. Scared. Mystified.</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady. I have no doubt you and your men would have taken on the whole of Duncan Cameron\u2019s army and dragged Caelen home to McDonald keep.\u201d</p><p>He knelt beside Caelen in the snow and feathered a hand over Rionna\u2019s forehead. \u201c \u2019Tis God\u2019s truth, my lady. Never have I met a lass as brave and as fierce as you. I\u2019m honored to serve you. I\u2019m grateful you were able to save our laird\u2019s life. I\u2019ve grown used to serving with the grumpy bastard.\u201d</p><p>Rionna laughed and then promptly broke off with a groan, as pain wracked her small frame. \u201cHe is grumpy, but I\u2019m going to work on that.\u201d</p><p>Ewan laid a hand on Caelen\u2019s shoulder when another spasm of pain crawled over Rionna\u2019s face. \u201cLet her go, Caelen. Let Alaric carry her back into the keep. The battle is over. Cameron is dead, and the few men who still live are scattered and running. We must see to both of your wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaelen?\u201d</p><p>Caelen looked down and brushed away the hair from her eyes. \u201cAye, lass.\u201d</p><p>Her unfocused gaze found his and she licked her lips. \u201cI seem to have a dagger in my back. Could you take it out for me?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t let me tend your wounds, you\u2019ll die, and what good will you be to Rionna then?\u201d Ewan demanded in exasperation.</p><p>Caelen snarled back at his brother, his impatience simmering like a cauldron. \u201cYou should be with Rionna. She is who needs tending. If she dies because we stand here arguing, I\u2019ll make Mairin a widow, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Ewan blew out his breath in frustration. \u201cIf I have to sit on you and have Alaric clean your wound, I\u2019ll do it. The sooner you allow me to tend you, the sooner Rionna will get the care she needs.\u201d</p><p>Caelen swore viciously. \u201cWould you allow me to tend you if Mairin had suffered as Rionna has? Nay, you would insist that Mairin be taken care of first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGannon is with Rionna. He\u2019ll call if he has need of me. Rionna\u2019s wound is fresh. Yours is not and it has already begun festering. Damn it, Caelen, give over so that you can rest beside Rionna.\u201d</p><p>\u2019Twas the mention of being able to be with Rionna that made Caelen yield. While they stood arguing, Rionna was alone and without comfort and it twisted Caelen\u2019s stomach into knots. He still remembered his harsh words, the fact that he had at first believed the worst of her. He would not have her believe he thought ill of her any longer.</p><p>\u201cYou burn with fever,\u201d Ewan said grimly when Caelen was laid on the bed in one of the chambers. \u201cYou worry for Rionna, but \u2019tis the truth you are far more seriously wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with child,\u201d Caelen said in a low voice. \u201cI know not even if you were aware of it yet. She was out fighting for my life when she carries a child. She had to have ridden nonstop to arrive here when she did. God\u2019s teeth, Ewan, but it makes me want to weep like a babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know it,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cBut Rionna is a strong-willed lass. I don\u2019t see her giving up without a fight. She was hell-bent on saving you, damn king and country and whether I agreed or not. Gannon rode into Neamh \u00c1lainn and delivered her orders as imperiously as a man ever did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d Caelen murmured. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t appreciate her for the wonder she is. I tried too hard to change her and mold her into what I thought I wanted.\u201d</p><p>Ewan chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine she put up with that.\u201d</p><p>Caelen smiled ruefully then swore when Ewan began cleaning the arrow wound. \u201cNay, she didn\u2019t. She\u2019s a fierce lass. I ...\u201d He broke off, unable to voice the words. Nay, he wouldn\u2019t speak them here. \u2019Twas not for his brother to hear, but for Rionna, and he wouldn\u2019t give them to anyone but her. She\u2019d fought for them. She\u2019d demanded them. She\u2019d bloody well have them.</p><p>\u201cTell me of Neamh \u00c1lainn,\u201d Caelen said through gritted teeth, as pain swamped over him.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the most beautiful place I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ewan said quietly. \u201cThe keep has existed for over a century and it looks as though it were constructed yesterday. The king\u2019s men have guarded it well since Alexander\u2019s passing. He provided well for Mairin and her firstborn. \u2019Tis a fine legacy bestowed upon Isabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen will seek Isabel as they did Mairin,\u201d Caelen said grimly. \u201c \u2019Tis a fine legacy, aye, but it won\u2019t be an easy burden for the lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have protection that Mairin didn\u2019t,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cMairin was left without someone to guard her until she married. It won\u2019t be the same for Isabel. I\u2019ll watch over her well until she decides who she\u2019ll marry.\u201d</p><p>Caelen smiled at the edge in his brother\u2019s voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll give her a choice then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. She\u2019ll have better than Mairin had. I never want her to feel as desperate as Mairin felt or be forced to choose the lesser of two evils because she\u2019s backed into a corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a good thing. We\u2019ve brought exceptional women into the McCabe clan. We\u2019ll breed little warriors with the fire and intelligence of their mothers for sure.\u201d</p><p>Ewan chuckled. \u201cAye. That we will.\u201d</p><p>Caelen winced again when Ewan poked at the wound. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth, Ewan, are you done yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needs stitching and you\u2019ll lie there and allow it or so help me I\u2019ll sew your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get on with it. I want to get back to Rionna. I\u2019ll not have her think the worst when she doesn\u2019t see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent Alaric to tell her that you\u2019re carrying on as usual and making threats. She\u2019ll know you\u2019re fine when she hears that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t hurt so badly, I\u2019d hit you for that.\u201d</p><p>Ewan grinned. \u201cYou can try. You\u2019re as weak as a newborn babe at the moment. I think Rionna could take you even with a dagger in her back.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sobered. \u201cShe amazes me, Ewan. I don\u2019t even know how to act around her. How can I ever go beyond the fact that she risked all for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do the same for her,\u201d Ewan said bluntly. \u201cIt stands to reason she\u2019d stand up for you as well. They broke the mold when they made her. You\u2019re well blessed, Caelen. I hope you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Ewan said as he sat back. \u201c \u2019Tis stitched and the bleeding has stopped.\u201d</p><p>Caelen tried to rise but he fell back on his side, every bit of his strength gone. His muscles felt like mush, and he was so weak he could barely lift his arm.</p><p>He cursed and struggled to rise again. \u201cHelp me up, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you to the chamber where Rionna is if you swear to stay abed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not bargain with you over Rionna,\u201d Caelen growled. \u201cI\u2019ll not leave her even for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis a serious wound, Caelen. You\u2019re fevered and your strength is gone. You could die if you won\u2019t have a care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me up,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Ewan shook his head and pulled Caelen to a sitting position. \u201cI swear I have no idea whose loins you sprang from. I\u2019m convinced you were left on the steps to the keep when you were a wee bairn.\u201d</p><p>Caelen sobered as he struggled to his feet. Cameron\u2019s words about their father drifted back into his hazy consciousness. He would never know if there was any truth to Cameron\u2019s rantings. But he wouldn\u2019t relate the story to his brothers. There was no need to plant any doubt in their minds. Cameron had existed on hatred and revenge for years and it had brought him nothing. In the end, he\u2019d brought dishonor on himself and the father he claimed to avenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c \u2019Tis over, Ewan,\u201d he said quietly as they hobbled down the hallway. \u201cAfter eight years, \u2019tis over. Cameron is dead and neither of us dealt the killing blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Ewan murmured. \u201cOur father can rest now. He has been avenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Caelen said swiftly. \u201c \u2019Tis not about vengeance. \u2019Tis about what is honorable and just. Cameron acted without honor. He died without honor. \u2019Tis enough.\u201d</p><p>Ewan\u2019s brow furrowed as he cast a sideways glance at his brother. \u201cI owe your wife a debt I can never repay. She not only saved your life, but she killed a man who has caused much grief to my wife and who threatened my daughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Twould seem there are many of us indebted to my wife,\u201d Caelen said dryly.</p><p>Ewan knocked at the chamber door and Caelen pushed impatiently in before the summons was issued. His heart nearly stopped when he saw Rionna sprawled facedown on the bed, face turned to the side and eyes closed.</p><p>Gannon immediately put up a hand. \u201cShe passed out awhile ago, but she\u2019s breathing. The pain became too much for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we give her a potion? Is there a healer in this clan?\u201d Caelen demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll not have her suffer unnecessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe at ease,\u201d Alaric said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to frighten Rionna if she awakens. We\u2019ve convinced her \u2019tis a minor wound and nothing to worry over. She fears more for you than for herself and \u2019tis better that way. \u2019Twill give her something to fight for.\u201d</p> <p>Caelen went to her bedside, battling pain and the mugginess of fever. His head swam and it felt as though he walked through a bog, but he was determined that he\u2019d remain by her side.</p><p>\u201cThe dagger is deep, Ewan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. It\u2019s going to bleed more freely once the blade is out. I\u2019ll have to work fast to stop it and stitch the wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Gannon said gruffly. \u201cThis is naught for her.\u201d</p><p>Caelen had never seen his commander so pale. He hovered over Rionna, clenching and unclenching his fists as if he had no idea what to do.</p><p>\u201cHas there been other bleeding?\u201d Caelen asked fearfully. \u201cShe carries a babe.\u201d</p> <p>Alaric shook his head. \u201cNone that I\u2019ve been able to see. She\u2019s complained of no pain in her stomach. Just in her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed with her before you fall over,\u201d Ewan said crossly. \u201cGet to one side so that when you finally pass out, you won\u2019t be in the way.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the door and Gannon and Alaric both drew their swords. Gannon hurried to answer, opening it just a crack. Then he opened it wider to admit a gray-haired woman who looked to be as old as Methuselah.</p><p>She looked extremely agitated and she wrung her hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cBegging your pardon, Laird McCabe, but I was told you had need of a healer.\u201d</p><p>Ewan gazed sharply at the old woman. \u201cHave you skill?\u201d</p><p>The woman drew herself up and pinned Ewan with a beady stare. \u201cI was versed in the healing arts long afore you were born, laddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a drought for pain and a poultice to rub on the wound after it\u2019s been stitched.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cAye, I have those things. Would you be needing a steady hand to do the stitching? I\u2019m old, aye, but my hand hasn\u2019t wavered in all my sixty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Caelen interjected. He turned to Ewan. \u201cYou do it. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Ewan nodded then gestured toward the older woman. \u201cFetch the items I requested.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and backed from the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need help to pull the dagger from her back,\u201d Ewan said with a grimace. \u201c \u2019Twill have to be done quickly, and then we have to stop the bleeding. Caelen, lie down. If she awakens, it will soothe her to have you near.\u201d</p><p>Caelen crawled onto the bed and collapsed next to her, as his strength finally gave out. His smoothed his hand over the back of her head, stroking her hair that was matted with blood at the ends.</p><p>\u201cWhen \u2019tis done, I\u2019ll bathe you as you once bathed me,\u201d he murmured close to her ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit by the fire and I\u2019ll brush your hair and then feed you by my hand. I\u2019ll read you all the thoughts I\u2019ve written down since the day I first laid eyes on you. \u2019Tis the truth I wanted you even then. Even when you belonged to my brother.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek, trying to infuse some color. It was pale and cool.</p><p>\u201cBuild up the fire,\u201d he said to Gannon. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to be cold. I\u2019d have her as comfortable as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlace your hands on either side of the dagger,\u201d Ewan instructed Alaric. \u201cI want you to push down when I pull. As soon as the dagger is free, press your hands firmly over the wound.\u201d</p><p>Alaric nodded and Caelen moved in close until his lips brushed her temple.</p><p>\u201cBe brave, lass,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAs brave as you\u2019ve been through everything else. I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll not leave you.\u201d</p><p>Ewan nodded at Alaric and then took hold of the dagger and pulled. Rionna jerked. Her eyes flew open, panic flaring in their depths. She cried out and began to struggle.</p><p>The knife came free, bathed in blood, and Alaric pressed down on the wound as Rionna writhed beneath him.</p><p>\u201cShh, Rionna, \u2019tis I, Caelen. Be at ease, lass. We\u2019re helping you. \u2019Tis Ewan my brother who has pulled the dagger from your back.\u201d</p><p>Ewan cut impatiently at her tunic until her back was bare. Caelen closed his eyes as he saw blood stream from underneath Alaric\u2019s palms.</p><p>Rionna whimpered as Alaric pressed harder, and Caelen reached for her hand.</p><p>Her fingers bit into his palm, her nails digging deep. He didn\u2019t mind the pain for if it helped her to bear hers, he\u2019d do anything.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis like fire,\u201d Rionna gasped. \u201cOh God, it burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it, lass. It will be over soon. I swear it. Breathe for me. Look at me. Only at me and put this from your mind.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze found his, her eyes wide and panicked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to stitch the wound,\u201d Caelen said calmly. \u201cI want you to focus on me. Push the pain from your mind and imagine holding our bairn.\u201d</p><p>Some of the wildness eased from her eyes and soft joy replaced the pain.</p><p>The next hour was a test of Caelen\u2019s endurance. Weakened from his own injuries, fevered, and in a great deal of pain himself, he coaxed Rionna through every stitch that Ewan set. When her face went gray with pain, he kissed her and talked of their child. When she was near to passing out, he stroked her cheek and told her he loved her.</p><p>By the time Ewan was done with the last of it, Caelen was barely conscious himself.</p><p>Ewan stepped back from the bed and wiped his brow with the back of his arm. \u201c \u2019Tis done, Caelen. \u2019Tis in God\u2019s hands now.\u201d</p><p>Caelen didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cCaelen?\u201d</p><p>Ewan bent over the bed to see that his brother had finally succumbed to unconsciousness. He glanced up at Alaric and Gannon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried for them both. They both have grievous wounds and have lost a lot of blood. But \u2019tis Caelen\u2019s that went the longest without care and they\u2019d already began to fester. He has a fever already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Gannon asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe bear them back home and pray that God is merciful.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Rionna woke, awash in pain. Her entire body felt stretched and tight as if her skin fit too snugly. Her lips were dry and cracked and she\u2019d sell her soul for just a taste of water.</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d a sweet voice soothed.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019ve died, haven\u2019t I?\u201d Rionna said in disgust.</p><p>There was a light chuckle. \u201cNow why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have the voice of an angel.\u201d</p><p>Rionna pried open one eye, never imagining it could hurt so much to do something so insignificant.</p><p>\u201cKeeley,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Then she frowned because she wasn\u2019t sure where here was. She looked around to see that she was in her old chamber at McDonald keep.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m here. Would I be anywhere else when those I love are in need of my skills?\u201d</p><p>Keeley eased onto the bed beside Rionna, holding a goblet of water. \u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I want to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Keeley laughed again. \u201cNot dramatic, are you?\u201d</p><p>Rionna sucked thirstily at the liquid, ignoring the pain that her movement caused. When she was done, she eased back down onto the pillow and closed her eyes to ward off the spasm of discomfort that gripped her.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I in here?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t want to read too much into why she wasn\u2019t in Caelen\u2019s chamber\u2014the chamber they\u2019d shared ever since Caelen had fetched her from this very room.</p><p>Keeley placed a cool hand on Rionna\u2019s forehead and rubbed soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you in a room with no windows. You burned with fever for so many days. The draft from the windows was too cold and yet I didn\u2019t want a fire to keep you overwarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat made no sense to me,\u201d Rionna said tiredly.</p><p>Keeley smiled down at her as Rionna opened her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Caelen?\u201d she asked, voicing the question that had burned in her mind from the moment she woke up.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t yet awakened.\u201d</p><p>Rionna struggled up, nearly fainting from the red-hot pain that lanced through her back. \u201cHow long have I lain here?\u201d she asked hoarsely, ignoring Keeley\u2019s attempts to make her lie back down.</p><p>\u201cThe journey back here took two days and you\u2019ve been insensible with fever for the last seven.\u201d</p><p>Panic gripped Rionna by the throat. It took every bit of her strength, but she pushed Keeley aside and forced herself up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she demanded, even as she staggered toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere is who? Rionna, stop at once. You\u2019re too weak and you\u2019ve still got a fever.\u201d</p><p>She threw open the door. \u201cCaelen,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his chamber, of course. Now come back. For God\u2019s sake, you\u2019ve naught on but your nightdress.\u201d</p><p>Rionna warded off Keeley\u2019s grasp and strode down the hallway and around the bend. Gannon stood outside Caelen\u2019s door and he didn\u2019t look at all happy to see her.</p><p>He rushed to catch her before her knees gave out. \u201cSweet Jesu, my lady. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Keeley caught up to Rionna just as she tried to shake off Gannon\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cMove out of my way,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cI would see my husband for myself.\u201d</p><p>Gannon\u2019s eyes softened and he wrapped a strong arm around her waist. \u201cIf I let you inside, you have to swear you\u2019ll return to your bed. \u2019Tis the truth you look like death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Rionna grumbled. \u201cYou flatter me so.\u201d</p><p>Keeley turned her lips in to hide the smile. \u201cI\u2019ll wait out here, Rionna. But I\u2019m coming in to get you after a moment. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might take more than a moment to convince my stubborn husband he\u2019s not going to die,\u201d Rionna bit out as she walked through the door.</p><p>Gannon and Keeley exchanged puzzled glances but Rionna was already gone.</p><p>Rionna barely made it to Caelen\u2019s bed before her legs gave out. She perched herself on the edge and looked upon her husband\u2019s face. He looked at peace. No lines carved across his forehead. He lay so still that it frightened her.</p><p>Then anger consumed her and she leaned forward so that she was close to his face and there was no chance he couldn\u2019t hear her. She\u2019d make him hear her, by God.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, husband, and listen well,\u201d she all but shouted at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll not die on me. Not after all I did to save your sorry hide. Is this how you show your gratitude? By dying on me after all? \u2019Tis a disgrace, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p><p>She framed his face in her hands and leaned farther down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll fight, damn it. You\u2019ll not give over this easily. God is not ready for you yet because I am not through with you. You\u2019re going to wake up and you\u2019re going to give me the words I\u2019ve waited on for so long. Telling me you love me on the battlefield as we both lay dying doesn\u2019t count. You\u2019ll give them to me and mean them or so help me I\u2019ll bury you in unconsecrated ground so that you never rest and you\u2019ll be forced to dwell in this keep with me for eternity.\u201d</p><p>To her complete surprise, his eyes opened and a smile curved his lips upward. Warmth gleamed in those beautiful green eyes as he stared up at her.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes until she could no longer even see his face. Relief was so sweet and so overwhelming that she couldn\u2019t hold herself up. He gripped her arms and lowered her to his chest as she lay exhausted over him.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you woke me for, wife? To beat the words from me? I would have gladly given them to you except you\u2019ve been unconscious the last days and I grew tired of saying them to a woman who couldn\u2019t hear me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushed herself off his chest and glared down at him. \u201cWhat? But I thought you hadn\u2019t yet awakened. I thought you were dying. Keeley said you hadn\u2019t yet awakened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I hadn\u2019t,\u201d he said in an amused voice. \u201c \u2019Tis the truth it was late when I took to my bed and I only did so because Gannon threatened to knock me over the head to force me to sleep if I didn\u2019t leave your bedside.\u201d</p><p>Weak tears slid down her cheeks. She could barely breathe for the relief beating in her chest. \u201cYou weren\u2019t dying. You\u2019re going to be all right. You won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of leaving you, lass.\u201d</p> <p>Then he fixed her with a stern scowl.</p><p>\u201cYou, however, are not so assured of glowing health. You should not be out of bed. \u2019Tis the truth you look like you\u2019re but a few steps out of the grave.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, he ran trembling hands over her arms and then up to her face.</p><p>\u201cHow typical that you spring from your deathbed to prevent me from going to mine,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou worried me, lass. The last days have been the longest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not go back to that chamber,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cWhen I woke, I worried that you were still angry with me and that I\u2019d been banished from our chamber. \u2019Tis not a feeling I ever want to experience again.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes went soft and he gently rolled her so that she lay beside him on the bed. He fussed and rearranged the furs, making sure she was comfortable and without pain. How could she think of pain when the husband she thought lay dying was staring at her with love in his eyes?</p><p>\u201cIf I have my way, we\u2019ll never be separated again,\u201d he said. \u201cGod\u2019s teeth, Rionna. You frightened at least a decade from my life. I was so worried for you and our babe.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s hand went automatically to her stomach, her expression panicked.</p><p>Caelen laid his hand over hers and she calmed. \u201cAye, our bairn is still there, wedged in his mother\u2019s womb. I\u2019ve no doubt that he or she is every bit the fierce warrior that their mother is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she said, as he turned on his side next to her. \u201cSo much is a blur. I don\u2019t remember much of the battle. I was so terrified.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair and kissed her forehead as if he couldn\u2019t bear not to touch her.</p> <p>\u201cYou were magnificent. You saved me. \u2019Tis a fact I\u2019ll not forget in this lifetime. You led our clan into battle. You were the fiercest warrior princess that ever was.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and looked suspiciously up at him. \u201cHow came you by that term?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cKeeley told me of your childhood dreams. Aye, Rionna, you\u2019re my warrior princess.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted and she sighed at the adoration in her warrior\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ashamed that for so long I tried to mold you into someone else,\u201d he said with a grimace. \u201cBut \u2019tis the truth, from the first day I saw you attired in those trews and a man\u2019s tunic, wielding a sword as deftly as any warrior, I wanted you so badly I ached with it. I thought if I forced you to be something you were not, \u2019twould temper my fierce need for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you recognized in me the mirror of yourself. Your other half,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did, but I fought it. But no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll let me fight alongside you?\u201d she asked with a raised eyebrow.</p> <p>He leaned down to kiss her. His breath stuttered out unevenly and it took him a moment to respond. \u201cI\u2019ll not lie. \u2019Tis my wish to forever keep you here and under my protection. I died a thousand deaths watching you in battle. Part of me was so proud. I wanted to shout to the world, Look at her! She is mine! The other part of me wanted to drag you as far from danger as I could and keep you from harm all the days of your life. I can only promise not to be so rigid in the future. I\u2019ll not ever be accepting of anything that puts you in danger.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and laid her head on his shoulder. \u201c \u2019Tis enough you love me and accept what I am, faults and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love you well, lass. \u2019Tis one promise I can make and vow to keep. I\u2019ll love you until I draw my last breath and beyond. You were made for me. I cannot imagine a more perfect mate.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Keeley stormed in, Gannon on her heels. Behind them, Alaric and Ewan crowded in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had long enough,\u201d Keeley said. \u201c \u2019Tis time to return to your bed. You\u2019re not well, Rionna.\u201d</p><p>Caelen turned and smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll remain here where she belongs. Her fever has broken and I\u2019ll be sure to keep the furs tight over the windows so no draft blows in.\u201d</p><p>Ewan walked farther into the room and then came to stand over the bed where Rionna and Caelen lay.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis relieved I am to hear you\u2019ve awakened, Rionna. For I would offer you my deepest gratitude before I return to Mairin and Isabel.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit together in confusion. Caelen chuckled softly.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even realize all she has done. It would appear her sole aim was to save her husband\u2019s worthless hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my thanks for saving my brother. He\u2019s difficult and grumpy, but a more loyal man I\u2019ll never find. He\u2019s suffered for the sins of others for far too long.\u201d</p><p>Rionna smiled as Ewan continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd as much as I wanted the duty myself, I would also thank you for ridding the world of Duncan Cameron. I have it on good authority the king will bestow his gratitude on you personally. Without the support of Cameron, Malcolm\u2019s rebellion is dead. He hasn\u2019t the resources or the support to launch a bid for the throne. Indeed, the whole of the highlands is in your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say I thought of all that just before I thrust my sword through Cameron\u2019s back, but \u2019tis the truth, my only aim was to prevent him from killing my husband,\u201d she said ruefully.</p><p>The others laughed and Caelen squeezed her to him as he kissed her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019ll rest now,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHere in my arms where I know you\u2019re safe and I can watch over you and our babe.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes. \u201cAye. \u2019Tis where I want to be most.\u201d</p><p>Never looking away from his wife or moving his lips from her temple, he raised his hand and waved the others away.</p><p>Keeley\u2019s gaze was misty as she stared at the two entwined on the bed. Alaric chuckled softly and pulled her into his side.</p><p>Even Gannon and Ewan wore soft smiles as they tiptoed quietly from the room.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Rionna yelped when Mairin stuck another pin in her hair. She tried to rub at the spot, but Keeley grabbed her hand and forced it away from her hair.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis important you look perfect this day,\u201d Mairin said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d Rionna muttered. \u201cIf the king wanted to thank me, a private word would be sufficient. All this pomp makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>Keeley and Mairin exchanged conspiratorial glances and Rionna was quick to latch on.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What mischief are you two brewing? I saw that look.\u201d</p><p>Keeley rolled her eyes. \u201cWe just want you to look stunning. Your recovery has been long. The weather is beautiful today. You should shine as marvelously as the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a silver tongue, Keeley McCabe. I see your aim. Ply me with flattery so I\u2019ll forget that look between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Mairin laughed. \u201cOh, Rionna, do stop. Now let me look at you.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and Rionna ran a nervous hand over the burgeoning swell of her belly. Keeley and Mairin had worked to let out the waist so that it wouldn\u2019t be too constricting. The result, Rionna had to admit, was wonderful.</p><p>The dress flowed to her ankles and hid the evidence of her pregnancy. Only a slight distension at the waist hinted at her condition. And the dress itself was a masterpiece. Rionna could scarcely believe such a creation belonged to her.</p><p>Miles and miles of amber velvet trimmed with golden threads and russet embroidery. It was a tribute to her hair and all the varying shades of the sunset it embodied.</p><p>For all her grumblings, Rionna wanted to look stunning. Aye, she wanted her husband to look upon her and see naught else. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her to be nervous over the king\u2019s visit or his tribute to her. Nay, she worried only over her husband\u2019s reaction to her appearance.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis time,\u201d Mairin said.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis time for what?\u201d Rionna asked in exasperation. \u201cThe two of you are acting so secretive.\u201d</p><p>Keeley smiled mysteriously and took Rionna\u2019s arm to guide her from the chamber. \u201cWe are to deliver you to the balcony overlooking the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>The two women tucked their arms through Rionna\u2019s and walked her out of the chamber and to the doorway leading outside to the balcony.</p><p>Rionna squinted at the sudden wash of sunshine but then closed her eyes and allowed the warmth to pour over her. It felt so good to be outside again. She inhaled deeply the sweet-scented air. Spring had at long last arrived and the earth burst with green, the snows long since melted and replaced by vibrant carpets of color.</p><p>She opened her eyes and glanced down to see all the McDonald warriors assembled in the courtyard. To the right, Caelen\u2019s two brothers stood and beside them was seated the king, surrounded by his guard.</p><p>Rionna looked back to comment to Mairin and Keeley but found them gone. Befuddled, she turned her attention back to the courtyard in time to see her husband stride out to stand in front of the assembled men.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t them he faced or them he addressed. He turned and stared up at her. Quiet descended on the courtyard and Rionna swallowed, suddenly nervous and unsure of what was happening.</p><p>And then Caelen\u2019s voice rang out over the courtyard: \u201cRionna McDonald, I stand here today because you assembled your warriors and came for me with a plan so crazed that it was brilliant. You risked your life because you loved me. I have not a gesture so grand as yours to prove my love and regard. You once told me you demanded the words and you demanded the part of my heart you swore I locked away from you. \u2019Tis the truth that no part of me was safe from your possession.\u201d</p><p>Rionna gripped the stone edge of the curved balcony wall and leaned forward as she drank in her husband\u2019s appearance and let his words slide like silk over her ears.</p><p>\u201cNay, my gesture is not as grand as yours. You were willing to sacrifice all because you considered me yours and were unwilling to let me go.</p><p>\u201cI once made the mistake of trying to change who you were. I tried to take a bold, courageous woman and make her into a meek, mild-mannered genteel lady because I thought I would be safe from her. \u2019Twas the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made and one I\u2019ll regret all my days.</p><p>\u201cI offer you the words now, wife. I love you. I love my warrior princess. I say it in front of my king, my clan. Our clan. So that you\u2019ll know how very loved and cherished you are.\u201d</p><p>A roar of approval went up from the men. They raised their swords and whoops and whistles rose sharply through the air.</p><p>She pressed her fist to her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t embarrass herself or Caelen by bursting into tears. \u201cI love you, too, my gruff warrior,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI gathered my king and my family today to rectify a wrong,\u201d Caelen continued when the cheers diminished. He turned then, partly to include the McDonald men in his address. \u201cThe McDonalds deserve to have their name live on. \u2019Tis a noble and courageous thing they did for the laird who bore not their name and for the king who divided their clan.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he raised his gaze once more to find Rionna\u2019s. His love was a tangible warmth crowding his clear green eyes.</p><p>\u201cHenceforth I will no longer be known as Caelen McCabe. From this day forward I take the name of Caelen McDonald. May our clan live long, and the glory of the day a golden-haired warrior princess led them into battle be retold for many years to come.\u201d</p><p>Rionna\u2019s mouth dropped open. Stunned silence settled over the courtyard as the warriors all stared at Caelen. The women who\u2019d gathered to hear the address put their hands to their mouths. Some openly wept and others brought their aprons to their eyes.</p><p>Ewan stared at his brother with pride while Mairin, who\u2019d gone to join her husband, wiped tears from her face.</p><p>And then Rionna was running. She flew into the keep and down the stairs, grasping her skirts in tight fists so she didn\u2019t fall. She burst out of the door of the keep and there was Caelen, standing before her, the king, his brothers, and their clan.</p><p>She stopped before she hurled herself into his arms, remembering his admonishment so many months earlier about showing affection in front of his men.</p><p>\u201cIf you wait any longer to come to me, I\u2019ll tackle you here in front of everyone,\u201d Caelen said in a low voice.</p><p>With a cry she launched herself into his arms and he caught her against him as she fused her mouth to his in a kiss that her clansmen would talk about years later.</p><p>He spun her around and around as her laughter filled the air. Around them their clan gathered, joyous and celebrating. When he finally lowered her to the ground, he kept her pressed to his chest as he stared into her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, lass.

I like it.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p> <p>Caelen quietly let himself into his chamber, his newborn son nestled in his arms. A few feet away, Rionna slept, exhausted from the birth.</p><p>Carefully, so as not to awaken her, he lay the babe next to her and stood looking down on the most precious things in his life.</p><p>The celebration was still ongoing below. His brothers and their wives had traveled to McDonald keep for the birth, and Caelen had gone down to present his son to his clan.</p><p>He could go back down and leave Rionna to rest, but he found himself going to his desk and taking out his scrolls, quill, and inkwell.</p><p>As he\u2019d told Rionna, he wasn\u2019t an eloquent man and could oft express himself better in writing than he could aloud. Today was such a day, for his heart was so full he could never hope to fully put into speech all that he felt.</p> <p>He opened the scroll and hastily scrawled the year and the day, for this was an important entry. The day that marked the birth of his son.</p><p>But \u2019twas his wife he found himself thinking on as he sat writing by the light of a candle. Every once in awhile he looked up and smiled a contented smile as he watched his wife and child sleep.</p><p>When he\u2019d finished the last of his entry, he scattered sand to dry the ink and then looked one last time at all he\u2019d written.</p><p>Today will long be a day that lasts in my memory. I was sore afraid as Rionna struggled to bring forth life from her womb, but I needn\u2019t have worried, for my warrior princess was as fierce as ever. And indeed she presented me a fine, squalling son, with a satisfied smile upon her face. She informs me that my son will bear my green eyes and dark hair because she commands it. I\u2019ll not gainsay her, for \u2019tis widely known that I cannot deny her anything.</p><p>She rests now and I cannot help but stare and marvel at the miracle she represents. I\u2019ll never forget the day I first saw her and how she fascinated me with her mannish attire, the sword she wielded with the skill of a warrior, and the challenge in her beautiful eyes. She\u2019s spoken before of a time when part of my heart was withheld from her because it belonged to another, but from the moment I laid eyes on her, I belonged solely to her.</p><p>Ah, lass, I think I have always loved you, for \u2019tis the truth I cannot ever remember a time I didn\u2019t.</p>  </body></html>"]
