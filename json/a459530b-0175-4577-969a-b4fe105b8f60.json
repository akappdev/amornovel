Vanity. Perfection. Three words my mother adores. They mean more to her than her husband, her daughters, and life. Without these attributes, she thinks she\u2019d be better off dead. Without me having these attributes, she would disown me. Be flawless. Shine bright. Never, ever do anything less than excel. These are her rules and the vanity that makes up my life. And my father isn\u2019t any better. In fact, I think he might be worse, because even with beauty, perfection, and flawlessness, I\u2019m still never good enough.</p><p>The constant need to be perfect continuously overwhelms me and makes me feel like I\u2019m going to be crushed from the pressure. Sometimes I swear my house can shrink and expand, that the walls can close in and then retreat. When I\u2019m alone in my house, the space feels overly immense with too many rooms, too many walls. But when I\u2019m in it with my parents it seems like I can\u2019t get enough space, almost as if I can\u2019t breathe, even if we\u2019re on opposite sides of the house.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m always doing something wrong and they\u2019re always reminding me of my unforgiveable mistakes. Either I\u2019m not doing enough to appease them or I\u2019m not doing things well enough. There are always rules to follow. Sit up straight. Don\u2019t slouch. Don\u2019t talk unless you\u2019re spoken too. Don\u2019t screw up. Be perfect. Look pretty. We have expectations and standards to live up to. We must be perfect on the outside, despite what\u2019s on the inside. I get so exhausted by the rules. I\u2019m fourteen years old and all I want to do is have fun for once in my life and not wear sweater sets, slacks, and designer dresses, not worry about my hair being shimmering and sleek, my skin flawless. If I could, I would cut off my hair and dye it some wild color, like fiery red or streak it with black. I would wear heavy eyeliner and dark red lipstick. I would do anything as long is it was really me. At the moment, I\u2019m not sure who that is, though. I only know the me my mother created.</p><p>I\u2019m getting tired of it. I don\u2019t want to worry about what everyone thinks of my family. I don\u2019t want to have to sit at a dinner table that is big enough to seat twenty when there are only three of us. I don\u2019t want to be forced to eat food that looks like it still needs to be cooked. I don\u2019t want to endure one more dinner where I\u2019m told every single thing I\u2019ve done wrong. I want them to just let me be myself and maybe, perhaps tell me that they love me. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m always screwing up. I want to feel loved. I really do.</p><p>\u201cLila Summers,\u201d my mom says, her tone clipped as she snaps her finger at me. \u201cDon\u2019t slouch at the table. You\u2019ll get bad posture and it will mess up your height, or worse, you\u2019ll get a hump on your back. Imagine how hideous you\u2019d look then.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, I straighten my shoulders, lifting my chest up, and continue to push the food around on my plate with my silverware. \u201cYes, mother.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a dirty look, displeased with my disrespectful tone. She just had her regular Botox treatment and her face looks frozen in place; nothing moves, wrinkles, or reveals any kind of emotion whatsoever. Then again, that\u2019s how my mother is with or without Botox treatments. To show feeling is to show weakness, something my father and mother despise, along with failure, underachievement, and embarrassment to the family name, something I frequently cause.</p> <p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it seem just a little bit silly,\u201d I say, knowing I\u2019m treading on thin ice. My father hates when we question the rules, but sometimes I can\u2019t keep my mouth shut, because I keep it shut too often. \u201cTo not be able to slouch just a little since we\u2019re the only ones here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should start having her eat at her own table,\u201d my father says, taking a bite of his asparagus. \u201cYou know how I feel about distractions while I\u2019m eating.\u201d He\u2019s always in a pissy mood, but he\u2019s extra pissy today. He had to join my mother at a mandatory meeting at my school with the principal because I got caught ditching yesterday. It wasn\u2019t really a big deal. I just missed gym, but they got called in and that in and of itself caused an embarrassment to my father, which he repeatedly reminded me of in the car ride home.</p><p>\u201cShe never does anything right,\u201d he\u2019d said to my mother as we drove home. \u201cI\u2019m so sick and tired of the drama. Either she needs to straighten up or she needs to go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said it like I was a dog or something equally as easy to discard.</p><p>My mother continues to glare at me from across the table, warning me to keep my mouth shut, that my father is not in mood for any arguing\u2014like he ever is. She has blue eyes and blonde hair identical to mine, but her hair has started to gray so she dyes it once every couple of weeks so her roots won\u2019t show. She gets manicures, won\u2019t wear anything else besides name-brand designers, and has a shoe closet that\u2019s as big as a lot of people\u2019s houses. She likes her expensive wine and of course her medication. I hope to God I don\u2019t grow up to be her, but if my mom has her way, I\u2019ll be married off to some well-known family\u2019s son, despite the fact that we won\u2019t be in love. Love is stupid. Love won\u2019t get you happiness, she always says. It\u2019s how my mother and father met, which is probably why they sit on opposite ends of the dining table and never make eye contact. Sometimes I wonder how I was ever created, since I\u2019ve never even seen them kiss.</p><p>My father\u2019s phone chimes from inside his shirt pocket and he slips it out, checking the screen. He hesitates, and then silences it before returning it to his pocket.</p> <p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d my mother asks, even though she already knows. We all do. Even the maids.</p><p>\u201cBusiness,\u201d he mutters and stuffs his mouth with asparagus.</p><p>Business is his twenty-four-year-old mistress, who my mother knows about but won\u2019t ever say anything to my father about. I overheard her talking to her mother about it and they\u2019d both agreed that it was a sacrifice of her luxurious life. My mother acted like it was no big deal, but I could hear the hurt in her tone then like I can spot agitation in her eyes now. I think it makes her feel like she\u2019s losing her beauty and youth, since she\u2019s getting older, grayer, and the wrinkles are starting to show.</p><p>\u201cWell, will you please tell business not to call at the dinner table?\u201d She stabs her fork into her chicken. \u201cAnd Lila, I will not warn you again. Sit up straight or you will go to your room without dinner. You\u2019re going to end up with a hump on your back and then no one will ever want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think we should reconsider sending her to that boarding school in New York that you sent Abby to,\u201d my father says without looking at me. He straightens his tie and takes a bite of food. \u201cActually, I think we should. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about raising her anymore. It\u2019s too much drama and I don\u2019t have the patience for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow Douglas, I don\u2019t think we need to send her that far away,\u201d my mother says, letting the mistress call go like it\u2019s as easy as popping one of the pills she takes every morning.</p><p>It\u2019s almost the same conversation they have every single night. My dad says, \u201cHey, let\u2019s send her away\u201d to which my mother replies, \u201cNow, Douglas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been getting into too much trouble.\u201d My father grimaces, cutting his chicken. \u201cSkipping school to go shopping and hanging out with people who aren\u2019t up to our standards. She has average grades at best and zero accomplishments besides looking pretty. I ran into Fort Allman the other day and his son just got accepted to Yale.\u201d He stuffs a bite full of chicken into his mouth and chews it completely before speaking. \u201cWhat do we have to show for ourselves, Julie? Two daughters, one who\u2019s been to rehab two times and the other who\u2019s probably going to end up pregnant before the end of her freshman year of high school. She needs some sort of direction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to get pregnant,\u201d I argue, feeling myself shrink, my shoulders hunching in. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a boyfriend yet. Not a serious one anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too much of a flirt.\u201d He talks over me with disdain in his voice, like he\u2019s ashamed of who I am. \u201cShe\u2019s turning out to be just like Abby and I don\u2019t want another one of those in our house. I want something I can be proud of and boarding school may be able to turn her around, if it isn\u2019t too late already.\u201d</p><p>It feels like I\u2019m running out of breathing space, the walls closing in, ready to crush me to pieces. My shoulders bend inward even more until I\u2019m pretty much curled up in ball.</p><p>\u201cShe will turn into someone you\u2019ll be proud of\u2014I\u2019ll make sure of that. I promise,\u201d she says in a timid voice, rearranging her vegetables on the porcelain plate. \u201cShe just needs a little bit more discipline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d he asks. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, cutting her chicken into thin slices, and I can hear the knife scraping the plate.</p><p>My father looks at me and his brown eyes are cold, his jaw firm, and his expression stoic. \u201cAt her age I already knew what college I was going to go to, where I\u2019d work, and I even helped my father out at his office three times a week. What has she accomplished? Looking pretty? Wearing nice clothes? Becoming you, Julie? I don\u2019t see how that will be beneficial to her future. Unless she can find someone to marry her, which at this point, I can assure you no one will.\u201d He says it with such arrogance and self-worth. \u201cShe needs to start focusing less on boys and clothes and more on school and work. She needs to stop being such a God damn screwup, and until she does I don\u2019t want her in this house.\u201d</p><p>I tell myself to breathe, that the walls aren\u2019t really closing in and that I\u2019m not going to get crumpled into pieces. That feelings stabbing inside me are just feelings and one day I won\u2019t feel so worthless\u2014one day I\u2019ll feel loved. That my father is just being himself, the same way his father was with him (I know because I\u2019ve seen it). My sister, Abby, assures me there\u2019s an entire world out there, past parents, money, expectations, and vanity. One that you can be yourself in\u2014be free to be whoever you want, whatever that might be. She says she\u2019s free now and it\u2019s the most breathtakingly wonderful experience ever, despite her less-than-perfect living conditions and life choices. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDouglas, I really think\u2014\u201d my mother starts, but my father cuts her off, holding up his hand to silence her.</p><p>\u201cYou assured me when we decided to have kids that I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with them,\u201d my father says, his tone chilled like ice. \u201cYou said that you would take care of them and that I would only have to focus on my job. But now I\u2019m here, with daughter number two and she\u2019s giving me just as much of a headache as daughter number one. This is not what I signed up for.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I picture my father on his wedding day scribbling his John Hancock on a contract that says he won\u2019t have to deal with his kids if my mother chooses to have them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do better,\u201d I dare say. \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll try.\u201d My father lets out a low, derisive laugh as he drops the fork onto his plate. \u201cJulie, she needs to go to boarding school. It\u2019ll be good for her.\u201d He doesn\u2019t speak to me. He rarely does, like I\u2019m not good enough for him to speak to.</p><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll send her,\u201d my mother says abruptly, with her chin tipped low. \u201cI\u2019ll set it up first thing on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I know better than to raise my voice at the dinner table, but this has to count as an exception. I shove my plate forward as I place my hands on the table. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that! I\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d</p><p>My dad overlaps his hands on the table and finally speaks to me. \u201cI will do whatever the hell I want. You are my daughter, you carry my last name, and therefore you will act how I want you to and go wherever I send you. And if I say go to boarding school, then you will go.\u201d</p> <p>It feels like there\u2019s no room left between the walls and the table and myself. I\u2019m going to get smashed between them if I don\u2019t get out of there. I push my chair back from the table. I know better than to act like this, but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. \u201cWhat about my friends? School? My life here? I can\u2019t just leave that all behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friends aren\u2019t suitable for you,\u201d my mother says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got you missing school and getting into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have not,\u201d I protest. \u201cI\u2019ve barely done anything and what I have done is normal for a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d my father demands. \u201cYou will not get up until you\u2019ve finished your dinner.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I step back from the table. \u201cThis is such bullshit!\u201d I\u2019ve had only a few outbursts like this and every one resulted in my being punished by a very long lecture about how insignificant I am to this family.</p><p>He scowls at my mother. \u201cTake care of your daughter.\u201d</p> <p>She quickly stands up, placing her hands on top of the white linen tablecloth. \u201cLila\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hurry out of the dining room, heading for the stairs, but at the last second, I turn for the foyer, taking long strides, eager to get the hell away from this place, just like my sister, Abby, did. I want to run away from them. Disappear. She used to do it all the time until one day they sent her away and she never came back to the house again.</p><p>I hear my mom yell and her high heels click across the marble floor as she chases after me. \u201cLila Summers, don\u2019t you dare leave this house!\u201d</p><p>I throw open the front door and the warmth and sunshine surround me. The house alarm also goes off, but I don\u2019t turn back to turn it off. I sprint down the brick-paved driveway and press the code for the gate to open. I can hear my mother shouting, but I run through the gate and down the sidewalk, seeking freedom. I want to get away from them and their rules. I can\u2019t go to boarding school. I have a life here. I have friends who care about me, and without Steph, Janie, and Cindy, I\u2019ll have no one. I\u2019ll be alone.</p><p>The idea is frightening and the fear sends an adrenaline rush through my body. My legs and arms move quickly, carrying me down the block. I don\u2019t stop running until I reach the bus stop a couple of miles down the road where the neighborhood changes from massive, eccentric mansions to ordinary, less appealing suburbs. I\u2019ve ridden the bus only once, but I think I can handle it, and right now I have no other option. I don\u2019t have my phone on me so I can either wander around, go home or take the bus to my sister\u2019s place and stay there for a little while. Reaching into the pocket of my pants, I take out a twenty dollar bill. Then I sit down on the bench and wait for the bus that goes downtown to the main street in the city.</p><p>It takes a while for the bus to arrive and I\u2019m kind of surprised that my mother doesn\u2019t show up by the time I\u2019m boarding, although the idea of her endeavoring to this area seems implausible. I try to pretend that it\u2019s not a big deal, even though it is. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t show up so I don\u2019t have to hear her lectures. But if I admit the truth to myself, the painful, ugly truth, I wish she had shown up because it\u2019d mean that maybe she cared about me enough to look for me.</p><p>The bus ride takes forever and the seat I end up in has a funny smell to it, like unwashed socks mixed with a very overwhelming floral scent. It\u2019s crowded, too, and some of the people look really sketchy. Like the guy across from me who keeps licking his lips as he stares at me. He has his shoelaces unlaced, there are holes in his jeans, and he looks only a few years older than me. He\u2019s not ugly but the scars and slightly bumpy skin would make my mother instantly deem him unworthy of the finer things in life. Only the beautiful deserve to be rich. (I actually heard her say this once to my grandmother during one of their drunken heart-to-hearts.)</p><p>\u201cYou got any cash on ya?\u201d he asks, sliding to the edge of his seat, rubbing his unshaven jawline.</p> <p>I shake my head and turn my knees toward the wall. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He eyes the pockets of my pants while he keeps licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I scoot toward the window, while he continues to stare at me like a creeper.</p><p>\u201cYou are fucking fine. You know that?\u201d he asks and for a second I feel flattered, but in an uncomfortable way. \u201cAre you lost or something?\u201d he wonders and when I don\u2019t answer, he puts his hand on my knee. \u201cIf you want, I can help you find your way back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I utter quietly, my pulse accelerating as he glides his hand up my leg.</p><p>\u201cWhy, sweetheart?\u201d he asks, his hand reaching my thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you know that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move right away. It takes me a minute to sort through the confusion in my head, because my head and my body are saying two different things. It\u2019s not like a guy hasn\u2019t touched me before, but for some reason this guy\u2019s hand on my thigh makes me feel special. Human contact, skin to skin. I hate that I feel starved of it and there\u2019s a slight bit of enjoyment his touch brings, which makes me feel ashamed and dirty, yet at the same time wanted. And I rarely feel wanted.</p><p>Working up the courage, I fling his hand off my leg. He starts laughing at me, but doesn\u2019t say anything else, and finally he gets off the bus, making a remark about me going with him so he can show me a \u201creal good time.\u201d</p><p>I unstiffen a little once he\u2019s gone and try to stay focused on the outside as the bus passes street after street, the sun dipping lower on the horizon until it vanishes altogether. My reflection stares back at me through the window nearly the entire ride: my deep-set blue eyes, shoulder-length blonde hair, and my fair complexion that\u2019s so smooth everyone thinks I wear makeup but I don\u2019t. Beauty. I get told I have it all the time and people seem envious of it, yet it never gets me what I want. Love. Affection. To feel whole inside instead of so empty.</p><p>It\u2019s dark by the time I reach my destination and the air has gotten chilly. The neighborhood my sister lives in doesn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s in the rundown section and there are a lot of people roaming up and down the sidewalks littered with garbage. There\u2019s a man passed out on the bench at the bus stop, along with a group of guys standing in a circle shouting in front of a vacant building with boarded-up windows. One of the guys notices me when I step off the bus and he nudges the guy to the side of him, saying something in a low voice. They both look at me and I don\u2019t like the expressions on their faces or the fact that they\u2019re three times my size.</p><p>I veer to my right, even though my sister\u2019s place is to the left, just to avoid walking by them. I keep my head tucked down, wanting to hide what I look like, because, like I\u2019ve experienced before, my looks can cause trouble.</p><p>\u201cHey, where you goin\u2019, baby?\u201d one of them shouts out, his eyes following me. \u201cCome back here and play.\u201d</p><p>I take off and don\u2019t slow down until I\u2019ve rounded two of the corners on the block, practically making a U-turn. Finally, I reach a quieter area of the sidewalk, which borders a chain-link fence around a junkyard. I continue walking with my head tucked down, walking swiftly, until I reach my sister\u2019s apartment a few blocks down.</p><p>I remember when I first visited her, how shocked I\u2019d been. She\u2019d just been kicked out of the boarding school for drug possession and my dad wouldn\u2019t let her move back home or give her any help financially. She\u2019d left home a loudmouth who liked to speak her mind, and rebelled every once and while, but nothing major. When she returned, she was subdued, addicted to drugs, and barely acted like the sister I remembered. This was the only place she could afford and I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s disgusting. Most of the windows on the outside of the three-story brick building are either broken or boarded up and there are people sleeping on the stairway. My mother calls it a crack house where trashy, unwanted people live, and she tells me she\u2019ll never, ever visit my sister. I manage to make it to Abby\u2019s floor without any confrontation from the people sleeping on the stairs or the woman shouting obscene things to a man who lives across the hall from her. It takes five knocks to get my sister to answer the door and as soon as I see her, I can tell she\u2019s blissfully high.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lila,\u201d she says dazedly as she blinks her blue eyes. \u201cTo what do I owe the honor of your being here?\u201d She\u2019s wearing an overly large gray sweatshirt and cutoffs, something my mom would disown her for wearing, although I guess my mother already kind of has so it doesn\u2019t really matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d I wave idiotically, feeling uneasy.</p><p>She opens the door wider so I can step inside. \u201cI bet it was Dad, right?\u201d she jokes disdainfully as she shuts the door behind me. \u201cHe must have sent you here to check up on me and make sure that his dear daughter is doing okay and isn\u2019t dead in a ditch somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just needed some place to go to clear my head,\u201d I tell her, drawing a deep breath as I turn in a circle, taking in her living room that\u2019s the size of the foyer in my house. The air smells smoky and kind of like garbage and there are all these eccentric glass vases everywhere and a lot of alcohol bottles. \u201cMom and Dad don\u2019t know I\u2019m here,\u201d I say, facing her. I think about giving her a hug, because I really need one right now, but she looks so fragile, like if I hug her too tight, she might crumble.</p> <p>She looks so much different from the last time I saw her and it\u2019s been only six months. Her blonde hair looks greasy and thin and her pores are huge and she has a few sores on her skin that look like pimples she\u2019s been picking at. Her lips are really dry and she has a couple of cold sores. She\u2019s lost a lot of weight, which isn\u2019t good since she was already too skinny to begin with.</p><p>She blinks her eyes at me and then motions to a tattered plaid sofa that fills up the narrow living room. \u201cYou can have a seat if you want,\u201d she says, flopping down in the sofa herself.</p><p>I brush some crumbs off the cushion and take a seat. There\u2019s this weird-looking lightbulb on the coffee table, sketched with colorful art, and I reach for it. \u201cWhat is this? Art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch that,\u201d she snaps, slapping my hand away. \u201cThat\u2019s not art, Lila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d I\u2019m starting to regret coming here, since she seems unhappy to see me and is completely out of it. \u201cMaybe I should go.\u201d I start to rise to my feet, but she grabs my arm and pulls me back down.</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go.\u201d She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d She scratches her head and then picks at her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here, especially since Mom made it pretty clear that the family was going to disown me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never disown you,\u201d I tell her, remembering how we once used to have a good relationship, before boarding school came along and then her drug addiction. \u201cI just... it\u2019s just that... Dad\u2019s sending me off to boarding school,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cThe same one that you went to.\u201d</p><p>She stays quiet for quite a while, staring at the lightbulb on the coffee table. \u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I pull a guilty face. \u201cI got caught ditching school.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and hatred flashes across her face. \u201cDad is such a fucking asshole. It\u2019s like you can never screw up. Not once, even if it\u2019s something small. And if you do... if you do, then you no longer exist to him.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t disagree with her. In fact, I\u2019ve felt pretty nonexistent for most of my life. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do... not until you\u2019re eighteen and can get the fuck away from our parents.\u201d</p><p>I slouch in the sofa, staring at the colorful poster on the wall that has a picture of a guitar on it. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>She picks up a lighter from the coffee table and reaches for the lightbulb. \u201cHow bad is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoarding school?\u201d I ask, watching her with curiosity. What is she doing? Who is this person sitting beside me? I barely even recognize her.</p><p>She puts the lightbulb up to her mouth. \u201cNot any worse than being at home.\u201d She flicks the lighter and starts moving the flame along the glass. I have no idea what she\u2019s doing, but it feels like I should look away. So I do.</p><p>\u201cSo I can handle it?\u201d I stare at the dark hallway that leads to a door covered with strings of beads. \u201cI mean, going there. It won\u2019t be that bad, right?\u201d</p><p>She snorts a laugh and then it\u2019s echoed by a cough. \u201cThat all depends on how great you think our home life is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt not that bad,\u201d I say, but the lie is thick in my throat.</p> <p>She snorts another laugh. \u201cOh, Lila, don\u2019t kid yourself. Our home life is a bunch of shit based on lies for the public eye. To everyone, we seem like the perfect family, but on the inside\u2014behind closed doors\u2014we live in a hollow shell of a home. No hugs. No kisses. No affection. An unemotional zombie mother who\u2019s obsessed with her beauty and money. An absent father who hates us and prides himself on telling us that all the time, letting us know how much we annoy him just because we exist.\u201d She coughs again, louder, until she hacks something up and then spits it out onto the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s like he wants us to be as miserable as his father made him.\u201d</p><p>I finally glance back at her and she\u2019s setting the lightbulb down on the table and I notice the air is a little musty. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I ask, pointing at it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you never find out. Let\u2019s keep hoping you live some kind of rainbows and sunshine life instead of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you said things were better out here. That you felt freer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do feel freer.\u201d She yawns, her eyelids growing heavy. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want this version of free for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t like it then why do you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it makes me happy and all the dark things in the world not so dark.\u201d She drops the lighter on the table, considers something, and then draws her knee onto the couch as she turns to face me. \u201cYou want some sisterly advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d I glance around at the apartment that I\u2019m fairly certain is littered with drug paraphernalia. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive your life, Lila, the way that you want to, not how Dad wants you to or anyone else.\u201d She reaches for the lighter on the table again, her eyelids growing heavier and she begins to ramble, looking dazed and barely coherent. \u201cAnd if you end up at the boarding school keep clear of the trouble-making guys, the rough-looking, wild, and dangerous ones. They can make you feel really alive and loved and like life can actually mean something. But all they fucking do is use you. And they\u2019ll only bring you down with them. They don\u2019t really love you, Lila. They don\u2019t. Love doesn\u2019t even exist, despite how much you want it to.\u201d</p><p>I wonder why she\u2019s telling me this. \u201cUm... okay.\u201d</p><p>She never explains further and that is the end of our conversation. She gets up and starts cleaning the house like a robot dosed up on sugar and caffeine. I sit there and watch her, wondering how she got to this point in her life, so ugly and broken\u2014so messed up. Was it because of a guy? One she loved? Is that why she said that thing about love?</p><p>A week later I go off to boarding school with her words of wisdom a shadow in my mind, there but barely. The problem is she forgot to warn me about the guys who seem perfect on the outside, the ones who are charming, seemingly unflawed, and make you feel loved for the very first time. She forgot to tell me about the illusion of love and the darkness that comes with it. That eventually when the illusion is gone, the walls close in on you, crush you, and all you\u2019re left with is feeling more unloved and worthless than you did before.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table, surrounded by garbage, alcohol bottles, and cigarette butts in probably the shittiest house in the neighborhood, which is saying a lot because there are a lot of shitty houses in this town. It\u2019s dark outside and the guy who owns the place decided to go 1960s hippy style and decorate his entire house with lava lamps. He\u2019s also got a black light so the house has this haunting glow and everyone\u2019s teeth look stupidly white.</p><p>A year ago I was an average guy, going to school, and getting decent grades. Now I\u2019m an almost seventeen-year-old high school drop out who\u2019s sitting in some druggies\u2019 house, unsure how the hell I got here. It feels like I\u2019m abruptly plummeting off a cliff, hanging out with a bunch of people who I barely recognize and who don\u2019t seem to care about anything but getting high and talking about how hard their lives are.</p><p>At first the fall was kind of fun and easy, especially turning off my thoughts, because they drive me fucking nuts. But then things descended toward rock bottom and I can feel myself about to splatter against them. I don\u2019t want to be in this deep. Not just because I hate needles. I mean I can stand them to an extent, as long as they\u2019re going in someone else\u2019s body, not mine. This should be enough to keep me out of situations like these, yet here I am watching some guy shoot up right in front of me, for no other reason than I\u2019m kind of curious and can\u2019t seem to find a good enough reason to get up and leave. Plus, there\u2019s London, my one weakness in this world, despite how much I want to deny it. London is the one person who I\u2019ll make dumb choices for, even when I know they\u2019re dumb choices. She\u2019s the reason I broke my no-girlfriend rule.</p><p>The owner of the house flicks the needle with his fingers and then aims the tip at his forearm. He opens and closes his hand a few times, pumping his fist, then makes a final fist before he plunges the needle into his forearm, sliding it under his skin, deep into his vein. I wince as his muscles tighten, and then he pulls it out and drops the needle onto the table in front of him next to a spoon. He flops back in the kitchen chair and lets out a moan that seriously creeps me out.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you get high, fuckers,\u201d he says, as his eyes roll into the back of his head. \u201cThis seriously feels...\u201d He drifts off, his head flopping to the side.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to figure out why I\u2019m still here. I know why I came here. Because of London. I first met her almost a year ago. She\u2019d been really drunk at this party I was at and needed a ride home. Somehow that ended up becoming my job. At first I was pissed and made a point to be an ass the entire drive home. But then she started crying to the point where I thought she was going to pass out, so I pulled the truck over and she immediately took off into the field to the side of us.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d I\u2019d muttered, shoving the truck into park. I\u2019ve never done well with crying and for a moment I considered just letting London run and get lost in the dark. After seriously contemplating how big of a douche I was being, I couldn\u2019t just leave her there. Cursing under my breath, I got out of the truck, chased her down, and found her crying in the middle of the field. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what the problem is, but I really need to get you home,\u201d I said, stopping in front of her, working to keep my cool. It was getting late, the sky already gray and I wanted to have time to go back to the party. \u201cSo could you please do me a favor and get in the truck?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, hugging her knees closer to her. \u201cJust leave me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I\u2019m seriously considering it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She buried her face against her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t want to...\u201d She trailed off, wiping her eyes.</p><p>I stood there in the middle of the dry grass, trying to figure out what the hell to do\u2014if I should ask questions or keep my mouth shut. I was about to leave her when she started to sob, like these gasping, hyperventilating sobs. I suddenly had a flashback to when I was around eight and my dad went through this phase where he would beat the shit out of me every time he was coming down from his pain medications and I used to curl up in a ball and sob. It really wasn\u2019t a big deal or anything and it only lasted, like, a year, but still, it sucked at the time.</p><p>Even though I had no idea why London was crying, I felt a little sympathy for her because there was obviously something going on. \u201cLook, are you okay?\u201d I crouched down in front of her. \u201cDo you want me to take you somewhere else besides home?\u201d</p><p>Her tears silenced and when she peeked up at me, she had a cynical look on her face, which surprised the shit out of me. \u201cLike where? Your place? So you can fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stood up and took a step back because the girl was seriously intense. \u201cI was just trying to help. That\u2019s all. But if you\u2019re going to be a bitch about it then I\u2019ll let you sit here and cry.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes stayed on me as she rose to her feet and her sadness gradually shifted to inquisitiveness as her gaze strayed up and down my body. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I muttered, not giving a shit. It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d been called this. In fact, I\u2019d been called a lot worse.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want to help me,\u201d she said, grabbing ahold of my hand, \u201cthen stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond, she dragged me back to my truck on the side of the road. I thought she was going to pour her heart and soul out to me or something, but instead we climbed into the truck and she took a joint out of her bra. We smoked it and when we were done, she asked me if I wanted to fuck her. As much as I loved sex, there was something about her\u2014sadness in here eyes maybe\u2014that made me hesitate for the first time since I\u2019d started having sex. Sure, London had a rebellious, skanky kind of look to her, in her tight leather skirt and cleavage-baring top, but she also looked like she was hurting inside. It felt like she was searching for a way to get rid of the sadness and at the moment it seemed to be sex.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just take you home,\u201d I\u2019d said, putting the joint out in the ashtray of my truck.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she questioned in a feisty tone, raising her eyebrows. \u201cAre you afraid of me or something?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head and rolled my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be fucking ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me up and down. \u201cAre you a virgin or something?\u201d</p><p>I snorted a laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a virgin for two years, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She smiled condescendingly. \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I lied.</p><p>She kept biting her lip and her eyes were all swollen from crying and there was mascara running down her cheeks. I hardly knew her, but I wanted to take that sad look off her face, which is something I didn\u2019t want to be thinking. No strings attached. No relationship. Those were my rules.</p><p>\u201cThen have sex with me.\u201d She\u2019d scooted across the bench seat and pressed her lips against mine roughly, biting my bottom lip. I thought about pulling away, but I was too turned on and ended up thinking with my cock and kissing her back.</p><p>We had sex in the backseat of my truck. Rough, sweaty, passion-filled sex that blew my mind at the time. I mean, I\u2019d had sex before, but this was different and all that overthinking and wanting to be alone momentarily dissolved into desire for something more in life, not that I could figure out what.</p> <p>After that I kind of became addicted to her and her erratic, impulsive, wild behavior. She introduced me to a world of weed and we\u2019d spend hours having sex, never really talking, making our relationship easy and perfect, never complicated.</p><p>And now, six months later, I\u2019m sitting in a heroin addict\u2019s house because she asked me to be here. It\u2019s not my scene. I mean, I get high and everything with weed and I\u2019ve tried cocaine a few times, but heroin is a whole other ballgame, one I\u2019m not sure I want to play.</p><p>London extends her arm across the table. She\u2019s got short black hair, streaked with purple, and her eyebrow is pierced, along with the spot just above her lip, next to a gnarly scar that runs from the side of her nose to her lip. I\u2019ve asked her a ton of times how she got it, but she refuses to tell me. She refuses to tell me a lot of things.</p><p>\u201cEthan?\u201d London looks in my direction with a hopeful expression on her face. \u201cI can\u2019t shoot myself up. Will you please, pretty please help me?\u201d</p><p>I pull a wary face and shake my head. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t, baby, but I can tell you how to do it. It\u2019ll be fine, trust me.\u201d Her eyes plead with me to help her as she runs her free hand through my hair, trying to warm me up. \u201cPlease, I really need this.\u201d</p><p>She always really needs something and I usually let her, because she\u2019s not mine to own, but this... this might be a little too much.</p><p>\u201cSince when are you into this stuff?\u201d I ask her, glancing around at the people lying around on the living room floor. \u201cI\u2019ve been with you for the last six months and I\u2019ve never seen you do anything but weed and coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you don\u2019t know me that well, then,\u201d she snaps, jerking her hand away from my hair. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been with me. I just let you follow me around.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m getting aggravated. I crack my knuckles against the table and then pop my neck. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not helping you with this.\u201d She pouts out her lip, but I don\u2019t feel bad for her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work on me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cNot with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help ya, baby.\u201d This guy who\u2019s her age\u2014I think his name Drake or Draven or some weird vampire-sounding name\u2014comes walking into the kitchen. He\u2019s a complete asshole and disregards me, looking at London like she belongs to him or some shit. \u201cYou got a needle?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and tucks her hair behind her ear, brushing it away from her shoulder and I can see her tattoo on her shoulder: broken. I asked her what it meant once and she said it was because she was broken. I asked her why she thought that and she shook her head and told me she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. That she just wanted to fuck. She says that a lot.</p><p>\u201cJust the one right here.\u201d London flicks the used needle that\u2019s on the table and my face twists with revulsion.</p><p>He plops down in the seat next to her and picks up the used needle that belongs to the guy passed out on the table. Then he picks up a spoon and a lighter.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not sanitary, right?\u201d I ask London, tugging down the sleeves of my plaid shirt. \u201cOr smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when have I ever claimed to be smart?\u201d She arches her eyebrow at me, daring me to tell her otherwise.</p><p>\u201cNever, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to act like an idiot.\u201d I glance at Draven or Drake or whoever he is. \u201cWhen you\u2019re obviously not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Drake\u2019s going to do it for me,\u201d she states, with a challenge in her eyes because she knows it\u2019s a sensitive subject. I hate looking weak and right now I\u2019m letting some guy take control over my girl.</p><p>I glance at the needle in the guy\u2019s hand as he extracts some liquid from the spoon. I want to punch him in the face. I want to yell at him. I want to yell at London, not just for doing it now but because I\u2019m starting to wonder if she\u2019s done this in the past, shot up with dirty needles. Shit, what if she gave something to me. But I don\u2019t yell at her because then I\u2019d be a replica of my father always yelling at my mom. Honestly, what I really want to do is run out of this damn house because I don\u2019t want to be here.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just go?\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be something else you want to do. We can go hang out with Jessabelle and Big D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose two are amateurs,\u201d she retorts and I can tell by her firm tone that she\u2019s not going to back down because once London makes up her mind, there\u2019s no changing it.</p><p>\u201cWho brought the whiner to this place?\u201d the guy interrupts, targeting a glare at me. He nods his chin toward the front door. \u201cIf you\u2019re not big enough to handle it then get the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>The guy is twice my size\u2014thick neck, tall, hefty\u2014and I\u2019m not one for picking fights anyway. \u201cJust come with me,\u201d I say to London. \u201cI can take you home or I can take you back to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what? Talk? Make out? Fuck?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want right now, Ethan. What I want\u2014what I need\u2014is this.\u201d She directs her attention back to the needle and pumps her fist a few times. \u201cGod, I need this so bad.\u201d</p><p>Something\u2019s obviously bothering her and it seems like for once I need to get to the bottom of it before she does something drastic even for her. \u201cLondon, please just come with me and tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Ethan!\u201d she cries, slamming her other hand down on the table. Some guy in the living room busts up laughing and the guy high in the chair tips over and falls to the floor, hitting the ground hard. No one seems to care. \u201cI don\u2019t need a fucking hero. Or some pathetic little high schooler trying to save me. What I need is to be with someone who will give me what I want and allow me to live my life how I want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grinding my teeth, I shove up from the chair. \u201cFine. Do whatever the fuck you want then. Find someone else. See if I give a shit.\u201d I do give a shit, though. Really badly. I want London, more than I\u2019ve wanted anyone else. I\u2019ve always secretly wished I could just leave all my stuff behind, hitchhike across the country, and write about what I see and feel and how much I hate being around people and the world and the constant chattering. It always feels like there\u2019s the rest of the world and then me. But now there\u2019s London and me. I think I might be in love with her even though she\u2019s kind of messed up in the head and I really don\u2019t know much about her. But I\u2019m the same way. I rarely share who I am and confuse the hell out of people when I do. Deep down, I think we could be beautiful together, living in our own little messed-up world, where we would talk about being outsiders and living life to the fullest. But not like this. Not with fucking heroin in our systems.</p><p>London\u2019s emotions mix in her expression as I head for the door. She looks enraged, irritated, and hurt, but I keep putting one foot in front of the other. As I leave the kitchen, I get this small urge to turn back around and try one more time to convince her not to do it, but when I glance back over my shoulder, the guy\u2019s already plunging the needle into her forearm. Shaking my head and internally cringing, I storm out of the house, knowing she\u2019ll call me either later tonight or in the morning to pick her up, like she always does. That\u2019s the thing with London. She always comes back to me no matter what and I\u2019ll probably always take her back, because in this lonely world, she\u2019s the only person who gets what it\u2019s like to feel out of place. She promised me that no matter what happened, she\u2019d always come back to me and she always has. So when she doesn\u2019t call me by the next morning, I instantly know that something has to be wrong. And for the very first and last time, she doesn\u2019t come back to me.</p><p>Chapter One</p> <p>Present day...</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m having a where-the-hell-am-I moment. My arms are flailing, my pulse fitfully racing as I struggle to get my bearings. I open my eyes, but I can\u2019t place a single thing about the room I\u2019m in other than I\u2019m naked in a bed, sweaty, and super gross. My head feels like it\u2019s stuck in a fishbowl as I try to recollect where I left my pills, but I can\u2019t even remember where I am. There are photos on the walls, none of anyone I recognize, though. The closet is open and it looks like there\u2019s some kind of football uniform in there. Did I sleep with a football player? No, that doesn\u2019t sound familiar. My gaze slides to the opened condom wrapper on the nightstand and I feel relief wash through me. I\u2019m on birth control and everything, but that only protects from pregnancy. God, I really need to stop doing this.</p><p>I\u2019ve become accustomed to these kinds of situations, waking up in unfamiliar places with a headache, panic, and consistent, recognizable shame inside me that I know belongs there, just as much as the air in my lungs and the blood in my heart. I don\u2019t deserve to feel anything better after the decisions and choices that I\u2019ve made. I know what I am on the inside now and I don\u2019t fight it anymore. It\u2019s both liberating and heartbreaking because this is how I have to be\u2014who I am\u2014and it\u2019s sad. But I can smile on the outside, show the world how happy I am, since that\u2019s what\u2019s important, even if I\u2019m dying on the inside.</p><p>The routine is very simple and I know it like I know the back of my hand. I open my eyes, take in my surroundings, try to remember something, and then when all else fails, get the hell out of there. I slowly sit up, trying not to wake the guy lying in the bed next to me. He\u2019s got dark brown hair and a pretty sturdy body, but his back is turned to me and my memories are hazy, so I can\u2019t place what he looks like from the front. Maybe that\u2019s for the best, though. Whatever I was looking for with him\u2014love, happiness, a blissful moment of connection\u2014obviously never happened. And I\u2019m at a point in my life where I doubt if it ever will.</p> <p>Holding my breath, I climb out of bed and slip my dress on, covering myself up, along with the scar winding around my waist, reminding me of why I\u2019m here. I attempt to get the back row of buttons done up, but my fingers are numb, like I was doing something weird with them last night, which could be a possibility. I do have tendency to get a little extreme when I\u2019m that drunk. The fingernails sometimes come out, and back in boarding school I got deemed the slutty biter/screamer. Although, sometimes I wonder if I do it out of pleasure or from the fear that seems to surface when I have sex. And that confusion is his fault. I\u2019ll always hate him for that, even if I thought I loved him and would have done anything for him at the time. But how could I really, when I was way too young to feel love? Even now, I still haven\u2019t felt it and I\u2019m twenty years old.</p><p>Leaving my dress unbuttoned, I collect my shoes and tiptoe toward the door. I notice a wad of cash on the nightstand beside the bed and a ring that looks like a football championship ring or something. There\u2019s also a stale sandwich on the dresser and several empty beer glasses.</p><p>\u201cEw, I must have really been drunk,\u201d I mutter, cringing at the food and then double cringing when I catch my untidy appearance in the mirror on the wall.</p><p>Making a repulsed face, I slip out of the room, thinking I\u2019ll be out in the hallway of one of the dorm buildings on campus. But I\u2019m in a large, open living room with columns around the walls and picture windows everywhere, letting light easily flow in. The floor is marble and there\u2019s a large white rug spread out. It has to be a condo or something, with how fancy it is, not a dorm.</p><p>There are a couple of guys and a girl sitting on a leather couch in the middle of the room, watching a flat-screen television mounted on the wall just beside where I stepped out. I can\u2019t remember anything other than shots, a chic club, a sleek black Mercedes, someone\u2019s hands and lips on me, wishing I could black out, and then I must have gotten what I wanted because after that I remember nothing.</p><p>The guys simultaneously look up at me and I notice they\u2019re older, like maybe twenty-four or twenty-five, which makes me feel too young to be here, yet older guys seem to be my thing, at least when I\u2019m drunk.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d One of them nods his scruffy chin at me. \u201cYou look a little lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m totally lost.\u201d I force a smile, even though I\u2019m frowning on the inside, and I hold my head high as I do the walk of shame. They start laughing at me and I find myself wishing I were someone sassier, like Ella, my best friend and old roommate. But I\u2019m not. Sure, I can be sassy when the time calls for it, but right now I feel icky, gross, and disgusted with myself because I just woke up, my makeup\u2019s worn off, my hair\u2019s a mess, and my clothes smell like alcohol. Plus I\u2019m crashing. Badly. And I don\u2019t have anything on me to help balance my mood.</p><p>I rush across the room and throw open the door. As I step out of the condo, I hear one of them laugh and say something about me being easy and slutty, but I close the door and shut out their voices. I walk down the hall and trot down the stairs to the bottom, where I push the door open and step outside into the sunlight and the lukewarm November air. Being outside makes me feel a little better, except I still can\u2019t recognize where I am. It\u2019s a condo complex\u2014that much I get.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I mutter, pressing my fingers to the brim of my nose. I have a splitting headache and my hair smells like beer and my pores feel sticky. I hike across the lawn toward the corner of the street so I can read the street sign, knowing it could be worse. I could be in one of the lower-class areas of Las Vegas, but this looks like it\u2019s a nice area, located near some cul-de-sacs and upper-class homes. When I reach the corner of the street, I shield my eyes with my hand and squint up at the street sign. Damn it, I\u2019m way too far away from my apartment to walk. I can either take the bus, which I haven\u2019t been a fan of since I was fourteen, or I can call someone. The only person I really know around here anymore\u2014the only one who I trust seeing me like this\u2014is Ethan Gregory. He\u2019s the one and only bad boy I\u2019ve ever had in my life and the one and only guy who\u2019s never wanted to sleep with me, which makes him seem less bad to me, but to all the other girls he sleeps with, not so much.</p><p>I first met him two summers ago when I went with my best friend Ella back to her hometown. He was the best friend to the guy Ella was in love with, Micha\u2014although she wouldn\u2019t admit it at the time. While those two were working out their problems, I spent a lot of time with Ethan and we hit it off. There was this strange connection between us, like we understood each other, even though we were from totally separate worlds: rich and poor. Even when I went back to school in the fall, we still talked on the phone. And then he moved here and we\u2019ve been hanging out pretty much ever since.</p><p>Cursing under my breath, I find my phone that luckily is still in the side pocket of my dress, and then I punch in Ethan\u2019s number.</p><p>He answers after three rings and his voice is laced with amusement. \u201cWell, hello, lovely Lila. What\u2019d you do this time?\u201d</p><p>I ignore the ripple through my body that his voice always causes. After knowing him for a year, I\u2019ve pretty much become an expert at discounting the emotions he always brings out inside me, which is a good thing for many different reasons. For one thing we live in two separate worlds: I like nice things and Ethan is very unmaterialistic. He calls me spoiled a lot and I call him a weirdo because I don\u2019t get half the things that he does, like refusing to buy nicer clothes when he has the money for them. He\u2019s so sexy and if he\u2019d wear jeans without holes in them and new shoes and shirts he\u2019d look so much better.</p> <p>Plus, even though I hate to admit it, my mother\u2019s words always echo in my head: If you can\u2019t find a man to take care of you then you\u2019ll end up living in a crack house, just like your sister. Find a wealthy man, Lila, and hang on to him no matter what sacrifices you make. Despite the absurdity of it, I can\u2019t seem to get the mental picture out of my head of me curled up in a ball on a ratty old couch, dressed in rags, smoking crack from a pipe, and it scares me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything... I don\u2019t think anyway. I just need a ride,\u201d I say in a whiny voice because I\u2019m tired and filthy and disgusting.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d he replies, pretending to be annoyed but I\u2019ve gotten to know him well enough to know he really isn\u2019t. He just likes people to think he is because he likes to seem tough and a badass. But I know he\u2019s not. He\u2019s actually really sweet and talks and listens to me and gives me candy canes. I still have a drawer full of the ones he gave me, unable to eat them or throw them away because then it feels like I\u2019m losing a nice moment in my life with a guy and those kind of moments are very rare, if nonexistent.</p><p>\u201cAre you there?\u201d he says, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes, I need a ride again.\u201d I sink down on the curb, attempting not to think of candy canes and red lacy bras. That was a one-time thing. We both agreed that there would be no hooking up. Although, I agreed to it only because he seemed so eager to make it clear it would never happen again. \u201cSo will you or won\u2019t you come pick me up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re snippy today,\u201d he remarks with humor in his tone. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I want to deal with it today. I\u2019m too fucking tired from the woman I screwed last night. She really wore me out. Plus, I have to be to work later today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d I scowl, even though he can\u2019t see me. \u201cPlease quit messing around and just come get me. Pretty please.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and then sighs, defeated. \u201cI\u2019ll come get you though, but only if you say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it, Ethan. Not today.\u201d I prop my elbow on my knee and rest my chin against my hand. He wants me to tell him that I\u2019ll be his sex slave, something he made me promise to say the last time he picked me up. He doesn\u2019t really want me to be one, though. He just thinks he\u2019s funny.</p><p>\u201cThat was the deal,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cIf I ever had to come pick you up again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I made the deal when I wasn\u2019t this cranky,\u201d I say and grimace. \u201cWhen it seemed like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He surrenders way too easily and it makes me smile just a little. \u201cBut next time I\u2019m making you... In fact, I might even actually be your sex slave the next time you call me,\u201d he says and I sigh heavily. \u201cI\u2019ll head out in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him, stretching my legs out onto the road. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for being so pissy. I\u2019m just hung-over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go out with that douche from the club, did you?\u201d he asks and I can hear him moving around. \u201cBecause I told you the guy seemed sketchy. Although all the guys you\u2019ve hooked up with seem a little bit sketchy, if you ask me\u2014rich, preppy douche bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not douche bags. They\u2019re just different from what you\u2019re used to.\u201d I yawn, extending my arms above my head. \u201cAnd no, I didn\u2019t go home with the guy from the club... I don\u2019t think anyway. I can\u2019t even remember who I went home with.\u201d I cringe as I try to put the pieces together, but I can\u2019t even seem to find one full piece.</p><p>\u201cLila...\u201d he starts, but then decides against it, probably because he sleeps around just as much as I do. \u201cWhere are you exactly?\u201d</p> <p>I breathe a sigh of relief, grateful he\u2019s not giving me anymore crap for my sexual mishap. I\u2019m hung-over and having withdraws and I can feel myself verging on a meltdown, something that can never happen, let alone in the open. \u201cI\u2019m on the corner of Vegas Drive and Rainbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly? In like a store or a house or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sitting on the curb.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had to pick me up under these kinds of circumstances and it probably won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s kind of our thing; we share our stories and never judge each other, despite how bad and ugly the stories are. He knows things about me that no one does, like how my father treats me, and I know things about him, too, like how his dad used to beat his mother and how he despises him for it. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in, like, fifteen to twenty minutes. Don\u2019t go wandering off anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would I go?\u201d I pull my knees up and lower my forehead onto them. \u201cIt\u2019s too damn hot outside to even breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd try not to get into any trouble,\u201d he adds, disregarding my comment.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I roll my eyes and then squeeze them shut, inhaling the sweltering air. \u201cAnd, Ethan...\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d I say softly because I really do feel bad for making him do these things for me. He\u2019s always so nice about it, too.</p><p>Another pause and then he gives an overexaggerated sigh. \u201cWhatever. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I feel the slightest bit better. He\u2019s always there for me, even when he doesn\u2019t want to be. He\u2019s the only person I really talk to anymore and I worry what will happen if he decides to leave me.</p><p>I lie down on the sidewalk and twist my platinum ring around on my finger as I stare up at the melting blue sky and the blinding sunlight. For a moment I don\u2019t care about how filthy the ground is or the fact that my dress is undone and my eyes are starting to sting. In fact, for a split second I know I belong there and nowhere better. But as I press my cheek against the scalding concrete, I remember that I was taught not to lie on a filthy ground. I sit up straight and trace the ugly circular scars on each ankle, the mark of my biggest imperfection both inside and out.</p><p>The sun bears down on me as I attempt to remember some details of the previous night. But as usual, I\u2019m drawing a blank. If I keep it up, then I wonder if one day my head will just be as empty as my heart. But on the bright side\u2014my mother\u2019s bright side\u2014at least I\u2019ll still have my beauty and that\u2019s all that really matters.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>You know that point where you\u2019re about to wake up, but you can\u2019t quite seem to get your fucking eyelids to open so you get kind of stuck between being awake and asleep? Well, that\u2019s pretty much where I\u2019ve been for the last four years. I feel stuck. Trapped in the same place, unable to move. In a life I\u2019m not sure I want, yet I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to change it. I\u2019ve felt differently only once and the person who brought the sunnier side out of me is no longer in my life. Although, sometimes Lila gets me close to breaking out of the daze, but in a different way, one based more on anger and sexual frustration than an actual deep emotion.</p><p>I even tried to escape the trapped feeling of my life once. I packed my shit and hit the road with no real destination other than to escape the trapped feelings that had been festering inside me for years. It wasn\u2019t bad being alone on the road with no worries about where I was going, but what I learned quickly was that you can\u2019t escape life, no matter how much you want to.</p><p>I wake up to \u201cHey Ho\u201d by the Lumineers. It\u2019s the ringtone Lila picked out for herself, even though I told her it wasn\u2019t my kind of music. She insisted that it was the perfect song choice for her, and I meant to change it but I forgot and now I just don\u2019t care. In fact, it\u2019s kind of growing on me, like her.</p><p>I run my hand over my face, rubbing the drowsiness away, and then reach for my phone on the nightstand beside my bed. I answer it and give Lila a hard time because it seems like it\u2019s becoming a tradition. She calls me when she needs help, usually with a guy-related issue and either I listen to her complain about it or go bail her out from whatever situation she\u2019s in.</p><p>It\u2019s the third time she\u2019s called me this month and it\u2019s only halfway into November. She told me once, over way too many shots of Tequila\u2014which always makes her dark alter ego come out\u2014that she\u2019d been like this since she was fourteen, never giving me an exact reason. Honestly, she seems to be going on a rapid downhill decline since Ella left, even taking a semester off of school, but I think that might have to do with money more than anything. But I\u2019m worried she\u2019s lonely or something. A lot of people can\u2019t handle being alone, and I think Lila might be one of those people.</p><p>I remember the first time we had a real talk, back in Star Grove, where we first met. Our best friends had a thing for each other and we kind of met through them. During the first real time we spent together, we drank a bottle of Bacardi while my dad repainted her car that someone had spray-painted, talking about life, our weird views on casual, meaningless sex, and how at one point in our lives our parents treated us like shit, although Lila\u2019s still do.</p><p>I\u2019d been flirting with her the entire night, because that\u2019s what I do and then Lila tried to get me to screw her. I\u2019d declined since we were both trashed out of our minds and I have rules about having sex and being wasted. I have to be sober enough that I can remember the sex\u2014and the girl. Plus, I don\u2019t think of Lila like that. Well, I try not to anyway. I have had a few slip-ups, where I crossed the no-touching rule I made, but I always make sure to play it off as casually as I can, reminding myself that I have rules about relationships for a reason, to keep me out of relationships because I don\u2019t want to end up like my mother and father. My father is always yelling at my mother and I\u2019m always worried I\u2019ll turn out like them\u2014or him really. Getting emotionally involved with someone leads to an unhealthy, disastrous relationship, where someone will get broken. Take my mother and father. She got pregnant while they were dating, they got married, and twenty-five years later they\u2019re still married and hate each other, although they\u2019ll never admit it. Instead, my father yells and tells her how stupid and shitty she is all the time and my mother pretends that everything\u2019s okay. That it\u2019s normal for people to talk to each other like that.</p><p>The only exception I ever made was with London, and after what happened with her I promised I\u2019d never make an exception again because I never wanted to feel that much loss and guilt over losing someone again. But I really struggle with following the rules when it comes to Lila. I even had to add a no-touching rule that exclusively applied to her after I gave her candy canes last Christmas, about a year ago, when I tried to put my hands on and tongue in places they didn\u2019t belong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometimes it is hard to keep my hands off her, though, and I slip up. The girl is fucking gorgeous, in a model, Hollywood, way-too-perfect actress kind of way. She\u2019s got flawless skin, perfect curves, her body proportioned just right. But she\u2019s kind of high maintenance. The first time I took her to a pub, she refused to eat the food because she thought eating pub food was too gross and kind of beneath her high food standards, but she\u2019s slowly progressing and I\u2019ve even got her to eat ribs with her hands once, which was hilarious to watch.</p><p>After I get off the phone with Lila, I put away the bracelet London gave me and my journal, filled with pages of haunting memories and thoughts. I took both of them out of my dresser during a bout of depression last night, trying to find something that doesn\u2019t really exist anymore, because I chose to walk away from it. Or maybe it never really did exist, yet I continue to hold on to it and allow it to haunt me, never talking to anyone about it because the idea of talking about London aloud seems impossible and almost like I\u2019d finally be letting go of her and I\u2019m not ready for that.</p><p>I get up and get dressed in jeans and a red T-shirt, then grab a five from my stash of money hidden in a box underneath my dresser. I work part time in construction and since my apartment is dirt cheap and I don\u2019t really need anything else besides food, gas for my truck, and occasionally new clothes, I pretty much save everything I make. Tucking the five in my back pocket, I head out the door. I make a quick stop at the nearest Starbucks and use the five to splurge on getting Lila an iced latte because I know she loves them and it might help her with her hang-over. It\u2019s early in the afternoon, but still warm. That\u2019s Vegas for you, though. Even the fall seems like summer in most areas.</p> <p>When I finally reach the corner of Vegas Drive and Rainbow, I park the truck where Lila\u2019s lying down on the sidewalk with her legs stretched out into the road.</p><p>I hop out of the truck and shut the door. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d I ask, rounding the front of the truck with the iced latte in my hand. \u201cTrying to get run over or something? Jesus, Lila.\u201d</p><p>She angles her head back and peers up at me. Her blue eyes are bloodshot, her mascara is smeared, and her blonde hair is all tangled. Usually she\u2019s so put together, even when I pick her up the morning after, and it\u2019s a little bit shocking to see her like this. Still, she\u2019s beautiful as hell, but I\u2019ll never admit that to anyone out loud.</p><p>\u201cIs that for me?\u201d Lila eyes the coffee, licking her lips.</p><p>I hand it to her and she guzzles it down, then pulls a face. \u201cDid you have them put nonfat milk in this?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. Sometimes she can be so high maintenance. \u201cNo, I forgot your specific instructions, your highness, but you\u2019re welcome for getting it for you.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says with an attitude and then starts sipping on the drink again and I struggle not to ask questions about the condition she\u2019s in, because I want to know what the hell happened to her and how she ended up here, looking like she does. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d she mutters, then gradually straightens her legs. She gets to her feet and brushes the sand off the backs of her legs. \u201cI\u2019ve had a rough morning as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a rough afternoon,\u201d I correct her and then step back from the curb with my hands up in front of me when she targets me with a death glare. \u201cFine. Jesus, I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She walks toward the truck door, drinking from the straw and swaying her hips. I notice the back of her dress is unbuttoned all the way, so her smooth skin is exposed to the sunlight. God, if I didn\u2019t have my rules I\u2019d seriously bend her over and have her take it from behind.</p><p>I check her out for a little bit longer and then back up toward the driver\u2019s side. \u201cWhy\u2019s your dress undone?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, swinging her shoes in her hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get my fingers to work this morning.\u201d</p> <p>My lips threaten to turn upward into a full on smirk. \u201cWhy? Were they preoccupied too much last night or something?\u201d I joke, and suddenly way too many images of her flood my head, her fingers sliding up her inner thigh and then slowly entering herself.</p><p>She jerks the door open, narrowing her eyes at me, and I add, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re the one who brought it up. If you don\u2019t want me to tease you, then don\u2019t set up the punch line.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she presses her lips together and hops into the truck. She\u2019ll be pissed off at me for, like, the next ten minutes, but then she\u2019ll get over it. She always does.</p><p>After I get in the truck, I pull out onto the road and turn up the stereo. We barely speak the entire drive and when I pull into the parking lot of her apartment, I figure she\u2019ll bail and then call me in a few days when she needs me to rescue her again.</p><p>But when she opens the door, she says, \u201cSo are you coming in or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, if you really want me to.\u201d It\u2019s not like I have anywhere else to be. Micha, my best friend and old roommate, is gone and I don\u2019t work on the weekends anymore. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sleeping with you no matter how much you beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never beg,\u201d she says and then her face contorts with confusion as she frowns down at the ground. \u201cAt least from what I can remember I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I climb out of the truck and meet her around the front, aiming the keys over my shoulder to lock up the truck. We make our way across the parking lot beneath the heat of the sun and I pull my sunglasses down off my head to cover my eyes. I remain slightly behind her, checking out her ass and her lower back peeking out of her still-opened dress. Finally, I have to rip my gaze away and step up beside her, otherwise I\u2019ll end up unable to keep my hands to myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to stop blacking out when you get drunk,\u201d I say, nudging her playfully with my shoulder. \u201cDrunk is okay, but getting so shit-faced you have no idea what you\u2019re doing is really fucking bad, Lila. Even I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bad at all.\u201d She attempts to smooth her hair down with her hand, but it only makes it stick up more. \u201cYou just pretend like you are. But deep down, you\u2019re a really nice guy who likes to write in a journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I told you that in confidence.\u201d I scowl at her as we make our way up the steps to her second-story apartment. \u201cYou were never supposed to utter that aloud.\u201d</p><p>She pats her pockets for the keys. \u201cWell, then you never should have told me because I kind of have a big mouth.\u201d Her arms fall to her sides and her eyes scan around her feet and then down the steps behind her. \u201cCrap, I think I lost my keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... so go ask your landlord to unlock it for you. It\u2019s not that complicated,\u201d I say, shaking my head at her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I lean on the railing, squinting against the sunlight as I assess her.</p><p>She lowers her chin, allowing her hair to fall in her face, like she doesn\u2019t want me to see her expression. \u201cBecause... if I do... then he\u2019ll ask me for rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you behind on it or something?\u201d</p><p>She peers up at me through her eyelashes. \u201cI may or may not have paid the last couple of months,\u201d she discloses, her forehead furrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not broke.\u201d I hate to say it, but it\u2019s kind of obvious by the fancy clothes she\u2019s always wearing. Hell, she\u2019s got a platinum ring on her finger, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cBut I am,\u201d she insists, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cMy dad canceled all my credit cards a while ago and I have only, like, eight hundred bucks left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen pay your rent with it.\u201d I gape at her. \u201cOr pawn that ring on your finger.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she covers the ring on her hand, looking almost panicked. \u201cNo way. This was a gift from someone I used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather live on the streets than get rid of your gift?\u201d I cock my eyebrow at her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d she says simply, her arms falling to her sides.</p><p>I tighten my jaw, growing frustrated. \u201cGod damn it. You do this all the time, you know that. You need to start being more responsible...\u201d My eyes widen. Holy fucking Jesus, I sound just like my father. Shit. He\u2019s always lecturing my mom about her flaws. This is the reason why I don\u2019t let myself get into relationships and I\u2019m not in one with Lila, so why am I acting like this?</p><p>She laughs scathingly and jabs her finger against my chest. \u201cOh, and like you are. You get drunk and sleep around and work in construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I never claim to be responsible.\u201d I lean in, lowering my voice, trying to shake off the feeling that I\u2019m acting just like my dad. No, this is different. You\u2019re trying to help her, not control her. \u201cBut I do work and pay my rent.\u201d</p><p>She huffs, stomping her foot and crossing her arms. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve witnessed her temper tantrums when I don\u2019t give in to her, but it still gets on my nerves as bad as the first time I saw her do it. \u201cEthan, will you please just help me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck am I supposed to help you out?\u201d I ask. \u201cPay your rent so you can get let in? Because I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d But a voice inside my head laughs at me, telling me I\u2019m full of shit. That I would pay it for her if she asks, that I\u2019d do anything for her if she flat out asked me to.</p><p>She sticks out her bottom lip and makes me soften just a little. \u201cYou can pick the lock,\u201d she suggests, and when I start to frown, she grips the bottom of my shirt and clutches on to it. \u201cPlease, please, please. I\u2019ll owe you big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already owe me big time, for being a pain in the ass and calling me all the time to come pick you up from random guys\u2019 houses,\u201d I tell her, dragging my hand across my face. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to owe me. I just want you to get a job or something so you won\u2019t get kicked out of your apartment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll work on getting some cash.\u201d She bats her damn eyelashes at me intentionally\u2014I can tell because there\u2019s a smirk forming at her lips.</p><p>Sighing, I stick out my hand. \u201cGive me one of those pins in your hair.\u201d</p><p>She releases my shirt, plucks a pin out of her hair, and hands it to me. Grunting and pretending I\u2019m more annoyed than I really am, I bend down in front of the door and quickly pick the lock. When I shove the door open, she jumps up and down, clapping her hands.</p> <p>\u201cThank you! Thank you! Thank you!\u201d She throws her arms around my neck and embraces me tightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d I tell her, uneasy and kind of turned on, something I always feel whenever she hugs me. Lila is off limits. She\u2019s a friend. Just a friend. It\u2019ll never work out. Relationships never work out. Look at the one that you had. \u201cJust pay your damn rent and quit losing your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d She rushes into the house eagerly, leaving the door open behind her, and hurries toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d I ask, standing in the entryway of her two-bedroom apartment, which is much nicer than mine: painted walls, a crack-free floor, and the carpet isn\u2019t loose. \u201cSit around here and wait for you? Is that what you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re totally not enjoying the idea.\u201d She pauses at the corner of the hall and grins. \u201cBesides, you could just come join me.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes, suppressing a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you a thousand times that you can\u2019t handle me, baby.\u201d I bite down on my tongue on the baby slipup. I don\u2019t use endearing terms with women. Ever. My dad used to use them on my mom when he was trying to kiss up to her after he beat her and she\u2019d always let him butter her up. It made me hate affectionate terms and affection in general.</p><p>She turns around and puts her hands on her hips, arching her eyebrows. \u201cAnd vice versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d I say, because I picture Lila as being extremely bossy and orderly in bed and I like women who get caught up in the moment, who love to do things without thinking about them first and who can completely and utterly let go of everything going on in the world. Who don\u2019t care if they have money or material things. I like women who are like London. The problem is, she seems to be the only one of her kind and she no longer exists.</p><p>Lila laughs and I roll my eyes again, feigning annoyance. Then I chuckle when she sticks out her tongue and I have to bite on my own because the movement draws all my attention to her mouth. Despite the no-touching rule I made, I still can\u2019t help but picture the many things I\u2019d like her to do with her mouth that would require a lot of touching.</p><p>Once she vanishes down the hall, I get comfortable on the sofa and start channel surfing, but I can find only three channels and I wonder if she hasn\u2019t paid her satellite bill either.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lila,\u201d I mutter and then take my phone out of my pocket. I think about just calling Micha and asking him to ask Ella, Lila\u2019s best friend, to call Lila because she\u2019s obviously gotten in over her head, but then it just seems weird and makes me seem like I\u2019m scared of Ella, so I call her myself.</p> <p>She answers after two rings and I can tell from her tone of voice that she\u2019s trying to figure out why I\u2019m calling her. \u201cEthan?\u201d she asks warily. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cOr maybe... I don\u2019t know... it all kind of depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether you\u2019ve talked to Lila lately or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from her in, like, a week,\u201d she says. \u201cI texted her the other day, asking her how she was, and she said she was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think she was lying to you.\u201d I slump back in the sofa and something pokes me in the back. \u201cMaybe you should call her.\u201d I reach around behind my back and pull out an empty prescription bottle. The label\u2019s ripped off so I can\u2019t tell what it was for. I wouldn\u2019t think anything of it, but I used to keep my drugs in something similar and it gets me wondering. No, there\u2019s no way Lila would be doing drugs. She\u2019s way too fucking preppy. I twist off the cap, glance inside, and then take a sniff. It doesn\u2019t smell like anything I\u2019m familiar with. Shaking my head, I put the lid on and toss it onto the table in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually really needed to call her,\u201d Ella replies. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been meaning to tell her... something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being weird,\u201d I point out, kicking my feet up on the table.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m being like that for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you have a reason then I guess we\u2019re okay,\u201d I joke sarcastically with a heavy sigh. Ella and I have always had this issue with each other, due to the fact that it always felt like she was interfering in Micha\u2019s and my friendship. We\u2019re not as bad as we used to be, but our clashing personalities will always sort of hinder us from being good friends. \u201cLook, can you just call her and talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she there now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you?\u201d There\u2019s insinuation in her tone.</p><p>\u201cSitting on the couch.\u201d I click the television off with the remote. \u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She pauses and I know whatever she\u2019s about to say is going to irritate me. \u201cIn the shower with her or watching her take one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d I say dryly, more offended than I probably should be. \u201cLook, just call her, okay? I\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she mutters. \u201cGod, you\u2019re in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure who hangs up first, but we probably do it at the same time. I\u2019m about to put my phone away when I get a text. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s Micha, because I figure Ella went and told him that I was being a jerk, but I\u2019m surprised to find that it\u2019s from London\u2019s mom, Rae. I haven\u2019t talked to her in more than seven or eight months, around the time I decided to give a go at living my lonely wanderer dream, living my life to the fullest, mainly because Rae had called me and reminded me of everything that happened, the stuff I\u2019ve tried to forget\u2014the life I tried to forget, yet I always feel imprisoned by it. But when I hit the road, there was the whole Micha and Ella drama. Micha was boozing it up, going completely fucking crazy because he thought Ella cheated on him. I remember when I got the call from Lila telling me what was up.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to New York, now,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cUm, no thanks,\u201d I\u2019d replied. \u201cI\u2019m trying to escape people, not go to a city packed with way too many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you want,\u201d she said, sound like a spoiled brat, which she did a lot. Then she proceeded to tell me how Ella had told her, after multiple shots, that she\u2019d only told Micha she\u2019d cheated on him because she thought it was the only way he\u2019d let her go. That he was too good for her and her insanity and deserved someone better.</p><p>As much as I agreed that Ella was insane, I didn\u2019t think the two of them should split up. They have the kind of love that most people, including myself, will never understand or experience. I don\u2019t think I even had it with London.</p><p>So I\u2019d agreed to go to a city I hated, to help fix the problem and try to make things right between the two of them even though it wasn\u2019t my responsibility. Why do I always try to fix things? I have no fucking clue other than it drives me crazy when other people are acting crazy when clearly they have it really good.</p><p>I slide my finger over my cell phone screen and read the text over.</p><p>Rae: I know we haven\u2019t talked in a while, but I wanted to check up on you and see how you were doing.</p><p>That\u2019s not the real reason why she\u2019s texting and I know it. She wants the same thing she wanted from me seven or eight months ago.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m fine.</p><p>Rae: Have you thought anymore about taking a trip to Virginia?</p><p>Me: Not sure I can.</p><p>Rae: Why not? You know it\u2019d be good for both of you.</p><p>Me: No, it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Rae: Please, I really need your help... London\u2019s getting worse.</p><p>And there it is. The real reason she\u2019s texting me. She wants hope. She needs to know that she\u2019s doing everything right. And she wants me to give her the resolution. But I can\u2019t because giving her false hope\u2014going there and seeing London\u2014means finally letting go. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that yet, whether I can allow myself to let go and fully accept reality. That what\u2019s done is done and I have to let go and move on.</p><p>Me:You know it\u2019s not going to do any good. It didn\u2019t the last time I tried and from what you told me seven months ago, everything\u2019s still the same with her as it was after the accident.</p><p>Rae:But I want to change that. If you\u2019d just come visit her, you might be able to change it. You were so close to her when it happened.</p><p>No, I can\u2019t. No one can. You know this\u2014everyone does\u2014and I don\u2019t want to see what I lost. My finger hovers of the button as I deliberate what to type back to her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I feel so much better,\u201d Lila says, tousling her wet hair with her fingers as she walks out of the hallway wearing only a towel. My jaw nearly hits the floor. It\u2019s a really, really fucking short towel, one that gives me a view of her thighs and if she turned around, I could probably see the bottom of her ass.</p><p>\u201cIs that a hand towel?\u201d I ask, half joking, half serious.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replies simply. She seems more relaxed and laid-back than when I picked her up. \u201cJust a normal towel.\u201d</p><p>I try not to stare as she sinks down on the sofa beside me. She doesn\u2019t even bother trying to keep the towel closed and I get a glimpse of her thighs, which I\u2019ve touched once so I know how soft her skin is. Just seeing them, I have to ball my hands into fists so that I\u2019ll keep them to myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI really needed to get last night off of me,\u201d she says, shaking her hair out. It falls against her bare shoulders, sending beads of water trickling down her skin. \u201cI felt so gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were being so bitchy?\u201d I stuff my phone into the pocket of my jeans. I need some time to think and process what she\u2019s asking me to do and if I can finally do it, not to give her hope but to say my good-bye.</p><p>She shrugs, examining her fingernails. \u201cI guess so,\u201d she says nonchalantly, putting her hand on her lap. \u201cHey, do you want to go out tonight or something?\u201d Lila smiles cheerfully at me as she relaxes back into the sofa, with her hair swept to the side. \u201cDrinks are on me for being a pain in the butt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d I say evasively. \u201cDid you get a phone call from Ella by chance?\u201d</p><p>Lila shakes her head and twirls a strand of her damp hair around her finger. \u201cNo, but I left my phone in my room, so maybe I missed a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call her.\u201d I pat her bare leg, slipping up again on one of my rules that I set with her: no inappropriate touching.</p><p>I\u2019m about to quickly pull away when she shudders under my touch and my muscles ravel as my palm presses against her warm, slightly damp skin. We both freeze and I swear to fucking God I can hear both of our hearts pounding insanely. This isn\u2019t the first time that an awkward, intense moment has happened between us and I\u2019m starting to think it won\u2019t be the last. I know I should pull back, because it\u2019s going to go somewhere beyond the friend zone if I don\u2019t, but her breathing accelerates, her chest rapidly rising and falling, her breasts heaving up and down with her deep, ravenous breaths. My cock goes hard and the idea of touching her is so tempting. Suddenly, like my damn hand has a mind of its own, it\u2019s slipping up her leg. Her skin is as soft as I remember. I knead my fingers into her thigh and she shudders again, her whole body quivering.</p><p>As my hand drifts higher up into the towel, my thoughts wandering to how it would feel if my fingers were inside of her. Fucking good, I\u2019m sure. Way too fucking good. I could find out. I know she\u2019d probably let me, but the fact that she would so easily makes me feel guilty. She lets just about everyone touch her, but not because she\u2019s a slut. I don\u2019t believe for one second that she is. There\u2019s something hidden inside her that she\u2019s trying to cover up with sex. I can see it in her eyes sometimes, when she gets really quiet. Sadness. Self-doubt. Self-torture, even.</p> <p>She\u2019s not like that now, though, seeming more content and subdued than anything. My hand lingers on the top of her thigh, my fingers brushing toward the inner section, which is even softer. I can feel warmth radiating off her and wetness. God damn it, she\u2019s getting wet and I can feel it, which only makes me want to feel more. As my fingers make a path inward, just about to brush across her wetness, she grips down on the armrest and moans. Actually arches her neck, tips her head back, and fucking moans. My pulse hammers as my fingertips press down into her skin. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cEthan... God...\u201d Her hair falls back from her shoulders, her chest bowing upward, and I nearly attack her with my lips, lick a path up her leg, slip my tongue inside her, something I\u2019ve wanted to do since the first day I laid eyes on her.</p><p>My fingers dig deeper into her skin, as confliction settles inside me. Pull my hand back. Keep going. Somehow I manage to snap my thoughts away from my cock and swiftly pull my hand away. I can\u2019t believe I screwed up again. I\u2019ve always had my rules about fucking around with girls who I had any sort of feelings for.</p><p>I\u2019m practically sweating as I get to my feet, digging my keys out of my pocket, hoping she doesn\u2019t notice my cock bulging in my shorts. \u201cI got a few things to do, but I\u2019ll check up on you a little bit later.\u201d I wait for her to say something about what just happened, that I almost stuck my fingers inside her, but all she does is frown up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to check up on me.\u201d She adjusts the bottom of the towel over her thighs, crosses her legs, and covers herself up a little. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly okay by myself.\u201d She smiles at me but it looks fake.</p><p>I move for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll check up on you later,\u201d I repeat, then open the door and step out into the sunlight, angry with myself for messing up and extremely angry at the part of me that wanted to mess up and throw my rules right out the window. I set them for a reason. To stop myself and others from getting hurt.</p> <p>As I head to my truck, my phone beeps from inside my pocket. I retrieve it and check the screen. Rae again. I think about texting her back and telling her that I won\u2019t go to Virginia. But part of me wants to see London again, even if she\u2019s not the same London I fell in love with. I want to say good-bye, yet I don\u2019t. And part of me wants to run back to Lila because for some reason, being around her makes me feel better. I\u2019m so confused at this point as thoughts of both London and Lila clash in my head. Who do I hold on to? London? The girl who I thought I once loved? The girl I lost and will never get back? The girl I walked away from, just left to shoot up? The girl who I wanted to know more than anything, but I missed my chance? Or should I just let her go? Release my guilt of walking away from her that day, just like that. Go around fucking girls, living life, doing whatever I want? Deep down I know I should have never walked away from her that day and that if I\u2019d stayed instead of thinking solely of myself then things might have been different today. Perhaps I\u2019d still be with her.</p><p>I can\u2019t let her go yet\u2014can\u2019t let go of my guilt. I should just be alone. It\u2019s for the best.</p><p>I end up skipping on sending back a text to Rae, knowing that by doing so I\u2019m allowing myself to continue to hold on to the idea of London and continue to think of Lila sitting up in her apartment in the hand towel at the same time.</p><p>My fucked-up thoughts are giving me a headache. \u201cShit,\u201d I mutter, kicking the tire.</p><p>I really fucking need a drink.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on the couch alone, wearing a towel, stunned and slightly ashamed of myself. I don\u2019t know what the hell happened. Well, actually I do since it\u2019s happened before, but it still doesn\u2019t make it any easier. One minute Ethan\u2019s hand was wandering up my thigh and it felt so good but then he just up and left, totally blowing me off, and it frustrates me because I want him. Badly.</p> <p>Ever since I met Ethan, that\u2019s how he\u2019s been toward me. He\u2019ll flirt with me all the time, yet for the most part he never acts on it, teasing me but never fully following through. I\u2019m always hoping he\u2019ll surprise me and finally do something, like show that he\u2019s attracted to me. Something tells me that he might be a little different from the other guys I\u2019ve slept with, sweeter, softer, or maybe rough, but in a good way. Usually, I\u2019m strictly a collared shirt, slacks, nice car, money kind of girl. But there\u2019s something about Ethan and the mysteriousness in his brown eyes, the intricate tattoos on his arms, and the way his black hair is always all over the place that makes me burn with curiosity. And part of me thinks that maybe, just maybe I\u2019d finally feel something besides unworthiness and humiliation after I had sex with Ethan. Although, I\u2019m really starting to wonder if I just have a broken vagina. And heart. And head.</p><p>After he leaves me high and dry, the two pills I popped before I took a shower quickly and fortunately kick in and everything\u2014even being alone in my empty apartment after Ethan blew me off\u2014feels okay. The pills keep away the memories and feelings of what happened last night, along with many other nights in my past. And not remembering them is important. Pain equals unwanted emotions, meltdowns, embarrassment. As much as I hate the blackouts the pills give me, I also hate temporary blackouts where bits and pieces come back to me in sharp, disgraceful images. All that does is remind me of what I\u2019ve become and how empty and insignificant I feel inside. Sometimes it feels like my body doesn\u2019t belong to me, like I lost it a long time ago and I\u2019ll never get it back. I wonder if this is how everyone feels after sex. If they feel so dirty and unclean.</p><p>It does seem like I\u2019ve been getting worse lately, but life seems to be getting harder. In the last year and a half my roommate and best friend moved out to go live her life and now I\u2019m alone. I tried to stand up for myself to my parents, telling them I wouldn\u2019t come home and live the life they want me to live, and in return my dad took away my car. A few months ago he also canceled all my credit cards and now I\u2019m running out of money and can\u2019t even come up with enough to pay my tuition. Being poor isn\u2019t something I think I can live with. So to escape the painful, shameful reality of how pathetic my life has become, I\u2019ve started sleeping around more and downing more and more pills.</p><p>I first started taking the pills when I was fourteen because my mother encouraged me to, saying they would help erase the shame and dirtiness I\u2019d been feeling. I\u2019d just had sex for the first time with a guy who pretty much used me and it turned out the pill worked brilliantly, numbing almost all of my emotions. So I\u2019ve been taking them ever since.</p><p>Sighing, I get dressed in a light-blue sundress, twist my hair up with some clips, and head to the kitchen to clean up the floor. Last night I spilled a bunch of wine on it, but I was too drunk to clean it up and now it\u2019s stuck to the tile and is stinking up the house. I grab a barely touched sponge and some cleaner out from under the sink, then try not to gag as I put a pair of rubber gloves on and get down on my hands and knees.</p><p>I hate cleaning up the house and try to avoid doing any sort of cleaning at all cost. I\u2019d been having someone come clean the house since Ella left, but I\u2019m running low on cash and can\u2019t afford her anymore. I get down on my hands and knees with a bucket of water and a sponge. As I\u2019m scrubbing the floors, my mother calls me and I almost laugh to myself, wondering what she would do if she saw me on my hands and knees scrubbing dirt off the floor with a sponge.</p><p>I turn around and sit down before answering my phone, noticing that I\u2019ve missed a call from Ella, like Ethan suspected. \u201cYes, mother,\u201d I answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you changed your mind about coming home?\u201d She\u2019s been saying the same thing to me ever since I announced my sudden decision to move to Vegas and attend UNLV over a year and a half ago. I\u2019d just graduated from boarding school and had returned home for the summer. My family thought I was going to Yale in the fall, only because I\u2019d lied to everyone and told them I was. I felt ashamed and I was angry at myself for feeling that way, like I couldn\u2019t just admit that I wasn\u2019t smart enough to go to a fancy school. I\u2019d felt ashamed for the last four years and I didn\u2019t want to feel that way anymore. I knew eventually I\u2019d have to tell everyone that I didn\u2019t get accepted to Yale or any other Ivy League school, so instead of facing it, I left. I packed my shit, opened a map, and pointed to a random place, which ended up being Vegas. I said good-bye to my mother and she fought me the entire way, yelling and screaming and saying that I\u2019d never make it on my own. But I had money and decent grades and UNLV accepted me in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I respond with the same answer I always give her. \u201cAnd I already told you I wasn\u2019t going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was hoping that your mind decided to be smart,\u201d she counters. \u201cBut then again, I guess I should know better. You\u2019ve proved over the last many, many years, just how stupid your decisions can be.\u201d She sounds more and more like my father the more time goes on. She\u2019s almost like clay, easily pliable and shapeable.</p> <p>I pick at my nail polish, debating whether to go to my room and take another pill. She\u2019s taking a jab at me for the huge mistake she\u2019ll never be able to forgive me for, not only because of what it made me look like but because it made her and my father look like they raised a slut.</p><p>\u201cDid you call for a reason?\u201d I ask calmly \u201cOr to just complain about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father wants you to come home,\u201d she states in a subdued voice. \u201cHe says if you do he\u2019ll give you back your car and credit cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs always, I\u2019m going to have to decline his offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as always you\u2019re going to make dumb choices that make this entire family look bad. Between your sister being a waitress and having an illegitimate child and your living in Vegas in an apartment, we look like the low-lives of the community.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe you should just tell everyone we\u2019re dead, then.\u201d I feel numb as I say it and I\u2019m thankful for the medication in my system. \u201cI mean, we both know how great you are about making up cover stories when one of us screws up.\u201d</p><p>She laughs cynically into the phone. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had good practice. I have one daughter who\u2019s an ex-junkie, and another daughter who\u2019s been a little slut since she was fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was confused and didn\u2019t completely understand what I was getting into.\u201d I swallow hard, trying not to think about where my journey of being a slut started. \u201cAnd you did nothing to help me. Nothing beneficial anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a choice, Lila,\u201d she retorts derisively. \u201cNo one made you do anything. You chose to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fourteen,\u201d I mumble, the detached feeling in my body starting to lift as the walls close in on me, shrinking me into a ball, just like they did to me when I was a child. My mother has that effect on me, even with a simple phone call. I cradle my knees against my chest and rest my chin on my knees.</p><p>\u201cExcuses are for the weak. And if you\u2019d just admit that you made a mistake, and that you continue to make them, then maybe you\u2019d finally be able to clean up your act.\u201d She sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful girl, Lila, and your looks could carry you really far in life. Imagine what kind of man you could get if you\u2019d try to date one instead of sleeping with them all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow, have you ever considered becoming a psychiatrist?\u201d I ask sarcastically. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be great at it.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up on me.</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised and I was hoping she would, otherwise she would have started lashing into me about how much of an utter disappointment I am. I press END, glad that I no longer have to talk to her. At the same time I\u2019m hurt that she views me like she does, that she hates me, wishes I was someone else, someone other than who I am. Although, I don\u2019t even know who that is so I can\u2019t figure out how she does.</p><p>I give myself thirty seconds to wallow, and then I call Ella to see what she wants.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answers cheerfully and I can\u2019t help but smile because she used to be so sad. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s happy, although part of me envies her.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you call earlier?\u201d I ask, lying down on the linoleum floor and staring up at the ceiling. I miss Ella and everything, but it\u2019s nice to live alone, too, because I\u2019d never just lie down on the floor in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured you might need to talk,\u201d she says and I hear Micha shout something in the background.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk later,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIf you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we can talk now,\u201d she insists. \u201cMicha\u2019s just yammering in my ear for no reason.\u201d There\u2019s laughter in her tone and Micha shouts out something else, but it sounds murmured through the phone. \u201cEthan made it sound like you needed to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh... He called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a little bit ago.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my lip, slightly irked, wondering if he called her to tell her to check up on me because I haven\u2019t been paying the rent. The last thing I want to do is tell Ella my problems when she has so many problems herself. Plus, I don\u2019t like talking about my issues\u2014it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been taught. The only person I\u2019ve told anything to is Ethan and even he doesn\u2019t know everything. \u201cWell, sorry to waste your time, but I don\u2019t really have anything to talk about.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been meaning to call you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I\u2019m trying to force the irritation out of my tone, but I can\u2019t quite get there. The pills need to kick it up a notch so I can feel artificially happy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call later,\u201d she says. \u201cYou sound annoyed right now.\u201d</p><p>I sigh heavily, stretching my legs out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just a little hung-over and taking it out on you. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she replies very cheerfully and very unlike the Ella I first met. \u201cYou\u2019ve put up with a lot of crap from me over the last couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, have we known each other for that long?\u201d I manage to keep my voice light and cheery, even though my head is aching.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re getting so old, right?\u201d she jokes, but she sounds kind of nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d I say, pushing up on my elbows. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that tone... the one you use when you have a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a tone.\u201d She pretends she has no idea what I\u2019m talking about, but her overly nonchalant attitude suggests otherwise.</p><p>I pinch the brim of my nose, trying to alleviate the pain in my head, and luckily my voice comes out sounding as if I\u2019m the cheery Lila, the one everyone needs to see. \u201cAll right, spill your guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She takes a deep breath. \u201cI kind of moved the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I exclaim and suddenly all of my crankiness diminishes. Ella has been wearing a ring Micha gave her on the opposite finger as the engagement one. The deal between the two of them was that when Ella felt ready to get engaged, she\u2019d move the ring to the other finger and it\u2019s finally official. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She dithers. \u201cActually it was a while ago... the day Micha and I left Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d I say, half joking, but kind of angry at the same time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... I guess because I was still getting used to it.\u201d</p><p>I absentmindedly turn the ring on my own finger, thinking about how sick and twisted I am that I won\u2019t get rid of it. I swear the God damn ring still owns me\u2014he still owns me. \u201cYou could have gotten used to it by telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I\u2019m really sorry. You know how I get about this kind of stuff though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I really, really do. Ella shuts down and keeps things hidden. I didn\u2019t know that when I met her so it was a surprise when I got to see this whole other side of her. She went from a quietly, orderly, good girl, to this loud, reckless, badass, and I sometimes wish I could be the same way. Carefree and outgoing and just living life exactly how I want in the moment, without having to be intoxicated.</p><p>Micha, her fianc\u00e9 now I guess, shouts something in the background and then Ella lets out a squeal in the phone. I hear a loud thump and then there\u2019s a lot of giggling. I wait for her to come back on, but the giggling only gets louder as she argues with Micha through her laughter about letting her go.</p><p>I roll my eyes, officially hating her for the beautiful relationship that she has and deserves. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to go. If you can hear me, congrats and I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>I drop the phone onto the floor and the quiet sets in. The sunlight sneaks through the cracks of the blinds and I can hear my next-door neighbors arguing about something. It\u2019s really loud and annoying and I yell, \u201cKeep it down!\u201d while banging on the wall.</p><p>They don\u2019t hear me though and keep shouting. The longer I lie there, the more the loneliness catches up with me, like a wave ready to slam into the shore. I want someone who will love me like Micha loves Ella. I want someone\u2014anyone\u2014just to love me. I\u2019ve been trying the best that I can to find that kind of love, but it never seems to work out and I\u2019m really starting to believe that I\u2019m beneath being loved.</p><p>I thought I had love once, very stupidly. I should have known better. He was too old to actually love a fourteen-year-old and after it was all over, after he\u2019d used me, he left me, brokenhearted, feeling dirty inside and confused over what I\u2014we\u2014had just done. Even now, when I look back at it, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, at least from an emotional aspect. But the pills make it easier to accept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI really did think he loved me,\u201d I mumble, feeling the tears sting at my eyes as I rotate the platinum-banded diamond ring around on my finger. \u201cHe seemed like he did.\u201d</p><p>I get up and walk out of the kitchen, heading for my room, wanting to escape my mistakes and the emptiness. The problem is that every time I do, I only add more mistakes to the list and I always end up alone. But I\u2019ll probably keep doing it over and over again because it\u2019s what I\u2019m good at\u2014screwing up, being a slut, sleeping around, praying I can find someone who will fall in love with the worthless bits and pieces of me and take care of me like my mother is constantly telling me should happen.</p><p>I open my nightstand drawer and stare down out the prescription bottle, twisting the ring on my finger, knowing that any more pills will send me into blackout mode. But I want to be in that mode right now because it momentarily makes me feel happy and content. I pick up the bottle and open it. As the pills slide down my throat, numbness slides through my body and I fall back on the bed with my hand placed on the scar along my stomach, my one flaw, both inside and outside.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure how boarding school is going, whether I like it or hate it. It seems weird living at a school at fourteen years old. Plus, I\u2019m having a hard time making friends. But I\u2019m trying.</p><p>\u201cYou see that older guy over there?\u201d Reshella Fairmamst, the girl I\u2019m working on becoming friends with says, pointing at the table across the library, at a man wearing a suit. He\u2019s sitting in a chair, reading an old tattered book.</p><p>Reshella Fairmamst isn\u2019t my friend, but I want her to be\u2014need her to be, otherwise I\u2019ll end up lonely and friendless. But becoming friends with her is tricky, because she\u2019s the richest, most entitled and popular girl in school. \u201cYou mean that old guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only twenty-two and he\u2019s part of the Elman family, who are totally wealthy.\u201d She flips her honey-blonde hair off her shoulder and holds her nose in the air as if she\u2019s smelling a bitter aroma. She does this a lot and I\u2019ve often wondered if it\u2019s out of arrogance or the fact that she\u2019s trying to make sure she doesn\u2019t have BO. \u201cHe\u2019s totally acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m only fourteen,\u201d I say stupidly as I twirl my hair around my finger. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to want me. He\u2019s like eight years older. \u201c</p> <p>She looks me over from the seat beside mine. She wears a lot of makeup and always has gray eyeliner on because she says it brings out her sharp features. She wears a strand of pearls daily and insists none of the Precious Bells wear them. The Precious Bells are her clique and to get into the clique you have to be the best of the best of the best.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not a good fit to be a Precious Bell,\u201d she says snidely. \u201cBecause to be one of us you have to be willing to date older men. We never, ever date guys in our school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I struggle against her condescending gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for you.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cOh please. It\u2019ll be easy for you if you just stop thinking so much like a child. It\u2019s time to grow up, Lila, unless you don\u2019t want to.\u201d She turns her head toward the group of girls and guys sitting at the round table in the corner, the ones everyone have deemed nerds and social outcasts, and my mother would never in a million years approve of me hanging out with.</p> <p>I think of the last words my mother said to me before she dropped me off at boarding school to live out the rest of my high school life: \u201cDo not embarrass us like your sister did. You will not hang out with crowds your father and I won\u2019t approve of and you will excel in your studies. Succeed, no matter what. Screw up, and we\u2019ll throw you out on the streets just like we did Abby.\u201d It was like she was reading a cue card written by my father, but I know it\u2019s the truth, because his threats always are. And I really don\u2019t want to live on the streets.</p><p>I sigh, straightening my posture. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I ask Reshella.</p><p>Her glossy pink lips curve to a grin. \u201cI want you to go over and get his number.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure it out,\u201d she says simply. \u201cAnd then, when you do, you\u2019ll officially be a Precious Bell.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I get up and step back from the table, nervous and near fainting as I make my way over to him. When I reach his table, he instantly looks up. His beauty throws me off guard, along with the hungry, intense look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lila,\u201d I say quickly, sticking my hand out like a spastic moron for him to shake. \u201cLila Summers.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirk, but he doesn\u2019t smile. He reaches over and takes my hand, but instead of shaking it he brings it to his lips and delicately kisses it. He has stubble on his chin and it grazes me, feeling both good and bad.</p> <p>\u201cLila, that\u2019s a beautiful name for a beautiful girl,\u201d he says thoughtfully as he looks back at me.</p><p>I notice he has a ring on his hand, a platinum band encrusted with diamonds. It\u2019s on his ring finger, too, and I wonder if he\u2019s married. I wonder if I should ask. I feel so nervous right now, I\u2019m starting to sweat.</p><p>I grin, though, kind of smitten by his dazzling smile, my heart throbbing inside my chest at the way he\u2019s looking at me. It makes me feel kind of special. And I\u2019ve never really felt special before. For a moment I can be just a beautiful girl standing in front of a gorgeous guy, thinking she\u2019s the most amazing person in the world.</p><p>What I really should have been thinking, though, was how stupid and na\u00efve I was.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I can\u2019t get up from my fucking bed, not just because I drank a six pack of beer, but because I really don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ve got the damn bracelet out again, the one she gave me so I would always remember her. It\u2019s on my bed beside my journal, both of them haunting me with memories. I\u2019m lying flat on my stomach, moping like a pussy over a girl who doesn\u2019t exist anymore and shouldn\u2019t exist to me anymore. I need to let her go. But I can\u2019t seem to. I\u2019ve always hated the idea of relationships\u2014still do. I\u2019d seen them at their grand ugliest and pretty much made my mind up that love and commitment were faulted, fictional, but then London came along and my views changed\u2014I changed. And I don\u2019t understand why, what it was about her that made me think differently. And now she\u2019s gone and I\u2019ve yet to find anyone else who makes me reconsider my warped, yet insightful view on eternal and never-ending love.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to take my eyes off the bracelet since I lay down. It\u2019s there in front of me, reminding me of everything that happened between London and me and everything that didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a beautiful guy,\u201d London used to say all the time. In fact, she\u2019d pretty much sing it to me. \u201cWhich is why you can pull off wearing a bracelet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d shake my head. \u201cNo fucking way am I ever going to wear a bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s from me?\u201d she questioned with amusement as she traced her fingers down my face.</p><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s from you.\u201d I was such a douche to her, totally in my father\u2019s asshole character and I\u2019ll always hate myself for it. The thing is she never really did seem to care. I never knew what she was thinking or feeling and she never got to see me wear the bracelet. I could put it on now, but what would be the point. It doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore, no connection to anything real. It\u2019s pretty much just a piece of leather with \u201cE&amp;L\u201d imprinted on it.</p><p>I lean forward, observing it closely, realizing that it could also stand for Ethan and Lila, which makes me hurt only more because I\u2019m thinking about Lila instead of London. What I really want is to not be thinking about anyone. I want silence. Solitude. I want my God damn thoughts to turn off.</p><p>Shaking my head, I toss the bracelet aside, out of my line of vision. I need to get out of the house, otherwise I\u2019m going to drift into that place where I get stuck in my own head and pretty much lock myself in a box. My mother always called it being unsociable and a few shrinks referred to it as social anxiety and I call it knowing too much. A couple of shrinks wanted to put me on something for it when I was about fourteen and got super stressed out about the idea of starting high school, not because I was afraid but because it seemed like there were so many people just moving together in herds. All I could think about was the loss of the peace and quiet I\u2019d gained over the summer and all the other stuff I\u2019d rather be doing.</p><p>I\u2019ve always loved the quiet, although I\u2019ve never really gotten much of it. When I was growing up, I had my brothers always pounding on me. Then they moved out and I was left with my dad constantly yelling at my mom and sometimes he would even hit her. I tried to interfere and ended up taking a few blows myself, which was fine except both my dad and my mom ended up mad at me. My mom told me that I didn\u2019t need to interfere with things that weren\u2019t my business. I was, like, thirteen and it totally confused me. When I asked her why, she simply said, \u201cBecause I love your father more than anything and he\u2019s just going through a rough time in his life.\u201d Just like he was when I was in second grade and he was addicted to pain pills. Sometimes I worry I\u2019m going to turn out like him, that eventually I will end up with someone and this ugly, abusive person will manifest itself inside me.</p><p>Eventually my dad stopped hitting my mom\u2014although to this day he walks all over her\u2014but I still saw enough of the ugly, and how easily it was forgotten, that I really question why relationships are so important. Even with London, I didn\u2019t see the importance of us declaring that we were together. We never said \u201cI love you,\u201d even though I think we both felt it. Sometimes I think I still do... maybe... I think so anyway. Shit, I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cI really need to get out of here.\u201d I push off my bed, grab my phone and keys, and head out the door. I think about going to a club, but I hate the noise. I consider a bar, which is lower key, but honestly I just want to walk, move forward, stop sitting still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a cab to the strip, order a drink from this building that\u2019s a smaller replica of the Eiffel Tower, and then walk up the crowded sidewalk, shoving my way through the crowd, wishing I was some place else instead. It\u2019s as loud as being in a club, but I\u2019m outdoors so it\u2019s easier to breathe through it. I wander around sipping my drink, watching the neon lights blink. For a while I consider calling Lila and asking her to come meet me, but I\u2019m afraid what will happen if she did. I feel bad for blowing her off, but I\u2019m in one of my need-to-get-laid moods, which is the best way to turn off my thoughts, and with Lila around, I might end up breaking the rules I set with her. Then what? We\u2019d fuck and things would get awkward and all those fun, light talks that we have, and the rescue missions, would get awkward and probably vanish.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s all wound up on the sidewalks and in the clubs, talking, chatting, smiling, groping the shit out of each other. While I\u2019m throwing my empty cup away, I spot a few girls in ridiculously short dresses. One\u2019s eyeballing me and I think: Now there\u2019s the distraction I\u2019ve been looking for. I shove any emotions out of me before approaching them. Micha used to do this shit with me all the time, which made it easier.</p><p>I pick the brunette in a red leather dress for no other reason than she seems more interested in me than the other two. I flirt and I smile at her and we walk up and down the strip together. She keeps running her fingers up and down my chest and batting her eyelashes.</p> <p>\u201cWe should go back to your place,\u201d she finally shouts over the noise as we reach the heart of the casinos.</p><p>I nod, but make sure to play by the rules: always let them know where I stand. \u201cWe can do that, but just so you know, I just want to fuck. I\u2019m not looking for a relationship.\u201d I\u2019m blunt, but I have to be. The last thing I want is to be misleading and either hurt someone or have them cling on to me.</p><p>She grins up at me as she traces my bottom lip with her pinkie nail. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want, too.\u201d</p><p>About an hour later I\u2019m screwing her in my apartment and there is no meaning behind it. She\u2019s using me and I\u2019m using her. We\u2019re just two shells of people with body heat that have absolutely no substance to them at the moment other than what we\u2019re searching for\u2014peace and calm. I never find it, though. But that might be because I never allow myself to.</p><p>Somewhere I lose track of what she looks like and picture her with short black hair, like London, and the more it continues the more she starts to look like Lila. It\u2019s completely messed up and defeats the purpose of having sex and trying to forget my problems. I don\u2019t want to be thinking of Lila\u2014I don\u2019t want to be thinking of anything. I just want a clear head, and when it\u2019s over I go back to being alone, following my rules so I don\u2019t have to get close to anyone and move on. Let go. Accept the reality that London\u2019s never coming back to me and that she isn\u2019t because I chose to let her walk away.</p> <p>Once we\u2019re done fucking, she gets up and tells me thanks while getting dressed and thoughts of London drift away as exhaustion overtakes me, yet Lila remains in my head as I wonder what she\u2019s doing right at this moment. I mutter a \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d and then she leaves, without giving me her number. I roll over in my bed, feeling alone, yet quietly content on the inside, exactly how I want to be. I glance at the clock and realize it\u2019s only nine o\u2019clock, though. Fuck. What the hell am I supposed to do for the rest of the night?</p><p>Shaking my head, I turn over and take my journal out, doing the only thing I can do to pass the time and try not to think about London and the last time I saw her. I can never forget it, how I just walked away from her. I end up writing about the morning when I found out she was gone, even though I promised myself a long time ago to forget about it. But it can\u2019t seem to forget me.</p><p>The phone rings. It\u2019s like a song. A very annoying song that has a sullen tune and lyrics full of angst and remorse. I\u2019m not even sure how I know it\u2019s bad news. I just do, and when I answer the phone and hear the sob, I know she\u2019s gone, but not in the way I expected.</p><p>She\u2019s gone.</p><p>But she\u2019s not.</p><p>She\u2019s in between death and life. Lost. Maybe forever. Maybe not. Who knows? No one really seemed to know much, and in the end the real London was gone, her mind always dying, veering closer and closer to death, but right at the last second it fleetingly starts to thrive again before starting the whole process over. She was always half starved, famished, unhealed, yet healed at the same time. It never made sense. None of it did with her.</p> <p>None of it ever does.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Lila</p><p>I love shopping, probably way too much. Spending money and buying clothes, for whatever reason, fills the void inside my heart. My mom used to drag me along with her all the time while she shopped. She\u2019d go on these outrageous spending sprees every time my father would upset her. Instead of confronting him, she\u2019d buy stuff and then put it all on and make herself look pretty. I remember watching her put new dresses on, shoes, and jewelry, and then she\u2019d stand in front of the mirror and admire herself with a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I look pretty?\u201d she\u2019d ask me and I\u2019d always nod because she always did look gorgeous and glamorous to me. She\u2019d turn toward me and look me over, like I was a doll, sometimes even letting me try some of her stuff on. \u201cOne day, when you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll be as beautiful as me, Lila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I\u2019m not?\u201d I\u2019d asked, because some of the older people around the neighborhood that I\u2019d seen weren\u2019t pretty like my mother. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t turn out as pretty as you?\u201d</p><p>She clipped on a pair of diamond earrings that shimmered in the light flowing from the chandelier. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to make sure you do, Lila. No man wants an ugly woman.\u201d</p><p>Even at the young age that I was, I can remember thinking how strange her response was, especially since my teacher was always telling us that beauty lay more on the inside than the outside. Still, something about her words stuck with me and, whenever I get a new outfit and put it on, it temporarily makes me feel beautiful. If only the feeling would just last. Then I could stop spending so much money and wouldn\u2019t be going broke, nor would I have to take the pills. I\u2019ll figure something out, though. One day.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously, Lila,\u201d Ethan complains as he follows me through the mall. He\u2019s been in a downer mood the last few times we\u2019ve hung out, but today he\u2019s extremely down because he hates shopping. \u201cNo more shopping. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s got a loose pair of jeans on that are frayed at the bottom and there\u2019s a hole in the hem of his green-and-black plaid shirt. He has an array of leather bands on his wrist, all of which look handmade. If only he\u2019d try to dress nicely, then he\u2019d be so sexy it\u2019d be impossible for any girl to turn him down. Not like a lot do. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I say, weaving around the shirt section in the men\u2019s department. I\u2019m on a shopping high, not to mention the fact that I popped three pills before I left. I feel euphorically happy at the moment, so happy in fact that I think my smile might be real. \u201cWe\u2019ve been out for only, like, a few hours.\u201d</p><p>He exaggeratedly widens his eyes as he turns his wrist toward himself to check the time on his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been out for a few too many hours then.\u201d</p><p>I rummage through the clearance rack because Ethan will never buy anything that\u2019s not on sale. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I hate riding the bus and I needed to go shopping.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, letting his hand drop to his side. He\u2019s carrying my bags for me, which I\u2019m secretly smiling about. He didn\u2019t even say anything when I handed them to him, as if he\u2019s gotten used to the fact that I\u2019m going to ask him to help carry them. \u201cFine, but can you please hurry up? I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>I slip a hanger off the rack and check the tag on the shirt. It\u2019s a little high-priced for him, but I\u2019m going to try anyway, because it\u2019s this light shade of pale pink and I love, love the color. \u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cAnything besides shopping.\u201d</p><p>I hold the shirt up to him. \u201cYou should totally get this. It\u2019ll bring out the color in your eyes.\u201d I dazzle him with a sunny smile.</p><p>He sticks out his tongue and makes a gagging face. \u201cThe only time I would ever wear a shirt like this is if for some insane reason I wanted to get my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I say, angling my head to the side as I position it higher on his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d His expression is neutral.</p><p>\u201cA pretty pink,\u201d I point out, grinning at him.</p><p>He just stares at me.</p><p>\u201cOh fine, whatever.\u201d I roll my eyes, but smile as I put the shirt back where I found it and turn to face him. \u201cI try to help, but you never let me. You could dress so much nicer.\u201d I flick the hole in his shirt with my finger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to dress nicer,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I need is to get the hell out of here. I hate shopping, malls, crowded places where everyone is acting all money crazy. Besides,\u201d he says and arches his eyebrows, \u201chave you even paid your rent yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I lie, frustrated with him for ruining my cheery mood created from the perfect balance of pills and new clothes. I hurry around him, though, hoping he won\u2019t notice my abrupt sunken mood.</p><p>His fingers wrap around my arm and stop me from going any farther. \u201cLila.\u201d</p><p>I roll my head back as I let out a frustrated sigh. \u201cOh, fine. I haven\u2019t yet, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney that I have.\u201d</p><p>He holds on to my arm, refusing to let go. \u201cYou\u2019re being cryptic.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s because I don\u2019t have an answer. I crane my neck and look at him. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to pay it. In fact, these clothes I\u2019m buying are so I can go apply for jobs.\u201d A huge lie, but I don\u2019t want him hassling me when I\u2019m actually feeling good inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He doesn\u2019t look like he believes me, but he lets go of my arm. \u201cDo me a favor, pay for the stuff you have and then come with me somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I have a few shirts draped over my arm and a skirt. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere I want to go,\u201d he says, leaning his elbow on the rack next to him. \u201cI figure if I can spend the day shopping then you can spend some time doing what I want to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a strip club, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it matter?\u201d he asks curiously. \u201cWould you go with me if I wanted to go to a strip club?\u201d</p><p>I can feel my cheeks heat, which doesn\u2019t happen that often. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Can\u2019t I get herpes or something just from going in there?\u201d</p><p>He snorts a laugh. \u201cThat depends on what you\u2019re touching.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flame hotter, something only Ethan is capable of causing. \u201cI won\u2019t be touching anything.\u201d</p> <p>He eyes me over quizzically and then his eyes darken. \u201cBut you\u2019d go with me, then?\u201d</p><p>I bite on my lip. I\u2019m not sure why, but the idea of going to a strip club with him seems naughty and kind of sexy. I can picture him getting turned on and the look on his face would be totally hot. Jesus. I\u2019m getting hot just thinking about it. \u201cI\u2019m going to go pay for my clothes.\u201d I hastily head for the cash register, dodging the subject.</p><p>His laughter hits my back and I have the urge to wind around and slap his arm or something. Honestly, what I have the urge to do to him should never be done in the middle of a store. It would be something that could happen only in the bedroom. His bedroom probably, since I\u2019m going to end up getting evicted from mine.</p><p>Crap. What am I going to do? As the pressure of reality crashes on to my shoulders, I almost put the clothes back because I know I shouldn\u2019t be buying them. But then I think about how good I\u2019ll look in them and how, really, my looks are all I have. So I put the clothes on the counter, doing exactly what I was taught to do.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I\u2019m making her pay me back for dragging me around the mall. I hate shopping, watching people buy stuff they really don\u2019t need. It\u2019s so pointless. Give me a T-shirt, jeans, and a pair of boxers and I\u2019m seriously good to go for a week.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making me do this,\u201d Lila complains after I take her to where I want to go. \u201cI hate getting dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you made me carry your bags,\u201d I reply, smiling up at the clear, blue, unpolluted sky. \u201cI hate shopping.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re out in the middle of the desert, the city far, far away in the distances, along with the noise and chaos of it. The sun is shining down on us and there\u2019s a little bit of sand on the blanket we\u2019re spread out on. We\u2019re side by side on our backs, squinting up at the sun. Lila has her arm draped over her forehead, acting overdramatic and I have my hand tucked under my head, feeling totally in my element. The quiet. The bare space. I love it. It makes all the crap jumbled in my head clear out. I just wish I could hold on to it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make you carry my bags,\u201d she protests. \u201cI just handed them to you and you took them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, shutting my eyes as the cool air blankets me. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a sucker, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou totally are,\u201d she muses. \u201cBut a sexy sucker.\u201d</p><p>It grows quiet between us. It\u2019s not news that Lila thinks I\u2019m sexy. She\u2019s hit on me way too many times for it not to be evident, but it still makes things tense between us and the sexual tension builds.</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019m just going to pack up my shit and take off,\u201d I say, causally changing the subject. \u201cI seriously want to spend a year just driving around the country, sightseeing.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment, mulling something over. \u201cBut where would you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your truck?\u201d she says. I feel her shift and I open my eyes, blinking up at her as she hovers over me with an astonished, almost horrified look on her face. \u201cHow is that even possible? I mean, where would you sleep?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s got a backseat. What more do I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, running water, a toilet, a fridge. Clothes. Shoes. Jesus, I could go on.\u201d She sits up straight, tucking her legs under her to raise herself up on her knees. \u201cAnd where would you keep all your stuff, like your television?\u201d</p><p>I shrug again. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d be okay with leaving them all behind, but I\u2019d probably just get a storage unit so I didn\u2019t have to start over if I ever decided to settle down again.\u201d</p><p>She seems angry, her face sharp, her gaze nearly cutting into me. \u201cBut you tried the whole loner thing already when you took that road trip and it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did work out, but Micha asked me to move to Vegas with him so he could be close to Ella and he couldn\u2019t afford to do it alone.\u201d I prop up on my elbows. \u201cI was doing just fine being on the road alone. It was my niceness that got in the way of it.\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows as she gathers her hair at the back of her neck, fanning her hand in front of her face as her skin dews with heat. \u201cYou\u2019re always telling me you\u2019re not nice.\u201d Her voice is tight and her face pinched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually not.\u201d I sit up and brush some sand out of my hair. \u201cWhy is this bothering you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she snaps, turning her back to me. \u201cI was just wondering why. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the back of her head as she rests her chin on her knees, staring out at the desert land. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re bothered,\u201d I point out.</p><p>Her shoulders lift and descend as she shrugs. \u201cIf you leave, then I\u2019ll be alone.\u201d She mutters it so quietly I can barely hear her.</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a while, unsure what to say or if there\u2019s anything I can say\u2014want to say. \u201cYou can come with me.\u201d It slips out and I want to smack myself on the head. Taking her with me would defeat the purpose of escaping the noise and people, yet at the same time I know I\u2019d miss her if I left her behind.</p><p>She glances over her shoulder with skepticism on her face. \u201cCould you imagine me living in your truck, because I sure as heck can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Again, what the hell is wrong with my mouth? Why can\u2019t I just let it go? She\u2019s giving me such an easy out to a huge commitment I shouldn\u2019t be taking.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the silliest reason I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t understand why anyone would want to take off from a city where you have everything at hand and live in a truck where you have nothing but a backseat. It\u2019s pretty much like being homeless.\u201d</p><p>I kneel behind her, inching close to her, then hesitantly place my hand on her shoulder. \u201cShut your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She leans away, like I\u2019m scaring her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to prove what\u2019s so awesome about my idea.\u201d I wait for her to do what I ask and she stubbornly drags it on for longer than necessary, then finally surrenders and turns around.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her voice softens a little. \u201cShow me what\u2019s so great about a backseat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things about a backseat,\u201d I joke in a low voice, and then dip my lips toward her ear and whisper, \u201cNow shut your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I expect her to argue, but she very willingly obeys, shutting her eyes the second I utter the words. I shut mine, too, but only because being so close to her, breathing in her scent, feeling the warmth emitting from her body is driving my body into a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cNow picture nothing but mountains,\u201d I say softly, picturing it myself. \u201cNo city. No noise. No crazy-ass parents who act like children and treat their children like shit. No nothing. Just the quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like an awfully lonely place, if you ask me,\u201d she tells me. \u201cJust me and the dirt and the quiet. Although I wouldn\u2019t mind the being without the parents part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be completely alone.\u201d I sweep her head to the side and rest my chin on her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019d be with me.\u201d</p><p>She pauses for an eternity and her breathing is ragged. Or maybe it\u2019s mine. \u201cWhat would we do at this mountain place together?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAnything we wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHike?\u201d There\u2019s disdain in her voice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cOr maybe we\u2019d just sit and enjoy each other\u2019s company in the quiet.\u201d</p><p>She shifts her weight and situates her hands underneath her legs, leaning back against my chest. \u201cThat kind of sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>As strange as it is, and as much of a pain in the ass as Lila can be, I can actually picture us sitting together up on the mountains in the noiselessness, living in my truck, driving anywhere and everywhere. Together. And the comfort in the idea is kind of frightening because it means I\u2019m thinking about our future. Together. Shit.</p><p>I think about moving away from her, putting a little space between us because obviously I\u2019m heading down a road I shouldn\u2019t be headed down. The dream of living on the road has always been one I\u2019d planned to live out alone and now suddenly I\u2019m telling Lila she should come with me. God knows what would happen between us if we lived in a truck with one another. We\u2019d either grow really close or end up hating each other. Or maybe both. But I can\u2019t bring myself to move and break the peaceful moment. So instead I sit down and wrap my legs and arms around her and we just sit there in the sun, enjoying each other in the quiet.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Lila</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how one moment in life can be beautiful, and then you return home\u2014to reality\u2014and remember that beauty isn\u2019t everything and that the ugly painful part will always exist in the form of unpaid bills, bad choices, and tiny white pills.</p><p>At what point do you finally admit that your life is falling apart, not to just yourself but to the outside world? When should I finally tell someone what\u2019s really going on? That I\u2019m penniless pretty much, soon to be homeless, carless, jobless, everythingless. That my mother was right. I was nothing without their help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought about telling Ella once, a couple of months before she left for California, about some of my money and even my pill issues, but then I remembered what I\u2019d been taught and decided it was best to keep my mouth shut. Besides, now she\u2019s got her own life with Micha. And I\u2019m here, wondering what I should do with my life because I want to do something\u2014anything. I wonder how long I can keep going like this, blacking out, having unmemorable sex, like I did the other night with some random guy I met at a club. It was after Ethan suggested our road trip together, even though I\u2019m still not certain if he was being serious. Afterward he had to drop me off at my apartment because he had stuff to do and the emptiness and silence wore me down and I went looking for someone to fix it, after I\u2019d taken a few pills. I\u2019ve even considered telling Ethan about my problems a few times because I know he\u2019s done drugs in the past and might understand what I\u2019m going through, maybe just a little. Although, it\u2019s not really the same. I mean he did weed and stuff and I just do pills.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Lila.\u201d Ethan waves his hand in front of my face. I blink and then direct my focus to him. He shakes his head in disbelief as he shoves up the sleeves of his black-and-red plaid shirt that has a torn front pocket. \u201cYou totally just spaced out for, like, five minutes straight,\u201d he says, resting his heavily inked arms on the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re so boring,\u201d I tease with a grin, stirring my Long Island iced tea with my straw. We\u2019re in a quiet bar with dim lighting and small lanterns on each table. Music plays from a jukebox in the corner near the restrooms and we have a platter of mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, and hot wings in front of us. It\u2019s not usually my kind of scene\u2014I like more glitz and glamour with a more sparkling atmosphere, classy music, fancier food, and top-shelf drinks. But I\u2019m enjoying it for some bizarre reason, maybe because I feel heavily subdued. Or maybe it\u2019s because of Ethan. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely said two words to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I think it was five,\u201d he says indifferently, but the corners of his lips quirk. He picks up his glass of ice water and takes a sip.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you drink water?\u201d I remark and wrap my lips around the straw, taking a swallow of my drink.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a break from drinking.\u201d He ogles some blonde wearing a tacky leather skirt and a bright pink tube top at the bar and I have to resist the urge to slap him against the back of the head. \u201cIt\u2019s getting exhausting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d I say and he crooks an eyebrow, staring at the drink in front of me. \u201cNo, not about drinking. About other stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d He picks up a mozzarella stick and dips it into the cup of marina sauce.</p> <p>\u201cLike stuff,\u201d I respond vaguely, and then reach for a jalapeno popper. It took me a while to actually try one, because the idea of eating something that had the word \u201cpopper\u201d in it seemed repulsive. But they are really good. Way better than the appetizers at the restaurants I grew up eating at.</p><p>\u201cCare to share the stuff?\u201d He has a string of cheese on his chin from the mozzarella stick.</p><p>Biting my lip to restrain from smiling, I extend my arm across the table and pick it off, letting my fingertips graze the stubble on his chin, pretending it\u2019s by accident, when really I just like touching him.</p><p>His brown eyes widen and his lips part as I lean back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYou had cheese on your chin,\u201d I explain, flicking it to the ground. He quickly wipes his chin with his hand and I laugh. \u201cI just got it off. Duh.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cI was just making sure you got all of it.\u201d</p> <p>I dip a stick into a cup of ranch. \u201cI got it all, so relax. I would never let you walk around with cheese hanging off your face,\u201d I tease. \u201cAlthough, it would be kind of fun to watch you go hit on the slut over at the bar with cheese on your face.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips quirk as he watches me chew and he leans back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could still get her to let me fuck her.\u201d</p><p>I throw a mozzarella stick at him, but he ducks so it misses his head. \u201cYou are such an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I say the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the foulest ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Saying fuck is foul?\u201d he asks. \u201cWould you rather me say let me screw her? Bang her? Let her ride me? Give her the hottest, sweatiest, lip bitingest, best orgasm she\u2019ll probably have?\u201d His voice is getting louder and people are watching us, which seems only to amuse him while it embarrasses me.</p><p>\u201cEthan, please keep it down,\u201d I hiss, glancing at the tables around us, embarrassed, but a giggle escapes my lips. \u201cPeople are watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the dirty nasty with me?\u201d he continues, unbothered, his brown eyes darkening as he leans back in his chair, watching me with an arrogant grin on his face. \u201cFuck her brains out? Or should I just make the noises for you so you really get the picture?\u201d He tips his head back, his black hair falling back out of his eyes, and he starts making little moans. Even though it\u2019s embarrassing, it\u2019s also turning me on. Especially how his lips hypnotically move and the way the light reflects in his eyes and makes them look lustrous.</p> <p>Stop thinking about him like that. He made his rules for a reason. Shaking my head and the near-orgasmic feeling out of my body, I lean over the table and cover his moaning lips with my hand. \u201cOkay, I get the picture. Will you stop now?\u201d</p><p>His grin broadens against my hand and I withdraw, sitting back down in the chair. \u201cI win,\u201d he says and winks at me.</p><p>I shake my head, but smile brightly. \u201cFor the record, fucking her and fucking her brains out are pretty much one and the same.\u201d</p><p>He covers his mouth with his hand, containing his laughter, because he always seems to think it\u2019s funny when I say the F word. In fact, he blames it on his bad influence on me. \u201cOh, I completely disagree. A lot more effort goes into fucking someone\u2019s brains out.\u201d</p><p>I want to argue with him, but I stop myself, because even though I\u2019ve had a lot of sex, I\u2019ve had a lot of meaningless sex, which doesn\u2019t make me an expert. I\u2019ve often wondered what sex would feel like if I wasn\u2019t high on alcohol and/or pills. Would it feel different? Would I feel different, less worthless, or would I feel more? Would it finally feel good for once? Hot, sweaty, and lip biting? I wonder what it would feel like with Ethan...</p><p>I dive into the wings, eating one after another, trying to contain my sex-driven thoughts. Ethan devours the jalapeno poppers and continues to check out the slut at the bar, who\u2019s now noticed him, probably because of his moaning and groaning. She looks interested and he\u2019ll probably go home with her, which is fine. I\u2019ve seen him do it a ton of times.</p><p>Ethan finally tears his attention off her and it looks like he wants to say something but is wary about it. I figure he\u2019s probably about to ask if he can go do his thing with her and I prepare myself for the stomach punch I always feel when he does this sort of thing.</p><p>He blows out a breath and wisps of his hair flutter to the side of his face. \u201cDid you ever get your rent thing taken care of?\u201d he asks, completely blindsiding me.</p><p>\u201cUm... what... oh, yeah I did,\u201d I lie, licking some barbecue sauce off my lip.</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at me with skepticism on his face. \u201cLila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Lila me.\u201d I sound whiney and I clear my throat, reaching for a napkin. \u201cOkay, so I haven\u2019t yet, but I\u2019m working on it. I just need to get a job, but they\u2019re really hard to find.\u201d</p><p>He hitches a finger over his shoulder, pointing at the bar, where a guy is wiping down glasses with a towel. \u201cThey\u2019re hiring here.\u201d</p><p>I eye the bar as I wipe the barbecue sauce off my fingers. \u201cYeah, for a waitress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I can\u2019t be a waitress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You could end up being good at it.\u201d He inclines forward, resting his arms on the table, and amusement dances in his eyes. \u201cAnd think of all the tips you\u2019d get if you wore a short, low-cut dress that showed off all your goods.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t dress like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could always wear that towel of yours,\u201d he says in a husky voice. \u201cYou looked good in that.\u201d</p><p>It feels like I\u2019m falling, air gets trapped in my lungs and my heart flutters at the hooded look he\u2019s giving me. I\u2019m about to ask him if he liked the towel, because I would seriously put it on for him right here, right now, when he sputters a laugh.</p><p>\u201cRelax, I\u2019m just messing with you.\u201d He scoops up a wing and takes a large bite. \u201cI\u2019d rather you not dress like that out in public.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, feeling like an idiot. Of course he\u2019s just teasing. He always is. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be between us. Just friends. But then what the hell was that hyperventilating, falling-off-the-cliff feeling then? \u201cI knew you were,\u201d I lie, sounding pathetically disappointed and feeling strangely conflicted inside.</p><p>His expression falls a little and he forces the bite of chicken down his throat. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly okay.\u201d I tuck a strand of my hair behind my ear as I lean forward in the chair and dunk a wing into the ranch, biting my tongue hard as I struggle to keep the tears back. Stop it. You don\u2019t ever get upset over a guy like this. Get it together. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking that you\u2019re right and I do need a job, but not here.\u201d My heart is aching inside my chest and I don\u2019t know why, but I feel furious. \u201cAnd just because I like sex doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to use my body for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was just joking about the towel.\u201d His eyebrows lower as he studies me. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you I don\u2019t think of you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d I snap, dropping the wing back into the basket. \u201cA slut. An easy lay. A whore.\u201d I hate the word whore. Hate it! But it sums up what I am really well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He throws up his hands exasperatedly. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to fight with you. I\u2019m just trying to help, but clearly I\u2019m not doing that so I\u2019ll back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want your help because I don\u2019t need help.\u201d I shove away from the table, my heart racing. Is it time for another pill yet? I feel like I\u2019m crashing. I wind around the table, picking my purse off the back of my chair, then storm for the exit and shove out the front doors, stepping out onto the street. I start to walk down the busy sidewalk, searching the streets for a cab since I didn\u2019t drive here. I start twisting the platinum ring on my finger as my emotions take over and the need to medicate burns inside me. I know I\u2019m acting ridiculous and probably look nuts because of my abrupt switch in moods. I could try to blame it solely on the fact that I need a pill, but it\u2019s much deeper\u2014like the fact I have so many bills and no money left, that I\u2019m proving my parents right and I can\u2019t take care of myself, that I\u2019m going nowhere with my life and have no idea how to change it. And then there\u2019s Ethan. God damn him for being so sexy. Seriously. I\u2019ve liked him since the first day I met him and it gets harder to be around him when it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want me, at least not how I want him. He just teases me. Plain and simple.</p><p>I reach the corner of the sidewalk and look left and right before I step off the curb. The evening sky is cloudy and there\u2019s the faintest scent of rain in the air. I hope it doesn\u2019t start raining because I don\u2019t have a jacket on and I\u2019m wearing opened-toed satin high heels and water will ruin them.</p> <p>\u201cLila!\u201d I hear Ethan shout as I reach the other side of the street.</p><p>Having no desire to talk to him right now, I pick up the pace. I hear the sound of his footsteps rushing after me, but I only walk quicker, balling my hands into fists, and the platinum ring digs into my skin. I clench them even tighter, hyperaware of the pain as the metal indents into my skin and of each scar on my body, all linked to the damn ring.</p><p>\u201cGod damn it, Lila.\u201d He\u2019s getting irritated. \u201cSlow the fuck down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan, just leave me alone,\u201d I call out over my shoulder, wrapping my arms around myself. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to talk right now.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his footsteps get closer as I zigzag around a group of people standing in front of one of the older casinos. \u201cI know you\u2019re not, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should leave you alone walking down the fucking strip by yourself.\u201d</p> <p>I pause near the street post beside a mob of people waiting to cross and I deliberate if I should turn around. I don\u2019t move as his footsteps arrive beside me, but I don\u2019t turn my head and look at him either.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says, panting. \u201cI have no idea what the hell happened back there, but whatever I did or said to make you mad, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d In the year that I\u2019ve known Ethan, I\u2019ve never heard him give a genuine apology.</p><p>With my arms crossed over my chest, I peek over at him, feeling the slightest bit embarrassed over my outburst. Ethan looks sincere, his eyes dark and slightly wide underneath the flashing florescent lights, and his chest is moving rapidly as he works to regain his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry.\u201d I sigh as uncross my arms. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d</p><p>He rakes his fingers through his hair. \u201cThen why the heck did you take off?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, shuffling my shoes on the sidewalk. \u201cI don\u2019t know... I guess I\u2019m just feeling a little down lately and I was taking it out on you.\u201d I put my fake, pill-induced game face on and smile at him. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a deep intake and releases it. \u201cStressed out over bills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat among many things.\u201d I push my finger against the crosswalk button on the pole.</p><p>\u201cIs it your mom again?\u201d He folds his arms over his chest, and I can\u2019t help but notice how his muscles flex beneath the vibrant artwork on his skin. \u201cHas she been hounding you to move home? Or is it your dad? He\u2019s not being a douche to you again, is he? I swear to God, Lila, you need to just tell them to fuck off if they are. They don\u2019t deserve to even know you with the way that they treat you.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my lip, trying not to stare at his lean muscles or his luscious lips or the fact that he just told me one of the sweetest things I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t even talked to him in months. My mother\u2019s been calling me all the time to come back home, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you finally tell her off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she mean to you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even matter. At this point it barely affects me.\u201d I\u2019m such a liar and I think he can tell.</p> <p>His forehead creases as he studies my face. \u201cDo you want to just tell me what\u2019s bothering you or should I keep guessing?\u201d</p><p>The light flashes to go ahead and cross the street and I step off the curb. He walks with me, keeping close to my side as we maneuver through the crowd coming at us. I want to tell him what\u2019s wrong, but I\u2019m not one hundred percent sure what\u2019s bothering me just yet. If it\u2019s money, the loneliness I\u2019ve felt for the last month, the fact that I need a job but don\u2019t even know how to get one, or if it\u2019s the feelings I have for him.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Ella and Micha are engaged?\u201d I say, changing the subject and stepping up onto the curb.</p><p>Traffic rushes by us as we walk past the towering, uniquely shaped buildings that glimmer and shine. Each building is so different from the other: a replica of the Eiffel Tower, a massive pirate ship, a pyramid\u2014you name it and it\u2019s probably here. Neon lights flash across billboards and marques, trying to entice people to come gamble their money away, see flamboyant shows, or drink drinks while staring at tits. There are a lot of people whisking around and the heat, the dancing, the skimpy clothing, and the music playing make the atmosphere erotic and steamy. The combination makes me want to dance and have fun, instead of thinking about stuff.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Micha told me a couple of weeks ago.\u201d He slips his arm around my shoulder and draws me closer as a guy tries to hand me a card with a picture of a naked lady on it. \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t mention it. Micha wasn\u2019t even supposed to mention it, because Ella wasn\u2019t ready to tell anyone, but he let it slip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me the other day,\u201d I say, breathing in his scent. He smells so mouthwateringly good. \u201cAnd she sounded so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they are.\u201d He slants his head down to meet my eyes and inquisitiveness sparkles in them. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re upset? Because they\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just... honestly, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s bothering me. I think maybe I\u2019m just tired. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well lately.\u201d</p><p>He searches my eyes a moment longer, the lights on the marque above our heads reflecting in his pupils. \u201cDo you want me to take you home?\u201d he asks. \u201cSo you can get some rest?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, even though I\u2019m exhausted. I don\u2019t want to go home to my empty house. \u201cCan we go to a club or something? And I mean really nice one.\u201d I grab his arm and pretty much beg. \u201cI need to do something that\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>He dithers. \u201cYou know how I feel about clubs. They\u2019re too God damn noisy and packed and fancy ones are even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I pout, exaggeratedly sticking my lip out. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to go home just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just go to a bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do something that\u2019s my kind of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean spend money you don\u2019t have?\u201d he says bluntly.</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cFine. I\u2019m sorry I even tried.\u201d I start to stomp away, but he pulls me back.</p><p>He sighs. \u201cFine.\u201d He gives in to me, then lets go of my arm and offers me his elbow and I take it, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t, because I\u2019m getting too attached, dangerously one-sidedly attached. He guides me across the road, talking about how hot it is. So simple. So easy.</p><p>Too bad he doesn\u2019t want me because I would love to let him have me.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I really hate clubs. There are too many people packed in a tiny area and the music is always turned up to the point where it vibrates in my chest. But Lila didn\u2019t want to go home and I don\u2019t want her out and about when she\u2019s obviously upset about something.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting on barstools at the bar that probably cost more than my truck. The bartender keeps hitting on Lila, even though she seems uninterested. It\u2019s annoying to watch, but it\u2019s always hard to watch her get hit on. In fact, it\u2019s harder than it used to be and I can\u2019t help thinking she\u2019s mine, even though she\u2019s obviously not.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a shot?\u201d she asks me over the music as she slams down her fifth shot of top-shelf vodka, which I\u2019m sure she can\u2019t afford. I remember when I first met her how much of a lightweight she was, barely able to drink beers, but now she\u2019s fucking crazy, reckless even. It makes me a little nervous and I\u2019m seriously considering taking her fake ID and cutting it in half so she can\u2019t use it anymore to go out, but then again I\u2019d be a fucking hypocrite if I didn\u2019t get rid of mine so I could stop going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who would drive home?\u201d I ask loudly, glancing at the dance floor. There are a ton of women out tonight, dressed in short dresses, tight pants, their tits pretty much bulging out of their tops. It\u2019s usually a nice sight, but I\u2019m not feeling it tonight. I wasn\u2019t even feeling it back at the bar with the blonde eyeing me. I kept staring at her, deciding if I wanted to hit on her or not, but Lila and my worry for her kept pulling me back and finally I\u2019d decided just to focus on her.</p><p>\u201cWe could get a cab.\u201d She spins the empty shot glass around on the bar. I open my mouth to protest, but she interrupts. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. You\u2019re just always so tense when we come to these kinds of places and alcohol usually relaxes you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My forehead creases as I assess her. Typically, people don\u2019t notice my uneasiness and it makes me question why she\u2019s been paying such close attention to me. I remember the countless times London use to drag me to noisy places, either not noticing that I hated the noise or not caring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lila touches her hair self-consciously and then glances down at her dress that brushes the middle of her legs. She has a sweater jacket thingy over it, which makes no sense to me since it\u2019s hot as hell outside. She also has a pearl bracelet on and a diamond necklace and everything about her screams money, a rich princess pretty much. We\u2019re so opposite, yet I can\u2019t seem to stay away from her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I say, patting the bar with my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take a few shots with you, but you have to order them.\u201d</p> <p>She lowers her hand to the bar. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I restrain an eye roll. \u201cBecause the bartender is obviously into you and I\u2019m guessing he might get the shots for you faster.\u201d</p><p>She glances over at the bartender talking to a group of women. \u201cHe\u2019s not my type,\u201d she says nonchalantly, looking back at me with curiosity. The lights from the dance floor flash across her face and there\u2019s no use trying to deny how beautiful she is, princess or not.</p><p>\u201cNot preppy enough for you?\u201d I tease, but underneath my skin, irritation surfaces.</p><p>She props her elbow on the bar and watches me, not saying anything. It\u2019s making me uncomfortable. I want to ask her what the hell she\u2019s thinking about and why she\u2019s staring at me like that, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019m afraid of the answer. \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>I shrug, taking an uneasy deep breath, hating how unsettled I feel inside. When did things get so complex between us? How did I let it get that way? \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go with tequila.\u201d</p><p>She giggles under her breath. \u201cTo kill ya coming up.\u201d</p><p>She raises her hand, leans over the bar, and flags down the bartender. She slips off her jacket, the thin straps of her dress revealing her shoulders and the low-cut back showing her smooth skin. I\u2019m not sure if she does it on purpose, to get the bartender\u2019s attention, but it works. She orders a shot of vodka and a shot of tequila. He grins at her, drinking her in, and I want to punch him in the face just for looking. I\u2019m not much of the jealous type, so the feeling throws me off a little.</p><p>The guy on the barstool next to Lila starts flirting with her a few seconds later, eying her lips as she chews on the straw. He\u2019s older, at least twenty-five, wearing a black suit and ridiculously shiny shoes. Lila seems vaguely interested in him, not laughing at his jokes, yet she lets him place his hand on her thigh and inch it up north.</p><p>I\u2019m getting pissed. I\u2019ve never had much of a possessive side\u2014I\u2019ve seen my father overact too much with my mother, even if she was just talking to the mailman\u2014but right now my jealous, controlling side is coming out. As the bartender sets the shots down in front of us, I grab the top of her barstool and spin her in my direction so the guy\u2019s hand falls off her leg.</p><p>Her eyes widen as the guy shoots a glare at me. \u201cWhat the hell, Ethan?\u201d</p> <p>I have an arm on each side of her and my hands are just beside her hips. I lean in so she can hear me. \u201cIf you want me to stay here with you and take shots, your attention needs to be on me.\u201d I wince at my own words, but it\u2019s too late and I can\u2019t retract them.</p><p>Her expression is calm, yet her eyes carry interest. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says simply and gathers the shot from the counter. She raises it in front of her, giggling. \u201cTo paying attention.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, rolling my eyes at her drunkenness, but a laugh slips through as I collect the shot glass. \u201cAll right, Lila.\u201d I raise the glass upward. \u201cTo paying attention.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to clink our glasses when she pulls back. \u201cThat goes for you, too,\u201d she says and when my expression slips to confusion, she adds, \u201cYou have to pay attention to me tonight, too.\u201d</p><p>Why do I see this going very, very wrong? \u201cOkay.\u201d I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cYou have my one hundred percent undivided attention, Lila Summers.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curve to a smile and then she clinks her glass against mine. We both pull away and tip our heads back, devouring our shots.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I ask, slamming the empty glass down on the bar while she gags on the drink\u2014she always does.</p><p>Her grin is almost devilish. \u201cAnother one?\u201d</p> <p>I sigh and shrug, feeling slightly better as the alcohol burns its way through my body. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s so hard to be alone?\u201d Lila asks, struggling to keep her eyes open as she gazes out at the night sky through the cab window.</p><p>I\u2019m turned sideways in the seat, with my knee up, so I\u2019m facing her, even though she won\u2019t look at me. I lost count of how many shots we had hours ago and I can barely comprehend how we got to a cab\u2014stumbling, laughing, as she rubbed her hand up the front of my jeans. No, that can\u2019t be right, can it?</p><p>\u201cI think being alone is fan-fucking-tastic... well, maybe... sometimes...\u201d I mumble, draping my arm on the back of the seat. I stare at her for a moment, taking in her bare skin in the moonlight. I want to touch it. Lick it. Even bite it.</p><p>I\u2019m bursting with sexual energy and I channel it to my foot on the floor, bouncing my knee. There\u2019s something different about tonight, something out of the ordinary, this strange need to keep getting closer to Lila. It could be the alcohol. Or it could be something else, but there\u2019s no way my tequila-soaked mind is going to reach any sort of answer.</p><p>Lila turns her head toward me, her pupils wide and shiny. \u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201d</p><p>I keep tapping my foot on the floor, trying to think of a better answer than the first one that pops into my head, but I can\u2019t find one. \u201cBecause I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>She glances at the cab driver, a thirtyish guy wearing a baseball cap, and then her gaze lands back on me. She sucks her lip into her teeth and I have to bounce my knee faster or I swear I\u2019m going to fucking lose it. \u201cThinking what about me?\u201d she asks, looking wary, interested, and exhausted.</p><p>Don\u2019t say it... \u201cI was thinking about what it would be like to lick you... or bite you... either one really.\u201d It seems like I should regret it as soon as I say it, but regret is nowhere in my reach at the moment.</p><p>Her breathing quickens and her voice comes out shockingly unsteady for someone who has sex so much. \u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>I blink, wondering if I heard her right through the massive amount of alcohol consuming my thoughts. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She holds my gaze steadily, even though she seems really nervous, her voice trembling. \u201cThen bite me. Or lick me... whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Every part of me is screaming not to do it, that I\u2019m breaking my rules\u2014rules I set for a reason. But desire and fucking tequila rampage the rational side of my mind. Drawn by a needy current, I lean forward, sweep her hair off her shoulder, keeping our eyes locked the entire time, and she quivers as my fingers brush her collarbone. When I reach the curve of her breast and trace a line above it, she bites her lip and groans. It\u2019s way too much. My body feels like it\u2019s going to combust. Before I can even acknowledge what I\u2019m doing, I duck my head forward, slip my tongue out, and lick a path from her collarbone to the arch of her neck, grazing my teeth softly along the path.</p><p>\u201cOh God... Ethan.\u201d She shivers, clutching her hands at her side. \u201cThat feels way too good.\u201d</p><p>My eyes close and my breathing becomes ragged as I battle to pull back, keep my hands to myself, fearing that if I touch her, I\u2019ll rip her clothes off right here in the back of the cab. And I can\u2019t go there. It\u2019s not the same as when I hook up with random women. I can feel a connection with Lila and sex will ruin it, especially when I bail out afterward.</p><p>\u201cLila...\u201d I trail off as her hand glides up the front of my shorts. \u201cI think...\u201d</p><p>I bite down on the sensitive spot right below her ear, just above her neck, not enough to break the skin, but enough that her shoulder jerks upward, and my hands clamp down on her waist, my fingertips delving into the fabric of her dress.</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d she whispers, breathless, her hand rubbing me hard. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>I remember how she told me she never begged, and suddenly all my doubts dissipate into the sea of alcohol swimming around in my head. I move my mouth upward to the tip of her earlobe, breathing hotly on her skin the entire way, and then I graze my teeth along her earlobe, slide my tongue out along it, and taste her just like I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cOh... my... God...\u201d She releases a slow breath that\u2019s echoed by a whimper, her chest curving forward and pressing against mine.</p><p>I\u2019m a little stunned by how much she\u2019s enjoying it and by how much I\u2019m enjoying it, too, my moves fueled by an adrenaline surge and yearning in my body. I swear all the sexual tension inside me is pouring out in my motions. I\u2019ve lost control. I place my hand on her bare leg and glide it up until it\u2019s fully underneath her dress, her skin searingly hot against mine, and my fingers graze the edge of her panties. The warmth and wetness that I felt when she had the towel on is there and all I want to do is say fuck my rules, slip my fingers inside her, and lay her down on the seat.</p><p>\u201cShit, Lila...\u201d I sound choked as I squeeze my eyes shut, trying to decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong\u2014what I need to do and what I want to do. \u201cI think we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>The cab jerks to a stop and Lila and I quickly pull back, looking stunned. I\u2019d seriously almost forgotten that we were in a cab. We\u2019re at the entrance of her apartment, the lampposts lighting up the parking lot. It\u2019s late, the neighborhood quiet, and the cab driver looks really pissed off.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she whispers, blinking her eyes open, and then she aims her attention at the door. Her hand is still on my cock and my hand is still up her dress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reluctantly pulling my hand out from underneath her dress, she follows my lead, so we both have our hands to ourselves. I inch my legs out of the way so she can squeeze through and climb out, but she doesn\u2019t budge, looking at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to come in?\u201d Her voice carries confidence, but her slackened posture and uneasy demeanor portray self-doubt and the doubt makes me hesitate.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d I say, torn between the good side of me and the bad, the drunken side and the sober side. Rules. No relationships. What am I doing? \u201cIt might not be a good idea... maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes widen in horror and it surprises me. With all the flirting we\u2019ve done and the guys Lila has slept with, I\u2019d never expect her to look so hurt. And maybe that\u2019s why I decide to do it. Or maybe I\u2019m just really, really stupid, but somehow I find myself getting out of the cab with her.</p><p>After we pay, we run in a drunken stupor to her complex, laughing about God knows what. When we reach her door, she fumbles with her keys, until finally she gets it open. She trips over her own feet, laughing as my fingers fold around her waist, catching her before she falls.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a clumsy drunk,\u201d I say as she stands up straight, steadying herself by clutching on to my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sexy when you\u2019re drunk,\u201d she says, biting her lip as she turns to face me.</p> <p>My hands are still on her waist, my fingers gripping at her skin, wanting to feel more of it, but I\u2019m still hesitating to take it any further. I know Lila\u2014like really know her\u2014and afterward, I\u2019ll have to see her again. What if it changes things between us? Do I care? As soon as I think it, I realize I do care about her more than I want to admit. She knows more about me than anyone. Jesus, she really does. I\u2019ve told her shit about my parents, my druggy past, and my future loner plans and she\u2019s told me a lot of stuff about her and how her dad is verbally abusive and cheats on her mom all the time and her mom just accepts it. We know stuff about each other and I never even got that far with London.</p><p>Looking anxious and uncertain, Lila grips the front of my shirt and tugs me with her as she walks backward toward the hallway. Neither of us says anything. We don\u2019t turn on the lights. We just breathe loudly with each step, our eyes fastened together as we move our legs in sync.</p><p>Minutes, or maybe seconds, later, we\u2019re falling onto her bed. I brace myself with my arms, catching my weight so I don\u2019t crush her, and she gazes up at me, not saying anything, just breathing, her chest brushing against mine with every inhale. I want her so damn bad and I know she can tell since my hard-on is pressed up against her hip. Unable to tolerate the tension anymore, I lower my mouth toward hers, ready to kiss her, but she turns her head at the last second and my lips brush against her cheek instead. At first it\u2019s kind of weird, but then she slides her body upward, so her neck is in my face and I understand what she wants.</p><p>I press my lips to her skin, rolling my tongue out, and then drag my teeth gently across her neck as her hand finds the top of my shorts and she undoes the button and zipper. I shiver and groan as she grabs my cock and starts to rub me hard again. I bite down on her skin, maybe a little too roughly but she trembles with me, enjoying it, but she doesn\u2019t moan, which is disappointing because the sound of it in the cab nearly drove me crazy in a good way. I want to make her moan so badly that it becomes the sole focus of my thoughts. Moving my body downward, I create a path of kisses and gentle bites, nibbling soft skin until I reach the top of her dress. Then I suck the curve of her breast as I reach up and slip one of the straps down her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d I mutter. The sight of her skin right there for me to taste is driving me fucking crazy and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted to be inside someone as much as I do right now. I\u2019m about to yank her other strap down so I can get a full view of her breasts when I realize how still she\u2019s gone. At first I think she\u2019s passed out, but when I pull back, she\u2019s just lying there motionless as she stares at the ceiling, fiddling with the platinum ring on her finger.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d I say, trying not to worry over what it could mean. That maybe I\u2019d misread her and she really wasn\u2019t into this. Did I force her to do something? Shit. I didn\u2019t even remember to ask if she wanted this.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she answers numbly, without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She sounds as hollow as she looks. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>I blink at her, stunned, and then I sit up, disconnecting the fiery connection between our bodies. \u201cKeep going? Are you even into this?\u201d I try not to sound upset, but it shows through the unevenness in my voice.</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t look at me, and when she speaks, her voice is flat. \u201cYeah, I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell don\u2019t sound like you want it.\u201d I climb off the bed and zip my shorts back up. \u201cHow wasted are you?\u201d</p><p>She finally meets my eyes and I\u2019m taken back by the emptiness in them. And it\u2019s not because she\u2019s drunk. She knows what\u2019s going on, yet it looks like she feels nothing about it. As much as I hate to admit it, it stings, tears at my heart a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to go,\u201d I say, backing toward the door, pissed off at myself for getting into this situation to begin with. I knew better than to go here with her and now I can\u2019t take it back.</p> <p>She sits up, the moonlight filtering through her window, illuminating her pale skin. Her eyes look black in the shadows. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d she says emotionlessly.</p><p>I have no idea how to take her right now. I could ask her questions, but we\u2019re both drunk, and honestly the hurt inside me is intensifying. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d It\u2019s all I say\u2014all I can say at the moment because I have no idea what\u2019s going on and I despise how freaked out I\u2019m feeling over it.</p><p>I leave her in her room and she doesn\u2019t chase after me. By the time I reach the curb, I\u2019m chewing myself out for ever going there because I know there\u2019s no way we can go back to what we were before. This is irrevocable.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Lila</p><p>November is pretty much over and I\u2019m running out of money and ways to escape the landlord. I know I need to get a job, but I\u2019ve never worked before and I\u2019m not qualified for any decent jobs. I guess I never really thought the whole being-on-your-own thing completely through. I feel like I\u2019m standing at this fork in the road and both paths lead to places I don\u2019t want to go. I could go backward, but I don\u2019t want to go there either. My past is full of irreversible mistakes. I\u2019m sure anyone who looked at me, when I was medicated anyway, wouldn\u2019t think I had any problems. But I\u2019m seriously considering breaking down and asking someone for help. Asking Ella. My sister even, although she can barely take care of herself. I even went as far as calling her, but she cut the call short, saying she had to go to work. I could hear her son crying in the background, the one I\u2019ve met only once because I moved away and haven\u2019t been back to California since. We barely talk anymore, and when we do, the conversation is causal and rushed because she\u2019s always too overwhelmed with bills or her job as a waitress.</p><p>I could talk to Ethan, but I haven\u2019t really seen much of him since the whole club fiasco. I\u2019m not even really sure what happened. I mean, he\u2019d finally given me what I wanted, touching me and kissing me, and even through the alcohol it\u2019d felt different, good for once, like I was safe and maybe worthy of being touched like that. But it lasted for only a moment and then the past caught up with me. The second we reached the bed I knew what was going to happen. He\u2019d fuck me and then leave me and I\u2019d be completely alone this time because Ethan is pretty much my only friend anymore and now I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s that.</p><p>So I let the off switch flip me into a state of numbness and I moved through the motions, knowing what I was supposed to do but making myself disconnect from my emotions. What shocked me though is that he was upset about it. No guy has ever been upset about how I act. Then he\u2019d left without finishing and I haven\u2019t talked to him since. I\u2019m a little afraid too, afraid of what he saw in me that night or didn\u2019t see in me.</p><p>The last week has been really depressing and the only company I\u2019ve really had is a random friendly call from my sister and my mother\u2019s phone calls that leave me feeling emptier than I did before them. She keeps making threats, telling me she\u2019s going to disown me if I don\u2019t get my ass back to California. It\u2019s not too late, she keeps saying. Brentford Mansonfield is back from his six-month trip to Europe and he\u2019s looking to settle down. I could win him over, start again, and turn myself into someone worthy of the Summers name. I asked her if she really thought Brentford wanted used goods for a wife.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re almost twenty-one, Lila,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cNo one expects you to be a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I\u2019m also kind of a whore,\u201d I\u2019d responded, mainly because I\u2019d had a couple glasses of wine and was feeling a little bit tipsy.</p><p>\u201cLila Summers, watch your mouth,\u201d she replied sharply. \u201cYou will not utter such things aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s true. I\u2019m the one who had to come clean up the mess in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I forget,\u201d I said. \u201cSince you\u2019re always reminding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila, quit being a little bitch. I didn\u2019t raise you to be that way. I raised you to keep your mouth shut and to do what you were told.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take the frustration building inside me anymore, so I let it explode and screamed into the phone, \u201cLike you do with Dad and his slutty mistress!\u201d</p><p>She called me a spoiled bitch and told me she was going to hang up. I told her okay, because I didn\u2019t really have that much more to say and she hasn\u2019t called me since.</p><p>It\u2019s overwhelmingly hot today, but I couldn\u2019t turn the fan on since it would rack up my already overdue power bill. I open the candy cane slash pill drawer again, reaching for the bottle at the bottom. Ethan gave me the candy canes as a Christmas present after I told him I\u2019d never had a candy cane, and it was seriously the sweetest moment I\u2019ve ever had with a guy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you fucking being serious right now?\u201d he\u2019d said. We were in his truck and it was late, the midnight sky above us as chilly winter air filled the cab and frosted the windows.</p><p>\u201cUm... yeah... What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d I\u2019d wondered, turning sideways in the seat to face him.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a fucking candy cane.\u201d He\u2019d gaped at me unfathomably. \u201cIt\u2019s like the most common Christmas candy there is. My mom even puts them all over our tree every year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve never had a Christmas tree either,\u201d I admitted, which made him gape at me only longer. \u201cWhat? She thinks that the pine needles on real ones are too messy and artificial ones are too tacky.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, he\u2019d given me an entire box of them. He didn\u2019t wrap them or anything, just dropped them on my lap when I\u2019d been sitting on his sofa in the living room of his parents\u2019 house.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d He\u2019d said it like it was such an inconvenience for him as he flopped down in the recliner.</p><p>I\u2019d smiled, then leaned over and gave him a hug before I unwrapped one. As I started sucking on it, I told him it was delicious and he\u2019d made a dirty remark about my lips. I made a comeback about the zipper on his pants being undone and that I could see his special man parts bulging out. He\u2019d rolled his eyes, but then checked his zipper anyway. I started to giggle and ended up dropping the candy cane on my leg. I was wearing a dress and the candy stuck to my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe I don\u2019t like them,\u201d I\u2019d said, pulling a disgusted face as I picked it up from my leg. I tried to wipe off the stickiness with my hand, but that only made everything stickier.</p> <p>\u201cHere, let me help you,\u201d Ethan muttered, his eyes locked on my leg. I thought he was going to go get me a paper towel or something, but instead he got up from the recliner and dropped down on his knees in front of me. His dark hair hung in his eyes as he peered over my knees, smirking at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, intrigued but slightly nervous. I mean he was super hot and everything, but I was fully sober and could feel everything going on, like my accelerating pulse and the weird flip my stomach did.</p><p>His eyes darkened as he ran his hand up my leg and it made my skin instantly ignite with stifling, overwhelmingly passionate heat. It was a new sensation for me since foreplay was pretty much absent with any of the people I\u2019d hooked up with. The feeling was piquing my curiosity so I let my legs fall open just a little and suddenly he seemed like the nervous one. I kept thinking about how much I wanted another pill because I could feel way too much, but then I\u2019d have to get up and break the moment.</p><p>Ethan had paused with his hand resting on the top of my thigh. I traced the lines of the tattoos on his arms, biting my lip as my heart leaped inside my chest. His breathing became ragged and his palms were starting to sweat the longer we sat there, unmoving in the silence and glow from the twinkly lights on the Christmas tree. Then he did it. He angled his face down, his lips parted, and his tongue slipped out as he licked the candy cane stickiness off my skin.</p><p>I dug my fingernails into the arm of the chair and moaned, a loud, blissful moan that surprised me, along with the burst of warmth that flashed through my body. He responded with a sharp intake of his breath and I quivered uncontrollably. I wanted to run my fingers through his hair, touch him, push his face up just a little bit farther, and make him lick me in places that would send me into a euphoric, uncontrolled spiral. But then he quickly sucked my skin, nipping at it before pulling away.</p><p>I frowned disappointedly up at him. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, dropping down into the chair. \u201cWhat?\u201d He eyed me over, like he was waiting for me to announce that he\u2019d gotten me all hot and bothered. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d He\u2019d pressed back a smirk, like he was the funniest person in the world. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting around for my Christmas present.\u201d</p><p>Two could play at this game. Smirking back, I unhooked the front clasp of my red lacy bra through my top, then slid the straps down my shoulders, managing to get it off without flashing him. Then I threw it at his face. \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Most guys would have grinned or said some dirty comment, but Ethan just flicked the little red bow on my bra, then shrugged and set it down on the armrest of the chair. \u201cI\u2019ve seen sexier,\u201d he said, his grin shining through his eyes.</p><p>With my mouth hanging open, I tossed a candy cane at him and it hit him in the head. He laughed, picked it up and unwrapped it, and then popped it into his mouth. \u201cDamn, these are good,\u201d he said, smiling as he rolled the candy along his tongue.</p><p>I think that\u2019s when I realized how much I liked him. Not because he was being an ass or because he gave me candy canes, but because he\u2019d stopped kissing my thigh. He knew enough about me\u2014how easy I was\u2014to know that he could have pretty much gotten me to do whatever he wanted, yet he didn\u2019t. Even if it was because he didn\u2019t like me, I still kind of liked that he stopped, even if it left me sexually frustrated. I\u2019d had sex with guys before who later made it clear they didn\u2019t even like me, yet they still had sex with me because I was an \u201ceasy lay.\u201d And I was left with self-hatred stirring inside me because deep down I knew they were right. I\u2019m good for only one thing. A one-night stand, a good lay, a moment of distraction, and I\u2019ll pretty much do whatever they ask, even when I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>But now the good thing I had with Ethan is gone, thanks to my fucked-up head. It makes me loathe myself even more, knowing just how good of a guy Ethan is. He\u2019d stopped it, refusing to have sex with the numb version of me. I\u2019m still baffled over it.</p><p>Sighing, I force myself out of the memory and return my attention to what\u2019s under the pile of candy canes and pick up the orange bottle. I take a couple, then lay down on the bed, on my back with my legs and arms out to my side, just like they were that day my life changed for the worst six years ago, when he used me and then abandoned me. I\u2019ve been on a downhill decline ever since, but the good thing is I\u2019ve barely been able to feel it. I feel the soaring rush from the pills and then the crash from the wine as the two substances mix and collide inside me. They\u2019re diluting each other, so I turn on my side and take a few more pills and somewhere between the sixth or the seventh my thoughts start to melt together. Until I feel empty.</p><p>Alone.</p> <p>And I desperately want to find someone to fill the void.</p><p>I\u2019m way too out of it to be out here, but I can\u2019t find my way back to my apartment. So I keep wandering aimlessly around the parking lot with no real destination, and I can\u2019t even remember why I came outside in the first place. I think it might have been the fear of being compressed between the shrinking walls in my house that made me go outside, but I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>This older guy comes up to me as I make my way over to a carport and he tells me about this party up the street. I mutter something about not really wanting to go with him, but then he takes ahold of my arm and kind of guides me along, or forces me (I sometimes have a hard time distinguishing between the two) toward the street.</p><p>He keeps talking about swimming or hitting or something, but the grogginess in my head barely allows me to decipher half of the words he\u2019s saying. His lips keep moving and he has nice, soft, full-looking lips, and there\u2019s this scar on the bottom one. I thought his eyes were green, but when we step into the house, underneath the light, I realize they\u2019re blue. His hair is way too long for my taste and he\u2019s wearing this ratty-looking T-shirt that makes me crinkle my nose with distaste.</p><p>\u201cI think I have to...\u201d I try to say go, but my lips have gotten really numb. I stumble over my shoes, which aren\u2019t fastened.</p><p>\u201cYou look really beautiful tonight,\u201d the guy whispers in my ear and I\u2019m relieved I caught the whole sentence.</p><p>\u201cThanks...\u201d I trail off as the stereo is cranked up and the floor starts to vibrate beneath us. Everyone starts dancing and shouting as they drink beers and grind against each other.</p><p>There are people crammed into a small living room and the furniture has been pushed out of the way. The kitchen to my right is lined with empty beer bottles and there\u2019s a large bucket filled with ice and drinks on the table. The loudness and chaos kind of reminds me of being at Ella\u2019s, where everyone could just roam free and do whatever they wanted. The first time I witnessed it I thought it was insane, but now it kind of feels like maybe this is the kind of place I belonged the whole time.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d the guy shouts over the music as he holds on to my arm.</p><p>I nod, relaxing. He doesn\u2019t seem that bad. \u201cYes, please!\u201d</p><p>Then he smiles and it\u2019s a dark smile, one masked with an alternate meaning. I\u2019ve seen this smile before right before he tied me to the bed. I\u2019m not sure what the alternate meaning is but I can\u2019t seem to concentrate on it for long enough to care. He releases my arm and I brace my hand against the wall nearby so I don\u2019t fall down. I want to dance, because I love to dance. But I\u2019m dizzy and vomit burns at the back of my throat. I try to recall how many pills I\u2019d taken. Two... No, I took more, didn\u2019t I? After the landlord knocked on my door? Yes, but how many did I take. Four... five... eight. God, I\u2019ve completely lost track and things are starting to get dark and chilly, not just around me but in my head. The song switches and I try to focus on the beat. The guy who brought me here returns. He hands me a beer. I drink it. Somehow I end up dancing with him. He\u2019s grabbing me roughly, forcing me against his body as he grinds against my hips. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m into it, so I try to back away.</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin\u2019?\u201d he wonders, pulling me back.</p><p>\u201cI want to...\u201d What do I want?</p><p>He shakes his head and probes his fingernails into my arms. I feel the skin puncture and the pain spans throughout my entire body. I try to shout, but the sound is lost in the music. He grins, all desire and need, just like every other guy who exists on the planet.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby.\u201d He presses me against his chest, his hand sliding underneath my back, and I find myself wishing he were Ethan so I wouldn\u2019t feel so unsafe. He grabs at my butt, touches me, and just like that a switch flips off inside my head. Like always, I become numb, every emotion draining out of me. Suddenly, it feels like I\u2019m watching the guy as he gropes my ass, feels my breast, kisses my neck, presses our bodies together. I can\u2019t feel a single thing, don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t deserve to. I\u2019m worthless. A whore, like everyone always tells me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He starts to lead me through the crowd, to the hallway, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to take me to a room and do whatever he wants to me, when my eyes roll into the back of my head and my legs start to give out as my stomach burns.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d I say and groan and the guy scoots back faster than the beat of the song with his hands out in front of him like he\u2019s afraid to touch me.</p><p>I take off, shoving through the crowd, and run out the front door, leaving it open as I stumble outside, then hurry down the stairs. One of my shoes gets caught in the bottom step and I can\u2019t get it out, so instead I wiggle my foot out of my shoe. Then I hunch over and fall to my knees in a bed of tulips and bushes. My shoulders jerk as I dry heave, feeling like I need to throw up, but nothing will come out of my mouth. My heart is beating rapidly, slamming against my ribs, and my skin is coated in sweat. I\u2019m having a hard time keeping my eyes open and I fall back into the bushes, landing in the moist dirt on my back. I see the stars. They\u2019re gorgeous. I wish I could touch them. It feels like I can.</p> <p>I lie there forever, feeling my heart beat faster as my stomach vines into painful knots. Then my butt starts ringing, or maybe it\u2019s my head... no, it\u2019s my phone. Yes, definitely my phone. Rolling to my side, I feel the back pocket in my dress and retrieve my phone. I let my thumb fall on the talk button and then put the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The sound of my voice hurts my head.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Ethan says, sounding more pissed off than he usually does. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh...\u201d I clutch my pulsating head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, huh?\u201d he snaps. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re drunk again, which means you probably need me to come pick you up from some guy\u2019s house.\u201d He sounds venomously jealous, and in the pit of my stomach, I like it.</p> <p>\u201cNo, not drunk,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI\u2019m out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think... I think... I took too much... this time.\u201d It\u2019s becoming harder to breathe, my chest constricting and it\u2019s bearing weight down on my body.</p><p>\u201cToo much what?\u201d he asks and I think I hear concern in his voice. Maybe, but I could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cThe stuff...\u201d I try to snap my fingers, attempting to think of the word, but I can\u2019t tell if I still have fingers. \u201cThose pills I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pills?\u201d His voice sounds all high and abnormally off pitch.</p> <p>\u201cNothing... never mind... I\u2019m really tired... I\u2019m going to go...\u201d I start to let my arm fall to my side.</p><p>\u201cLila, don\u2019t hang up!\u201d he shouts through the phone and I can hear a lot of banging in the background. \u201cWhere are you? At your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... I\u2019m in some bushes... and tulips.\u201d I swat my arm at this blurry spot forming above me. \u201cEthan, it\u2019s really cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold.\u201d His voice is harsh and makes me feel even colder inside. \u201cNow just tell me where you are and keep your God damn eyes open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d I blink fiercely, struggling to get my eyelids to stay open. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks and I hear the engine of his truck roar. \u201cHow the hell can you not know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... this guy took me somewhere... and I don\u2019t remember where...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you recognize anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStars... and...\u201d I trail off, letting the sleepiness overtake me. He says something, but I\u2019m too exhausted to answer.</p><p>\u201cLila!\u201d he yells.</p><p>My eyes snap open. \u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBushes... and stars... and a building...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the building look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike every other building out there...\u201d My head flops to the side. \u201cThere\u2019s this really weird flashing pink bird thingy at the entrance... That could be in my head though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fucking God.\u201d He sounds a little relieved. \u201cI know where you are.\u201d He says a bunch of other stuff, but I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s saying, so I just drop the phone because it\u2019s too heavy anyway. Then I gaze up at the stars and let myself fall into the darkness and numbness that I\u2019ve become so familiar with. In fact, it\u2019s really starting to feel like home.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he says, sliding his hand up my thigh. \u201cYour skin\u2019s so soft, too.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile, even though the way he\u2019s touching me feels wrong. Everything about the situation feels wrong, but at the same time it feels right, because the way Sean\u2019s looking at me right now makes me feel worshipped and loved. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say, which makes him grin this adorable grin that makes him look younger than he is.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he says and leans forward, giving me a soft peck on the nose. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he whispers against my skin, peppering kisses down to my jawline as his fingers drift up my plaid skirt. \u201cI want to touch you everywhere... kiss you all over.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on his chest, holding him back just a little so that I can look him in the eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever touch me in public? Is it because you were lying about not being married?\u201d I eye the ring on his finger.</p><p>His eyes turn cold, his mouth setting in a firm line as he leans away, leaving his hand on my upper thigh, but his fingers stiffen. \u201cNo, I told you I\u2019m not married. It was a gift and you know why we can\u2019t be seen in public. Age matters to people, Lila.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through his soft hair, worried I\u2019ve pushed him too far. \u201cYou\u2019re not that much older than me and it doesn\u2019t matter to me anyway.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me like I\u2019m incompetent. \u201cLila, don\u2019t be stupid. They would rip us apart. Everyone would.\u201d He starts to reach for the door handle of his car. \u201cMaybe I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d I grab a handful of his suit jacket and pull him back to me, terrified that he\u2019s going to leave me. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I brought it up. Please, just go back to what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes, looking like he\u2019s deliberating whether he should stay or go, whether he\u2019s too good for me or not. He is. I know that.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do back to what I was doing?\u201d he asks, cocking his head to the side as he assesses me. There\u2019s something in his eyes that is both thrilling and terrifying and makes my skin tingle in a way that it never has.</p><p>I nod, but with a lack of confidence. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He places his hand back on my thigh. He slowly starts to travel upward to the bottom of my skirt, briefly lingering at the hem before slipping his fingers underneath the fabric. I instinctively tense and he seems pleased by it. \u201cAre you sure, Lila?\u201d He reaches the fabric of my panties. \u201cYou really want me to go back to what I was doing?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say that I\u2019m not sure and that he\u2019s making me feel dirty, but then he forces his fingers inside me with a rough, almost violent movement. I\u2019m not sure what to do because it hurts and feels wrong yet it also feels good.</p><p>He starts to move his fingers inside me, almost forcefully. I think about telling him to stop, but the wonderful and horrifying feelings of bliss and need silence my lips. Then he moves his free hand around to the back of my head and grabs violently at my hair.</p><p>\u201cOw, that hurts,\u201d I mutter through a moan with my neck being forced to arch back.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, his eyes darkening with pleasure. He pulls even harder on my hair and pain and pleasure flood my body.</p><p>My feeling become hard to decipher as I reach forward and clutch on to his arms as my body heats up and I can\u2019t breathe. When he pulls his finger out of me, I\u2019m not sure whether I enjoyed it, regretted it, or both. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m supposed to feel.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>At first I think she\u2019s at some guy\u2019s house and even though I don\u2019t want to go to that jealous place inside me, I do. It pisses me off because only a week ago, I was touching her and all was great until she zoned out and it seemed like she didn\u2019t want to do anything with me.</p><p>But then I notice the dazed sound of her voice and none of that matters. I\u2019ve heard the distance and dazed sound in London\u2019s voice many times and in my own, too, when I used to get smashed. An alarm goes off in my head and all I can seem to think about is walking away from London the last time, right after the needle entered her arm. Then Lila starts talking about pills and I remember the prescription bottle in the couch cushion. That\u2019s when I really start to freak out. I\u2019m trying not to panic as I try figure out where she is, but she seems to have no idea. Then she mentions the pink bird and a small amount of relief washes over me. I drive by that damn pink bird twice a day to and from work. It\u2019s not too far from my house, only a few minutes away. I keep talking to her to make sure she stays awake, debating whether I should call an ambulance or something.</p><p>I can still hear her voice when I spot the pink bird in front of the apartment complex that\u2019s tucked between a house and a gas station. But when I\u2019m pulling in, there\u2019s a thud on the line and then it goes silent. For a split second all I can think about is how I\u2019m never going to see her again, that she\u2019s gone, and I almost become paralyzed. I\u2019ve never felt so much adrenaline rush through my body and my heart starts to slam against the inside of my chest.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I swing a hard left and slam on my brakes, stopping on the curb, the tire ramping up onto it. She said she was in the bushes, but there are bushes everywhere. I hop out of the truck and shout. \u201cLila!\u201d No one answers. I run around the two-story brick buildings situated inside the fenced parking lot, shouting out her name as I unlock my cell phone screen to call 911. I spot a flashy high-heeled shoe near the bottom of one of the stairways and I pick it up, wondering if it could be Lila\u2019s. It looks like something she probably wouldn\u2019t wear and more like something a stripper would own and there are a lot of those around here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I turn around I see feet sticking out of the shrubbery and one of them is missing a shoe. I run over and drop to my knees beside Lila, sprawled out on the ground, taking in the paleness of her skin and the glossiness in her eyes. Suddenly a feeling rushes over me, rams me square in the chest, gut, legs\u2014everywhere. Looking at her, like this, makes the possibility of losing her much more real.</p><p>\u201cI feel sick, Ethan,\u201d she murmurs and then rolls onto her side, tucking her hands under her head and closing her eyes.</p><p>I carefully slide my arm underneath her neck and slant her head up, patting her cheek so she\u2019ll open her eyes. \u201cLila, what did you take? Can you remember the name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I always take,\u201d she slurs, blinking her eyes open. \u201cThat stuff in my drawer.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stuff... you know... those pills that make you all awake... God, Ethan, I can\u2019t... I can\u2019t remember the name of them. It\u2019s a really... really... big word.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the dirt and the bushes around us. \u201cDid you throw up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She slowly sighs, her chest rising and falling. \u201cI feel like I need to, though. My stomach hurts really, really bad.\u201d</p> <p>I help her sit up, holding on to her arms, which have red welts on them that look like marks left from someone\u2019s fingers digging into her skin. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to turn you around and I want you to throw up, even if you have to stick your finger down your throat.\u201d</p><p>Her head bobs up and down as she nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I guide her to the side and help her turn so she\u2019s hunched over on her hands and knees. I keep my arm underneath her stomach, supporting her weight. She stays still for a minute with her mouth open, and then she finally shoves her finger down her throat. I angle my head to the side, staring at the parking lot as she pukes in the bushes. By the time she\u2019s finished, she\u2019s shaking and her skin is sweaty and paler than it already was.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get you to the hospital,\u201d I say as she sits down and rests her head against my chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, no hospitals.\u201d She shakes her head and peers up at me. In the glow of the streetlights, her eyes look black, or maybe it\u2019s because her pupils are dilated.</p><p>\u201cYes, to the hospital.\u201d I get to my feet and scoop her up in my arms, bearing her dead weight as she nuzzles her face against my chest.</p> <p>She gripes about going to the hospital, but only until we make it to the truck. Once I get her in the passenger seat, she relaxes and I buckle her seat belt over her chest. I drive straight to the hospital, knowing that there is no room for mistakes in the state she\u2019s in. It\u2019s why I stopped doing drugs. Why I went back to overthinking everything, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I learned firsthand what can happen. How one slipup can take you away forever, and thinking about the fact that Lila might be reaching that point terrified me more than I would have thought. It scares me to death, the thought that I might lose her. At that moment, I realize that Lila has become more than a friend. Much, much more.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Lila</p><p>I wake up unable to remember what happened the night before. I should be okay with the confusion, since I\u2019m used to it, but for some reason I feel more dirty and ashamed than I normally do.</p><p>The scent of cologne flowing from the blanket that\u2019s over me is familiar. I\u2019ve smelled it before and it comforts me. I force my eyes open and instantly recognize the band posters and drum set in the corner of the room. I sigh with relief. I\u2019m in Ethan\u2019s room, lying in his bed.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I mutter, gradually sitting up and my stomach muscles constrict in protest. I wrap my arm around my stomach and realize that I\u2019m wearing one of Ethan\u2019s shirts.</p><p>Holy crap, did I sleep with him? I run my hands through my tangled hair, sifting through my hazy memories. But the only things I can remember are stars, bushes, beeping machines, and the smell of cleaner.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d The sound of Ethan\u2019s voice makes me jump and my stomach churns from the motion.</p> <p>\u201cAh...\u201d I moan, hunching over and clutching my tender stomach with my gaze fixed on the comforter in front of me. \u201cWhat the heck happened last night?\u201d</p><p>I hear him walk toward the bed and then the mattress bows as he sits down on the foot of it, making sure to keep some space between us. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember anything at all?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, still looking down, feeling mortified for reasons I can\u2019t explain. Then I notice the hospital band on my wrist. \u201cNo... I can remember wandering around the apartment complex... Then this guy took me somewhere...\u201d I pause, daring to peer up. \u201cAnd then all I can remember are stars and the smell of cleaner.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a black-and-red T-shirt, his hair is damp, like he just got out of the shower, and there are holes in his jeans. \u201cYou pretty much overdosed,\u201d he says, cautiously watching me.</p><p>He thrums his fingers on his knees, considering something. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never been one for pressing people about their problems.\u201d He slides his knee on the bed, turning sideways so he\u2019s facing me. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a big fan of talking about my own shit and so I usually avoid trying to make people talk about theirs unless they\u2019re being stupid and right now every single part of me is screaming at me to make you tell me what happened.\u201d He pauses and I start to speak, but he talks over me. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to tell me that you\u2019re taking that prescription because of a doctor\u2019s orders. You told me last night on the way to the hospital that you\u2019ve pretty much been abusing them since you were fourteen, something I probably should have just told the doctors, but I didn\u2019t want to get you into trouble.\u201d He stops and waits for something. A thanks? An explanation? The truth? I honestly don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t want to tell him anything either.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I shut my eyes and summon a deep breath, chanting in my head not to cry. But I feel disembodied from my emotions and my stomach feels like I\u2019ve done an infinite amount of sit-ups. All I want to do is lie down, sleep, and forget that all of this happened.</p><p>\u201cHow about the truth?\u201d Ethan states cautiously, sounding less angry, and I feel him shift closer to me on the bed. \u201cYou know I get the whole substance-abuse thing.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids snap open at his awful accusation. \u201cI don\u2019t have a substance-abuse problem,\u201d I say, seething and tossing the blankets off me. \u201cIt\u2019s a prescription. Doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d I swing my legs over the bed and push to my feet. A rush of blood flees from my head and my knees instantly buckle. I reach for the metal bedpost as I collapse, but Ethan jumps up and catches me in his arms right before I hit the floor.</p><p>I blow out a breath, looking at the wall beside me as he holds my weight up. I feel like an idiot. \u201cLet me go. I can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be resting.\u201d He helps me back to the bed and I begrudgingly sit down. \u201cDoctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together, shaking my head. \u201cEthan, please just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t need this from you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t what? Talk about what I saw last night? Because I\u2019m not going to do that. It fucking scared the shit out of me, Lila... seeing you trashed out of your mind like that.\u201d His eyes are wide and filled with panic as he sits down on the bed again, leaving a little less space between us as he roughly rakes his fingers through his hair. He looks stressed out and exhausted. \u201cAnd as much as I hate to push you to talk about it, I feel like I have to. I can\u2019t... I don\u2019t want anything...\u201d He\u2019s fumbling over his words and it seems to be frustrating him. He\u2019s acting very out of character and I wonder if something else is wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d I mutter, frowning down at my lap. \u201cI\u2019m not your girlfriend or anything\u2014you don\u2019t owe me anything. You should have just told the hospital I tried to kill myself. Then they could be dealing with me and you wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, contemplating what I said. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend and that\u2019s equally as important, if not more important... You\u2019re important...\u201d His forehead creases as he says it, like he\u2019s confused himself as much as he\u2019s confused me. He starts to reach for me, as if he\u2019s going to put his hand on my cheek, but then pulls his hand back.</p><p>I cover my mouth and shake my head as tears start to form in the corners of my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows inquiringly. \u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk about stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d I wave my hand down in front of my terrible state. \u201cAll messed up and not put together.\u201d</p><p>His head cocks to the side as he crooks his eyebrow. \u201cLila, I\u2019ve told you some of my fucked-up stories about drugs and sex and you\u2019ve seen where I live\u2014you know what kind of a home I was raised in and what my parents did to each other. Messed up is nothing new to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say exasperatedly as I gather my hair around the nape of my neck. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be this way, or at least no one\u2019s supposed to know that I\u2019m like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying like this but I\u2019m still trying to figure out like what?\u201d His eyes scroll over my body carefully, as if he\u2019s searching for visible wounds. And there are a few, on my ankles and waist and even a very faint one on my wrist, but most people never notice them. \u201cAs far as I can tell, the only thing you\u2019re acting like is someone who needs to talk about their problems.\u201d He\u2019s being nice and it\u2019s only making me feel worse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier if you just yelled at me,\u201d I say, releasing my hair and spanning my arms out to the side. \u201cOr left me alone. That\u2019s what you usually do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy is overrated,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t leave you alone this time. Not about this. I\u2019ll hate myself if I do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEthan, please just take me home,\u201d I plead, wrapping my arms around myself. \u201cI just need to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responds stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to just let you run home and pop a pill. You need help.\u201d</p><p>My body and mind are yearning for a pill and only one thing is going to make it better. I keep running my fingers through my hair, trying to subdue the anxiety overcoming me. When I raise my head back up, I force a neutral expression on my face. \u201cLook, Ethan, I appreciate your help and everything last night, but seriously I\u2019m okay. I just need to go home and get something to eat and shower and I\u2019ll be better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPftt, don\u2019t try to bullshit me,\u201d he says callously, folding his arms and leaning against the footboard. \u201cYou can\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bullshitter,\u201d I argue, slamming my hands down on the mattress, wanting to scream at him. \u201cAt all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was once,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cOver stuff just like this. It\u2019s what people with addictions do. You\u2019ll do whatever you can\u2014say whatever it takes\u2014to get to the next high.\u201d</p><p>My mouth plummets to a frown and I clasp my hands out in front of me, desperation coursing through my body more toxically than the pills do. \u201cEthan, please, pretty please just take me home and forget about this.\u201d My voice is high and pleading. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He considers what I said, then gets to his feet, and I think I\u2019ve won. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to just forget.\u201d He backs for the door and grabs the doorknob as he steps out of the room. \u201cYou know where the shower is when you\u2019re ready to take one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any clothes!\u201d I shout and then throw a pillow at him, feeling the angry monster inside of me surfacing. I\u2019m plummeting into a dark hole filled with every negative thing that makes up my life and I don\u2019t have any pills on me to bring me back up to the light. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I care about you,\u201d he says matter-of-factly and then he shuts the door.</p><p>No one\u2019s ever said they care about me, not even my sister, Abby, and his words should make me feel better. But they don\u2019t. If anything, the craving and hunger for another pill amplifies, ripping through my body, leaving abrasions that only a dose will heal. Because I don\u2019t deserve for him to care about me. Everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve done to myself. Everything\u2014where I am and who I am\u2014is all my fault.</p><p>I sit on the bed for a while, stewing in my own anger as I stare out the window, rocking my body, trying to still the nervous energy inside me. It\u2019s a sunny day, the sky blue and clear and breathtaking. I should be out suntanning by the pool, but no, I\u2019m stuck in here, feeling like I\u2019m going to rip my hair out. And the longer I sit, the more desperate I become until finally I get up from the bed. Fighting the pain in my stomach, legs, and head, I search his room for my clothes. I find them draped over the stool in back of the drum set.</p><p>\u201cJackpot,\u201d I say and wind around the drums, picking up my white dress, and then I frown. It\u2019s caked in mud and some sort of gross green stuff and it smells like puke. I tap my fingers on the sides of my legs, trying to figure out what to do. Half my instincts are screeching at me not to put the filthy dress on and go out into public looking so disheveled, but the other half of my instincts, the ones connected to the pills, are conflicting with how I was brought up.</p><p>I ball my hands into fists, gritting my teeth, constraining a scream, and then slip Ethan\u2019s shirt off. I put the dress on, and then pull the shirt back on. I comb my fingers through my hair and then glance in the mirror. I look like death: pale skin, bloodshot eyes, and makeup smeared everywhere. Again, I\u2019m torn. Run to what I need or hide what I am?</p> <p>Turning in a circle, I search the floor for my shoes. I look under the bed, in the closet, near the dresser, but they\u2019re nowhere to be found. I give up and head for the door. There\u2019s only one way to get out of Ethan\u2019s house without jumping out a window or off a balcony and that\u2019s to walk through the living and out the front door. I wonder if he\u2019s in there, if he\u2019ll argue with me again. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. I\u2019m a grown woman and I can walk out of a house if I want to.</p><p>I straighten my shoulders, open the door, and step out into the hall. There\u2019s music playing from the stereo in the living room, so I\u2019m surprised when I walk in the room and he\u2019s not in there. He isn\u2019t in the kitchen either. For a second I wonder where he is, but then I realize it doesn\u2019t really matter. All that does matter is that I\u2019m free to leave without further confrontation.</p><p>I open the door, step outside, and blink fiercely against the sunlight. Shielding my eyes with my hand, I hurry down the stairs and walk swiftly for the bus stop. I know I look crazy, with no shoes on, a baggy T-shirt over my dress, and my hair and makeup all ratty. But for the first time in my life I don\u2019t care about my looks. All I care about is getting home, so I can sedate the hungry beast waking up inside my chest.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m seriously in over my head. I realized this when she admitted to me last night while she was in the hospital waiting to get her stomach pumped that she\u2019s been taking the pills since she was fourteen to numb her pain from something. I probably should have just told the doctors the truth and that she was an addict or even that she was suicidal, but I was afraid she\u2019d get in trouble. Plus, she\u2019d thrown up quite a few times by the time we got there, so there was little proof of what happened left in her. All she had to do was dazzle them with a smile and feed them a bullshit lie of mixing too much wine with a little too many pills and they let her go. Although, I wonder if they really believed her, or if the insanely busy emergency room aided her easy release.</p><p>Part of me wishes I would have spoken up. Then maybe they could have assisted her with the approaching withdrawals. When my dad came off of them things got really intense and the medication he\u2019d been taking was dangerous to quit cold turkey so he had to come off it in low doses. My mom helped him through it, battling with him every single God damn day when he\u2019d ask for more, and only giving him a little, slowing weaning him off them. And I start to wonder if that\u2019s what I\u2019m facing\u2014if this is how it\u2019ll be when Lila comes off the pills she\u2019s been taking. If so, can I do it? Can I help her get better? Especially if she doesn\u2019t want to? Part of me wants to just walk away and leave the drama behind, but the feelings I have for Lila, the ones I realized I had when I saw her on the ground like that, beg me to help her.</p><p>But I\u2019m not a fan of drama and helping with other people\u2019s problems, partly because it\u2019s overwhelming and partly because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll mess up, like I did with London. And Lila\u2019s is an addiction. I\u2019ve seen it many times. Felt it. Had it consume every single cell in my body, mind, and fucking soul. I had to get over it myself and it was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done. And I did drugs for only a year. Lila\u2019s been popping pills for over six years. That\u2019s a fucking deep addiction. Plus, I know nothing about what\u2019s even behind her addiction. What I do know is the wounds behind the addiction are even harder to heal.</p><p>After I walk out of her room, I crank up some music and sit down at my computer in the living room. Then I start researching opiate addiction and find the name of the one she told me she was taking when she was barely awake. What I find out pretty much describes what I saw with my dad. Anxiety. Irritability. Vomiting. Tremors. Confusion. The list is pretty long. And it says for long-term drug abusers either medication should be used during detox or the user should gradually be weaned off from it, like my dad was.</p> <p>Jesus, it would be so much easier to check her into a facility. Although I\u2019d have to convince her to check herself in and that seems fucking complicated, too. Everything does at the moment. I\u2019m not sure if I can do this.</p><p>I try to figure out what to do\u2014what kind of person I really am, the kind who can just walk away from a situation like this and not help her or the kind who wants to do the right thing and help her overcome the very hard obstacle of quitting. I think about the last time I walked away and what resulted from it. I don\u2019t want to go down that road again, but I also don\u2019t want to help her and fuck up her recovery because I did something wrong. What I need is some advice from someone who\u2019s helped someone get through a tough time in their life.</p><p>I crank up some music and then wander back to Micha\u2019s old room and lie down on the floor. I retrieve my cell phone from my pocket and delete all the text messages Rae has sent me over the last three days\u2014the ones I\u2019ve refused to read\u2014before I open up the dial screen. I hesitate for probably ten minutes before I finally dial Micha\u2019s number. It\u2019s weird to be asking advice from him\u2014usually it\u2019s the other way around. But he\u2019s been through something like this with Ella, who\u2019d run away and completely changed her identity after her mom committed suicide. She had a lot of psychological problem, but Micha stuck by her side and never gave up on her even when things got hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he answers with a laugh. \u201cYou hardly ever call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I rub my forehead with my hand, totally out of my comfort zone. Normally, I\u2019m the one listening to his problems. \u201cI have a question... about Ella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d He sounds really lost and I don\u2019t blame him. I\u2019m acting like a weirdo right now.</p><p>\u201cAll those problems that you went through with her... was it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Problems usually are.\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m not verbalizing myself very well. I do better with a pen and paper. \u201cYeah, I know that, but was it hard to help her out with stuff when you knew it was going to be hard?\u201d</p><p>It takes him a second. \u201cAre you asking if I ever considered bailing out and not helping her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I say. \u201cBut not bailing out so much as worrying about even getting into it with her because you knew it was going to be a pain in the ass to help her get past her problems and you weren\u2019t sure if you could handle it or even really help her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he answers guardedly. He\u2019s never has been too comfortable talking about Ella\u2019s problems. \u201cI mean, in the beginning I hesitated to be with her, but that\u2019s only because I knew she wasn\u2019t ready for anything more than friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what if you were just trying to help her as a friend?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd you knew you were just going to stay friends. Would you still have helped her then, even if you knew you\u2019d have to deal with a lot of shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says straightforwardly. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to sound all stupid and cheesy here, but isn\u2019t that what friends are for? I mean, you\u2019ve always kind of been there for me.\u201d</p> <p>I snort a laugh, rolling my eyes. \u201cYou know you sound like some kind of cartoon special, right? The ones with bouncing kangaroos that talk about how wonderful and neat it is to have a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBouncing kangaroos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve never been a cartoon person so how the hell should I know what kind of characters they have now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there aren\u2019t any kangaroos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d I waver. \u201cSo you\u2019d still have helped her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he assures me. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never once regretted doing it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I feel better or not now. \u201cAll right. Well, thanks I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what you were wanting to hear, huh?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo... honestly I\u2019m not really sure what I wanted to hear.\u201d I sigh as I sit up, dragging my fingers through my hair. \u201cBut anyway, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not going to explain where this really random phone call came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, gotcha.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cTotally off the subject, but you aren\u2019t by chance coming out to California anytime soon, are you?\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my tensed neck muscles. \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he replies and I hear a door shut. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Ella and I are thinking about having the wedding in a month, around Christmas time, and I was thinking that maybe you and Lila could fly or drive out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a month?\u201d I question, lowering my hand to my side. \u201cIsn\u2019t that, like, really soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon for two people who\u2019ve known each other for almost seventeen years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good point, I guess.\u201d I try not to roll my eyes because I think marriage is ridiculous. Look at my father and mother. They are prime examples of what can happen to a couple if they forever bind themselves to each other.</p><p>\u201cSo will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Ella talked to Lila about this?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr talked to her at all lately?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says, sounding confused. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I get to my feet and head for the door. \u201cI\u2019m down for California, but I\u2019m going to let Ella ask Lila if she thinks she can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan, man.\u201d He turns on some music, letting it play quietly in the background. \u201cTalk to you later, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I hang up and take a deep breath before going out into the hall and veering to the left toward my bedroom. The door is open and I know right away that Lila\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t doubt for one second where she\u2019s going. I\u2019ve been in that desperate place before and it\u2019s an overwhelming place to be trapped in. It makes not wanting to help her feel easy and wanting to help her feel hard, but the feelings that I have for Lila, ones I didn\u2019t know existed until I saw her laying on the ground completely out of it, also make it impossible to turn my back on her.</p><p>I hesitate for a moment, thinking about everything Lila and I have been through, the long talks, the flirting, the touches that almost led to something but never fully did, the way she makes me feel, the fact that I\u2019ve broken my rules with her a ton of times, the fear that overtook my body when I saw her in the bushes. As I remember it all, it makes it slightly easier to make my decision. I snatch my truck keys off the dresser and head for the front door, knowing I\u2019ve got to beat her to the apartment, otherwise this is going be even harder than it already is.</p><p>As I trot down the stairs, gripping my keys in my hand, I try to mentally prepare myself for what I\u2019m diving into so hopefully I\u2019ll be able to handle it. At the bottom of the stairs, I take out my phone and call my mom to get some advice on the right way to try to wean someone off an opiate addiction, since she\u2019s done it herself. I just pray to God, Lila and I won\u2019t turn into what they turned into during it, yelling and fighting and my mom always crying secretly in her room over the things my dad said to her. I can\u2019t picture this happening, at least the crying part, but I can\u2019t erase everything I saw when I was a kid.</p><p>There\u2019re so many emotions crashing through me at the moment as I make the final decision to be there for Lila, but out of all them, what really gets to me is the fact that I\u2019m going to help her, because I care about her\u2014more than care. That in and of itself is fucking terrifying, more than running head-on into traffic. More than walking into a room and looking at the girl you thought you might love, only to find out she has no idea who you are anymore and that you might have never really known her and never will.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m sweating and it\u2019s not from the heat. In fact, I think the air is kind of chilly, but it feels like I\u2019m drenched in sweat. I need to get to my apartment and I need to take a pill. Now. Before I lie down and die in the middle of this bus. God, this is the worst I\u2019ve ever been and if my mom and dad saw me they\u2019d be so embarrassed they\u2019d probably never call me again. Which doesn\u2019t seem so bad\u2014yet it does. Sometimes I hate them so much I want them to leave me alone forever, but then I\u2019d feel even more alone in world and that\u2019s scarier.</p><p>I hop off the bus and sprint for my apartment complex across the street, the asphalt rough against the bottom of my bare feet. I\u2019m panting and nauseous, but I know as soon as I get to the drawer everything will be okay again.</p><p>But when I turn the corner of my building, I slam to a stop at the bottom of the stairway. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I put my hands on my hips and narrow my eyes. \u201cGod, Ethan, can\u2019t you take a hint?\u201d</p><p>Ethan stands up from the top step, putting a hand on the railing and the side of the building. \u201cWhat? Did you seriously think I was just going to let you go?\u201d he asks, arching his eyebrow. \u201cAfter what happened last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say with honesty. \u201cYou always let me go after I mess up. You\u2019ve picked me up how many times and never said a word? That\u2019s what you do. You let me be and you don\u2019t judge me. You even walked out on me that night after we made out and almost had sex. You just walked away.\u201d I can\u2019t believe how blunt I\u2019m being at the moment and I should be embarrassed, but I have more important things to worry about, like getting to the damn pills.</p><p>Ethan briefly winces at my words, but stays composed, making sure to stay on the subject. \u201cYeah, but this is different.\u201d He trots down a stair and tips his head down so he can look at me. \u201cThis isn\u2019t sex. This is drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take drugs,\u201d I snap, rather loudly. I\u2019m making a scene, but at the moment I can\u2019t care because every solitary nerve in my body needs to get into that house. And Ethan is the only thing blocking my route. \u201cIt\u2019s just a prescription.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prescription that you abuse.\u201d He steps down another stair and then another, closing in on me like the damn walls always do. \u201cLila, look at yourself.\u201d His eyes sweep my body and I glance down at his shirt and the bottom of my dress showing out from under it, stained with dirt and vomit.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d I cringe, knowing I don\u2019t mean it. He arrives at the bottom of the stairway and stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jeans, looking uncomfortable and scared to death. \u201cI want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d I snap, stepping back. A few of my neighbors are outside on their balconies and near their cars and they pause to watch the scene unfold. \u201cYou were never supposed to see me like this. This isn\u2019t who I am. And as soon as you let me go into my house, I can clean up and we can forget about all of this. I can go back to the smiling, happy Lila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d he argues. \u201cSorry to break it to you but I haven\u2019t seen that Lila for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can at least give you the illusion of her,\u201d I retort hotly.</p><p>He scratches his unshaven chin with a doubtful look on his face. \u201cAfter you clean up and take a pill?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head multiple times, but I can\u2019t seem to answer him with words. \u201cPlease just let me through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he says simply, and then his hands come out from his pockets and he reaches for me. \u201cLila, I want to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off as I skitter around him and sprint up the stairs, skipping steps even though my body aches and the metal of the steps burns the pads of my feet. Thankfully, I left my door unlocked last night and I get into the house easily. I make a bolt for my bedroom without so much as looking over my shoulder. All I need is one, just one dose inside my bloodstream and all will be forgotten. Everything will be okay and I\u2019ll be back to the normal, happy, full-of-sunshine Lila.</p><p>When I reach my room, I jump over my bed to get to my dresser drawer. Right as I get my fingers around the bottle and relax, I hear Ethan enter my room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking do it, Lila.\u201d His voice is unsteady, which is really strange for him. He\u2019s usually full of humor and radiating calmness in unnerving situations. \u201cJust give me the bottle and we can talk.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and slam my trembling palm on the lid, pushing down to twist it off. \u201cNo, please just go away. I didn\u2019t ask you to be here or follow me. I don\u2019t want your\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arms snake around my waist and I let out a spastic wail as his fingers come down over my hands. He tries to pry them off the bottle, but I wrestle my arms away, slipping out of his hold. I bend my knees to jump over the bed, but he catches me midleap and hauls me down onto the mattress.</p><p>\u201cEthan, stop it!\u201d I cry as he holds me down with his body. I writhe my hips and jerk my shoulders, attempting to escape. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me!\u201d It\u2019s a lie, but I\u2019m desperate, needy, obsessed with what\u2019s in that bottle.</p><p>\u201cStop being a baby,\u201d he says, kneeling up so my waist is trapped between his knees. \u201cI\u2019m barely putting any weight on you.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>I hug the bottle to my chest. \u201cYes, you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d He grabs my hands and then pins them down above my head, pressing his forehead against mine. With his free hand he pries the bottle out of my frantic grasp.</p><p>\u201cNo, please, Ethan. Please, stop it. Please... please... please...\u201d I start to cry and hyperventilate and I despise it because I already look ridiculous as it is.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything as he climbs off me and then off the bed. I leap up from the bed, begging and pleading with him to give me the pills back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you whatever you want,\u201d I say, with my hands overlapped in front of me as I stand vulnerably before him. \u201cAnything, you want. Anything.\u201d I know it\u2019s low to offer myself in exchange for a bottle that\u2019s mine, but that bottle is worth more to me than any part of my used body, worthless mind, and empty heart.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you, Lila,\u201d he says, staring undecidedly at the bottle in his hand. \u201cExcept for you to get better.\u201d</p><p>I lunge for him, but he rotates to the side, so I slam into his back. He thrusts out his arm and holds me back as he grips the bottle in his hand. The longer they\u2019re out of my reach, the more I feel like I want to claw out of my own skin. I start to tremble as my blood pressure rises. \u201cPlease, please just give them to me,\u201d I mutter as I start to sweat. \u201cHelp me, please... I don\u2019t want to feel like this.</p><p>He suddenly lets go of me and for a second I think he\u2019s giving in. Then he pushes down on the lid with his hand and twists it off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, my mouth salivating as he dumps one tiny pill into his hand.</p><p>I notice his finger tremble a little as he breaks the pill in half with his fingers and hands one of the pieces to me. \u201cTake this.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at the tiny piece that\u2019s not going to do shit for me at the moment. \u201cI need more than that.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to give you and I\u2019m only giving it to you so you\u2019re body won\u2019t freak out from withdrawals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not yours to hand out!\u201d I shout and lunge for him again, but he catches me in his arms and holds my weight as my legs give out on me. \u201cThey\u2019re mine! Not yours.\u201d I\u2019m shaking from head to toe as my mind screams at me to take the half and then do whatever it takes to get more from him. \u201cEthan, please just give me the bottle. I\u2019ll do whatever you want...\u201d I shut my eyes and take a deep breath before I offer him something I\u2019ve offered other guys before in exchange for pills. \u201cI\u2019ll let you fuck me. And I mean fuck me, without any of the relationship, needy crap afterward that I know you hate.</p><p>His arms tighten around me as he presses me closer to his chest. \u201cLila, stop. I already said I don\u2019t want anything from you except for you to get better.\u201d Then he moves the insignificant-sized pill into my line of vision.</p><p>I hate him so much right now I can\u2019t stand it. I can\u2019t stand myself. I can\u2019t stand a lot of things, but I still take the pill, and once it touches my tongue, the bitter taste spreads through my body and for a brief second I feel slightly better. But then I remember he has the rest in his hand and I can\u2019t get another bottle until Monday, which is two whole days. Two very, very long, tiring, emotional days.</p><p>A switch I never knew existed flips inside me and unwanted emotions spring loose. \u201cI hate you!\u201d I shout. Fear and rage pound through me so badly and all I want to do is hit him. I start hitting him in the chest, over and over again as tears slip down my cheeks. He doesn\u2019t do anything, which makes me angrier. At least if he hit me or something it\u2019d distract me from the aching pain growing inside me. \u201cI fucking hate you!\u2019 I yell it over and over again until my arms and legs are so sore I sink to the ground, clutching on to his shirt. Every emotion I\u2019m feeling cuts at me like a knife.</p><p>Ethan silently scoops me up and carries me to my bed, even though I protest. I turn on my back with my head on my pillow and stare up at him through a veil of tears.</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much,\u201d I say, even though I don\u2019t. \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he replies imperviously as he stands at the edge of the bed, staring down at me.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d I lie and flip to my side so I don\u2019t have to look at him anymore. I turn the ring around on my finger, over and over again as I stare at the wall.</p><p>I think he\u2019s going to leave me there in my bedroom alone, which I don\u2019t think I can handle\u2014at the same time, I\u2019m fuming with so much rage that I don\u2019t want him to be there. There is no good solution to the situation. No matter whether he leaves or stays, the pills are with him and I can\u2019t get a refill for two days because they guy who writes them for me is gone for the weekend.</p><p>Ethan doesn\u2019t make a sound as he stands beside my bed, like he\u2019s waiting for me to say or do something. I shut my eyes and pretend he\u2019s not there. Finally he shifts and I think he\u2019s leaving, but then the mattress sinks down and a second later he\u2019s lying beside me. He drapes his arm over my side, his muscles tensing, and then he inches closer so our bodies are perfectly aligned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers against the back of my neck, brushing my hair to the side so he can trail his fingers across the base of my neck.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure exactly what he\u2019s sorry for, but nonetheless I start to sob as I roll over and bury my face into his chest. He smoothes my hair down as I cry my heart out, and even though every single part of my body and mind wants to wither and die, for the first time in my life, I don\u2019t feel utterly alone in the world. And the strange thing is I can feel the emotion behind it\u2014I can feel everything.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I\u2019m completely out of my element. I\u2019ve never been one for affection, even with London, but London wasn\u2019t affectionate either. She liked to kiss and have sex, but other than that, the touchy-feely thing was nonexistent in our relationship. She\u2019d cried a few times in front of me, but she always pushed me away or diverted to sex when I tried to comfort her. And she never ever told me anything about the cause of her problems and sometimes I wonder if she didn\u2019t trust me enough.</p><p>As Lila clings on to me, crying her heart out, trusting me completely, I feel more awkward than I ever have. But a few things make the awkwardness bearable. Like knowing that I\u2019m making the aching need inside her the slightest bit less painful, and that\u2019s what keeps me in the bed with her.</p><p>She cries for half the night and then sleeps until midafternoon. I get up around ten when a text message goes off on my phone. Sighing, I delete the message from Rae and then tuck my phone and the bottle of pills into my pocket. Then I wander out to the refrigerator to get a snack, trying to shake the rising emotions inside me. All that she has is some expired milk and a rotten sandwich and the fridge isn\u2019t even on. I shut the door and check the light switches and sure enough the power is out.</p><p>I knew she was having money trouble, but this is way worse than I thought. I start to question why she didn\u2019t tell me just how bad things were getting, but then I realize that I\u2019d probably do the same thing. In fact, at this point, I\u2019d probably have packed my shit up and hit the road, living in my car or something, which actually doesn\u2019t seem so bad at the moment.</p><p>As I slam the cupboard shut, there\u2019s a knock on the door. I debate whether to answer it, but then they knock again so I open the door. There\u2019s an old dude wearing a T-shirt with the sleeves ripped off and a pair of cargo shorts, and he has a piece of paper in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIs Lila...\u201d He glances down at the paper. \u201cSummers here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lie breezily, leaning against the doorway. \u201cYou just missed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give her this?\u201d He shoves the paper at me.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I take it from him and he walks down the steps as I shut the door, reading the paper over. It\u2019s an eviction notice. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>I remember when I was coming down, after I\u2019d decided to make the decision to stop doing drugs, I was very touchy about everything. I even remember yelling at my mom because I couldn\u2019t find any socks. Everything pissed me off and upset me, and an eviction notice... I can\u2019t even imagine what that would have done.</p><p>As much as I\u2019d just like to pay her past-due amount for her\u2014because that\u2019s the easiest solution\u2014I don\u2019t have the funds. I could ask her to ask her parents, but from the stories I\u2019ve heard about them, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d help her. They might make her come home, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go and I kind of don\u2019t want her to. There\u2019s only one more solution, one I\u2019m not very fond of, because of the many things that can go wrong. Still, I ball up the eviction notice and toss it into the trash.</p><p>When I go back to her room with a glass of water and half a pill in my hand, she\u2019s awake, curled up in a ball, hugging a pillow. I linger near the doorway for a while, trying to figure out what to say to her. \u201cSo,\u201d I start, realizing it\u2019s probably the stupidest thing to say at the moment, but honestly anything that comes out of my mouth is going to annoy her.</p><p>She frowns and scowls at me. \u201cWho was at the door?\u201d</p><p>I step into the room and sit down on the foot of the bed. \u201cYour landlord, I think.\u201d</p><p>She gradually sits up, blinking her eyes and clutching on to the pillow. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe dropped off an eviction notice,\u201d I explain and her face crumbles. \u201cYour power\u2019s off, too. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and rests her chin on top of the pillow. \u201cIt was on last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they must have turned it off this morning,\u201d I say. She smashes her quivering lips together and I scoot closer to her and hand her the glass of water and the pill. At first she just stares at it with a disgusted face, but then reluctantly she takes it, popping the pill in her hand and then taking a gulp of water. For a second she looks relieved, but it quickly erases and she starts glaring at me again. But that\u2019s okay. The half doses of pills aren\u2019t supposed to numb her pain, just keep her body from freaking out on her.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d I say, setting the glass of water down on the nightstand when she hands it back to me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get cleaned up and then you\u2019re going to come with me to find some boxes. Then were going to pack up your stuff and get you out of this apartment.\u201d</p><p>Her lip pops out as she frowns even more. \u201cWhere am I supposed to go, Ethan? I barely have any money left and even if I pawned off my ring\u201d\u2014she raises her hand in front of her and wiggles her finger\u2014\u201cit still wouldn\u2019t cover a new deposit and rent for another place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re not going to get another place,\u201d I say, giving her leg a gentle squeeze before rising to my feet. \u201cYou\u2019re going to come stay with me for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d she exclaims, throwing the pillow aside. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that you don\u2019t have to go home or go live on the streets,\u201d I say, bringing my hand away from her leg. She clamps her jaw shut and starts to pick at her fingernails. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live with you.\u201d</p> <p>I bite down on my tongue, getting pissed off. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t.\u201d She looks away at the wall with aggravation burning in her blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019d rather live on the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last a God damn day on the streets and you know it.\u201d I lean in front of her line of vision. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to because you think I\u2019m going to make you stop taking those stupid pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know you\u2019re going to make me,\u201d she snaps back, her head whipping in my direction. \u201cBecause apparently you\u2019re an asshole who will give me only half a dose, when clearly it\u2019s not helping me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn fucking straight I\u2019m an asshole,\u201d I retaliate. \u201cAnd those half doses are going to help you freak out while you quit.\u201d I grab her arms and pull her to her feet. Steering her by the shoulders, I move her in front of the mirror. \u201cLook at yourself, Lila. In the last month you\u2019ve completely fallen apart. You\u2019re not the girl I met a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am! I\u2019ve been falling apart for years, and just hid it better than I have lately,\u201d she says and then her eyes enlarge as she bites down on her lip so hard it instantly starts to swell. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m fine, so stop telling me things to try to get me to see clearly.\u201d She steps forward to move away, but I pull her back.</p> <p>\u201cLook at yourself,\u201d I repeat, because it\u2019s important for her to see what she really is at this moment, when everything the drugs have done to her is showing. \u201cWhen I was doing drugs I never really saw what I\u2019d become until I was pretty far into it. I\u2019d lost a lot of weight and my skin looked like shit. Plus my personal hygiene was nonexistent. This\u201d\u2014I gesture at her filthy clothes and matted hair\u2014\u201cis what you look like because of those pills. Can you handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an exception,\u201d she argues, glancing in the mirror. Her hair is all over the place, her makeup smeared, and her lips are chapped. \u201cI usually don\u2019t look like this. Last night was an exception... a minor slipup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you look like this every morning that I\u2019ve had to pick you up. I always thought it was a morning-after sort of thing, since every other time I saw you, you always look so put together, but now I\u2019m kind of realizing that you just hide it well and that the mornings I had to pick you up were just slipups.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cAnd last night wasn\u2019t a fucking slipup. You could have died if I didn\u2019t find you. Do you realize that? How close you were to dying?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes enlarge for a split second, but then narrow on my reflection in the mirror. \u201cI hate you,\u201d she says, her shoulder shaking under my hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d And I know she really doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s just furious, not even at me, but at the fact that whatever she was masking with the drugs is probably surfacing. \u201cAnd FYI, that\u2019s getting a little old.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me, fire scorching in her eyes. \u201cThen leave.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cAs your friend, it\u2019s my duty to not leave you alone for a while, at least until we can get you down from the half doses to no doses.\u201d</p><p>She laughs sharply and crosses her arms. \u201cWhat? Are you just going to follow me around all the time then, until you get sick of me? Didn\u2019t you get the hint the other night that I don\u2019t want you?\u201d</p> <p>It hurts like a knife slashing into my skin, deep, violent thrashes, but I know enough to know that she\u2019s desperate right now and will say anything to get me to leave. \u201cIf I have to.\u201d I realize as I say it that I actually mean it and the feeling is bluntly real. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes, then that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>She drags her hand down her face and then she notices the small blue-and-purple bruises on her arms. \u201cWhere\u2019d these come from?\u201d She touches them lightly with her fingertips.</p><p>I shrug, removing my hands from her shoulders. \u201cI have no idea. You had welts there last night when I found you in the bushes. If you ask me, it looks like someone got a little rough with you.\u201d</p><p>She winces and then glances at her reflection. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the bed and cross my arms. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right here when you get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you going to come take a shower with me?\u201d she asks derisively as she yanks open the dresser drawer.</p><p>I notice there are candy canes in it and it makes me mentally smile, thinking about when I gave them to her, but I quickly shake the thought away. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d</p><p>She scowls at me as she snatches a pair of black lacy panties out of the drawer. \u201cFine, but how do you know I don\u2019t have any pills hidden in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t since I\u2019m pretty sure you would have gone after them last night,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Her face reddens with rage. \u201cWhatever.\u201d She storms for the door and I follow her out into the hall, staying at her heels, making sure she doesn\u2019t try to make a run for the front door. She slams the bathroom door in my face and I sit down on the couch to wait for her.</p><p>I\u2019m trying not to panic about what the future holds, but I can\u2019t help it. Excluding the fact that I\u2019m taking a big step with another girl besides London, I\u2019m actually going to have to live with her, too, and I could barely stand living with Micha. I like my personal space and if I don\u2019t get enough of it, I start to feel like I\u2019m caged in. I mean, I like Lila and everything, but I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ve seen the real her yet, just the drugged-up illusion of her. Drugs are like that. They make someone a different person. With me, I was calmer on the inside, so on the outside I had an easier time talking to people. Lila\u2019s always seemed happy enough, except for the last few weeks. What if she turns into a completely different person and I end up not liking her? I\u2019ve enjoyed all the time we spent together, the bantering, even the sexual tension, the inappropriate touching, and I\u2019ll even admit it, despite the fact of how it ended, that night on her bed made me feel things I never knew existed. But what if that\u2019s all gone after this.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m a bitch. I\u2019ve been snapping at Ethan and saying mean things even though he helped me out when he didn\u2019t have to. He let me move in with him, and even went as far as helping me pack up my apartment. But I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s like there is this foul thing living inside me, this famished monster that wants nothing more than to be fed, and Ethan is getting in the way of the feast, only giving me broken pieces of pills, and he\u2019s giving them to me less frequently each day. I haven\u2019t felt this shitty since my mom and her driver picked me up from boarding school after the incident. She wasn\u2019t there to rescue me, though, like I hoped. She was there to talk some sense into me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to say that I\u2019m very disappointed in you,\u201d she\u2019d said, staring out the tinted window as we drove through the city, the tall buildings shadowing the streets and the car. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d She angled her head to the side to look at me and slipped her sunglasses onto the top of her head. \u201cAs much as I hate to admit it, I expected nothing less of you.\u201d</p><p>The indignity and mortification of what happened at school still burned inside me and yet I still couldn\u2019t control my tongue. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that, mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your tone,\u201d she snapped. \u201cJust because your father isn\u2019t here doesn\u2019t mean you can disrespect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You let my father.\u201d I was sitting on the opposite side of the backseat, looking at her with such animosity for making me come to the city and the school. If I\u2019d been in California then maybe I would have made better decisions. I wouldn\u2019t have felt so lonely and therefore wouldn\u2019t have gone looking for something to fill the emptiness inside me. I would have never met him and never have done things, disgusting, unimaginable things that I\u2019ll forever regret.</p><p>Her eyes snapped wide and before I had time to register what she was doing, she slapped me hard across the cheek. Heat and pain ignited across my face and inside my heart, too. But I didn\u2019t cry. I wouldn\u2019t give her the satisfaction of crying in front of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cupped my cheek with my head hung low so she couldn\u2019t see the hurt in my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like this was entirely my fault, but I didn\u2019t even know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t understand... I didn\u2019t...\u201d I shook my head, discouraged at myself, but still able to will myself to sit up straight. \u201cIt really hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurting and crying over something a guy did to you is pathetic, Lila Summers,\u201d she said and I had to resist an eye roll because she was seriously one to talk about being pathetic. \u201cAnd it is your fault. You made the decision to be with him, even though you knew he was older, and now we have to deal with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I questioned.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we,\u201d she said in a calm voice as she tugged off her leather gloves. \u201cEverything you do is done to this family. Your father has family here\u2014you know that. You have cousins and some of his business colleagues\u2019 kids go to the school. How do you think I found out about this to begin with?\u201d She tossed her gloves onto the seat, then reached for her purse. She took out a prescription bottle and read the label. \u201cAnd the outburst in the middle of class... you\u2019re making us look like we\u2019ve raised some kind of lunatic.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d balled my fists. \u201cThe other kids are tormenting me, though. Those stupid Precious Bells told the entire school, and now everyone keeps saying what a little slut I am and how I threw myself on Se...\u201d I trailed off, unable to utter his name. \u201cA-And I haven\u2019t been sleeping very well... I\u2019ve been having nightmares about waking up underneath... underneath him.\u201d I summoned a deep breath, wishing she\u2019d hug me or something, or try to make me feel a little better. She used to give me hugs when I was little, but then my father got a mistress and she got her pills and wine. When she was taking them, which was almost always, they became the most important things to her, and everything else, including me, didn\u2019t seem to matter.</p><p>She stared at me with a little bit of sympathy as she twisted the cap off the pills. \u201cTake one of these a day until you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d She grabbed my hand and dumped a pill into my palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I held the tiny white pill warily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to make this all better,\u201d she insisted, screwing the cap back on. \u201cFor everyone. You, me, and your father.\u201d</p> <p>I knew it was wrong, yet she was watching me expectantly, and all I really wanted to do was make the heavy, humiliating, filthy, self-loathing pain vanish, so I tipped my head back and swallowed the pill.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d my mom said like I was a dog who had just done the correct trick and had been rewarded with a treat. She handed me the bottle and then pulled her sunglasses back over her eyes and crossed her legs. \u201cAnd if you run out, let me know and I\u2019ll get you more.\u201d</p><p>And she did. Every time I\u2019d run out, she\u2019d get me a refill. Sometimes when I was visiting at home, she\u2019d share her stash. We\u2019d take the pills and then go shopping or something, the only visible thing inside either or our bodies were the shallow, materialistic, shadows of our true selves.</p><p>I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time in Micha\u2019s old room, which is my new temporary room. And a lot of that time I spend staring in the mirror, not in vain or anything, just looking at my reflection and trying to figure out who I am without pills in my system. The blue eyes that stare back at me are not recognizable, too wide and confused, instead of blank like they\u2019ve been for years.</p><p>As sobriety starts to seep in with each passing day, I try to figure how I got to this exact moment when it felt like I\u2019d been okay just a few days ago. In four days\u2019 time it feel like a thousand bricks have tumbled down on my chest and are pinning me to the bed. And I wonder if I\u2019ll ever be able to stop them from crushing me.</p><p>Ethan</p> <p>What the hell am I doing?</p><p>I\u2019m not looking for a relationship. They\u2019re ugly, raw, brutal, painful, life destroying. They exist only in the hearts of the needy and I don\u2019t need anything from anyone. I\u2019m perfectly content being alone, hiding in the desolate place inside myself. It\u2019s what I need to exist because I don\u2019t think I can handle anything else. Even with London, I made sure to keep as much distance as I could and I\u2019m glad. If I hadn\u2019t, I might have broken apart that morning when I got the news. But instead I felt numb, barely feeling a thing about it, almost like it never happened. And being in that place is a great place to be. It\u2019s quiet and still and peaceful. There\u2019s no yelling inside my head, no commotion, no anxiety. I don\u2019t have to worry about being walked all over by someone, being controlled, or losing myself, or trying to take away the identity of another person, pretending to love them, when really I just want to own them.</p><p>Within the loneliness inside me, I don\u2019t have to worry about turning into someone I don\u2019t want to be, like my mother or my father. I\u2019m just Ethan. And I can live with that. But with Lila... Jesus fucking Christ, I\u2019m turning into a person I barely recognize. A nice guy who cares way too much, who\u2019s breaking his rules and getting involved.</p><p>Yep, I\u2019ve become everything I promised I never would be after I lost London.</p><p>\u201cYour couch smells like old cheese.\u201d Lila walks into my room with a scowl on her face. It\u2019s the same scowl she\u2019s been wearing for the last four days, ever since I learned about her habitual pill popping habit. \u201cAnd your fridge has mold in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least it runs.\u201d I put my pen away and shut the notebook, toss it on the nightstand, and lean against the headboard. \u201cIt could have no power and be growing mold.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead creases as her scowl intensifies. Her hair isn\u2019t combed, and she still has on the pair of boxer shorts and the tank top she slept in. \u201cWhat were you just doing?\u201d She eyes the notebook. \u201cWriting about what a bitch I am?\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and stretch my legs out on the bed in front of me. \u201cWhy would I have to write about that when I can tell you in person?\u201d</p> <p>Her blue eyes turn cold. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019ve said that about twenty times in the last few days and it\u2019s getting really old, especially since most assholes wouldn\u2019t just let you move in with them.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and huffs with frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to give me another stupid piece of my pill.\u201d</p><p>I glance at my watch and then shake my head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a scream through gritted teeth and then flips me off before leaving my room. My head flops back against the headboard and I stare up at the crack in the ceiling. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing anything right, whether I\u2019m helping her or harming her. She\u2019s so much different, more closed off and stubborn and bitchy. She won\u2019t talk about anything and complains about everything. She\u2019s driving me fucking crazy.</p><p>I rub my forehead, cursing the nonstop headache I\u2019ve had for days. Finally, I can\u2019t take it anymore. I need to relieve the stress and there are only two ways for me to do that. Sleep with someone or play the drums. Usually, I\u2019d go with the first, but I\u2019m not feeling it at all.</p><p>I get up from the bed, take my shirt off, and sit down on the stool beside my drums, scooping up my drumsticks from off the floor. I reach over to my dresser and grab my iPod from the dock. I select \u201cGotta Get Away!\u201d by Offspring, put the iPod back in the dock, and crank the volume, wanting to drown out the noise of my thoughts and any more potential Lila drama.</p><p>Once the song clicks on, I slam the sticks down on the drums and start pounding to the rhythm with more force than usual. I\u2019m usually considerate of the neighbors, but right now I need to let off some steam. The longer I go, the more into it I get. Midway, I just close my eyes and let myself drown in the music and beat, my skin covered with sweat and my pulse hammering against my chest. I feel myself getting dragged away from my problems and life. For a moment, I\u2019m alone in the apartment, in the world, and all the worries that surround me cease to exist. Then the song ends and I open my eyes and nearly fall off the stool.</p><p>Lila is sitting on the edge of my bed, watching me with what looks like a disinterested look, but I think it\u2019s a mask to hide the fact that she\u2019s curious.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lila.\u201d I try to catch my breath, sweeping my fingers through my sweaty hair. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her legs and stares at me impassively. For a second I think she\u2019s going to ask me for another pill, maybe even try to bargain with me, something she\u2019s done a lot over the last few days. But instead she says, \u201cHow do you think I feel? One minute I\u2019m sitting in a quiet room and then suddenly the whole place is shaking?\u201d</p><p>I clutch on to the drumsticks, rotating them in my palms, gripping them so forcefully the wood rubs coarsely at the skin. \u201cSorry, but I had to do it, otherwise I would have done something really stupid.\u201d</p><p>She elevates her eyebrows. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike leave the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I wish you would have.\u201d She pauses contemplatively. \u201cWait, why would you leave the house if you didn\u2019t play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I needed to let off some steam.\u201d I wipe some sweat off my forehead with my arm. \u201cAnd it was either this or go get laid.\u201d</p><p>I catch the faintest flicked of annoyance in her neutral expression. \u201cYou should have gone with the getting laid. It works a lot better.\u201d Her tone is clipped and she\u2019s breathing stridently, working hard to keep the oxygen flowing.</p><p>I study her, really missing the smiling Lila I first met a year and a half ago, the one who I thought was my complete opposite, but now I\u2019m reconsidering this idea. In fact, the more I get to know her, the more she does kind of remind me of London, erratic and full of secrets. I thought I knew Lila but I guess I was wrong and I\u2019m not really sure what to do with it or how I feel about it yet. \u201cHow do you know? Have you ever played before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know anything that you can\u2019t and can do? Because I\u2019m learning pretty quickly that those little heart-to-hearts we had for the last year weren\u2019t real.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey were too,\u201d she says, looking hurt, and I relax at the sight of emotion in her face, even if it is sadness because at least it\u2019s something. \u201cEverything I told you was true. I just didn\u2019t tell you everything, which I\u2019m sure you did with me, too.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother trying to deny it. Sure, she knows stuff, like how my parents were and are, but she doesn\u2019t know about my fear of being with someone because I\u2019ll turn out like them or about what happened to London. \u201cAll right, fair enough.\u201d</p><p>We sit in silence for a little bit and she\u2019s either staring at my drumsticks, which are on my lap, or my dick.</p> <p>Finally, she asks, \u201cIs it really therapeutic?\u201d</p><p>I wipe the sweat off my arm with my hand. \u201cIs what therapeutic?\u201d</p><p>She catches my gaze and she looks helplessly lost for the first time since I met her. \u201cBanging on the drums. You said it was good for letting off steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s even better than punching a bag.\u201d I collect the drumsticks from my lap. \u201cDo you... do you want to try?\u201d</p><p>She leans back, shaking her head, like she\u2019s afraid of them\u2014or me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to play. You know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know that since I never got around to asking you.\u201d I inch back in the stool. \u201cBut I can help you if you want. It might help with your\u201d\u2014I press my lips together, trying not to grin\u2014\u201cbitchiness.\u201d</p><p>I wait for her to get all riled up, but instead she stands up with confidence and weaves around the drums toward me and I can\u2019t help but think, Now there\u2019s my Lila. But I quickly shake the thought away because she\u2019s not my Lila. She\u2019s my friend.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you going to show me?\u201d she wonders, eyeing the sticks in my hand.</p><p>A thousand dirty comments run through my mind, but I bite them back and scoot away just a little bit more, making room for her, and then pat the spot on the stool that\u2019s in front of me. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sweep the small space, and then biting her lip she tucks locks of her messy blonde hair behind her ears and tentatively squeezes between my knees and the drums. She drops down in the seat and I realize just how bad of an idea this is as her ass presses against my cock. I try to keep my dirty thoughts to a bare minimum as I reach an arm around each of her sides and hand her the drumsticks.</p><p>\u201cWhat song do I get to play?\u201d she asks as I slant to the side to grab the iPod. \u201cOne of your crazy rock songs?\u201d She sounds amused and it makes me smile.</p> <p>\u201cNot too crazy.\u201d I select \u201c1979\u201d by Smashing Pumpkins, then quickly place the iPod into the dock, press my chest against Lila\u2019s back, and wrap a hand around each of hers so that my fingers are folded around her wrists.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweaty,\u201d she remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t taken a shower in, like, four days. Imagine how you smell,\u201d I retort, but she actually smells good\u2014fruity, like watermelon. I swiftly sweep her hair to the side and lean over her shoulder, resting my chin on it so I can see what I\u2019m doing. The song starts playing and before I know it the drum section is starting.</p><p>\u201cWe missed the intro,\u201d Lila says, stating the obvious. \u201cAnd this song is really fast anyway. I can\u2019t keep up with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say can\u2019t.\u201d I lift her arms in the air. She\u2019s still holding the sticks and my fingertips are pressing against her hammering pulse. She\u2019s nervous, which surprises me. I expected her to be more subdued, because that\u2019s how she usually is. But then again, this is a whole different Lila, one without drugs in her system. \u201cYou ready?\u201d I ask her and I have to momentarily shut my eyes when she shudders against the feel of my breath against her shoulder.</p><p>She nods and I open my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she calls out over the music.</p><p>I take a deep breath, feeling uneasy. Thankfully I know it will clear as soon as I start playing. The song is reaching the chorus, the perfect time to jump in and start playing. We wait and we wait, breathing in and out until it feels like we\u2019re going to combust, and then finally the song approaches the perfect moment. Gripping her wrists, I bring her hands down to the drums. I hear her laugh as the sticks hit and don\u2019t quite match the beat. It\u2019s a little harder to play like this, but I make it work, because playing well isn\u2019t the point. Playing from the heart is and letting her tune out her thoughts with something else other than the overwhelming desire I know she\u2019s still feeling.</p><p>She continues to laugh, a few times trying to take over on her own. It sounds terrible, nail-scratching, ear-clawing terrible, but it\u2019s making her happy and relaxed, completely out of her own head, and honestly I feel the same way.</p> <p>Lila</p><p>Once I take a seat, I know I\u2019m in trouble. His sturdy, tattooed chest is crushed against my back, radiating heat through my thin shirt and making it hard to breathe. Something about the feel of him melts the starvation inside me and suddenly my thoughts are sidetracked. I\u2019ve seen him without his shirt on before, once when we were playing strip poker. But I was drunk and medicated, and truthfully I\u2019m not sure I was seeing very clearly because he looks so much sexier now. All the guys who I can remember being with have been clean-cut, with perfectly tanned skin and chiseled abs. They looked like good guys who use manners in public, although behind closed doors it was usually a different story.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been with anyone who played the drums, had scraggily, untrimmed hair, a five o\u2019clock shadow, or lean, tattooed arms that rippled as they slammed drumsticks down on the drums. I mean, I knew Ethan had tattoos, but I\u2019d never paid enough attention to how many. And God, they look good on him. There\u2019s one in particular going across one of his pecs that\u2019s always caught my attention. It looks like letters from maybe another language that go around in a circle, sketched in jet-black ink. The only other language I can speak is French, so I\u2019m not sure what language it is. But by the unique shapes of each letter, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not a very common one. I wonder if I\u2019m right. I wonder what it means. I wonder if he\u2019d tell me if I asked him.</p><p>My palms are sweaty against the drumsticks and my heart thrashes up as he holds his fingers around each of my wrists. I know he can feel my pulse jolting against his fingertips, but he doesn\u2019t say anything about it, either to be nice or because he\u2019s getting too caught up in playing. I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s liberating, slamming the sticks to the rhythm of the music and I even manage to laugh.</p><p>As he continues to move my hands, I dare to steal a glance over my shoulders at him. He looks so peaceful and in harmony with the song, like he\u2019s thinking about nothing but the beat and lyrics. His eyes are shut and he has this euphoric look on his face. It\u2019s fascinating, watching him match the beat of the song, moving my hands right along with his. He\u2019s really getting into it and it\u2019s sexy and hot and, oh my God, I have to bite down on my lip to restrain unwelcomed noises escaping from my lips as I remember how it felt when his tongue and teeth were on my skin.</p><p>It\u2019s the most amazing feeling I\u2019ve ever experienced, like all of my negative emotions are channeled into slamming the sticks and I wish I could keep doing it forever. But then the song comes to an end and the moment of freedom disappears.</p><p>I quickly look away from him before he opens his eyes and catches me watching him. I\u2019m panting and so is he, the movement of his chest and my back harmonized.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d I say, breathless, my skin damp with sweat. Everything inside me is so scorching, but in a mouthwateringly good way, and unlike usual, I can feel it, taste it, breathe it, want it. Want him. Good God, I want him. I\u2019m sober, completely coherent, and I want him, like I had him that night we took shots at the club and then I just laid in my bed, feeling my usually self-induced numbness, only this time he wouldn\u2019t stop and leave and I wouldn\u2019t shut down, instead letting myself feel everything.</p><p>His chin is on my shoulder and when he tips his head to the side, his breath caresses my neck. \u201cI think you\u2019re a natural,\u201d he says, amusement in his voice. \u201cMaybe we should get you your own set.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my lip, slanting my head to the side to look at him and almost end up kissing him. \u201cA pink set, maybe?\u201d I wet my lips with my tongue, noting the close proximity of his mouth, feeling this new, unfamiliar pull toward him as sensations of heat and tingles course through my body.</p><p>He laughs at me, his breath warm against my cheek as he shakes his head. \u201cPink? Why am I not surprised?\u201d He leans in, pressing his chest harder against my back, but I\u2019m unsure if he even realizes he\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with pink?\u201d I ask, the feeling of desire and hunger leaving my body.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with pink.\u201d Smiling, he climbs off the stool and holds out his hands, and the desire in my body fizzles. \u201cI just think it\u2019s funny that now you want a set when just a little while ago you came in here to complain about the whole house shaking.\u201d</p><p>I swallow the lump in my throat as I place the drumsticks into this hands and climb off the stool. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter, feeling bad, remembering how I was acting like a bitch. Usually I wouldn\u2019t care, but right now I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of tears, my emotions all over the place. I swing around him, banging my hip on one of the symbols. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go back to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila, wait.\u201d He snags my elbow as I reach the foot of the bed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I was just teasing, but I really shouldn\u2019t be. Right now is not the time or place.\u201d He takes a deep breath and his chest sinks as he releases it. \u201cI know how you\u2019re feeling, and teasing is the last thing you need.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, taking a cleansing breath and mentally clearing my head of any sexual feelings I have for Ethan, before I turn around and look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. All of this is my fault. I should have never called you that night and brought you into my secret train-wreck life.\u201d</p><p>His fingers leave my arm and he deliberates something, chewing on his lip while he does. I wonder if he knows he\u2019s doing it, or if he knows how crazy it drives me when he does it. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d he asks, throwing me off guard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare perplexedly at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, what do you want to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are my choices?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>I hold on to the bedpost, feeling light-headed for no reason as I consider what I want to do. \u201cI think maybe you better choose,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause everything I\u2019m thinking involves things you\u2019re not going to let me have.\u201d Pills. Alcohol. You.</p><p>He presses his lips together, looking strangely happy. I\u2019m about to ask him why when he says, \u201cGo take a shower and get dressed in something comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on my hip. \u201cWhy? Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He reaches for his shirt draped on the bedpost and I have to step back so his arm doesn\u2019t brush my breast. \u201cAnd no questioning. It\u2019ll take all the fun out of it.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m skeptical, but curious enough that I obey his instructions and start to head out of the room to take a shower. But I pause in the doorway, my mind going back to his tattoo as he goes to slip his shirt on.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I ask, pointing at his chest.</p><p>He glances down with his shirt half on around his neck. \u201cThis?\u201d He touches the tattoo lightly with his finger, then glances up at me through hooded eyes. \u201cIt means solitude in Greek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolitude?\u201d</p><p>He nods, slipping his arms through the sleeves. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be alone?\u201d I question. \u201cLike on your little road trip thing, because I thought you were going to take me with you.\u201d I try to say it lightly, but I\u2019m feeling too low and down.</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cDreams change, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you shouldn\u2019t tattoo them permanently on your skin,\u201d I joke.</p><p>His lips tug upward. \u201cWhenever I put a tattoo on my skin it always means something to me at the time, and I\u2019ve never regretted getting one.\u201d</p><p>I bite on my already chomped-off fingernails as he makes his way over to the dresser. \u201cMaybe I should get one.\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder at me through hooded eyes and slowly scans my body, making me feel naked. \u201cMaybe you should.\u201d</p><p>It gets really quiet between us as we stand there staring at each other, my body heating with each second his eyes are locked on me. Finally he clears his throat and the tension crumbles.</p><p>\u201cNow go take a shower so we can get going,\u201d he says, picking up a bottle of cologne from off his dresser.</p><p>I nod and go take a shower, wishing the water would wash off the untamed emotions flustering inside me, along with cleaning me. But I pretty much feel the same way when I get out, all riled up inside. I try to shrug it off the best I can and put on my one and only pair of jeans and throw on a pink tank top. I braid my damp hair to the side since I\u2019m not in the mood to curl it. Then I slip on my sandals and head out into the living room where he\u2019s lying on the couch reading a book.</p> <p>\u201cYou read more than any other guy I know,\u201d I say, sitting down on the arm of the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Without looking up at me, he turns the page. \u201cGood. I like being originally weird.\u201d</p><p>I cross my legs and fiddle with my braid. \u201cDo you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d His eyes return to the book, like he can\u2019t quite break himself away from the story. His hair is swept to the side and he\u2019s wearing a gray T-shirt, accented with a black-and-white-pinstriped shirt and a pair of black cargo shorts. He has leather bands on his wrists and boots on his feet.</p><p>I sit there for a while, waiting for him to put the book down, but I\u2019m starting to grow bored and restless. Finally he sets it down on the coffee table, marking the page by folding the corner over. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologizes, getting to his feet. \u201cI had to get to the good part.\u201d</p><p>I eye the worn, bent, torn cover as I rise to my feet. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve read it, like, a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d He scoops up his keys and wallet and then opens the front door, holding it for me. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the good parts get any less good.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and walk out into the sunlight. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019ve never understood what the big deal is about reading.\u201d</p><p>He shuts the door and locks it, turning for the stairs. \u201cGoing to another place. Getting lost in time. Pretending that you\u2019re living a different life.\u201d He heads down the stairs and I follow him. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re reading all the time? And writing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I read and write all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said so,\u201d I say as we arrive at the bottom of the stairs. We head for the carport where his truck is parked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you reading and writing in that journal a couple of times, but now that I\u2019m living with you\u201d\u2014I grab the door handle of his lifted truck\u2014\u201cyou do both a lot.\u201d</p><p>He beeps the truck unlocked and we open the doors and hop in. It takes me a little bit more effort, considering how tall his truck is and I\u2019m barely average height. We slam the doors simultaneously and he starts up the engine, giving the gas a few hard revs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have to ask,\u201d I say, securing my seat belt over my shoulder. \u201cWhat is it with guys and their cars or trucks or anything with an engine, really?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs as he shoves the shifter into reverse. \u201cI grew up around cars so it was kind of a given that I\u2019d love them.\u201d He backs out, cracking the wheel to the right. \u201cAs for every other guy out there, you\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d</p><p>I rest my elbow on the console. \u201cSo, what? You guys don\u2019t ever discuss your love for engines or whatever?\u201d</p><p>His forehead furrows as he straightens the truck and drives for the exit. \u201cYou mean, do we sit around and dig into the depths of our dark hearts to figure out why the power of an engine is so appealing?\u201d Amusement dances in his eyes.</p><p>I aim an annoyed look at him, but when he smiles, I hopelessly lose the battle and grin. \u201cDark hearts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d he says, pulling out onto the main road beside his apartment. \u201cUs men have very dark hearts. Isn\u2019t that what you women talk about all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I sit straight forward in my seat, staring at the towering casino buildings of the main area of the city that\u2019s out in the distance in front of us, the lights of the marques so bright I can read them, even though they\u2019re a little ways away. The sun is gleaming and the sky is a flawless blue as we head toward the freeway. \u201cSome really do have dark hearts, though.\u201d</p><p>He arches a brow. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI mean exactly what I mean. That some men have dark hearts and some women, too.\u201d</p><p>As he slows at a red light, it looks like he wants to say more, but I look out to the side window, not giving him the opportunity. I haven\u2019t made any promises to him about whether or not I\u2019ll stop taking the pills. I\u2019ve just chosen not to contact the guy who writes the prescriptions for me yet. I could any time, but part of me feels guilty since Ethan\u2019s helping me out by letting me live with him. But talking about dark hearts and thinking about the men and women who I know have them makes me want to race to a place where I can get some pills, and not a half of one. I want a full dose, maybe even two or three, so that maybe my own heart doesn\u2019t seem so dark.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I know it\u2019s really not her thing, four-wheeling in a truck and doing outdoorsy stuff, but the fact that it isn\u2019t might be good for her. Maybe doing something completely out of the ordinary will help her feel better and make it a little bit easier on her when I bring up my rules of living together, ones that are going to be hard to discuss but that need to be discussed, otherwise this is going to end up being disastrous.</p><p>\u201cThe desert?\u201d She gapes at me, completely thrown off by where I\u2019ve driven us. She gestures at the sandy hills out in front of us that are marked with tire tracks. \u201cThis is where you brought me? To the middle of the desert? Why do you keep bringing me to dirty places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dirt. It\u2019s sand.\u201d I unclip my seat belt and turn down the music. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why you sound so surprised since I\u2019ve brought you here before.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms and taps her foot on the floor. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s weird that you keep doing it.\u201d</p><p>I silence the engine. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her lips part. \u201cBecause it\u2019s out in the middle of nowhere and there\u2019s nothing to do here but talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty to do here,\u201d I insist. \u201cAnd being out in the middle of nowhere is the best place to be.\u201d The corners of my lips quirk. \u201cRemember, we already talked about this. You, me, the mountains, and the quiet.\u201d</p><p>Her plump lips tug upward. \u201cOh yes, you and your mountain-man obsession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me,\u201d I say. \u201cJust because I like a little bit less of a materialistic life doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>She unfolds her arms and leans over the console, propping herself up on her elbows, and the curves of her breast rise up out of the top of her shirt. \u201cI never said there was something wrong with you. I just don\u2019t get why you would bring me out here to distract my mind.\u201d</p><p>I blink my eyes and tear my gaze from her tits. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the perfect place.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curl to a smirk. \u201cAre you enjoying the view?\u201d She presses on her chest a little harder and I know her tits are popping out even more, but I don\u2019t look down, even though I know it\u2019s going to be a fucking amazing view, one I\u2019ve almost seen and still want to. There\u2019s no use denying it.</p><p>I maintain my gaze and gesture out at the desert. \u201cOf course, what\u2019s not to love about the view?\u201d</p><p>She frowns and then turns forward in her seat, fidgeting a little. \u201cSo show me what\u2019s so fascinating about the desert.\u201d</p><p>I climb out of the truck and stroll around the front of it, knowing she\u2019s confused as hell. When I open her door, sure enough, she has a perplexed expression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks, staring me down with her arms crossed.</p><p>I wave my hands at her, motioning her to scoot over. \u201cShowing you a good time,\u201d I say. She rolls her tongue in her mouth and scans me over, looking like she wants to rip off my clothes, and I realize I\u2019m giving her the wrong idea. \u201cScoot over into the driver\u2019s seat, Lila,\u201d I clarify cautiously, reminding myself that now is not the time to try anything with her. She\u2019s too vulnerable at the moment and I already decided I wasn\u2019t going to go down that road.</p><p>Her cheeks redden with embarrassment as she swings her leg over the console and sits down behind the wheel. As she\u2019s pulling her other leg over, I notice that she has a scar looping around the bottom of her ankle.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get that scar?\u201d I ask, hopping in and shutting the door. \u201cI\u2019ve never noticed it before.\u201d</p><p>She places her hands on the top of the steering wheel, sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s just from something really stupid I did a long time ago.\u201d She lowers the steering wheel and scoots the seat forward, even though I haven\u2019t told her she\u2019s driving anywhere yet.</p><p>\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d I joke, strapping my seat belt on.</p><p>She frowns, blowing out a breath and wisps of her blonde hair flutter around in front of her face. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why you asked me to scoot over?\u201d</p><p>I nod, deciding to let the teasing go. \u201cYeah, put your seat belt on, though.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing again, she reaches around and grabs the seat belt. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019re having me drive,\u201d she states, clicking the seat belt.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s therapeutic.\u201d</p><p>She glances at me from the corner of her eye. \u201cLike your drums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they not therapeutic?\u201d I question. \u201cBecause it seemed to me like you relaxed.\u201d</p><p>She looks me over from head to toe and for some dumb reason I find myself squirming like a fucking moron. \u201cEthan, why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows knit. \u201cWhat? Letting you drive my truck?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, helping me. I know... we\u2019ve talked and hung out enough that I know it\u2019s going to drive you crazy having me live with you. I know you like your alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... I do, but I\u2019m guess I\u2019m making an exception for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? I mean, all I\u2019ve done for the last few days is be a bitch to you and I know you lived with Micha and everything, but living with a girl is way different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insulting your gender?\u201d I tease.</p><p>She shrugs, picking at her fingernails. \u201cNot insulting. I\u2019m just stating the obvious. We do things, you know. Like want to talk and watch sappy movies and leave our bras and panties hanging in the bathroom because we can\u2019t machine dry them.\u201d</p><p>I fidget uncomfortably, trying to figure out what to say. \u201cWell, you and I talk a lot anyway and I don\u2019t mind sappy movies every once in a while, as long they\u2019re poetic, and the bra and panties...\u201d I dither with a waver of my head. \u201cI mean, why the hell would that bother me?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flush a little and I wonder what she\u2019s thinking about. \u201cBut you never said why you\u2019re doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... I like you, Lila. You\u2019re a good friend and you need help.\u201d Friend. I need to remember that.</p> <p>She mulls over what I said, which was nothing but the truth. \u201cPoetic, sappy movies, huh? Do those even exist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to figure that out.\u201d I grin. \u201cOtherwise, I guess no movies.\u201d</p><p>She sucks her lip between her teeth, her blue eyes brighter than I\u2019ve seen them in the last few days, which makes my heart speed up a little. \u201cI might just have to live without them, then.\u201d She faces forward in the seat and the fading sunlight glows against her face, her skin soft, her lips full, and she doesn\u2019t have any makeup on, which is rare for her. And honestly, I prefer her without it because right now she looks fucking gorgeous in the realest way possible. \u201cSo what am I supposed to be doing here exactly?\u201d She motions at the sandy land in front of us.</p><p>The sound of her voice tears me from my thoughts of her and I focus on the windshield. \u201cYou\u2019re going to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive?\u201d She seems hesitant. \u201cLike back to the apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d I extend my arm over the console and push the four-wheel-drive button. The truck grinds and then locks in. As I lean away, my arm grazes her chest and it takes a lot of energy not to lean over and touch her more. \u201cBut first I want you to drive around here.\u201d</p><p>She blinks at me, stunned. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking?\u201d I stare at her with a serious expression.</p><p>She shakes her head with reluctance, looking horrified. \u201cNo, and I\u2019m wondering if you lost your mind or something. Maybe when you hit that hard bump in the road on the way up here and you hit your head on the window, which is going to be a mild injury compared to what could happen if you let me drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about crashing it,\u201d I reassure her and relax back in the seat. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw drops as she grips the wheel. \u201cAre you being serious right now? You have driven with me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d I laugh under my breath, thinking about how terrified I was as she recklessly weaved in and out of traffic. \u201cI seriously thought I was going to fucking die.\u201d</p><p>She lightly punches me on the arm and I wince, but laugh. \u201cOh, now the asshole is going to make a grand appearance.\u201d</p><p>Stifling my laughter, I rub the spot where she hit me. \u201cI\u2019m just stating the obvious.\u201d I reach over and turn the keys, then lean back in the seat. \u201cNow come on and drive. As long as you stay on the straightaway and keep the acceleration up, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t go fast enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll get stuck.\u201d</p><p>She looks worried, and even though I\u2019m not letting on, so am I. There are so many things that could go wrong right now, but it\u2019s fun and adrenaline pumping and that\u2019s what she needs. Good, reckless fun, without the pills, because right now, she\u2019ll be able to feel the exhilaration of it and I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019s been since she\u2019s felt anything at all besides need.</p><p>Her shoulders rise and fall as she attempts to release the stress, and then finally she shoves the shifter into drive and presses on the gas. I try to stay calm, but when the truck lurches forward, I tense and grip the handle above my head.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d I say, grinding my teeth. \u201cJust go slow.\u201d</p><p>She huffs in frustration and then lets off the gas a little. The truck gradually inches forward, the engine lagging a little. She starts to smile as she maneuvers the truck up the sandy slope, but then her face plummets as the tires protest against the lack of traction and the truck rolls back.</p><p>\u201cPush on the gas harder,\u201d I instruct, waving at her to go forward.</p><p>\u201cBut you just said not to give it a lot of gas,\u201d she says, placing her hand on the shifter.</p><p>\u201cExcept when we\u2019re going uphill.\u201d</p><p>She frowns and then floors the gas way too much and we lurch forward. I slam my head on the headrest and hear something on her side hit something hard. When I glance up, she has the heel of her hand pressed to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIs your head okay?\u201d I ask as I rub my own.</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d</p><p>I cringe as the engine cuts in and out. \u201cLila, go, before we get stuck.\u201d</p><p>She throws her hands up exasperatedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re having me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fun,\u201d I explain. \u201cYou need to have some fun in your life.\u201d</p><p>I must have said the magic words or something because she places her hands on top of the steering wheel and hits the gas way too hard again, the truck jerking forward. This time I\u2019m ready and I grip the door handle, keeping myself in place. She whines in discouragement, but continues driving. The longer she does it, the more relaxed she gets and so do I, even when she hits the ramping hills and some of the bumps in the road. As she drives over a particularly large bump and the truck rumbles, bounces, and shakes, she starts to laugh.</p><p>When the truck gets on flat land again, she laughs harder and the truck starts to slow down. Ultimately, she stops it completely near the edge of the rocky road and rests her head on the steering wheel. Her shoulders shake as she sputters laugh after laugh. I remain quiet for as long as I possibly can, until I can\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>\u201cCare to share what\u2019s so funny?\u201d I ask, flipping the visor down.</p><p>She shakes her head from side to side without looking up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, share. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I tell you, then you\u2019re going to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to think that anyway,\u201d I joke, but I\u2019m being sort of serious.</p><p>She sighs, disheartened, and raises her head up. Tears stain her blue eyes and I have a hard time telling if they\u2019re from the laughter or if she was crying while her head was down. She dabs the corners of her eyes with her fingertips and blinks the tears back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that... this is the most fun that I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d She shakes her head like she\u2019s disappointed with herself. \u201cWhich is just silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not silly,\u201d I say, resisting the urge to wipe her tears away. \u201cI think it\u2019s fun, and trust me, I\u2019m not silly at all.\u201d I flash a grin at her.</p><p>She gazes at me intently. \u201cNo, you kind of are, but in a good way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond to her since it seems like she\u2019s being genuine, but genuine about my being silly. \u201cLila, there\u2019s actually a reason why I brought you out here.\u201d</p><p>She pushes the truck into park and presses down on the parking break before rotating in the seat to face me. \u201cI figured as much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just want to know what your plans are,\u201d I say, staring at the sky. The sun is setting and the lights of the city in the far distance illuminate the skyline.</p><p>\u201cPlans for what?\u201d She sounds confused.</p><p>I focus my attention on her. \u201cJust with stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re already getting sick of me, aren\u2019t you? Look, Ethan, I can totally move out. I have a few friends I can stay with until I find somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you going to pay for this other place?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd who are these other friends you\u2019ll be staying with? Guy friends?\u201d Why the hell did I just ask that?</p><p>\u201cHey, I have other friends.\u201d She presses her hand to her chest, offended. \u201cYou\u2019re just my favorite.\u201d She\u2019s not joking when she says that, and for some reason it makes me happy and also makes me mentally roll my eyes at myself.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer how you can pay for your own place,\u201d I say, unbuckling my seat belt.</p><p>She tips her chin down and twists the platinum ring on her finger. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>I reach over and fix my finger under her chin, forcing her to look up at me. \u201cHey, you\u2019re totally taking me wrong here anyway. All I want to talk about is our plans for moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur plans?\u201d she asks, assessing me with skepticism.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you and I and the place we now both call home,\u201d I explain, removing my finger from her chin.</p><p>\u201cOh, you want me to start paying rent.\u201d She frees a trapped breath.</p><p>\u201cYes and no... I know you\u2019re going to probably need a little more time to heal and what not, but I think we should probably discuss how this is going to work a little further down the road.\u201d I flip the handle of the door, hating to say it but knowing it has to be said. \u201cLike maybe when you\u2019re feeling better, you could get a job and start helping out.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be subtle, but it\u2019s hard. \u201cI just think that maybe if you were doing just a little bit more stuff, like working and finding some kind of hobby, things might be a little easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she says quietly, her brow puckering as she stares at the scars on her wrist. I asked her once where they came from and she said it was from something really stupid she did, which makes me wonder if she got them when she got the ankle one. \u201cBut I have no idea where to start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d I assure her, reaching over and giving her knee a gentle squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you go at this alone. And when you\u2019re ready, we can talk more... about anything that you want to. I\u2019m an excellent listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d She stares at me for an eternity, searching my eyes, like she doesn\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m real. When she finally opens her mouth, I have no idea what she\u2019s going to say. \u201cThank you.\u201d She unlocks her seat belt and leans over, giving me a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. Despite all the touching we\u2019ve done, this feels different. More intimate and personal and I realize that despite the fact that we\u2019ve touched each other in places most friends don\u2019t, we\u2019ve never actually kissed each other, a real passionate, lips-devouring kiss. And I want to kiss her so much it takes a lot of inner strength to keep my hands to myself. My instincts shout for me to jump out of the truck and run through the desert back to the apartment, far, far away from her. But the need to help her keeps me in the seat. I need to help her, like I didn\u2019t help London. This is my second chance to get things right and I want to make things right with Lila and with us. It\u2019s an overpowering, binding, magnetic feeling, one I\u2019m unsure what to do with other than keep going.</p><p>When she leans back in the driver\u2019s seat, the look on her face is unreadable. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and then my mouth turns upward. \u201cHow about we go home and watch a sappy, poetic movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d She says it like it\u2019s unreal, like homes don\u2019t exist. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go home.\u201d She opens the door and jumps out into the sand, then turns around and aims a finger at me. \u201cBut you\u2019re driving. I\u2019m so flipping scared I\u2019m going to wreck your truck.\u201d She blows me a kiss and then slams the door, acting just like the Lila I met a year ago, only she\u2019s not because the Lila I met never really existed. She was a mirage created by pills.</p><p>Strangely enough, I\u2019m not the same person when I met her because what I\u2019m doing right now\u2014what I\u2019m feeling at this exact moment\u2014is something I never thought I\u2019d do or feel. Dependency\u2014the thing I hate. I\u2019ve seen it in action, through drugs and through relationships, like my mom\u2019s dependency for my dad, but I\u2019m letting her be dependent on me, and in a weird way, I\u2019m kind of relying on her to let me help her and trusting her to get better.</p><p>Even though she\u2019s been a pain in the ass for the last few days, the thought of Lila moving out, living with another friend, annoys me. I kind of want her to live with me and that leaves me confused because it means that for the first time since London, I want someone to be in my life. I want Lila, more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anyone.</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019ve been living with Ethan for two weeks and I\u2019ve been pill free for two days, not even taking my half pills anymore. It\u2019s a strange feeling, one I\u2019m still adjusting to and learning how to handle. I\u2019d never realized how altered things would get when I was popping pills. Even the heat of the sun feels a little more blistering. Plus, I haven\u2019t slept with anyone. I think it\u2019s a record for me. Even when I dated guys, like my fleeting relationship with Parker a year ago, the relationship was based solely on sex that I barely felt, barely remembered. This has been my life since the first time I had sex. Even then, I had no idea what I was getting into, and when I finally did, it was too late. The things that happened forever changed who I was and how I saw things. I\u2019ve pretty much never looked at guys the same way since, except for Ethan. He\u2019s a genuinely nice guy, which is rare, and makes our situation complex. Ethan and I have always had an interesting relationship, one that\u2019s pushed the boundaries of friendship yet hasn\u2019t quite crossed it. Now that we spend so much time together we barely touch each other, despite the fact that we\u2019re constantly defying friendship boundaries. Like when he walked into the bathroom while I was taking a shower this morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I\u2019d yelled when I heard the door open and shut.</p><p>\u201cRelax, I\u2019m just getting my toothbrush,\u201d he\u2019d replied and then I heard him rummaging around in the medicine cabinet.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get out of here, I\u2019m going to pull back the curtain and flash you.\u201d I said, feeling squirmy about the fact that the curtain was very thin and nearly clear, almost see-through.</p><p>The water turned on and then he busted up laughing. \u201cOkay, best punishment ever.\u201d</p><p>My stomach fluttered with butterflies as I smoothed back my wet hair and cracked the curtain back, peering out at him. \u201cYou know just as well as I do that you do not want to see me naked.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure why I said it\u2014whether I\u2019m challenging him to admit something I hope exists or if I really do believe he doesn\u2019t want me that way.</p><p>He was wearing a pair of plaid drawstring pajama bottoms and no shirt. He had a toothbrush in hand and he was leaning over the sink, staring at the curtain. \u201cDo you not know me at all?\u201d He cocked an eyebrow as he stuck his toothbrush, coated with toothpaste, into his mouth. \u201cI love seeing naked women.\u201d His voice sounded funny and he waggled his eyebrows, completely cool and casual.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, wondering just how much he could see of me through the curtain, and wondering if I cared. \u201cYeah, but you made the friend line between us for a reason.\u201d I was being blunt and I didn\u2019t know why. I blamed it on withdrawals because I was learning quickly that they could make me insane and turn me into a crazy, emotional mess. \u201cAnd you...\u201d I almost bring up that night when we touched each other, but I\u2019m scared.</p><p>His eyebrows knitted and he leaned over the sink, spitting out a mouth full of toothpaste. \u201cNo, we both agreed on that line, I thought.\u201d He rinsed off his brush and returned it into the holder near the sink. Then he turned around, leaned against the counter, and crossed his arms. \u201cAm I wrong about that? Do you... do you... What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Why is he asking me this? What does it mean? Why am I asking myself so many questions?</p><p>Water ran down my eyes and face as I discreetly gazed at his body. He\u2019s so beautiful in a way I\u2019m not used to. A rough beauty, one that has substance, the kind that\u2019s real, not masked by tans, perfectly sculpted bodies, and fancy suits and ties. He\u2019s art, pure and simple\u2014wispy hair that always falls into place right over his dark, smoldering eyes, creating the perfect shadowy look and those tattoos... dear God, the tattoos. He is the kind of art you really have to look at to get what it means\u2014to understand what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>I suddenly realized just how out of character I was. I was noticing him more than I normally do and I could feel it through every inch of my body, the pulsating urge to fling the shower curtain back and beg him to take me now. Beg him to. I never do that with sex. Usually guys just take it from me and I shut my feelings off. But I was contemplating going there with him, asking him for the first time, and being sober. It was making me wonder if I really knew who I was. All these years, the person I\u2019d become was based on pills and this crazy need to feel loved.</p><p>We stared at each other for a while, and then Ethan cleared his throat and stood up straight, heading to the door. \u201cIf you want, we can pack up the rest of your clothes and go down to that consignment store and see if you can get anything for them.\u201d His voice sounded a little off pitch, but his expression was unfaltering.</p><p>I nodded, trying to stand motionless through the steam and the heat coiling up my inner thighs. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and then winked, his gaze skimming to the curtain hiding my body, and then he walked out, shutting the door behind him. I released the curtain, moving back below the showerhead, allowing the water to wash the heat and want off my body and down the drain, telling myself I\u2019d get over it\u2014get over Ethan. But for some reason, the idea seemed unlikely and very out of reach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how much do you think I can get for all of this?\u201d I ask Ethan as he loads up the back of the truck with boxes of my clothes. My beautiful clothes I never want to let go of, but I know I need to in order to buy things like, say, food. I thought it would feel horrible to do this, and it kind of does, but there\u2019s also simplicity in it, like I\u2019m getting a do-over, which I know isn\u2019t real, but at the moment everything feels real. Like the heat and the way my clothes stick to my damp skin. How my hair is in a messy ponytail, tugging at the nape of my neck. My hair has never been this messy and my cuticles never this dry. But I\u2019m in simplicity land, where BMWs and designer purses and platinum rings don\u2019t exist and I\u2019m trying to figure out what kind of person I am and where I fit in all this. Can I handle being poor? Taking care of myself? Who do I want to be? Who is Lila Summers?</p><p>Ethan heaves the last box into the bed of the truck and then slams the tailgate shut. \u201cHow the fuck would I know?\u201d He wipes the sweat from his brow with his arm. He has on a green T-shirt and a pair of black shorts secured by a studded belt, along with an array of leather bands on his wrists. He\u2019s sweaty and kind of cranky, but beneath the sunlight he\u2019s freaking hot and I\u2019m fixated on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, noting my staring.</p> <p>I press my lips together, shaking my head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have a goofy grin on your face.\u201d</p><p>I self-consciously rub my hand over my mouth like I can erase my smile or something. \u201cI don\u2019t have a goofy smile.\u201d</p><p>His lips curve up into a playful grin, and for a moment his grumpy mood vanishes. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Now will you tell me why you have that beautiful smile on your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I shrug, trying not to let my smile broaden at the fact that he called it beautiful. \u201cI was just lost in how nice you look today,\u201d I say, telling him the truth in the most casual way that I can.</p> <p>He glances down at his sweaty T-shirt, then peers up at me warily. \u201cYou think I look good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I shrug again, not really wanting to delve into the details of the fact that I think he\u2019s ridiculously hot looking and I want him to touch me. This feeling has become a growing desire over the last week. Living with him has seemed to sprout it like a flowering blooming on a tree. It\u2019s annoying and I wish it would go away because apparently without the pills I am one sex-starved person. Plus, Ethan has gotten a glimpse into what lies beneath my makeup, jewelry, and designer clothes\u2014he\u2019s seen the real me at the ugliest times. I fear that having sex with him would be different, carrying more depth, at least for me, and I\u2019d become emotionally involved. And then what would happen when our relationship ended? I\u2019d probably pretty much be where I was at after Sean, the first and last guy I cared for and who used me and discarded me like trash.</p><p>He slants his head to the side, assessing me with a quizzical expression on his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why are you acting so weird?\u201d I shield my face with my hand as the gleaming sunlight reflects off the metal roof of the apartment building.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, opening his arms and stepping forward. \u201cAre you really, really sure you think I look good right now? So good that you want to touch me?\u201d He does this weird thrusting thing with his hips that causes all my attention to center on his manly area.</p><p>I roll my eyes even though I shiver on the inside. \u201cYou\u2019re so weird sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWeird, huh?\u201d He comes at me, giving me little to no warning.</p><p>I try to gracefully sidestep out of his way, but I step on my own toe instead and trip over my ankles. I stumble to the side and he catches me in his arms, laughing under his breath as he intentionally rubs his sweaty body against mine.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I squeal, wiggling, attempting to get away. \u201cYou\u2019re all wet and gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said I look good.\u201d He lifts my feet off the ground and I stay straight as a board, trying to maintain distance from his sweaty body. He rounds the back of his truck, heading for the passenger side and somehow he gets the door open without letting go of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I yell, trying to sound like I\u2019m turned off by his sweaty touch, but the pleasure of the moment is evident in my voice.</p><p>He drops me down on the seat and then grabs the seat belt. He leans close as he moves the strap over my shoulder to buckle me in.</p><p>\u201cYou still think I look good?\u201d he asks with a dark look in his eyes, his face so close I can see the faint freckles on his nose.</p><p>I nod slowly, swallowing the lump in my throat. \u201cYes, but I also think you smell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI smell like a man,\u201d he says, grinning at himself. He leans in, getting his chest closer to my face so I can get a whiff of his man scent.</p><p>\u201cBlah!\u201d I scrunch my nose, turning my face to the side, even though the smell of him isn\u2019t that bad. He actually smells like cologne and sweat and heat. Very nice. Very manly. I discretely breathe him in, letting the scent of him saturate my lungs. He must notice the rise and fall of my chest, because he leans back and looks me in the eyes, sheer perplexity burning in his pupils.</p><p>\u201cSo apparently you like the smell of sweat.\u201d He tries to joke but his voice cracks and I wonder why. Ethan never gets nervous. I\u2019ve seen him hit on women many, many times, and he always gets them to come home with him.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything and I\u2019m not sure why. I just keep staring into his eyes and it feels different\u2014I feel different, giddy, alive, and not numb for once. That switch that always flips off stays on. I\u2019m not sure if I like the feeling\u2014the vulnerable, misplaced emotions swarming inside my chest\u2014or not.</p><p>Without even realizing it, I hitch my legs around his waist. The need to feel someone close to me, connect with me, touch me, is conquering anything else within me. I haven\u2019t been touched in a while and it feels good\u2014better than good.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s breath hitches in his throat and it startles me. He\u2019s nervous. I\u2019m nervous. I feel this strange shift between us, the heat between us intensifying, and I get excited, my nerves bubbling up inside me. Suddenly I\u2019m a completely different person. I\u2019m not broken. Lost. Numb. Confused. I\u2019m a girl enjoying a moment with a guy I really, really like.</p><p>I close my eyes as he leans in. He\u2019s going to kiss me. I can tell. And I mean really kiss me this time instead of almost kissing me. I\u2019ve been waiting for this more than I realized and despite all my concerns about my new feelings, ones that I\u2019m sure existed before this moment but I was too medicated to feel anything, I want him so much it consumes every part of my body. I can feel all the warm, hot, overpowering sensations, and I breathe in his delicious scent, taste the anticipation. Kiss me. Please God, kiss me. Don\u2019t back away.</p><p>I moan from the heat of his breath and trace my hands up his back as I arch into him. I wait for it. Wait for the kiss, feeling his cheek touch mine. He rests it there, pressing our skin together, and I know that next he\u2019ll touch his lips to mine. I wait as he moans my name under his breath. And I wait. Seconds later his cheek leaves mine. Break me. Throw me away. You don\u2019t want me. Of course you don\u2019t. No one does.</p><p>Even though I don\u2019t want to, I open my eyes, feeling angry and humiliated when I realize he\u2019s watching me. This is a first for me. Usually, when I get to this point with a guy, they\u2019re staring at my breasts, ready to rip my clothes off, like I\u2019m an object they\u2019re ready to devour.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going.\u201d That\u2019s all he says.</p><p>I\u2019m struck dumb. Speechless. And feeling more unloved and undesirable than I ever have. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d I force a tight smile as I sit up, the inside of my body shaking with anger and disappointment. Tears actually start to sting at my eyes, something that\u2019s never happened to me before. I\u2019m not sure how to handle it as I struggle to suck them back, twisting the ring on my finger as I remembering everything I used to be.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He steps back from the door, farther away from me, and the sunlight hits his face. He looks sad and in pain, almost as if he\u2019s trying not to cry, just like me, and very un-Ethan like.</p><p>I nod, adjusting my pink tank top over my stomach. I feel defeated, unwanted. Honestly, I have no idea what I feel and it\u2019s scaring me. I\u2019ve lived my life moving through a string of very similar guys, ones who are polite in public, buy me nice things, have nice cars, and always tell me what I want to hear, at least until we screw, but I\u2019ve never felt a single thing with them. And now there\u2019s Ethan. He\u2019s poor, drives a truck, and I\u2019m pretty sure that every word he\u2019s ever said to me is real. He didn\u2019t bail on me, even when things got tough\u2014he actually tried to help me, something no one\u2019s ever done. What does that say? That all this time I\u2019ve been looking for the wrong person in the world? One who I thought I was supposed to look for? The type of guy my mother has always told me I needed. Is that what I\u2019ve been doing all this time?</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m about to burst into tears, not just from rejection from Ethan or the lack of confidence flowing inside, but because I\u2019m worried that all this time I might have been doing what my mother\u2019s wanted and was too blind to realize it. All I want to do is pop a pill and make everything I\u2019m feeling go away. I want my confidence back, at least my fake confidence. I want my blissful, numb, never-having-to-experience-shame state because it\u2019s easier than reality.</p><p>Luckily, Ethan walks around the truck and climbs into the driver\u2019s seat. This seems to break the strange, depressing desire bubble that\u2019s formed around us.</p><p>\u201cSo to the store then, right?\u201d he asks, turning the key.</p><p>\u201cWhere else would we go?\u201d I say it softly as if it doesn\u2019t matter, but somehow it does.</p><p>He nods again and then backs away and the simplicity that I\u2019d been feeling just moments ago evaporates and I\u2019m left with a massive void in my chest and only one thing will fill it.</p><p>One tiny, fit-into-the-palm-of-my-hand, forbidden pill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan</p><p>Things are getting weird between us, just like I guessed they would. I\u2019m not even sure what the hell the problem is. I mean, one minute she\u2019s taking a shower and for some damn reason I go in there, pretending I need to brush my teeth when really I just want to flirt with her. And then the truck thing. What the fuck? I seriously almost kissed her and then cried about it over all the emotions pouring inside me, emotions that I haven\u2019t felt since London. I have strong feelings for Lila and I know it; it\u2019s getting hard to handle. And we live together now, which makes things even more complicated. What happens if we end up doing something? We just live together? Kissing and touching and fucking, and if relationships go how I\u2019ve seen then, we\u2019d ultimately end up fighting.</p><p>But for a brief second I look past the idea of turning into my parents and actually like the idea of Lila and me kissing all over the apartment... fucking all over the apartment... having a relationship.</p> <p>No, I can\u2019t go down that road. Yes, I want to help her, but as a friend, because that\u2019s what both of us need right now. I need a break from all of this, my emotions for her and my overanalyzing thoughts. What I need to do is go back to what always helps me clear my head and go get laid, yet the idea of sleeping with someone else makes me feel guilty, and not over London. Over Lila, even though I don\u2019t belong to her and she doesn\u2019t belong to me. I\u2019m free to do whatever I want, yet for some stupid reason, it feels like I\u2019d be cheating on her if I hooked up with someone else.</p><p>This living-together thing is seriously screwing with my head.</p><p>After we sell off her clothes, we wander around the secondhand store for no other reason that it helps avoid awkward time alone in the closed-in truck and then in the apartment.</p><p>\u201cEthan, what do you think?\u201d Lila holds up this really tacky pink fluffy rug with flowers on it. She flashes me a teasing grin, totally trying to work through our awkward moment in the truck.</p><p>I make a face, but I\u2019m seriously distracted by my thoughts, which are stuck back in the truck, wishing I\u2019d kissed her. Yet at the same time wishing I could kiss London again. What the fuck is wrong with me? \u201cIt looks like a nineteen seventies shag rug that a lot of people probably had sex on.\u201d</p> <p>Awkwardness builds around us at my use of the word sex. She shifts uncomfortably and I clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cSo should we go?\u201d I ask, stepping to the side as a man walks up the aisle. I grow anxious and I need to get the hell out of here.</p><p>She lets out a breath and then sets the used rug back onto the shelf, seemingly depressed. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I feel like an ass. She doesn\u2019t need this right now. She needs a friend. Why can\u2019t I just keep my hands to myself? Why can\u2019t I just be her friend? The answer that pops into my head frightens me to no end. Because I want Lila and not just as a one-night stand.</p><p>I try for a lighter mood and subject. \u201cWe could go get some ice cream before we go home.\u201d</p><p>She shuffles to the end of the aisle, shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m kind of tired anyway.\u201d She heads for the door, looking down at her feet, a broken version of the person I first met, and yet she\u2019s probably even more whole now. The brokenness just isn\u2019t hidden inside her anymore.</p> <p>The drive home isn\u2019t any better. It\u2019s quiet and she keeps picking at her nails and won\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m about to drop her off at the apartment, ready to bail out for the night and get my mind out of depression land and my stupid thoughts of being with her. It\u2019s getting late, the sun is setting behind the sandy hills, and the Technicolor sky looks like a watercolor painting, beautifully unreal.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d she asks, holding the truck door open, ready to climb out. Her blonde hair is slipping loose from her ponytail, her tight white tank top and shorts showing off her curves, and her blue eyes looking sad.</p><p>I shake my head, pressing my foot onto the brake, ready to bolt. \u201cNah, I got somewhere to be tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shadow over as she narrows them. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to go find someone to fuck you?\u201d Her voice is sharp and she\u2019s clenching her fists so hard I think her fingers might break.</p><p>I feel like the biggest douche who\u2019s ever existed, but I\u2019m also very confused. About everything. How I got to this place where every rule I set for myself I\u2019ve managed to break. Where I\u2019m looking past London and my guilt and all I want to do is be with Lila. \u201cYeah, probably.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head vigorously and then hops out, shooting me a heated look before slamming the door. I back away and before she even makes it to the curb I am spinning the tires. I head straight for the strip, parking as close as I can get and hop out. I wander over to the busiest section of the town, where the lights are glowing all over people\u2019s faces and pictures of half-dressed women litter the sidewalks. I search the crowd and nearby buildings for a potential hook-up. Because I need to fuck someone. Now.</p><p>I start searching for someone who looks like they\u2019d be good for a one-night thing. There are too many people out tonight, so I end up going into one of the casinos and searching around the slots until I spot a group of women around my age laughing near the front of the building. I head over to them, knowing it\u2019s not the best scenario because they\u2019re in a group, but I need to clear my fucking head and screwing is the best way when my thoughts get this mixed up, because it distracts me. Not even the quiet will give me that right now.</p><p>A shorter woman with curves and tits that bulge out of her leopard-print dress starts eyeing me the closer I get. She whispers something in her friend\u2019s ear and then giggles as she starts twirling a strand of her blonde hair around her finger. I\u2019m trying to decide if she\u2019s really my type, and if I even have a type anymore, when she starts to approach me.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says, smiling at me. She has some pink lipstick on her teeth and her eyelashes are a little too long, but she\u2019ll do, at least I think she will.</p><p>But as soon as I think it, my thoughts drift back to my apartment where there\u2019s already a beautiful blonde. I wonder what she\u2019s doing. If she\u2019s okay. Why did I just leave her like that?</p><p>\u201cHello, are you listening to me?\u201d the blonde in front of me says and I blink out of my daze.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry, I can\u2019t hear you over all the noise.\u201d I gesture around at the machines flashing around us.</p><p>She nods, biting on her lip. \u201cWell, maybe we could go somewhere quiet.\u201d</p><p>I want to but all I can think about right now is how I bailed on Lila because my emotions were getting the best of me. Because I wanted to kiss her in the truck and then take her upstairs and fuck her again. I want to be with her and for it to be more than just a one-time thing. I want to break my rules for her. The last person I broke my rules for was London, and I wanted her to be my last, at least I did at one point in my life, but now I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>The sounds of the slot machines are driving me crazy, along with the music playing. I could go with this woman somewhere that\u2019s less noisy, like a hotel room. Stay there for a few hours until I\u2019m sweaty and temporarily content. Yeah, I could do that.</p><p>\u201cSure, we could go some place else.\u201d I smile at her, but I feel anything but happy on the inside.</p><p>She tells her friends she\u2019ll be back in a while and we head up the strip, weaving through the people. She starts telling me about her life, but I barely listen. I just keep nodding my head, thinking about Lila and how I feel about her, and every time I reach the same conclusion. That I don\u2019t think I can think about being with her completely yet, not without thinking about London as well.</p><p>I\u2019ve always been good at controlling my actions and emotions, but they\u2019re out of control at the moment, a wild reckless tornado sweeping through my body. I can\u2019t think straight. Lila. London. Lila. London. The slutty girl in front of me. I have no idea what I want and the truth is, whether I want to admit it to myself or not, I\u2019ve been dependent on the idea of London, holding on to her and on to the guilt I felt for walking away from her that day. I can pretend all I want, but all the sex and numbness I\u2019ve been seeking, just like I\u2019m about to with this girl, was just covering it up, not getting rid of it. And now I\u2019m trying to do the same thing with Lila because I feel guilty over having feelings for her. I think until I can let London go, I won\u2019t ever really be able to be with Lila on a complete emotional level where I\u2019m just thinking of her. And that\u2019s what she deserves. Not my halfhearted attention or my moodiness where I run off to avoid what I\u2019m feeling through sex. It\u2019s a revelation. A big, painful revelation and I have no idea what to do with it, although my original instincts say to go fuck this woman and forget about stuff for a moment.</p><p>I suddenly stop in the middle of the strip and people run into me.</p><p>The woman I\u2019ve been walking with slows down, looking confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I blow out a breath, raking my fingers through my hair, thinking about how bad I just want to fuck her and momentarily feel better and how Lila is probably at home feeling the same way about taking pills, especially with how sad she looked when I bailed on her. \u201cI have to go,\u201d I tell her, backing away from her through the crowd. I may not be able to have a relationship at the moment with Lila, but I can be her friend and I can walk away from having sex with this woman because I really don\u2019t want to be with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you have to go?\u201d she calls out, but doesn\u2019t follow after me, probably because she doesn\u2019t care enough to try. We were simply two people looking for something in the wrong places and we didn\u2019t even bother to get each other\u2019s names.</p><p>When I make it back to my truck, I try to call Lila but she doesn\u2019t answer, so I make tire-ripping veer onto the road and floor the gas pedal, pushing the speed limit until I get back to the apartment. I\u2019m worried about what I\u2019ll find and feel guilty that I\u2019ve bailed out on a girl again.</p><p>When I open the door, my nostrils are instantly flooded with the scent of paint thinner. Or nail polish anyway. Lila peers up at me from the couch, her damp hair a veil around her flushed face. She has her foot propped up on the coffee table and she\u2019s painting her toenails as music plays in the background. My eyes instantly go to the half-empty beer on the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a beer,\u201d she quickly says as she swipes the paintbrush on her toenail.</p><p>\u201cIs it the only thing?\u201d I hate asking, but I need to know.</p><p>She blows out a breath, her bangs fluttering up from her face. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>I shut the door and toss the truck keys next to the lamp. \u201cWhatever you tell me, I\u2019ll think.\u201d I hope though that, like me, she was able to stay away from the one thing that helps her numb the stuff she doesn\u2019t want to feel. I hope she still feels her emotions right now like I am. Because seeing her sitting here makes me realize that even though I still have a lot of shit to work on, mainly with figuring out how to let London and my guilt for her go, walking away from that woman on the strip was the right thing to do.</p><p>She puts the brush into the tiny bottle and twists it on, screwing it tightly closed. Then she sits back in the sofa, staring at me with an unreadable expression. \u201cI didn\u2019t take anything, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at.\u201d</p><p>I lower myself down onto the armrest and I\u2019m overwhelmed with the scent of nail polish and her shampoo. \u201cI\u2019m not getting at anything, Lila. I just walked into my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s why you came back, right?\u201d She scoffs. \u201cBecause you thought I was going to do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>I let out a stressed breath. \u201cLook, I know things have been weird between us, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWeird,\u201d she says, cutting me off and throwing her hands into the air exasperatedly. \u201cEthan, you almost kissed me in the truck and then that night... that night we refuse to talk about...\u201d She shakes her head, discouraged. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where we stand anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d I struggle for words, surprised by how she tossed it out there so openly. It throws me off and I struggle to get my balance back, but I\u2019m hopelessly falling to a place I\u2019m unfamiliar with and I need to regain my footing before I do anything drastically life-altering. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been driving me crazy, because I have no idea what I want or what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m going so crazy that I seriously thought about using again. Every single thing is driving me crazy!\u201d She balls her hands into fists, about to scream. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m going to lose it. I seriously think I\u2019m losing my mind. I mean, maybe I need to be on pills. Maybe they were what was keeping me sane and now all of my insanity is out there for the whole world to see.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to explain. I know what she means. I thrum my fingers on the side of my leg, racking my brain for something that will make this situation better. I need to calm her down and make her understand that she\u2019s not in this alone. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time I ran my truck into the ditch?\u201d I have a vague idea of where I\u2019m going with this, but honestly I just might be rambling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gapes at me, dumbfounded. \u201cHow does that have anything to do with what I just said?\u201d</p><p>I slide off the armrest and down onto the cushion, leaving a little distance between us as I kick my feet up onto the coffee table. \u201cIt happened two days after I decided to clean up my act. I was pretty much insane and my mind was all over the place. I seriously thought I was going crazy.\u201d I omit the fact that a major part of this had to do with London, because even though I\u2019ve realized my issues with holding on to London, I\u2019m still not ready to talk to Lila about her. \u201cI ended up dozing off and ramming my truck into a ditch. I was completely sober, and that in and of itself can be even more complex than getting high. It\u2019s distracting, you know. And hard.\u201d</p> <p>She taps her foot on the ground, refusing to look at me. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u201d\u2014I lean closer to her and start to shut my eyes when I get a whiff of her perfume, but quickly blink my eyes open\u2014\u201cI want to let you know that I understand how you\u2019re feeling and that sometimes things do feel all crazy, but it\u2019ll fade.\u201d</p><p>She sighs begrudgingly. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil it goes away completely?\u201d</p><p>I stare ahead at the wall in front of us. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it ever does go completely away. It\u2019s always kind of there, you know. Like a sleeping beast or something, but the intensity of the cravings fades away.\u201d</p><p>She turns her head toward me. \u201cDid the beast ever wake up for you? I mean, have you ever slipped up?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOnce. About a year after I stopped doing drugs.\u201d The day I saw London again. It was too much to see her like that, a shell of her old self.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d Lila asks. \u201cYou just fixed yourself again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d I say, again omitting the truth. That I was afraid of myself when I do drugs. Afraid of what I might become. Afraid I\u2019d lose my mind, too, and end up jumping out a window, following in London\u2019s footsteps. The people at the house had said they had no idea she went upstairs. That they didn\u2019t see her. That\u2019s because they were out of it and I should have been there for her. And she shouldn\u2019t have shot up the damn heroin in the first place. What really gets to me though, and I\u2019ll always wonder, is why did she jump? Was it because of the drugs? Or was it for another reason? Did she want to jump? If I hadn\u2019t left her, then I\u2019d know. If I hadn\u2019t left her, then she might have not jumped. But she still might have. I\u2019ll never really know.</p><p>Lila bites on her lip, soaking my words in like a sponge and I pray to God I\u2019ve said everything right. She looks at me, her eyes big and blue, and she frees her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously like Mr. Miyagi or something.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shoot upward and the dark tone of the night flips to amusement. \u201cDid you seriously just reference the Karate Kid?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s just an old movie about kicking ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like something you\u2019d watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m full of surprises.\u201d She rolls her eyes like she\u2019s saying the most ridiculous thing that\u2019s ever existed, but really, it\u2019s the truth. Good and bad, Lila has been surprising me over and over again and I wonder just how many more surprises I\u2019m in store for. Good and bad.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d I say, truthfully, remembering how different she was when I first met her. \u201cYou really are.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Lila</p><p>Ethan\u2019s teaching me how to take care of myself, like how to shop cheap at the grocery store and pretty much spend as little money as possible wherever I go. It\u2019s a little bizarre, not just because I need to be taught these things at the age of twenty, but because what he\u2019s teaching me goes against everything I\u2019ve been taught. I grew up in a home with maids, nannies, dry cleaners, chauffeurs, and money always on hand. Then while I lived with Ella, when I couldn\u2019t pay someone to do these things for me, she\u2019d do them. Looking back at it now, I feel guilty. I should have never let her be responsible for cleaning up after me. Now I\u2019m broke and doing my own laundry. It\u2019s weird and kind of sucks, yet at the same time there\u2019s this strange gratification of being able to take care of myself, like I\u2019m finally not completely worthless.</p><p>\u201cI have a job interview tomorrow morning,\u201d I announce as I walk into the apartment, shutting the door behind me, feeling a little proud of myself, despite what position the interview is for.</p><p>Ethan glances up from the book he\u2019s writing in at the kitchen table. His hair is swept back out of his eyes and sticks up everywhere. \u201cOh, thank God. Finally. I was beginning to think I was going to have to kick you out on the streets.\u201d He grins, amused with himself, but there\u2019s an underlying pain in his expression, almost as if he\u2019s forcing his humorous self to come out to disguise something else.</p><p>I\u2019d ask him about it, but after the whole truck fiasco I\u2019m deciding it\u2019s better if we keep a little bit of distance between us, until I can figure out where we stand.</p><p>\u201cRude much?\u201d I toss my purse on the couch and chuck the keys at him. He ducks, laughing, and the keys miss him and hit the wall behind him. \u201cAnd I know you would never put me out on the streets.\u201d I grin as I enter the kitchen. \u201cYou like me way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I now?\u201d He sits up straight and humor dances in his eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you finally got an interview. You\u2019ve seriously applied for, like, a hundred jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sigh and head to the kitchen, opening the fridge. \u201cBut apparently if you\u2019re twenty and have never worked before, no one wants you to work for them.\u201d I grab a can of soda out of the fridge and bump the door shut with my hip. \u201cThey all kept looking at me like I was worthless, and I\u2019m not.\u201d I tap the top of my finger against the can as I sink down into the chair. \u201cI\u2019ve got skills, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad finger skills?\u201d He laughs as he eyes my finger tapping insanely against the top of the can.</p><p>I flip him my middle finger. \u201cYou would be very surprised at what I can do with my fingers.\u201d</p><p>He clenches his fist and places it in front of his mouth. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I would.\u201d</p><p>We both go silent. I can hear the loud roar of an engine outside and the clanking of the refrigerator. It\u2019s an awkward silence, which is becoming more common the longer I live here with him. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s causing it. Sexual tension? Probably from me, but I\u2019m assuming Ethan\u2019s managed to maintain his playboy lifestyle, bringing his women home late at night and sending them home as soon as he\u2019s done with them, because that\u2019s what he\u2019s always done. I haven\u2019t actually seen any of them, but none of them in the past have stuck around very long anyway. I\u2019d be disgusted by his behavior, but I\u2019ve done the same thing time and time again, only I\u2019m usually the one leaving the house in the early hours of the morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan clears his throat and then shuts his book, shoving back from the table. \u201cSo should we go celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrate what?\u201d I take a gulp of my soda to cool down my body.</p><p>He scoops up the keys without taking his eyes off me. \u201cThe job interview.\u201d He stands up straight, closing his fingers around the keys. \u201cBy the way, where is it at?\u201d</p><p>I set the soda can down on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s at that bar.\u201d I try not to go into the details on purpose because I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s going to react.</p><p>\u201cWhat bar?\u201d He pushes the chair in and tucks the keys into the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cThe one down on that street by the old section of Vegas,\u201d I say evasively, pushing away from the table.

I only want to celebrate if I get the job.\u201d</p><p>He scans me over quizzically. \u201cWhere\u2019s the job interview, Lila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere.\u201d I walk quickly down the hall to avoid any more questioning. Once I make it to my room, I shut the door and breathe in the silence, but as soon as I step away from the door it opens and Ethan comes walking in.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the interview, Lila?\u201d he repeats, standing in the doorway, looking vexed.</p><p>I place the soda can down on one of the boxes I haven\u2019t unpacked yet and then cross my arms. \u201cWhy is this bothering you so much? I thought you were just happy I finally had an interview.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his weight and then sweeps his fingers through his hair, brushing it out of his eyes. \u201cBecause... you\u2019re not...\u201d He\u2019s struggling and I\u2019m twistedly finding it amusing. \u201cYou\u2019re not applying to be a stripper, are you?\u201d His gaze locks on me and fury burns in his eyes.</p><p>Without taking my eyes off him, I sit down on the foot of my bed. \u201cWhy would it matter if I was? I thought you loved strippers.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, casually leaning against the door. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s not the place for you. You\u2019re too...\u201d His gaze skims my entire body, making even the coolness of the air conditioning feel stifling.</p><p>\u201cToo what?\u201d I press.</p><p>His attention lingers on my chest and then he blinks, fixing his eyes on my face. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing... you just don\u2019t fit in a place like that.\u201d</p><p>I bend my knee and unfasten my sandal, wiggling my foot out. \u201cI think a lot of people would disagree with you.\u201d I shake my chest and then roll my eyes. \u201cWhat else am I good for?\u201d</p><p>He remains by the doorway, grasping on to the doorknob. \u201cYou\u2019re good for a lot of things, you just don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so that was a little bit sweet. \u201cLike what exactly?\u201d I toss my sandal into the closet without getting up. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything by myself. I mean, you had to teach me to work the dishwasher for crying out loud.\u201d</p><p>He lets go of the doorknob and sits down beside me on the bed while I take off my other sandal. \u201cSo what? Everyone has to learn sometime. You\u2019re just learning a little bit later than most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a spoiled brat who had a maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t any more, though. You\u2019re becoming an independent, strong Lila.\u201d He winks at me and gives me a lopsided grin. \u201cAnd that Lila doesn\u2019t belong in a strip club.\u201d</p><p>I think I may have just fallen in love with him. No one has ever said something so nice to me or put that kind of confidence in my character. In fact, I\u2019ve been told the opposite for as long as I can remember. Lila, you\u2019ll never make it. Lila, you\u2019re worthless. Lila, you\u2019re messing up this family. No one will ever love you if you don\u2019t change into something they can love. Be perfect. Be beautiful. Because no one will want you if you\u2019re not.</p> <p>\u201cEven though I know you\u2019re to going to get annoyed with me for saying it,\u201d I begin, slipping my foot out of my sandal, \u201cyou\u2019re seriously really sweet when you want to be.\u201d</p><p>He frowns with annoyance. \u201cI\u2019m not sweet. I\u2019m actually really, really mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of it.\u201d Once I get my shoe off, I flop back on the bed, not bothering to tug my shirt down when it rides up over my stomach. \u201cI have to take more of my clothes down to that store tomorrow because I\u2019m running out of money. Can you give me a ride? Or can I borrow your truck?\u201d</p><p>He lies down beside me on the bed, surprising me, and turns his head toward me. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s the most tragic thing that\u2019s ever happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt kind of is.\u201d I pout with my arms overlapped on my stomach and my gaze fixed on the ceiling. \u201cAs shallow as it\u2019s going to sound, I love my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d He runs his finger along my exposed stomach, right above the scar hidden behind the waistband of my shorts, and I fight back the urge to shiver and moan. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re not dressed up all fancy now.\u201d He props up on his elbow, keeping his fingers on my stomach, although I\u2019m not even sure he realizes they\u2019re there. He peers down at my tight, purple T-shirt that Ella left behind and my denim shorts I\u2019ve never worn until today. \u201cAnd you look pretty fucking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dressed this way because of where I applied.\u201d I have to work to keep my lungs moving as he continues to trace his fingers back and forth across my stomach. The insides of my thighs are starting to shake, more than any other time a guy has touched me. \u201cI had to play the part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what part is that?\u201d He cocks an eyebrow and then playfully pinches my stomach right above my belly button and a hot sensation coils deep within me. \u201cCome on, just tell me where you might be working because I\u2019ll end up finding out anyway.\u201d</p><p>I begrudgingly sigh. \u201cFine... at Danny\u2019s Happenin\u2019 Bar and Entertainment.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stop moving and his eyebrows arch. \u201cThe one on the old strip?\u201d</p><p>I nod, avoiding eye contact with him. \u201cYep, that\u2019d be the one.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stay on my stomach for what seems like forever, blinding me with heat and deafening me with desire. I\u2019m so relieved by the time he pulls them away because I swear I\u2019m seriously on the verge of having an orgasm. \u201cYou dance?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head toward him, finally encountering his gaze. \u201cWhy do you sound so surprised?\u201d</p><p>He wavers, chewing on his lip. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to picture you dancing... like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Slutty? I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d be surprised about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not slutty,\u201d he says, still seeming puzzled as his eyes do a quick sweep of my body. \u201cIt\u2019s... sexy and kind of erotic, at least from what I can remember. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that sexy... I mean, I don\u2019t take my clothes off or anything,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019s just dancing at a bar and sometimes on the bar, depending on what night. I get to wear normal clothes... well, normal tight clothes. And eventually they\u2019ll teach me how to bartend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is, Lila.\u201d His hand lazily scrolls up my body again and I swear to God I\u2019m going to melt from the heat emitting from his eyes. Then he catches sight of his fingers on my stomach and, blinking at them, he quickly pulls his hand away.</p><p>I sit up, no longer wanting to be on the bed with him because I\u2019m seriously about ready to straddle his lap and force myself on him. \u201cLook, I really need to get some rest.\u201d I climb off the bed and backtrack to the door, opening it wider so he\u2019ll get the hint to leave and let me be horny for him in peace.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get up, only pushes up on his elbows. \u201cYou want me to leave?\u201d He fakes a sexy pout, trying to be mocking, but it comes off more mouthwatering than anything. \u201cI thought you were going to show me the moves you used when you applied.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand on my hip and give him an overdramatic look of aggravation. \u201cEthan, seriously, stop teasing me. I only had to fill out an application so far. Besides, you really don\u2019t want to see me dance. You just want to try to make me blush or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I ever want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... I have no idea. You tell me.\u201d</p><p>He sits up and crosses his arms, his muscles flexing. \u201cIt\u2019s just something to think about. You could practice on me.\u201d He smirks. \u201cI\u2019m an excellent judge.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles under his breath, totally pleased with himself, and then he stands up. \u201cAre you sure you want me to leave? I mean, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why you\u2019re standing by the door, looking all hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say, \u201cGet out please,\u201d but nothing comes out. I never want him to leave, which is really bad. I could blame it on the fact that I like his company, but the fact of the matter is that I need him. \u201cYou want to watch a movie or something?\u201d</p><p>He smiles broadly. \u201cA sappy, poetic one maybe?\u201d</p><p>I point a finger at him. \u201cYou know they don\u2019t exist. We tried to find one on Netflix, remember?\u201d</p><p>He sits up, ruffling his hair into place. \u201cI\u2019m sure one exists, we just haven\u2019t looked hard enough... but we can watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want?\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows to express my doubt. \u201cAnd what if I say the girliest movie ever?\u201d</p><p>He yawns, stretching his arms above his head, showing off his rock-hard abs and the artful ink on his skin. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll finally get a nap. I\u2019ve been wanting to take one all day.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but smile. \u201cI secretly think you like girly movies,\u201d I say as we head out into the living room.</p><p>He shakes his head, but I hear him laugh under his breath. \u201cNot the movie, just the company that comes along with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t say anything, because I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been around guys before who have complimented me on anything besides my tits and my ass. I situate myself on the couch while Ethan boots up the Xbox so we can stream Netflix. Grabbing the remote, he sits down on the couch beside me. He sits closer than I anticipated, his knee resting against mine and it feels almost painfully good, to the point where my body feels like it\u2019s going to explode from the tension and heat, and while I hate it, I also love it because I\u2019ve never felt it before. It\u2019s crazy and strange, like I\u2019m a virgin again or something, and it alters my entire thought process. For the first time in my life, I picture myself sitting next to him, doing this exact same thing ten years down the road. We would be living in the same shitty apartment and Ethan would still be working his job in construction because he never graduated from college and I don\u2019t think he cares enough to do anything more with his life. And I won\u2019t be going anywhere, since I could barely get a job as a dancer at some skanky run-down bar. I would still be wearing an outfit I got off a clearance rack and we would have the same crappy furniture because Ethan hates fancy stuff and we couldn\u2019t afford it between our crappy salaries. But despite poverty, everything would be okay. In fact, I can actually envision myself happy, even if I were poor. I\u2019ve had everything before, material-wise at least, and look where it got me. Addicted to pills, struggling to take care of myself, and bearing all the emotional trauma I couldn\u2019t deal with because I\u2019d been taught it was wrong to show emotions that were anything but perfect and pretty. I feel so content right now and I want to keep feeling content. Genuinely content.</p><p>Ethan drapes his arm on the back of the sofa and his fingers brush my hair away from my neck. He starts searching through the movies, asking me questions about them, and I answer with minimal responses because I\u2019m too engulfed in what\u2019s happening to my body and mind. There\u2019s so much clearness in it and I\u2019m hyperaware of everything, from the way his lip is slightly swollen from where he chews on it to the intoxicating scent of him. I can even feel the heat flowing off his body, enflaming my skin and he\u2019s not even touching me. It\u2019s amazing. Clear. Undiluted. Is this what I\u2019ve been missing? All these years? Is this what things are supposed to feel like? Warm and heart pounding, instead of cold and silent. If it is, though, then what the heck am I supposed to do with it?</p><p>A little bit into the movie Ethan falls asleep and he slumps over, putting his head onto my shoulder. I\u2019m fairly sure he has no idea that he did it and I wonder what he\u2019ll think when he wakes up. I let him stay there, running my fingers through his hair, across his nose, his jawline, his lips, like a creeper touching someone in their sleep. I can\u2019t help it though. He\u2019s got such soft skin and amazing lips. I wonder what they\u2019d taste like if our mouths finally came into contact with each other.</p> <p>I\u2019m smiling at the thought when he starts muttering in his sleep. At first it\u2019s really quiet and it almost sounds like he\u2019s saying \u201cLila.\u201d But then he starts to get louder and I realize he\u2019s saying \u201cLondon, don\u2019t leave me... Please, stay... I need you...\u201d</p><p>London? Is it a person? If so, Ethan\u2019s never mentioned a London before. Who could they be? A girlfriend? But if they are then why has he never introduced us? An endless list of things runs through my mind and I realize that even though he sleeps around, the idea of him having a girlfriend is like a knife to the heart. Sex is meaningless, but a girlfriend he could care about.</p><p>Maybe even love.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>\u201cOh, Ethan,\u201d London singsongs as she skips through a field. There\u2019s a bonfire burning near the trees in the distance and the smoke rises to the starry sky. There\u2019s a party going on and people are laughing, shouting, drinking, having sex and London is out in the field skipping like the strange girl that she is.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, drinking my beer as I walk slowly behind her, watching her move through the field of tall grass and weeds. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get us lost.\u201d</p><p>She spins around and around, with her head tipped back, her dark hair blending with the night. \u201cI\u2019m having fun.\u201d She spins again and then stops as I reach her. \u201cHow about you?\u201d she asks, breathless.</p><p>I knock back the rest of the beer and then crush the cup, throwing it into the dirt. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>She grins, walking toward me, swaying her hips. \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a blast,\u201d I say flatly, placing my hands on her hips.</p><p>She frowns. \u201cWell, that sounds convincing.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh, letting my head fall forward so it\u2019s pressed against hers. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just tired. And there are too many people over at the party for my taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be such a party pooper,\u201d she says. \u201cBut only half the time. And then sometimes you\u2019re totally into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally into it when I\u2019m either drunk or stoned,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut when I\u2019m sober, it drives me crazy.\u201d</p><p>She pauses, hooking her finger through my belt loop. \u201cSometimes I think you\u2019re going to just pack up and leave and go wandering off on your own.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer right away, moving my forehead away from hers so I can look her in the eye. \u201cI sometimes think about it. Just packing up and hitting the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you take me with you if you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you want to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe... I don\u2019t know.\u201d She doesn\u2019t look like she wants to. \u201cWould you want me to go with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, but honestly I\u2019m not sure. I really like her, more than any other girl out there, but there are times when I do think about leaving not just my life behind, but everyone in it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you wouldn\u2019t want to take me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t completely deny it,\u201d she retorts.</p><p>Silence grows around us and she holds on to me, wrapping her arms around my waist. \u201cOkay, I take my \u2018maybe\u2019 back. I want to go with you but only so you can take me away from this place\u2014my life.\u201d Her voice is flat, saddened, devoid of any emotion. She gets this way sometimes when she\u2019s talking about her life.</p><p>I kiss the top of her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about yours?\u201d she says, dodging the question like she always does whenever I try to dig deep into her psyche.</p><p>\u201cNothing, except that I don\u2019t want it,\u201d I reply, pulling her against my chest. \u201cLondon, if you want me to take you with me then I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll need notice before we go,\u201d she jokes, the sadness leaving her voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to check my calendar. I\u2019m really busy this summer.\u201d</p><p>I pinch her ass hard and she squeals, backing away from me. She takes off running through the field and I chase after her, but somewhere along the line I lose track of her and the darkness swallows her whole.</p><p>\u201cLondon,\u201d I call out, but she doesn\u2019t reply. I hear her laugh from somewhere, but I can\u2019t figure out where. \u201cLondon...\u201d</p><p>Someone is shaking my shoulder and I\u2019m snapped out of my dream. I feel hot, burning up, like I have a fever and my heart is racing erratically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re totally a lightweight,\u201d Lila says when I open my eyes. I\u2019m lying on my back, my head resting in her lap, my feet kicked up on the armrest.</p><p>I\u2019m very aware how comfortable I am on the outside, but on the inside I\u2019m a mess as memories of London float around in my head. Once again, I\u2019m stuck somewhere between Lila and London and I don\u2019t know how to get over London completely so I can just be just with Lila.</p><p>Lila hovers over me with a hurt look in her blue eyes, like she\u2019s upset about something. \u201cYou passed out, like, ten minutes after it started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it ten minutes?\u201d I instantly crank up my humor, trying to shut down my thoughts of London as I blink up at Lila. \u201cI should get a medal for that or something.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and sits back on the couch so that I can sit up. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was terrible.\u201d I stretch my arms above my head and yawn as I lower my feet to the floor.</p><p>She watches me with this strange look on her face, like she\u2019s trying to unravel a puzzle. \u201cWho\u2019s... who\u2019s London?\u201d</p><p>My heart just about drops into my stomach as a shock pulsates through me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon.\u201d She repeats, relaxing back in the sofa, with an intent look on her face. \u201cYou were muttering it in your sleep.\u201d The corners of her lips quirk, but it looks forced. \u201cAt first I thought you were saying my name and I thought, ew, gross, he\u2019s having sex dreams about me. But then I realized you were saying London and I\u2019m starting to wonder if you have a secret girlfriend or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no one,\u201d I snap, not meaning for my voice to sound so clipped, but I\u2019ve never talked to anyone about London because talking about her makes everything real. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cDon\u2019t get all snippy with me. You know a lot about me\u2014things I\u2019d rather you not know\u2014and I think it\u2019s only fair that I know a few things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know things about me,\u201d I say, trying not to snap, because it\u2019d be bad, both for her and me. \u201cNow drop it.\u201d</p><p>She considers this and then her expression darkens in a very un-Lila-like manner. \u201cNo, it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d She inches closer to me on the sofa. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten into my head so much over the last few weeks and it\u2019s not fair that I don\u2019t know a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know enough.\u201d My voice is tight and packed with a warning for her to not go down this road.</p><p>\u201cApparently not, since I\u2019ve never heard of this London, yet she seems to be important to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLila, drop it,\u201d I warn, sitting up and stretching my arms above my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why, but she seems like she\u2019s looking for a fight.</p><p>Anger crashes through me, a ripple of fire, ready to burn anything in its path. I\u2019m a very controlled person, except for that one time, right after I heard about London\u2014the one time I lost it. The one time I turned into my father and shouted at everyone, broke stuff, showed my rage. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d My voice is low, but the deep, heavy tone is worse than me yelling.</p> <p>Her eyes water over, like she\u2019s about to cry. \u201cYou shut the fuck up. I just asked you a God damn question.\u201d</p><p>I take a few deep breaths, and then I stand up. \u201cI\u2019m going to my room.\u201d As I walk toward the hall, she watches me, looking enraged, irritated, and the slightest bit hurt, just like how London looked the last time I saw her, the last time I walked away from her.</p><p>But I can\u2019t bring myself to turn back to her. I\u2019m too worked up over London, and the emotions surfacing inside me make me want to run out and find someone to fuck. But I can\u2019t. God, I haven\u2019t been able to since the incident on the strip, and honestly I\u2019ve been pretty content about it until now.</p><p>My head is in such a weird place right now over the dream. I try not to think about London, but she always catches up with me, whether I\u2019m awake or asleep. Plus, Rae won\u2019t stop texting me, so that doesn\u2019t help. Three to four times a day, every fucking day, she texts me or leaves me a voice mail. I\u2019ve been screening her calls, refusing to answer until I\u2019m certain about what I want to do.</p><p>I lock myself in my room and do the only other thing I can think of to try to clear my thoughts. I write.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid. More than I want to admit. Fear has never been a feeling I have been comfortable with. I always adopted the artificial, subdued, and in-control demeanor, because I don\u2019t think anyone needs to know what really lies inside me. Like the fact that I still feel torn apart, ripped in half, my soul split, because the only girl I thought I wanted to be with is an outer shell that still exists in every aspect down to the mole she has above her lip. That\u2019s still there, along with her hazel eyes and the scar above her mouth. Her skin is still flawlessly smooth. Her looks still exist, but she doesn\u2019t. The London I knew\u2014the London of the past\u2014is no more. She\u2019s forgotten her life, and life for her now is only about the future. Everything else is lost to her.</p><p>But what I really worry about is if I do go and see her, I\u2019ll finally have to let her go. Forever. And the scariest thing is I both do and don\u2019t want to. I want to move on, maybe with Lila and yet I want to hold on to London because it\u2019s easier than feeling everything that comes along with letting go. But deep down, I\u2019m realizing that eventually I\u2019m going to have to finally say good-bye.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Lila</p><p>It\u2019s been a little over a week since I brought up this London person and Ethan will still barely talk to me. He avoids me most of the time, but when we do cross paths, he keeps it very businesslike, as if we\u2019re only roommates and nothing more. Whoever this mysterious London is she obviously means something to him. At first I thought it was just a secret girlfriend, with the way he whimpered out her name after he fell asleep on the couch. It hurt. A lot. I\u2019d always been okay with him sleeping with women, or at least I could live with it. But a girlfriend? The idea was clawing at my skin like overly manicured nails.</p><p>When I started questioning him about it, though, the spark of anger and discomfort and pain in his eyes led me to believe she might have been someone he loved. But getting to the bottom of it seems nearly impossible when all he\u2019ll say to me is hello. It\u2019s annoying me a little, because he knows so much about me. But when I think about it, Ethan\u2019s always been more of a listener than a talker, and he keeps a lot about himself to himself.</p> <p>I got the job at Danny\u2019s and I\u2019m still figuring out if I like it or not. Honestly, it hasn\u2019t been too bad, but then again, I haven\u2019t gotten up on the bar and danced yet. Today is supposed to be the big day.</p><p>After I check out my reflection in the mirror for what seems like ages, I finally head out. Ethan is sitting on the couch, watching the news, although his glazed-over expression means he\u2019s probably daydreaming about something other than the weather. He\u2019s got no shirt on and a torn pair of cargo shorts. His hair is a mess and his eyes are red, like he\u2019s high, but I know Ethan enough to know he\u2019s not.</p><p>I collect my purse and a jacket off the table and his eyes wander over to me. Usually, he immediately disregards me, but tonight my outfit sets him off, which I expected.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing?\u201d He sits up, giving me a dirty look as he takes in my tight white tank top that shows off my stomach, my breasts, and the leopard-print bra I wear underneath. I have a pair of really short cutoffs on that reveal the bottom of my ass when I bend over, which one of the waitresses told me I\u2019ll be doing a lot since the guys usually throw the tips onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d I retort, swinging the handle of my bag over my shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing called a shirt, you know.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat the hell did I do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides ignore me for the last few weeks?\u201d I say, jerking the front door open. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ignoring you,\u201d he calls out. \u201cI\u2019m just opting not to spend time with you. Something roommates do a lot.\u201d</p> <p>I stick my head back in the door. \u201cYou\u2019re being an asshole and I don\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t even do anything to you besides ask a God damn question.\u201d</p><p>His eyes soften and I think he\u2019s going to apologize as he stands up and struts over to the door. But then he says, \u201cYou look like a whore.\u201d</p><p>That strikes a nerve, severing my connection with him. I raise my hand to slap him or shove him\u2014I\u2019m not even sure which. But then I decide against it and, shaking with rage, I walk down the stairs. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I did!\u201d I holler, unconcerned that I\u2019m making a scene. I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying not to make a scene and I\u2019m so sick and tired of it. Nothing feels right anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything... This is all my fault... I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ethan calls out after me, but I\u2019m already running across the parking lot so his words hit my back.</p><p>I have no traveling option other than to take the bus or walk. It\u2019s a long walk, so I take the smelly, gross bus. I sit in the back, stewing in my anger, zipping my jacket up over my slutty clothes. I\u2019ve never cared that I was a slut before. I\u2019ve been called it since I was fourteen. But that God damn word\u2014whore\u2014sends me back to a time I\u2019ve tried to forget.</p><p>\u201cJust lie down on the bed,\u201d Sean says in a sultry voice that makes me feel warm and loved inside. \u201cI promise, Lila, it\u2019ll feel good.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just put the platinum ring on my finger, saying that he was waiting to give it to someone special. My head feels a little hazy, due to the few shots I had before I came to his place. I hate drinking, but my friends told me it was necessary for tonight, especially if I was going to lose my virginity. All the cloudiness evaporates as I blink up at him and I can see the love in his green eyes, even if he hasn\u2019t said it aloud yet. I know he loves me, because no one has ever looked at me like that\u2014like they want me.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d he whispers, leaning in to give me a soft kiss on the mouth.</p><p>I nod as he leans away and I start to unbutton the crisp white shirt I have to wear every day at school. I keep my eyes on his as I fumble with the buttons, both loving and fearing the hungry look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have such gorgeous eyelashes,\u201d I say as I slip my arms out of my sleeves and let my shirt fall to the floor. I\u2019m standing in my plain white bra, plaid uniform skirt, and knee-high socks, the standard New York Reform School attire. I\u2019ve never been topless in front of a guy before, but Sean isn\u2019t just some guy. I gradually walk toward him, trying to look sexy and confident, but my nerves are bursting inside. I slide my fingers up the front of his shirt, feeling his rock-hard chest beneath it, pretending that I\u2019m not terrified at all of what\u2019s about to happen\u2014pretending I\u2019m more experienced than I really am.</p><p>His muscles constrict as I reach his neck and for a flicker of a second the caring softness I\u2019ve always seen in his eyes ices over. But the oddly cold look quickly vanishes as he reaches up and places his large hand over mine. \u201cGuys don\u2019t want to be told they have gorgeous eyelashes, Lila,\u201d he says in a blank tone. \u201cThink of something better.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, worried I\u2019m turning him off. I wrack my brain for something to say to him\u2014anything that will get him to stop looking at me as if I\u2019m just an inexperienced, na\u00efve girl. But I can\u2019t seem to think of anything witty and sexy through the massive sea of alcohol in my head.</p><p>Sensing my panic, he gathers my hands in front of me. \u201cRelax, Lila. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were.\u201d I sound choked and I know he can feel my pulse pounding through my wrists that he has pinned beneath his hands.</p><p>He smiles, glancing around his dimly lit bedroom. He has candles burning on the nightstands and in the windowsill, creating the perfect glow and lavender scent to make love in. The bed is decorated with rose petals, there are chiffon curtains enclosing the elegant four-poster bed, and soft music flows in the background. Everything is perfect. Perfection. I can feel it, which means this is right. The thing I\u2019m supposed to achieve. I have the perfect guy, older and more mature, with stubble and a firm jawline, and he\u2019s wearing a fancy suit. These are the things my mother always told me to look for in a guy. Yes, he\u2019s been a little rough with me, and when we\u2019re around other people, he ignores me, but only because he has to because he\u2019s older.</p><p>He strokes his finger delicately down my cheek and all my reservations melt like the wax dripping from the candles around the room. \u201cYou trust me, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod, gazing up at him. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>An artful smile curls at his lips. \u201cGood.\u201d He leans in, putting his lip to my ear, and breathes on my skin. I try not to shudder because I know it will make me seem immature, but I can\u2019t help it and my shoulder drifts upward. \u201cLie down on the bed for me,\u201d he says softly and then grazes his teeth across my ear.</p><p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d I say breathless.</p> <p>He leans back and his eyes almost look black in the inadequate lighting as I back toward the bed and he slowly drinks me in. My knees are shaking as I sink down onto the mattress, remaining on the edge.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014do you want me to leave my skirt on?\u201d I sound so nervous, but he\u2019s so experienced and I\u2019m not and I\u2019m doing a terrible job of hiding it.</p><p>He walks back and forth in front of the foot of the bed, tracing his finger along the footboard. \u201cLeave it on for now.\u201d As he reaches one of the bedposts, he stops and begins unwinding a frayed rope I hadn\u2019t noticed was there until now.</p><p>My eyes are fixated on it, my body filled with uncertainty as he unravels the rope from the bedpost and winds it around his hand. \u201cYou look nervous,\u201d he observes, rounding the bed back and coming to me. \u201cI thought you trusted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I do,\u201d I stammer, unable to take my eyes off the rope. \u201cYou just seem different tonight.\u201d</p> <p>He puts a finger under my chin and forces me to look up at him. \u201cLila Summers, listen to me. I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you, understand?\u201d He pauses, waiting for me to nod, and I do, almost certain that I mean it. He smiles. \u201cGood, now lay down for me please.\u201d</p><p>I obey, telling myself I love him, even when seconds later he calls me his little whore as he ignores my pleas for him to stop and he ties me to the bed...</p><p>I jump up from my seat, even though the bus is stopped nowhere near my destination. The doors open and I rush out into the heat and dusty air, trying to shake my head of thoughts of lavender and the aching memory of how the rope felt. I make a right instead of a left, heading toward a house I know I shouldn\u2019t be going to, but it\u2019s hard\u2014too hard. Remembering the things I\u2019ve done\u2014the dark things I did\u2014is making a vile feeling pollute my stomach.</p><p>The house is located a few blocks down from where I got off the bus. The neighborhood is nice, homey, each two-story stucco house surrounded by lush green lawns dotted with plants and small trees. Each two-car driveway has a midsize sedan, sleek, but not too sleek. There\u2019s an illusion of middle-class perfection in this neighborhood, but behind some of these closed doors lives a darker way of life. I know because I\u2019m headed to one of them.</p><p>At the end of the street, I make my way up the driveway and rap on the door that has a decorative wreathe on it and a welcome mat below. I fidget anxiously as I wait. My phone goes off, notifying me that I have a text message, but I reach into my pocket and silence it. I want one thing right now and only one thing and when the door swings open, that\u2019s what I say.</p><p>\u201cI need one right now.\u201d I sound panicky and it\u2019s going to give Parker all the power, but I don\u2019t give a crap at the moment. I just need to feel okay.</p> <p>He leans against the doorway, looking handsome, his sandy-blond hair perfectly in place, the sleeves of his black button-down shirt rolled up to his elbows. He has dimples and his smile is flawless. He seems perfect with his charm and a PhD. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Isn\u2019t this what my mother wanted for me?</p><p>\u201cYou know instant hits cost more than a blow job,\u201d he says, nonchalantly leaning against the doorway. \u201cBut I guess you do know that, since you were pretty much a little whore for our entire relationship.\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him a thousand things, like how I hated every second we dated. Or how I wanted to break it off with him after our first date, thought about it a ton of times, but the fact that he could write prescriptions kept me coming back. But saying so would piss him off and I need him happy at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI know what it costs,\u201d I say, letting the foul feeling take me over because I know it\u2019ll be gone soon. \u201cBut can we make it a quickie? I\u2019m in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>He grins like a freaking greedy, disgusting thief and I both hate him and love him for it. Hate him because of what he\u2019s making me give him but love him for what he gives me in return.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I know I\u2019ve messed up, yelling at her like that just like my father always did with my mom, but it wasn\u2019t to belittle her or to purposely hurt her. I told her she looked like a whore, which she did, but I hated that she\u2019s dressed like that and how good she looks dressed like that. I hated that every guy in that damn place she works at is going to be thinking the same things as me.</p><p>I\u2019ve been doing my best to keep my distance from her, especially after she mentioned London\u2019s name. I\u2019ve never talked about London with anyone and suddenly Lila was asking me to talk about her. It scared me because I was afraid of what I\u2019d say, that I miss her, but not really, that I feel guilty for walking away from her, but I don\u2019t want to, that I want to let her go and move one\u2014move on with Lila.</p> <p>After I call Lila a whore and she runs off, I realize just how badly I\u2019ve been fucking up for the last week. The look on her face was toxic. Dangerous. I need to make it right. I need to not screw up again. I try to text her a couple of times and finally decide just to go down to her workplace, hoping I don\u2019t have to see her dancing up on the bar. I need to apologize for messing up.</p><p>When I arrive, however, I can\u2019t find Lila anywhere. The place is filled with ogling guys, drooling all over themselves as they stare up at the half-dressed women shaking their asses on the bar. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve showed up at a place like this not looking for entertainment and it\u2019s strange seeing it from an outsider\u2019s point of view. It makes me think kind of poorly of myself for being here and loathing myself for letting Lila work in a place like this. Why didn\u2019t I stop her? Sure, she needs a job, but not like this.</p><p>I stop one of the waitresses as she whisks by wearing a see-through dress and carrying a drink tray. \u201cHey, there\u2019s a girl named Lila who works here. Have you seen her?\u201d There\u2019s panic in my voice.</p><p>She looks me over from head to toe and then tries to dazzle me with a grin. \u201cNo, but whatever you\u2019re looking for, I can sure as hell give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say, walking away from an open invitation. And I haven\u2019t had sex with anyone since Lila moved in twenty-two fucking days. Jesus, I\u2019m getting blue balls.</p><p>I\u2019m making my way to the bar when my phone vibrates from inside my pocket. I reach in and take it out, checking the text message.</p><p>Lila: I messed up.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Me: What happened?</p><p>Lila: I did something bad... I think I might need your help.</p><p>Me: Where r u?</p><p>Lila: At work.</p><p>I glance around at the packed tables, the dancers, and the crowded bar area.</p><p>Me: Where?</p><p>Lila: In the bathroom.</p><p>I scan the room until I spot the restroom sign. I shove through people, pushing anyone who gets in my way. Finally, I stumble into the hallway and the voice and music quiet down a little bit. I walk up to the bathroom door and text Lila.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m right outside.</p><p>Lila: Why???</p><p>Me: Because I wanted to see if you were okay.</p><p>Lila: Okay... can you come in here then... I need u...</p><p>Need. It\u2019s a very strong word. Taking a deep breath, I push the door open. There are two women fussing over their reflections in the mirror. When they spot me, their eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d I grin charismatically at them.</p><p>They seem unimpressed and scurry for the door, one of them calling me a pervert, but I ignore them. I scan the stall doors, all of them shut.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d I call out.</p><p>It takes a second before I hear her muffled voice. \u201cI\u2019m in here.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like she\u2019s in the last stall. I make my way over and when I put my hand on the door, it swings open. She\u2019s sitting on the grimy floor, hugging her legs to her chest, her chin resting on her knees. She\u2019s still wearing the outfit from earlier, but she has a jacket pulled over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, cautiously stepping inside the stall.</p><p>\u201cI messed up,\u201d she mutters, frowning at the floor.</p><p>I take another step in and shut the door behind me, gliding over the latch to lock it. \u201cDid you... did you take a pill?\u201d My heart pounds in my chest as I wait for her answer.</p><p>She glances up at me and her eyes are red and swollen, like she\u2019s been crying. \u201cWould you hate me if I did?\u201d</p><p>I crouch down beside her, brushing her hair out of her eyes, trying to get a good look at her pupils so I can get a better assessment of her state of mind. \u201cI could never hate you, Lila. I... I already told you that I messed up while I was trying to recover, too, but it\u2019s important that you tell me the truth so that I can help you.\u201d</p><p>She takes an unsteady breath and then her hand trembles as she removes it from around her leg and stretches it out in front of her. Inside her palm is a tiny white pill.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I run my fingers through my hair, relief rushing over me so powerfully it\u2019s hard to stay upright. \u201cDid you... did you take another one?\u201d I\u2019m afraid to find out, fearing that we\u2019re going to have to start over.</p><p>She shakes her head, her whole body quivering. \u201cN-no but I want to take this one. So bad, Ethan. I can\u2019t even...\u201d Her chest heaves up and down as she fights to breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy, it even being in my hand.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, I take the pill, pinching it between my fingers as I straighten my legs and stand up. She doesn\u2019t say anything, fiddling with the ring on her finger as I make my way over to the toilet, but her eyes are fixed on me.</p><p>I hold my hand over the bowl, waiting for her to yell at me, but she just watches, horrified and relieved at the same time as I open my hand and let the pill fall. When it hits the water, I flush the toilet and then turn back to her, finally able to breathe again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nods, tears pooling in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I squat down in front of her again, needing to get closer to her, like a magnetic current is guiding me to her. It\u2019s overwhelming how much I want to be close to her and how much I regret driving her to this place on the floor. It\u2019s all my fault and I know it. I fucking screwed up and now I need to fix it.</p><p>I look her in the eye so I can see what she\u2019s feeling, let her know what I\u2019m feeling. \u201cSorry for what? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m the one who yelled at you.\u201d</p> <p>She lets out a sharp laugh as tears slip out of her eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t do anything? I went over to my prescription-writer drug dealer, or whatever the hell you want to call him, totally ready to fuck his brains out so I could get one single pill.\u201d</p><p>My heart tightens in my chest and it feels like a knotted, warped, thorny vine is winding through my body and stabbing at every single inch me. I feel like I\u2019m being ripped apart from the inside, a feeling I\u2019ve never felt before and can\u2019t quite comprehend the entire meaning of. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say, even though it\u2019s not. She fucked some guy for drugs. She fucked him. Fucked him. I take a deep breath and unsteadily let it out.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay,\u201d she says, sniffling as tears fall down her cheeks. \u201cI messed up. Really, really bad.\u201d</p><p>I hook my finger under her chin, so she\u2019ll have to look at me. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t take it and that\u2019s good. Really, really fucking amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she says, puffing out a frustrated breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m upset about.\u201d</p> <p>I slant my head to the side, confused. \u201cThen why are you? Is it... is it because of what I said back at the apartment? Because I\u2019m really sorry I said it. I was just...\u201d I glance at her body hanging out of the barely there clothes she\u2019s wearing. \u201cI don\u2019t like you dressing like that. At all.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders rise and then slump as she inhales and exhales, looking ashamed. \u201cI stole the pill while Parker was going to the bathroom. I didn\u2019t sleep with him like I promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d I state, my eyes wide. \u201cThat preppy jerk you used to date? That\u2019s where you get the pills?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cAnd the prescriptions.\u201d She blinks and then panic fills her eyes as she quickly stands up, nearly smacking her head against mine and I have to lean back on my heels to get out of her way. \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s going to be pissed, Ethan. He\u2019ll come looking for me, wanting to collect what I took. And I\u2019m going to have to sleep with him.\u201d She starts to pace the stall as I stand up. \u201cNormally, that was never a problem but normally I was medicated.\u201d She anxiously chews on her fingernails. \u201cIt felt so wrong, just from him kissing me. I could feel it...\u201d She shakes her head, her eyes widening with whatever revelation she\u2019s having. \u201cI could feel everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, though.\u201d I lean back against the stall, very aware at how relieved I\u2019m feeling over the fact that she didn\u2019t sleep with Parker, but also furious that that asshole was her pill provider. I seriously want to beat him. \u201cFeeling stuff is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a heavy sigh as she continues to pace. \u201cI know, but I never have, you know. All those times, meaningless sex, it always felt like a routine.\u201d She sticks her hands out to the side and stops in front of me, looking me in the eye. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t even really like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot like sex?\u201d Okay, that concept is foreign to me and makes me wonder what she felt when we just about had sex. Were all those sparks I felt a one-sided thing? Is that why she just lay there?</p><p>She nods, her blue, mascara-stained eyes so wide they\u2019re practically popping out of her skull. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just something that I do, not something that I really want to do. It doesn\u2019t even feel good.\u201d</p><p>A lot of inappropriate thoughts creep into my mind at that moment and it takes a great amount of energy to hold them back. \u201cWe should get you home,\u201d I say and move to take her hand.</p><p>She shakes her head, turning out of my reach, and strands of her hair curtain her face. \u201cI think I might have lost my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I say honestly, stepping forward and brushing her hair back because I want to see her face. \u201cThis place isn\u2019t somewhere you should be working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to pay rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out. There are a ton of jobs out there.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head again, wrapping her arms around herself as tears begin to slip down her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re too nice to me. You need to stop. I don\u2019t deserve nice.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s like she thinks she\u2019s unworthy of nice. I want to ask her about why she thinks this, but I don\u2019t want to set her off again. She needs to relax.</p><p>I aim for a joke. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because a few weeks ago you couldn\u2019t seem to stop calling me an asshole.\u201d I smile at her, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she says, wiping the tears and smeared mascara off her cheeks with the bottom of her shirt. I can see her stomach, perfect, smooth, and almost flawless, except for that scar going around the middle. \u201cDon\u2019t joke. You\u2019re being too nice again and I\u2019m so messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s messed up.\u201d I reach forward and slowly wipe away some of the tears running down her cheek with my fingertips. \u201cIn their very own fucked-up way, a lot of people just won\u2019t admit it aloud and then try to change it.\u201d I reduce the space between us and place a hand on her arm. \u201cBut you\u2019ve done both of those, which makes you so fucking strong, Lila. I wish you could see that. You\u2019re strong and amazing and beautiful and you deserve so much more than sitting on a bathroom floor in a skanky bar. You deserve to have an amazing life.\u201d I mean every word I say and even though I\u2019m being really emotional, I don\u2019t regret anything I said.</p><p>She tries to wipe some of her tears away, but more pour out. She starts to sob and rushes toward me, throwing her arms around my waist. I tense, but then circle her in my arms, hugging her tightly against me as she buries her face in my chest and a strange sense of calm comes over me. I feel comfortably at peace with her in my arms, and if I could, I\u2019d just keep holding on to her forever, comforting her, making her feel better in every way that I could. It takes me a minute to grasp what it might mean. I might be falling in love with Lila. And the moment I realize this is the moment I realize that I\u2019m not sure if I was ever really in love with London. Infatuated with her, maybe. Love, I don\u2019t think so. Because what I\u2019m feeling right now, this terrifying, cliff falling, heart dropping, thoughts racing, plunging into unknown was far from anything I ever felt for London.</p><p>Lila cries in my shirt for an eternity and I trace my fingers up and down her back, telling her that it\u2019ll be okay, while I kiss the top of her head over and over again, feeling my life\u2014feeling myself change. The longer she stays in my arms, the less I want to let her go. I want to hold her. Smell her hair. Kiss her cheeks until I can\u2019t feel my lips, only her. I want to do a lot of things to her, very slowly and deliberately so I can feel every sensation.</p><p>But then she pulls back and peers up at me with bloodshot eyes. \u201cWhat am I going to do about Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what are you going to do?\u201d I keep my arms around her shoulder, still not wanting to let her go. \u201cIf he comes near you then I\u2019ll kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be fighting anyone for me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh again, louder, until my whole side aches. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can handle Parker. In fact, he looks like the kind of guy who likes to bitch slap and pull hair when he fights.\u201d</p><p>She restrains a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s not that much of a wimp.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes again and shake my head at the absurdity. \u201cWe are talking about the same guy, right? The douche you dated for a while?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head and I detect a hint of an amused sparkle in her eye. \u201cAnd you were so excited when I broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk when you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we were playing strip poker. I remember.\u201d</p><p>I smile, because it\u2019s a perfect moment, a light after a dark episode. \u201cAh, strip poker,\u201d I say, tucking her hair behind her ear. \u201cIf I remember right you never did take your bra off when I won that hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I knew you couldn\u2019t handle the goodies.\u201d She shakes her chest and her tits bounce against my chest. She pauses and then lowers her cheek against me, breathing quietly. \u201cThank you, Ethan... for everything.\u201d</p><p>I could tell her she doesn\u2019t need to thank me. That I was glad to do it. That I loved helping her. But I\u2019m not. I wish it\u2019d never happened. Instead, I wish she never had to go through all of this.</p><p>I mutter, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Then lace my fingers with hers and tug her toward the door, ready to take her back to our home and get her the hell away from this place. I\u2019m ready to take her back home.</p><p>To our home.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Lila</p><p>It\u2019s been four days since my little episode and for the most part, life has been fairly normal, except for my relentless need to fixate on Ethan. Ever since he found me in the bathroom stall, I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. It\u2019s worse than before, an intense growing obsession. I\u2019m not even sure what it is. The way he looked at me, touched me, spoke to me, joked with me, forgave me, and then took me home. They\u2019re such little things, yet they mean so much. He may be rough, blunt, somewhat perverted, and completely imperfect according to my mother\u2019s standards, but I seriously wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I\u2019ve had the supposed perfect guy before, the one who gave me rings, told me I was beautiful, told me he loved me, that I owned his soul, and that he\u2019d do anything for me. But it was a bunch of shit. Unreal. Perfect doesn\u2019t exist. Realness does. Realness is what I need. And Ethan is as real as anyone I\u2019ve ever met. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m trying to figure out what this all means in terms of my feelings for him. I thought I understood love once, but it turned out I was wrong. Could the feelings I have for Ethan possibly be love? I have no idea, but eventually I\u2019m going to have to figure it out, instead of wandering around analyzing everything.</p><p>I\u2019m also looking for a job again, one that\u2019s Ethan approved, and I\u2019m still getting used to that fact. No one has ever thought highly enough of me to think I deserved something better. Sure, my mother wouldn\u2019t approve of the job at Danny\u2019s either, but not because she thought I was better than that. She would think the Summers\u2019s name was better, but not my character. In fact, if she was basing it solely on my character she\u2019d say I belonged there, something she made pretty clear during one of her phone calls.</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d she practically screams into the phone and I have to hold the receiver away from my ear as it rings against her voice. \u201cYou moved in with some guy?\u201d</p> <p>I put the receiver back to my ear and balance it between my head and my shoulder. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s what you said,\u201d she replies curtly. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t get is why the hell you did it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rinsing off the dishes as I load up the dishwasher. I also vacuumed, swept, and cleaned the toilets, and even though it sucked, I also took a bit of pride in doing it. \u201cBecause I needed a place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this guy rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s normal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNormal isn\u2019t acceptable, Lila Summers. Normal will get you nowhere but pregnant and living in a shack and wishing your life was better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal is perfectly acceptable.\u201d I smile at myself, saying it aloud, as I scrub some green stuff off the plate underneath the stream of water. \u201cAnd besides, what makes you such an expert on normal. You don\u2019t even know anyone who is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt Jennabelle is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I had an aunt Jennabelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister and you don\u2019t know her because she lives in a studio apartment with her three children and had to take a job as a secretary to make ends meet after she left her husband when he started screwing a woman he worked with. And no one ever wants to visit a poverty-stricken, single-parent divorcee who lives in a crappy apartment. If she would have just stuck with her husband and overlooked his one flaw then she wouldn\u2019t live in the run-down part of town with a bunch of drug addicts and criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because they live in the run-down part of town doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re drug addicts and criminals,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I would love to visit her,\u201d I argue, rinsing off a glass. \u201cShe sounds like a strong woman who was brave enough to leave a man who obviously didn\u2019t love her enough to treat her well and she\u2019s been able to take care of herself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s poor, Lila,\u201d she harshly snaps like the word is so filthy it has no right to even leave her lips. \u201cShe can\u2019t even afford a new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d I state, sliding some silverware under the faucet and scrubbing the gunk off with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s your own damn fault for being so stubborn. You could have everything you wanted in life, Lila. The perfect life, but you keep messing it up for yourself. Instead of doing what I\u2019ve told you to do and come home and live with us until you can get back on track and meet a nice, wealthy guy who will take care of you, you\u2019re living in poverty, probably taking the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not living in poverty,\u201d I reply. \u201cNot yet, anyway. Thanks to my normal friend, who\u2019s letting me stay here with him because he\u2019s nice. Money and cars and nice clothes aren\u2019t everything, mother. And I don\u2019t want to sacrifice being around people who I like just to have a glamorous life.\u201d Wow, when did I get to this place? \u201cI want to be around people I care about and who care about me. That\u2019s all I really want in life.\u201d God, I care about Ethan. I really, really do.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a lovely way to look at life. Maybe you should go visit your Aunt Jennabelle and get a real taste of what life is like,\u201d she says, and then adds, \u201cAnd what on earth is that noise? That water noise in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater.\u201d I put the plate in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know that,\u201d she snaps. \u201cBut what\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>I turn off the faucet and close the dishwasher door. \u201cIt\u2019s from the sink.\u201d I press the power button and wipe off my hands on a towel. \u201cI just got done doing the dishes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou what?\u201d she shouts into the phone so loudly my ear rings. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Lila. This kind of behavior is unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m cleaning up after myself?\u201d I walk into the living room and flop down on the couch. I have some vanilla-scented candles burning and the whole house has a shiny, polished look to it. It looks good and I hope Ethan will appreciate it when he gets back from work.</p><p>\u201cSummers\u2019s do not clean up after themselves,\u201d she snaps. \u201cThey hire maids for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since I\u2019m broke, a maid really isn\u2019t an option.\u201d I sit back in the chair and comb my fingers through my hair. It\u2019s still long and perfectly trimmed just like I was taught to maintain it. \u201cGod, with the way you\u2019re acting, you\u2019d think I\u2019d just told you I did drugs or something.\u201d</p><p>She laughs into the phone. \u201cQuit being a little bitch and be grateful for everything I\u2019ve done and given to you. Without me, you\u2019d be worse off than you are now. And that\u2019s going to end quickly because I\u2019m coming down to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck finding me,\u201d I say, inspecting my split ends. I should really just cut my hair off, like I wanted to when I was a kid. \u201cVegas is a very big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d she cries. \u201cYou\u2019re being rude and inconsiderate. I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get any of this, like why you\u2019re even living in Vegas in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was the first place I pointed to on the map,\u201d I mutter to myself, remembering how I got here.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she seethes hotly. \u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to,\u201d she snaps. \u201cIf you\u2019d just listen to me then you\u2019d quit messing up your life. Being with a guy because he cares about you is going to get you nowhere, especially if he\u2019s some low-life like the guys your sister dates. He\u2019ll end up screwing you over and then you\u2019ll be left alone, probably pregnant and poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, so quit being overdramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. You wait and see. You\u2019ll get pregnant and guys like that won\u2019t take care of you. And I sure as hell won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your help,\u201d I tell her, fuming with aggravation. \u201cI want to be right where I am, living with Ethan. I don\u2019t want to be with anyone else. Ever.\u201d Wow, this conversation with my mom is getting productive in a very scary, life-altering way.</p><p>\u201cYou are really starting to piss me off,\u201d my mother says sharply.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re pissing me off.\u201d I hang up, tossing the phone onto the coffee table. I feel so strange. So light, even after talking to her because of what the conversation revealed. I want to be here. With Ethan. And I don\u2019t ever want to leave, at least as far as I can see into the future.</p><p>\u201cI want to do something exciting,\u201d I mumble to myself, coiling a finger around my long blonde hair. It\u2019s the same haircut I\u2019ve had for years and I\u2019ve never dyed my hair, yet I\u2019ve always wanted to. \u201cI want a change.\u201d</p><p>Change. I want to change who I am. I want to be better. I want to be a person who I can love, not hate and despise. Smiling, I get up and grab my purse off the table, and then I head out the door, knowing I\u2019m going to have to take the bus, but it feels okay today and that in and of itself is another change. I wonder how many more are to come.</p><p>I\u2019m really starting to walk on the wild side, well the wild side for me. I got my haircut at a discount hair salon and not just a trim or anything. I cut it off so it\u2019s shoulder length and I added black streaks to it. I\u2019d always gotten pretty much the same haircut, always at this expensive, appointment-only place down in the main area of the city. Turns out discount places aren\u2019t that bad. Shelia, the lady who cut my hair, was really nice. She told me how she ended up cutting hair, how she\u2019d been going to school to be a lawyer because her parents wanted her to. But when she was sitting in class one day, listening to her professor ramble on and on about the law, she realized how much she could care less about law and that really she\u2019d rather be breaking some laws instead of learning about them. She left class, traded her nearly new car in for a motorcycle, and drove across the country. Just like that. Then when she got back she decided to try beauty school, simply because it was the first place she came across when she entered town. Her parents never forgave her for messing up what they deemed a perfect life, but she didn\u2019t care. She was happy. Still is. And that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>I loved her story and it gave me hope that one day I\u2019ll figure out what I want. Although, I do know one thing that I want. My very sexy roommate/drummer/savior. Although, he\u2019ll never admit it, Ethan saved me. Many, many times. If I could just have him now, then life would be good. Because I want him. Want him. I really, really do.</p><p>After my head fills like it\u2019s going to burst from overthinking, I decide to call Ella to distract myself and to maybe get some girl advice with my guy problems.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Ella says, answering after a few rings. \u201cI was actually getting ready to call you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I stare out the bus window at the street, the smell of fast food from the takeout bag on my lap overwhelming me. \u201cMaybe you read my mind, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She pauses. \u201cOkay, I was trying to figure out how to ask you, since every time I\u2019ve ever brought you and Ethan up, you always deny there\u2019s anything going on, but I\u2019m just going to be blunt. Are you living with him? Because Micha said you were.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUmm...\u201d I let out a breath, unsure why it\u2019s always been so hard for me to talk about my relationship with Ethan aloud. \u201cYeah, I have been for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she asks with a hint of humor in her tone. \u201cAre you... are you two together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot together like that,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t tell you because the reason I moved in with him isn\u2019t the kind of stuff I\u2019m used to talking about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I still wish you would have at least given me a heads-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeads-up?\u201d I reply in a teasing tone and she laughs. \u201cI am really sorry. The next huge news I have is yours first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She clears her throat, sounding nervous. \u201cAnd now I have news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you pregnant?\u201d I sit up straight in the seat, trying not to laugh at my joke.</p><p>\u201cWhat! No!\u201d She gives me an elongated pause. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I think that? You and Micha are always going at it, even when you\u2019re not together. The walls were very thin in our apartment and those late-night chats you two had while he was on the road were very, very loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she says, mortified. \u201cYou should have said something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Quit having such loud phone sex with your boyfriend.\u201d I laugh and then lean closer to the wall, shielding out the sunlight with my hand. \u201cBut anyway, what\u2019s your big news?\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep inhale. \u201cMicha and I are getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know... but in, like, a week.\u201d</p> <p>My jaw drops as my hand falls to my lap. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not pregnant?\u201d Now I\u2019m being a little bit serious.</p><p>\u201cQuit saying that. You\u2019re scaring the shit out of me.\u201d She steadies her anxious breath. \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant. We just wanted to get married and figured why the hell not, since we\u2019re already living together. We\u2019ve practically been living together since we were four.\u201d</p><p>I smile, because even though I\u2019m jealous, they are cute enough that the jealousy is worth it. \u201cDid Micha give you that speech?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. It always is with him,\u201d I say, coiling a strand of my much shorter hair around my finger. I pause, because even though I\u2019ve been a cheerleader over their relationship from the start, as a best friend, I still have to make sure. \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it really is.\u201d She sounds so happy and the jealousy in my chest builds.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll get over there,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I have to point out that I really hate California, so my going there means I really must love you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a while and with Ella, that means she\u2019s really thinking. \u201cLila, thank you,\u201d she finally says. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, whatever. I didn\u2019t even do anything really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you kind of did,\u201d she insists. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your little pushes, telling me that I\u2019d be giving up the kind of love that shouldn\u2019t exist\u2014letting me know how lucky I am\u2014then I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be where I am, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be getting ready to marry the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true,\u201d I say. \u201cThings still could have worked out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, but maybe... maybe I would have finally come to my senses on my own and quit fighting the need to make myself miserable.\u201d She sounds like she\u2019s getting choked up, which is strange for her. She pauses and then clears her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re coming, though, right? And you\u2019ll be my maid of honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve actually always wanted to be one.\u201d I pause, contemplating whether I should ask, since her family is such a serious subject for her. \u201cElla, who else is coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your dad?\u201d</p><p>She hesitates. \u201cI know things have been going pretty good between my dad and me and even my brother, but this is kind of something I want to be simple. Just me and Micha and you and Ethan, of course. Then there won\u2019t be any drama.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, sad that that\u2019s how she feels. But then again, if I ever did get married, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want my family there either because they\u2019d probably ruin it for me, especially if the groom wasn\u2019t up to their standards. \u201cWell, I\u2019m totally coming, but you\u2019ll have to ask Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days ago,\u201d she says hesitantly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m kind of hurt. Why did he not mention this to me? \u201cOkay, then I guess I\u2019m going.\u201d Usually, I\u2019m good at sounding happy when I\u2019m not, but the hurt shows through in my voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks. \u201cI mean, with Ethan... is everything okay between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I not be okay?\u201d I stand up from the seat as the bus reaches my stop, growing nervous over the idea that Ethan said something about us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... because you two have a weird relationship.\u201d</p><p>I grab the handle as the bus lurches to a stop. \u201cDid Ethan say that to Micha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sounds like she\u2019s lying.</p><p>\u201cElla, please just tell me if he said anything.\u201d I step off the bus and onto the curb feeling very insecure.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lila, just relax,\u201d she says and then I hear someone shout in the background. \u201cLook, I got to go. Call me later after you\u2019ve talked to Ethan and let me know when you\u2019ll get here and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I look left and right and hurry across the street toward my apartment. \u201cWait for me to shop for your dress, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will, but I\u2019m telling you right now,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I won\u2019t in any way shape or form be wearing a frilly white dress. It needs to be rock-star-ish or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll find you something very Ella-like.\u201d I step onto the sidewalk and enter the apartment complex entryway that\u2019s situated between a broken fence and a desolate section of sandy land. The sun is setting so the air isn\u2019t nearly as hot as midday, yet it\u2019s still blistering and I\u2019m starting to sweat. \u201cI\u2019m an excellent shopper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bye.\u201d I hang up and seconds later I realize that I never got around to the reason why I called her.</p><p>Sighing, I take the house key out of my pocket, frustrated at myself because I really could use some girl advice about Ethan and what I should do and she probably would have given it if I\u2019d just been brave enough to ask her, but my initial instincts to keep my mouth shut got the best of me. Although, I remember in high school how far girl advice got me. Just sleep with him. It\u2019ll feel good and he\u2019ll be less likely to break up with you. Sex means commitment. Sex means you\u2019re older. Sex. Sex. Sex. I\u2019m not even sure if they were ever really being sincere or if they were just toying with me.</p><p>When I enter the apartment, Ethan\u2019s still not back from work. I settle down on the couch, with the takeout bag in front of me on the coffee table, trying not to think too much about the past, otherwise I know where I\u2019ll end up heading\u2014what I\u2019ll end up doing. I turn on some of Ethan\u2019s music, which I\u2019m still getting used to, feeling nervous for some reason, like I can feel that I\u2019m about to do or say something really stupid. Because I\u2019m seriously considering telling him that I like like him. It\u2019s time to be bold and blunt. It\u2019s time to let him know how I feel. That I like him. I might even love him. My eyes widen as I realize that I might really do it and then double widen as I run my fingers through my now-chin-length hair that\u2019s even shorter in the back. And as if that wasn\u2019t a big enough change, I had black streaks put in.</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d I whisper. I really don\u2019t know anymore. A girl who chops off her own hair? Feels things for Ethan? A girl who wants to tell Ethan about her feelings? And that is very, very scary.</p><p>I\u2019m deciding what I should do, run away or stay put and face my fears, finally be brave, when someone knocks on the door. I get up and open the door, then swiftly step back. \u201cParker?\u201d</p><p>He looks me over and his face twists with disgust when he notes my new hair. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to you hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it.\u201d I shrug, praying to God he\u2019s not here for the pills, even though deep down I know there\u2019s no way that could be true. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a navy-blue polo shirt, slacks, and a Rolex. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you\u2019re surprised to see me.\u201d His tone is sharp, his posture very rigid and threatening.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m very aware that I\u2019m alone in the apartment. \u201cHow did you know where I live?\u201d I ask, gripping the doorknob tightly.</p><p>\u201cI asked around.\u201d He takes a deliberate step toward me, inching his way into the doorway. \u201cYou fucking stole from my stash, Lila. My fucking stash. Now I know you\u2019re used to getting your way with me, but not with this. This is business.\u201d</p><p>I step back, moving to shut the door, but he slams his hand against it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Parker,\u201d I say, attempting to stay calm, but my palms start to sweat and my heart is beating wildly inside my chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. Really. I was just having a rough day and I messed up.\u201d</p><p>He stalks closer, stepping over the threshold and onto the small section of chipped linoleum in the entryway. \u201cDon\u2019t try to feed me your sob story. You didn\u2019t mean to? Seriously. What?\u201d He starts swinging his hands animatedly as he speaks and it makes me wince. \u201cYou just accidentally opened the bottle hidden in my nightstand drawer and then accidentally poured a pill into your hand. I checked after you left, Lila, and there was a pill missing. And you know I keep track of that shit. You\u2019ve seen me count them after I make a deal. Although, I\u2019m a little surprised you took only one, seeing as how I\u2019ve seen you pop four at a time without even hesitating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaking my head, I stumble back into the living room and inch around the coffee table, knowing I\u2019m in serious trouble. \u201cLook, what do you want me to say? I\u2019m sorry, okay? I messed up. But I can\u2019t bring the pill back. I can pay for it, though.\u201d I reach for my wallet that\u2019s next to the television.</p><p>He laughs darkly, walking all the way into the apartment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay me for that fucking pill, Lila,\u201d he says, shutting the door with his foot, keeping his eyes fixed on me. \u201cBut not with money. You know I don\u2019t except cash for pills.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the hallway, contemplating running into the bathroom and locking myself in there. This is bad. Very, very bad. I can feel that something bad is about to happen and I\u2019m not sure how to get out of it.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d he says and then unzips his pants. \u201cNow, you can either fuck me or suck my dick, but either way I\u2019m going to get something out of this. I\u2019m not just going to let you steal a pill from me and get away with it. You know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I do,\u201d I say, my voice unsteady as I search around the room for my phone. Where did I leave it?</p><p>This evil ugly monster is about to come out of him. I know because I\u2019ve seen it with every other guy out there. Try not to give them anything and they\u2019ll break you. Give them what they want and they\u2019ll take everything you have and then they\u2019ll leave you in the dirt.</p><p>I press my lips together, feeling a slight tremor inside my heart, but deep down I know I can probably do this if I need to. Just screw him and get it over with. I\u2019ve done it before, but that was when I felt nothing. But right now it feels worse than wrong. It feels icky and twisted and warped. I\u2019m scared, just like I was when Sean tied me to the bed, ropes around my ankles, wrists, even my stomach. I didn\u2019t want to do it. I even told him that. Once. But once wasn\u2019t enough and he took what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2014\u201d I start, my hip bumping into the corner of the television stand as I try to back away more.</p> <p>Parker hurries forward, his fly undone and before I can move he grabs a handful of my hair, wrenching on the roots so hard my scalp stings. \u201cGet down on your fucking knees and be the whore that you and I and every other guy out there knows that you are.\u201d</p><p>I raise my hand to slap him, but he catches me by the wrist, jabbing his fingers into my skin as he slaps me across my face. Tears sting at my eyes and my ears ring as he shoves me down onto the floor, pressing on my shoulders until I\u2019m kneeling at his feet. I whimper pathetically as the rough carpet scrapes against my knees and my neck bends in an awkward position. \u201cStop it, Parker... You\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cupping the back of my head, and still grasping violently on to my hair, he shoves my face toward his open fly. \u201cOpen your mouth and be the whore that you are.\u201d</p><p>I remember when I was dating Parker I never felt a single speck of emotion. My mind and body were blank, just like almost every other single sexual encounter. I want the blankness right now\u2014crave it. But it\u2019s not coming. The switch that flips is staying stubbornly in place. I can feel the shame, terror, and embarrassment way too much. I start to cry because this is real. I\u2019m not drunk or on pills and I don\u2019t want to do anything with Parker, like I really didn\u2019t want to with Sean. I was just too afraid to admit it and worried that if I walked away he wouldn\u2019t love me. And I wanted\u2014want\u2014to be loved for once in my life.</p><p>But I never said no. All these years and not once did I refuse anyone who wanted me. I worried that no guy would ever listen to me, and really, I just didn\u2019t think I was good enough to say no. In a sickening and perverse way, I\u2019ve never felt good enough for anyone. So I just popped pills and did things I thought other people wanted me to do and waited for them to accept me, to love me, yet they never did. I thought Sean loved me, but he hurt me and now I\u2019m scarred inside and out. I\u2019m scarred and I don\u2019t want to be. I want to feel like a whole person again. I want to go back to being fourteen and not make stupid choices, not have sex with an older guy who ties me to the bed after I say I don\u2019t think I want to, that I don\u2019t think I can, and then he screws me so hard the ropes cut into my skin and I bleed all over the bed. Then I\u2019m left feeling guilty because I let it get that far and I\u2019ll always feel like I didn\u2019t put up enough of a fight. But I was lost. Confused.</p><p>A painful wave rushes over me as my past slams down on my shoulders. I don\u2019t want to be this girl anymore. This lonely, hollow girl. I want to feel like I deserve things and not hate myself so much. I\u2019m deciding whether to open my mouth and scream or just bite down really hard when the door opens and Ethan walks in, carrying his tool belt.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d I say with relief and realize I\u2019m trembling.</p><p>Parker turns around and looks over his shoulder, and then his fingers immediately leave my hair and I fall to the ground on my ass, cupping the side of my face that he struck me on.</p><p>\u201cDude, she wanted it,\u201d he tells Ethan with his hands up in front of him.</p><p>I get to my feet, clutching my tender cheek as Ethan assesses the situation, taking in Parker with his pants undone, then me and my swollen cheek, before his eyes land back on Parker. He\u2019s still dressed in his work clothes, torn cargo shorts, a black shirt stained with dirt, and he has his work boots on. He looks all bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who kicks people like Parker\u2019s ass just for fun. And I love it.</p><p>\u201cIs that true, Lila?\u201d Ethan glances at me, slowly taking the hammer out of his belt like he\u2019s going to use it to beat Parker. I can tell he\u2019s not going to, nor does he think what Parker said is true, but he\u2019s messing with Parker\u2019s head. \u201cDid you want this loser to unzip his pants and force you down onto your knees?\u201d</p><p>Parker cringes, eyeing the hammer as Ethan holds it in his hand, but he doesn\u2019t say a word, inching back against the wall, trying to creep toward the doorway.</p><p>I wipe the drying tears from my eyes and swollen cheek as I shake my head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want it at all.\u201d There\u2019s this strange kind of freedom in saying it, like this secret I\u2019ve kept hidden drifts out into the open, even if I\u2019m the only one who understands.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a liar and a slut,\u201d Parker argues, glaring at me, and then his gaze returns unsteadily back to Ethan. \u201cCome on, man. You know her, so you must know what she\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan shakes his head as he tosses his tool belt onto the couch, keeping ahold of the hammer and tapping it in his hand. \u201cThe Lila I know isn\u2019t a slut.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s eyes widen, and then he crosses his arms. \u201cWell, the one I do is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s too bad for you.\u201d Ethan chucks his keys onto the table, but doesn\u2019t budge from the doorway.</p><p>I love Ethan. I seriously do. I feel the brave side of myself emerging and I take a small step forward. \u201cParker, as much as I would love to stand around here looking at your small penis, I\u2019m sure Ethan doesn\u2019t, so please zip up your pants.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drops to his slacks and he quickly tucks himself in, then zips up the zipper. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he says, raking his fingers through his hair, attempting to tidy himself up. \u201cI\u2019m just going to leave. You two can go to hell.\u201d He moves to the right to step around Ethan, but Ethan matches his move and blocks the doorway and his path.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fucking leaving this house until Lila says what to do with you.\u201d He looks at me with intensity burning in his eyes as he places his hands on the door frame. \u201cDo you want me to beat the shit out of him or call the cops?\u201d He raises the hammer in Parker\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Parker says, but he doesn\u2019t dare move. It\u2019s clear how easily Ethan could kick Parker\u2019s ass, even without the hammer. He\u2019s taller, stronger, rougher, and way, way more intense looking, like he\u2019s been through things, which he has. He\u2019s been beat by his father and watched his father hit his mother, while he tried to stand up for her. He\u2019s real. And I want real, not the deception of it that sometimes comes with wealth and money. I\u2019m not going to sacrifice my life like my mother did just so I can have nice clothes and a roof over my head. I like the cracked one that\u2019s over my head now perfectly fine.</p><p>I unintentionally smile, especially when Parker makes this weird noise that sounds like a strangled cat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I want you to do.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shrugs and then winks at me. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I can only imagine how broad my smile is at this moment because I\u2019ve never had this\u2014protection. I\u2019ve never had someone in my life who would stand up for me and tell me that it was okay, that people make mistakes and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to suffer eternally for them. I look over at Parker, who\u2019s waiting expectantly for me to chime in and save his ass. I study him forever, until he squirms and looks like he\u2019s about ready to piss his pants.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d he says, his eyes pressing. \u201cHelp me out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask, folding my arms over my chest. \u201cYou seemed tough enough to handle yourself a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>He glances at the hammer in Ethan\u2019s hand, and then frowns back at me. \u201cLila,\u201d he pleads. \u201cYou know I hate fighting.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a girl, right?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrow at my divulgence. \u201cGod damn it, Lila, I swear to fucking God...\u201d He trails off, his jaw tightening as Ethan steps forward, patting the head of the hammer in his hand again.</p><p>I shake my head and sigh, knowing I\u2019m not really going to let Ethan kick Parker\u2019s ass, but only for Ethan\u2019s sake. Parker\u2019s the kind of guy who would either try to sue and press charges or come back with a group of his friends and have them all beat Ethan up. And if I call the cops, Parker\u2019s daddy will probably just get him out, since he\u2019s a lawyer. \u201cFine. Whatever. Ethan just let him go.\u201d</p><p>Ethan doesn\u2019t budge. His eyes are locked on me, and his arm snaps up to the side when Parker tries to head toward the door. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod, hugging my arms around myself. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan firmly holds my gaze as he steps to the side of the door and toward the couch, leaving a tiny bit of space for Parker to squeeze through. \u201cFine, but I\u2019m letting you walk out of here bruise free only because of her.\u201d He nods his head in my direction as he glares at Parker.</p><p>Parker narrows his eyes at Ethan but doesn\u2019t say anything as he turns sideways and squeezes between Ethan and the doorway. Every muscle in Ethan\u2019s body tenses, his knuckles whitening as he tightly grips the handle of the hammer, and I can tell it\u2019s really hard for him to let Parker walk out of here.</p> <p>When Parker steps outside, he pretty much takes off running, and Ethan kicks the door shut hard, like he\u2019s locking out the bad by doing it. He turns around and faces me, tossing the hammer aside, then leans back against it with his arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cSo what really happened?\u201d He studies me intently, taking in every square inch of my body, and it makes my skin ignite. His gaze lingers on my cheek and I know he\u2019s wondering: Did he hit you? It makes my skin even hotter, because I can see in his eyes that he cares.</p><p>It\u2019s a minor sensation, the slightest bit of heat in all the right places, but it\u2019s enough to make me notice the difference between the way I feel around Ethan and the way I felt with Parker. Around Parker my skin was chilled like ice, basically numb. It\u2019s the sensation that I\u2019ve felt with most of the guys I remember hooking up with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long, stupid story like most of my life is.\u201d I sink down on the edge of the coffee table and place my hands on my lap, focusing on them instead of Ethan because I do feel ashamed of what just happened\u2014what he just saw\u2014because it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been in that kind of a situation and it\u2019s my own fault it happened. \u201cHe came to collect my debt for the pill I stole. I said I\u2019d pay him, but since I\u2019d promised at his house that I\u2019d fuck him for one, that\u2019s the payment he wanted. So he... well, what you saw.\u201d</p><p>The muscles of his arms flex and his jaw is taut. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p> <p>I shrug, examining my fingernails, once again feeling like he\u2019s seeing the real, rare sight of me that I\u2019m so used to keeping hidden from people. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything I haven\u2019t had to deal with before. You know that... you know what I\u2019m like.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Ethan walks over in front of me and kneels down, splaying his hand on top of my thighs. His skin is seductively hot, yet comforting. \u201cWould you stop thinking about yourself like that? So you screwed some guys. So fucking what? People have sex and that doesn\u2019t make you a slut. And it sure as hell doesn\u2019t give rich douche bags an excuse to rape you or make you do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have raped me,\u201d I say, with my chin tucked down. \u201cI would have given in before it became rape.\u201d</p><p>He frowns, his face reddening with anger. He huffs out a breath and then cups my face between his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that again. If a girl says no even once then a guy should stop. Hell, if she shows a single sign of not wanting it, the guy should stop. You should never, ever have to have sex with a guy when you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Tell that to the many guys I\u2019ve been with throughout my life. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepens. \u201cLila Summers, where is that perky girl I first met?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think she died at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo bring her back.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, discouraged. \u201cI can\u2019t. She takes too much energy and pills. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure I want to be her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s fine. Be whoever you want to be, but please, please stop thinking so poorly of yourself. You barely even smile anymore and I... I fucking miss it.\u201d He gives me an adorable, lopsided grin. \u201cYou have a very beautiful smile.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure what overtakes me. His words. The bluntly, beautiful, realistic moment. Or if it\u2019s just him. Whatever it is, I quickly lean forward, letting my emotions drive me to him, which is a first for me. I press my lips to his and it\u2019s amazing. Undiluted. And I feel it all, from the way my heart rate accelerates to the swift flow of my blood rushing to my head, the heat of our contact, the soft, wetness of his lips.</p><p>I\u2019ve kissed more guys than I can count, but the emotions freed in this kiss are new because there\u2019s real emotion behind it. Even though I was having a hard time deciphering it earlier, because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve never felt love toward anyone ever, or been on the reciprocating end of it, I realize now what this is.</p><p>Love. I\u2019m completely, one hundred percent, truly in love with Ethan.</p><p>Ethan</p> <p>It took a lot of energy not to slam my fist into Parker\u2019s face. I wanted to really, really badly. I remember a couple of times when I walked in on my dad beating the shit out of my mom. My dad used to be a fairly big guy, with bulky arms and a really thick neck, but he looked so pathetic as he shoved my mom down to the ground and then backhanded her across the face.</p><p>One moment in particular always sticks out in my mind because it was the first day I realized how bad things were between them.</p><p>I\u2019d just gotten home from school, a little earlier than usual, and I let my bag fall to the kitchen floor as I took in the sight of my mom cowering on the ground and my dad raising his hand to slap her. \u201cDad, stop!\u201d I didn\u2019t even think. I just ran up to my mom, ready to protect her.</p><p>\u201cEthan, stop!\u201d she cried back right as my dad swung his arm around without even looking and struck me across the face.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t hit me since I was eight, so it kind of took me off guard a little, although I wasn\u2019t that surprised. That\u2019s the funny thing about being beaten by someone who\u2019s supposed to love you. It\u2019s hard to see how wrong it is, because the idea of love can be blinding. Which is exactly what happened to my mother.</p><p>She got up from the floor and hurried over to me as I cradled my cheek with my hand. \u201cEthan, what are you doing here? School isn\u2019t out yet.\u201d</p><p>I peeked up at her, shooting a glare in my dad\u2019s direction as he rubbed his hand. \u201cSchool got let out early today. I gave you the note on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d There were tears running down her face and her cheek was inflamed. She looked a little lost for a minute and then she patted me on the shoulder. \u201cGo do your homework in your room.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my father, who looked remorseful. He always did, though. It was like he\u2019d get caught up in the heat of the moment and turn into a monster, his eyes glazed over with rage. When it was all over, he was always sorry and kept telling everyone that over and over again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should stay out here with you,\u201d I told my mom, wishing I was big enough that I could actually hurt my dad back for her.</p><p>My mom shook her head and ruffled my hair, like everything was okay. Like none of this was messed up. Like her face wasn\u2019t swelling, or all the kitchen chairs weren\u2019t tipped over, or the veins in my dad\u2019s neck weren\u2019t bulging. \u201cEthan, go to your room and do your homework. Everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat and collected my backpack, swinging it over my shoulder. They both watched me as I headed to the doorway and the entire situation felt wrong. I felt confused, afraid, and terrified, yet I couldn\u2019t figure out why.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder when I reached the doorway, looking back at them. \u201cAre you sure, Mom?\u201d It felt like leaving wasn\u2019t the right thing, yet I couldn\u2019t figure out what else to do.</p><p>\u201cEthan, your mother\u2019s fine,\u201d my father replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really sorry that I accidentally hit you... I didn\u2019t realize you were there.\u201d</p><p>Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Always sorry. I nodded and left the room, locking myself in my bedroom. A few minutes later they started yelling at each other and I cranked up the music to drown them out.</p><p>Walking in on Lila and Parker, I felt the same kind of fear and fury that I did when I was younger. The sight of it\u2014the control he had over her\u2014rammed me hard in the stomach. Yet, unlike when I was a kid, I knew I could kick Parker\u2019s ass. And I wanted to so much I could feel it raging through my bloodstream. I wanted to beat him so hard he couldn\u2019t see straight. A flood of emotions rushed through me and not only was I pissed that he was making a girl do something she obviously didn\u2019t want to do, but he was making my Lila do something she didn\u2019t want to do. And as soon as I saw it\u2014felt it\u2014I knew that whatever I\u2019d been trying to deny was going on between us was obviously something I couldn\u2019t run away from. But I\u2019m worried because the amount of anger in my body matches the amount of anger I\u2019ve seen in my dad\u2019s eyes.</p><p>The rage continues to amplify, burning inside my chest until suddenly and completely unexpectedly, Lila kisses me. And that kiss, the single touch of our lips, the slight elevation of heat in my body, the flood of mixed emotions, erases my anger and changes my life despite the fact that I don\u2019t know if I want it to.</p><p>I don\u2019t react right away, partially from shock and partially because I\u2019m afraid. My mother and father\u2019s turbulent relationship is fresh in my head and so is the fear of turning out like them. This isn\u2019t just about sex. There is so much more to it than that. We have a connection. We have since the day we met. I just refused to feel it, but now it\u2019s forcing its way on me, controlling, owning me\u2014she controls and owns me\u2014which means I\u2019m dependent on her in a lot of ways.</p><p>I\u2019m freaking out, but then she starts to pull away and I realize that I don\u2019t want her to, so I open my mouth and sweep my tongue into hers as I cup the back of her head and bring her back to me, all my worries and fears briefly dissipating.</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ. This is so different from what I\u2019m used to. I\u2019m both curious and terrified to explore it more. But desire and want push me forward and I comb my fingers through her short blonde hair that\u2019s streaked black. \u201cYou changed your hair,\u201d I murmur. \u201cI like it...\u201d I gently tug it back as I explore her mouth further with my tongue, massaging it, caressing it, searching every inch of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes shut tightly. \u201cEthan,\u201d she says, clutching my shoulders, her nails piercing through the fabric of my shirt and into my skin. The roughness of her touch surprises me and adds fuels to my very eager body. Before I even know what I\u2019m doing, I stand up, disconnecting our kiss.</p><p>Her breath falters and her cheeks turn a little pink as she opens her eyes, like she\u2019s embarrassed. Before she can say anything, I grab her by the hips, digging my fingers into her skin, and swiftly pick her up. I\u2019ve never been much of a carrying-a-girl-around kind of guy, but I\u2019m feeling different with her. I want to hold her, hug her, have her so damn close to me that I can\u2019t tell where she starts and I begin. Every inch of my body is blazing, adrenaline spiking as it crashes through my body. I\u2019m light-headed, burning up, wanting her more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anyone. Feelings soar inside me, ones I knew existed but refused to fully feel before. I seal our lips together before any words can be uttered and before I can start analyzing what this is going to mean.</p><p>I kiss her deeply and passionately as I carry her back to my bedroom, feeling my way blindly down the hallway, bumping us into walls and into door frames. I interlace my fingers around the back of her, bearing her weight as she latches on to me by crossing her ankles behind my back. She keeps groaning, her tongue tangling forcefully with mine, sending my body into a spiraling frenzy of yearning, need, and ultimately fear of how much I want to be with her and not London anymore. I want Lila more than anything at the moment. I trip over some stuff on my floor and manage to bang my hip into the one of my drums, and then I finally stumble into the bed. We bounce when we hit the mattress and she laughs against my lips but keeps her eyes shut.</p> <p>I pull back a little and her eyelids flutter open. She looks perplexed and lost, among a thousand other emotions that probably match my own.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, self-consciously. Her legs are still fastened around me and her arms are locked around my neck. \u201cIs something... is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>A thousand things are wrong, I want to say. I\u2019m feeling too much for you, Lila. I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m getting too caught up in you and if I keep going eventually we\u2019ll hate each other. I\u2019ll break you. Ruin you\u2014us. I\u2019ll mess up. But my voice refuses to work and so I kiss her instead. Fiercely. Forcefully. With heat, desire, and hunger suffocating both of us as we drown in each other\u2019s feelings. Our bodies align and press together as I kiss her with all the pent-up energy I\u2019ve been collecting since the first day we met. I\u2019ve lost all control over my actions. Rules don\u2019t exist. The past and the future dissolve and only this moment exists.</p><p>Between deep kisses and throaty moans, I manage to get my filthy work shirt over my head and I toss it on the floor. Her eyes snap open as I lower myself down onto her and she gasps. She traces her fingers up my chest, her fingers shaking, and I realize how nervous she is. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want this. Maybe she\u2019s just doing it because she\u2019s afraid to say no. I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to shut down like the last time we ended up on the bed touching each other.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d I start, conflicted, because if she does reject me, it\u2019s going to hurt. \u201cAre you okay with this? I mean, you... do you want this?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips part and her breath falters as she curves her body into mine, a sea of emotions pouring through her eyes. \u201cI do... but if you... if you don\u2019t want to then you can stop.\u201d She seems to be struggling with words as she gets lost in whatever she\u2019s feeling.</p><p>It\u2019s not the answer I\u2019m expecting. And she looks so fucking nervous, almost like she\u2019s having sex for the first time. I\u2019m not sure what to do, but then she props herself up on her elbows, bringing her mouth to mine, and sucks my bottom lip into her mouth as she closes her eyes, and I feel her entire body shudder beneath me.</p><p>\u201cShit... Lila...\u201d I groan as she grazes her teeth down the inside of my lip. My eyes shut involuntarily as I dip my head down and our lips collide roughly, to the point where I wonder if we\u2019re going to have bruises.</p><p>I move my arms to the sides of her head to support my weight as she keeps pressing her chest against mine, like she\u2019s starved\u2014been starved forever. Our tongues tangle as I slip my knee between her legs, causing her to clutch on to my upper arms. Her fingernails jab into my skin as her body scoots down a little and meets the top of my leg. She starts rubbing against my leg, her eyes glazed and her expression hitting a euphoric state. I lose it completely and shove my hand up the front of her shirt, slipping it beneath her bra. I rub the pad of my thumb over her nipple and it instantly hardens as she whimpers, her entire body quivering as she continues to rub herself against my leg. I\u2019m blown away. I\u2019ve never enjoyed seeing a girl so responsive to my touch, but maybe that\u2019s because how I feel about Lila is very different from how I\u2019ve felt before. It\u2019s different. We\u2019re different. I\u2019m different.</p><p>I keep rubbing her nipple as she grinds against me, her head tipped back, and I know she\u2019s close. So am I. Fuck. Really, really close.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she breathes as I watch her on the verge of falling apart.</p> <p>I give her what she wants and pinch her nipple harder. She groans loudly in response, her entire body rising up as she gasps in ecstasy. I\u2019m on the brink of losing it myself and work hard to stay in control. After a moment of panting, she lies flat beneath me. Her skin is beading with sweat, her expression content, and she\u2019s more beautiful than ever. Her hair is scattered above her head, her skin damp, her breathing ragged.</p><p>\u201cThat was good,\u201d she says and breathes in and out, her chest moving up and down. \u201cGod, that was really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d I try to joke, but my voice comes out breathless in reaction to the fact that I\u2019m hard as hell and it\u2019s actually starting to hurt.</p><p>She shakes her head from side to side. \u201cI can\u2019t even compare it to anything... I\u2019ve never felt anything like it before.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still cupping her breast and I can feel her heart racing and I count each beat to calm myself down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNeither am I and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She leans in to kiss me and her whole body starts trembling before she even reaches my lips.</p><p>I\u2019m worried she might be going into shock or something over what just happened with Parker. I bring my hand out of her bra and cup her cheek. \u201cMaybe we should stop,\u201d I say, searching her eyes for what she\u2019s really thinking.</p><p>Her eyes widen in horror. \u201cOh my God, you don\u2019t want to.\u201d She starts to roll to the side to move away, but I put my arm next to her so she can\u2019t get too far.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d I tell her as she turns her head to look at me. \u201cI want to, Lila... God, I want to so fucking badly. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure you can feel how bad I want to.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks turn a little pink, shocking me again. \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d</p><p>I fight back a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just worried you\u2019re in shock over what happened with Parker and maybe you\u2019re not thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking more clearly than I ever have,\u201d she insists. \u201cI want this. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cuts me off, tracing her fingers up the front of my chest. \u201cYes... God, yes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she says, her voice alarmingly off pitch. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me beg, Ethan. Please. I can\u2019t... I don\u2019t... I never wanted to be with anyone like this before. Ever.\u201d</p><p>I let out a slow, tension-filled breath, fighting the urge to rip her clothes off, needing to be sure where she stands. And where I stand. Where the hell do we stand? \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be a good guy here, Lila, but you\u2019re making it really...\u201d I trail off as her fingers reach the top of my jeans. \u201cReally... really... difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says and then rises up on her elbows and crashes her mouth against mine. Her movement is sloppy and very inexperienced, the kind of kiss that carries doubt. She\u2019s throwing herself out there in front of me, and despite how terrified I am about what this move will mean for us I decide to do the same thing and kiss her back with equal, if not more, desire.</p><p>We kiss until our lips are swollen, until our bodies are covered in sweat, and then I sit up, only so I can take her shirt off and reach around to unclasp her bra. Then I lean back and take in her body. She\u2019s beautiful, amazing and nearly perfect, except for the scars on her stomach. But in a way it almost makes her more perfect, because it shows she\u2019s flawed and real. I just wish I knew where she got them from, wish I understood her better.</p><p>I trace my finger along her scar and she shuts her eyes, looking like it\u2019s hurting her. My hand travels upward to her breast and grazes her nipple and she sucks in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cThis feels so good,\u201d she whispers, breathless as she brings her hands up to my shoulders. Cupping my shoulder blades, she draws me down to her so our chests are pressing together. She inhales and exhales, like she\u2019s savoring the moment and I lean down and kiss her neck, softly at first, but the more excited and breathy she gets the rougher my kisses become. I make a trail of kisses to her breast and then I suck her nipple into my mouth, tracing circles around it with my tongue. She cries out my name and it makes my heart pump with adrenaline. I can\u2019t take it anymore. She\u2019s driving my heart and body crazy. I pull back and kick my shorts and boxers off and to the side, and then I unbutton her shorts and practically rip them to get them off her. I reach for a condom in my nightstand, feeling this new sensation build up inside me.</p><p>I want Lila. Just her. No one else. I want to be with her.</p><p>Seconds later, I slip inside her, knowing that whatever we had before will forever be changed. I know when it\u2019s over she\u2019ll mean more to me than any other girl ever has. The surprising thing is, I really don\u2019t care. In fact, I\u2019m glad.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the fact that I realize I love him or the fact that I\u2019m sober, but every touch, kiss, every time our skin comes into contact, I nearly lose it. I\u2019m on the verge of combusting, feeling as though I\u2019m tumbling into a wonderful, divine, unknown place. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019ve ever had a real orgasm. Probably, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019ve never been coherent enough to fully feel it.</p><p>I can barely breathe and every single one of my nerves is pulsating with dread, desire, and bliss. I\u2019ve never let myself be so exposed before, not since Sean, and even then I didn\u2019t know myself enough to show who I really was. I\u2019m starting to understand myself more, who I am, what I want, what I need. And it all ends with Ethan.</p> <p>I can barely think straight as he pinches and sucks on my nipples, touches me all over, feels me from the inside and the outside, head to toe, bathing kisses all over my body. I don\u2019t know how much more of this I can take before I\u2019m going to explode, and he must feel the same way because suddenly he\u2019s ripping the rest of our clothes off and throwing them onto the floor. When he slips inside me, I scream out his name as heat courses through my body, my insides trembling as he fills me. He starts thrusting inside me and I keep waiting for my mind to shut down, but I don\u2019t want it to and thankfully it never does.</p><p>His muscles are taught, his arms beside my head as he rocks into me and I curve my back inward, bringing myself up to meet him, wanting more, needing more. I swear to God it feels like I can\u2019t get enough as our bodies keep connecting, in tune with each other. The way he watches me every time I gasp in pleasure makes me feel beautiful, not filthy; wanted, not used. I wish it could go on forever, but I also want to reach the end because I feel like I\u2019m going to lose it. As he gives one last hard thrust, I feel myself letting go of everything, the past, the shame, the worry, and it\u2019s so blindingly intense, so overpowering, that I stab my fingernails into his shoulder blades, needing to channel the forceful energy somewhere. I feel his flesh split apart as I hold onto him, knowing I\u2019m letting the rough side of me show through, but for once I just embrace it, embrace who I am. This is who I am.</p><p>He lets out a deep groan, his face contorted with pain and pleasure, and seeing the effect I\u2019m having on him makes me rise higher until I completely lose touch with reality all together. When I finally return to reality, he\u2019s stilled inside me. He\u2019s situated between my legs, his head lowered onto my chest, and I can feel his pulse throbbing inside me.</p><p>He lays motionless forever, breathing against my chest, and the longer it goes on, the more nervous and insecure I get as I wait to see where this is going to go. Will he leave me like Sean did? Should I get up and walk away before he does? I don\u2019t want to. I want to be with him. Forever maybe.</p><p>When he raises his head, I see something in his eyes I\u2019ve never seen in any other guy\u2019s eyes before. Ethan cares about me and he looks just as nervous as I do.</p> <p>\u201cThat was...\u201d He breathes in and out as he brushes my hair away from my damp forehead. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>I nod, because I\u2019m speechless and way too out of breath. He smiles, kisses me delicately on the lips, then slips out of me and rolls onto his back, lying beside me with his arm tucked underneath my neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d He rotates to his side and places a hand on my bare stomach. \u201cAbout the Parker thing?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to the side and take in his firm chest, his damp, heavily inked skin, his dark brown eyes that are actually looking at me instead of through me. \u201cYeah, I really am, I think... You made me feel better. Much, much better.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, seeming nervous, and I\u2019m trying not to think about how having sex is going to change our relationship. It could end up ugly. Or beautiful. Although, I\u2019d love to be optimistic, all I\u2019ve ever seen is ugly, with my mom and dad, with every guy I\u2019ve met. There is only one exception to this and that would be with Micha and Ella. I want what they have, but is it possible for someone like me to have such a beautiful, pure love?</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking about?\u201d he whispers as he affectionately combs his fingers through my hair.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen between us?\u201d I ask honestly and he presses down on my wrist, feeling my pulse, and right beneath his fingertips is one of my scars.</p><p>He pauses, searching my eyes, for what I\u2019m not sure. \u201cWhat do you want to happen between us?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, reluctant to put myself out there, fearing I\u2019ll be rejected. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>He inhales slowly and then lets the breath ease out of his lips. \u201cYou know about my parents. How they were, right? I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve told me stories. Honestly, they sound a lot like my parents. My dad might not hit my mom, but he cheats on her and yells at her all the time.\u201d</p><p>He shuts his eyes, breathing in before opening them again. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to turn out like either one of them... I love being with you, even when you\u2019re being a pain in the ass.\u201d He tries for a light tone, but fails. \u201cWhat if a relationship ruins what we have? What if we ruin each other?\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens and I\u2019m finding it hard to breathe. It seems like my scar on my stomach is getting more distinct and I wonder if he can see it more clearly. \u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t? What if...\u201d Jesus, breathe, Lila. \u201cWhat if we end up having something really good, like what Ella and Micha have?\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together. \u201cBut what if it does ruin us? Then what? We just walk away from each other? I sure as hell don\u2019t want you out of my life. And I... I worry about you. The stuff you\u2019ve been going through... It\u2019s still so new and relationships can be very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Tears sting at my eyes as the feeling of being rejected builds inside me. I could stand by and just let it come like I did the last time, but unlike Sean, Ethan seems like he\u2019s worth fighting for. \u201cI don\u2019t want how I\u2019m feeling to go away.\u201d His lips part, about to say something, but I interrupt him, deciding that it\u2019s time to let him know who I really am on the inside, without the pills, the shots of Bacardi, without the makeup and fancy clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fourteen and I went off to boarding school, I met this guy,\u201d I begin, summoning every speck of courage I\u2019ve kept locked inside me. \u201cActually, I kind of made us meet. I was feeling really lonely and this group of girls\u2014the Precious Bells\u201d\u2014I roll my eyes at how ridiculous it sounds\u2014\u201csaid they would be my friend if I hit on one of these older rich guys who liked to hang out at the library for some reason.\u201d I can feel the ring on my finger weighing a hundred pounds. The ring Sean gave to me, telling me he loved me, whispering a false promise of loving me forever. Suddenly, I don\u2019t want it on my finger, branding me and what we did together. I don\u2019t want to remember his love anymore. Or him. Who I was with him. I want to move on, become a different person\u2014a stronger person\u2014so I slip it off and toss it onto the nightstand next to me.</p><p>Ethan watches me with curiosity, trailing his fingers back and forth across my stomach. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, returning my wrist to his hand, and continue with my story. \u201cI hit on him and he seemed to be interested. At first, things moved really slow, a few text and e-mails, but then we finally met up and everything changed. We kissed and for the first time in my life... I felt loved.\u201d I pause, catching my breath. Ethan looks like he wants to say something, his forehead furrowed as he swallows hard but I keep going because I need to get it all out. \u201cAnyway, to make a long story short, I was really stupid and pretty much would do anything he told me to do because I thought he loved me.\u201d I pause. \u201cThe first and only time we had sex\u201d\u2014I bring my free wrist up, the scar on it matching the one on my other wrist\u2014\u201che tied me to the bed with ropes, even though I wasn\u2019t really into it.\u201d I nod at my stomach and he follows my gaze to the faded scar traveling across the bottom section of my stomach. \u201cAnd then... well, I\u2019m pretty sure you can probably figure out what happened next.\u201d</p><p>His skin turns white as he stares at the scars on my stomach and then his gaze returns to mine. \u201cThose are from the ropes because some fucking guy tied you to a bed?\u201d</p><p>I nod and then shrug. \u201cIt was my own damn fault. I told him no once, but he said it\u2019d be okay, so I believed him and went through with it.\u201d Tears burn at my eyes as I remember how confused I felt, how lost, how disgusting and yet at the same time loved I felt. \u201cAnd it kind of felt good at first, but then when he...\u201d I breathe out, letting the words rush out. \u201cWell, he got really rough with me and I was too afraid to ask him to stop, too afraid I\u2019d lose his love.\u201d I suck back the tears, forcing myself not to show the shame I feel on the inside. Keep it trapped. \u201cAfterward, he left me and I never saw him again. I guess his girlfriend, who I didn\u2019t even know about, found out about me but honestly I\u2019m pretty sure he was done with me... I could see it in his eyes when he finished fucking me that he was done.\u201d I pause, taking a deep breath. \u201cWhat made it worse was that everyone found out about it and told me that I was a slut.\u201d I give Ethan a moment, because he looks like he\u2019s about to freak out. \u201cI should stop, right? This is too much.\u201d I start to sit up, ready to go and give him some breathing room from my slutishness and depressing story.</p><p>\u201cHow old was he?\u201d he asks through gritted teeth as he gently pushes me back down on the bed. \u201cThis guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d I say and feel him cringe. \u201cAnyway, it was a long time ago and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s completely forgotten about me at this point. I\u2019m just trying to tell you why I am the way I am. I\u2019ve spent the last six years popping pills and having sex with random guys because I seriously feel like I don\u2019t deserve anything better.\u201d I\u2019m about to cry and I hate myself for it. I feel so ugly right now, but Ethan deserves to know who I am, what he\u2019s going to get into if he chooses to be with me. \u201cI\u2019m fucked up, Ethan. I never feel loved, yet I always keep looking for it, hoping that somehow it really exists.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watches me for an eternity. \u201cThe guy who was twenty-two was fucked up. He should have never been with you, let alone tied you to a bed your first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI instigated our relationship... It wasn\u2019t entirely his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who instigated it. You were fourteen and didn\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes, more than anything to keep the tears from escaping, because he\u2019s saying everything I wished my mother would have said when I told her, but instead she told me it was my fault and made me feel more like the whore everyone was telling me I was. \u201cI didn\u2019t put up very much of a fight when he was tying me up.\u201d</p><p>He scoots closer, placing a hand on top of my rib cage, just below my breast. \u201cLila, everything about that story was wrong on the guy\u2019s part. He was way too old to be messing around with a fourteen-year-old. It\u2019s disturbing and wrong and illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t think so,\u201d I say, speaking more to the ceiling than to Ethan, my eyes locked on a crack running from the top of the wall to the fan in the middle. My vision is still blurred with tears, but thankfully no more are forcing their way up. \u201cShe said that she expected nothing less from me and then she handed me a pill so I wouldn\u2019t have to feel all the guilt and shame I\u2019d been feeling.\u201d</p><p>He rolls to his side, putting his body above me, so his face is directly in my line of vision. \u201cAre you being fucking serious right now?\u201d Anger flashes in his eyes. \u201cYour mother\u2019s the one who got you started on those pills?\u201d</p><p>I nod, startled by the fury in his eyes. \u201cSh-She thought she was making me feel better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Ethan says, shaking his head. \u201cLila, seriously. That\u2019s not normal at all. God, I hate this. I hate how parents are supposed to be the adults, and yet they act like children and bring their children down with them. It happens all the time and it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what to do, all I know is now I\u2019m worried he\u2019s going to leave me because of how fucked up my family is. \u201cI... it was my own fault for taking it.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head resolutely as he cups my face and grazes his thumb across my cheekbone, staring intensely into my eyes. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. None of what happened was your fault.\u201d He stares at me for an eternity and I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking, whether he\u2019s going to leave me, what he\u2019s going to say. Then he slides his hand down my shoulder, rests it on my side, and he pulls me against him as he turns, hugging me against him, our bodies pressed together. And it feels so amazing, just to be hugged, to know that someone cares about me, that he\u2019s not going to run away and leave me.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve so much better than what you have,\u201d he whispers against my head. \u201cYou really do.\u201d</p><p>A few tears fall from my eyes, not just over my mother or what Sean did to me, or even how I spent the last six years of my life. I cry because Ethan\u2019s holding on to me and for the first time in my entire life, I feel like someone wants to hold me just as much as I want to hold on to them.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>Ethan</p><p>I would have never guessed. Looking at Lila, I\u2019d always seen a beautiful girl, one who I thought had been spoiled most of her life. She seemed to always get what she wanted and did whatever she wanted. There were a few brief moments when I saw sadness in her eyes, but I never, ever thought it would be from something as dark as what she told me.</p><p>I hate her mother for starting her addiction to pills and I really, really fucking hate the perverted bastard who started this mess. I have a lot of hate floating around inside of me. It worries me, because my father has hate in him, too, and it nearly cracked my mom. But the moment Lila and I kissed I knew it was going to be very hard to let her go. And when we had sex, I knew I was done for. But what really did me in was when she told me her story, when I saw the pain in her eyes, the fear of being unloved and unwanted. Right then, I knew I wanted to take all that pain away from her. I think I can finally understand what Micha was always ranting about whenever I\u2019d question his refusal to let Ella go, despite her problems. And I think that\u2019s because I\u2019m falling in love with Lila. Really falling in love.</p><p>There\u2019s one thing I need to do, though, before I move forward with her. I need to see London, not to try to bring her back or hold on to her, but to say good-bye like I never did so I can finally move on. I\u2019ve been clutching on to the idea of her for years now, over my guilt of walking away and the sheer fact that I wanted her, broke my rules for her, but never did fully understand her, no matter how hard I tried. I\u2019m ready now, though, to say good-bye to London completely and Rae. Ready to move forward in my life instead of being stuck. And move forward with Lila.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be booking a flight to San Diego for Ella and Micha\u2019s wedding, but as I\u2019m searching for flights I change the destination from California to Virginia. I search through the flights, feeling a lump form in my throat and it only grows when I click one of the cheaper flights.</p><p>I\u2019m seriously going to do this. I\u2019m going to let go.</p><p>And hopefully move on with Lila.</p><p>Lila</p> <p>It\u2019s time to say good-bye to the ring. I haven\u2019t put it on since I took it off while laying with Ethan and I haven\u2019t wanted to. Now I want it gone. Forever.</p><p>I decide to go to the nearest pawn shop, which is in walking distance from the apartment. I walk into the run-down brick store pretty much shaking at the idea of setting it down on the counter, not because I am afraid but because I am so excited to be letting go of it and everything that it represents.</p><p>I have my hair down, barely touching my shoulders, and a tank top and frayed shorts on. I look so much different than the girl the ring was given to, and not just because I\u2019m older but because I\u2019m stronger. I\u2019m not some girl searching for love in all the wrong places. I\u2019m a girl who found love in the right place.</p><p>I set the ring down on the glass counter, my fingers trembling, the cashier guy looks at me like I am a crack addict, but it is okay because I am getting rid of the damn ring.</p><p>\u201cHow much can you give me for this?\u201d I ask, wiping my sweaty palm on the side of my shorts.</p><p>He picks it up and scans it over, pretending to only be half interested. Honestly, I probably would accept a dollar, even though I need the money, because it would mean the ring is gone from my life. Luckily, though, he gives me enough that I could afford part of the rent, food, and a plane ticket to San Diego.</p><p>I tuck the cash into my pocket, smiling as I head for the door. When I step out into the sunlight, my smile only broadens and it\u2019s the realest smile I\u2019ve ever had because finally I\u2019m free from my past.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I return home from work the afternoon Lila and I are supposed to be flying out to San Diego prepared to tell Lila about who London really is and that I\u2019m going to fly to Virginia before I head to California to see her. Normally in these kinds of situations, I\u2019d just pack up my shit and go. I\u2019m not used to telling anyone what I\u2019m doing, but bailing out on Lila isn\u2019t an option. I don\u2019t want to hurt her, and I want her to understand and be okay with it and for her to know that I want to be with her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lila says when I walk into her room, all sweaty from the heat of the desert sun beating down on me all day. She has her suitcase opened up on her bed and she\u2019s folding clothes and putting them into it. Her hair is pulled up and she\u2019s got a thin tank top on that hugs her curves and for a moment I just stare at her, mesmerized by how beautiful she is. \u201cYou should go shower and pack your clothes. Our flight leaves in, like, five hours.\u201d</p><p>I walk up to the foot of the bed, watching her move back and forth. She\u2019s gorgeous and still so sad, but the sadness disappears every time I hold her, kiss her. It\u2019s been a long damn time since I\u2019ve spent so much time with the same girl, or with anyone really, and it\u2019s nice, new, and uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d I say cautiously. Panic immediately floods her eyes as she looks up at me and I quickly take her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s actually good I think. But you\u2019re going to have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sounds very distrustful but sits with me as I guide us to the bed, our fingers threaded together. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI never booked the ticket to San Diego like I told you I did.\u201d</p><p>Her expression falls. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d She pauses, looking uncomfortable. \u201cWas it because you couldn\u2019t afford it? Because I still have some extra money from some of the jewelry I sold off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I have enough saved up.\u201d I rub my free hand down my face, blowing out a stressed breath. \u201cYou remember how I told you I stopped doing drugs very abruptly, but I never said why?\u201d</p><p>She nods, her eyes scanning my face. \u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the reason why was because of something that happened to this girl I was dating,\u201d I say, massaging the back of my neck. \u201cWe were pretty serious. In fact, besides you, she was the only girl I\u2019ve considered my girlfriend.\u201d I pause as she tries not to smile. At first I don\u2019t get why, but then as I retrace my words it clicks. I just declared she was my girlfriend and not even on purpose. I could take it back, but it seems really stupid and not what I want to do.</p><p>\u201cShe was into drugs,\u201d I continue, trying to stay focused. \u201cHeavy drugs, like heroin.\u201d I swallow hard as images of that day surface. Needles. Sadness. Pleading. Me walking away. \u201cThe last time I saw her she was shooting up... I tried to talk her out of it, but once London made up her mind it was very hard to change it.\u201d I inhale and exhale probably a thousand times before I can continue, the emotions I\u2019ve kept trapped inside pouring out of me. \u201cI got a call the next morning from her mother, saying she\u2019d fallen out the window of a two-story house. No one at the house supposedly knew why\u2014whether she jumped or fell. She had some serious head trauma... amnesia to be exact, but her mom was really hopeful that\u2019d it be temporary.\u201d I pause, remembering what it felt like to know London was alive but that she couldn\u2019t remember anything about me\u2014us. It hurt worse than being beaten, yelled at, watching your mother go through torture just so she could stay with your dad. It was like London had died but her spirit was still walking around haunting me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t temporary, though, and she never remembered who I was or a lot about herself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lila swallows hard, her blue eyes massive as she grasps my hand. \u201cIs she still... is she still like that?\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling either her pulse or mine throbbing in my fingertips. \u201cHer name\u2019s London, which I\u2019m sure you remember from when you caught me muttering in my sleep. Rae\u2014her mother\u2014keeps asking me to go there, hoping that after four years I can help London remember something, even though the doctors told her it\u2019s pretty much impossible\u2014that the damage is irreversible.\u201d</p><p>Lila stares at me forever and it drives me insane because I need to know what she\u2019s thinking and how she feels about what I just told her because quite honestly I\u2019m perplexed as hell over what I feel. Strangely, I almost feel liberated, like I\u2019m finally letting everything I felt out.</p> <p>\u201cShe must have meant a lot to you,\u201d Lila finally says, holding my gaze.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d I admit, tracing my finger across the inside of her wrist. \u201cShe was the first girl I ever really thought I might love.\u201d</p><p>Lila swallows hard again, biting her lip, looking like she\u2019s tearing up. I want to tell her that I think I might be in love with her. I want to let her know how I feel and that she means the world to me. I don\u2019t want her to cry or hurt. I want her to be happy, like the Lila I first met, only this time her happiness will be real, not pill induced.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to go and see her like her mother wants you to?\u201d Lila asks nervously and I feel her hand tense in mine.</p><p>I press my lips together and nod. \u201cI think I have to, for a lot of different reasons. One being that I never really said good-bye to London. I was always kind of too afraid to.\u201d</p> <p>Lila smashes her lips together so hard they turn purple. \u201cOkay...\u201d It comes out breathy. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I bring my free hand up to her face and brush back her hair. \u201cLila, it\u2019s not like what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s just something I have to do. I have to say good-bye to her, because I never really did. I just kept holding on to her, which is part of the reason why I\u2019ve felt so stuck in my life. If I go see her, then maybe I can quit living in the past and move forward.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cWith you.\u201d And there it is. The truth.</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s struggling with whether to be happy or sad. She tips her head back, attempting not to cry. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there for Ella and Micha\u2019s wedding, though, right? Because it\u2019s in, like, a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Micha would fucking kick my ass if I didn\u2019t show up,\u201d I say, wishing she\u2019d look at me, wishing I knew what she\u2019s thinking. \u201cBesides, I take credit for the fact that their dumb asses are even getting married. If it weren\u2019t for me, they\u2019d still be trying to please each other instead of actually telling each other how they feel.\u201d</p><p>That gets her to look at me and laugh and the sound of it is so amazing, I swear I could fill a thousand pages with words describing the beauty in it. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right. They are both very stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we,\u201d I say, thinking about how hard I fought against my feelings for her.</p> <p>She nods, agreeing. \u201cYes, we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah... we definitely are...\u201d I drift off as I lean in to kiss her, wanting to lick and bite her again\u2014wanting to be inside her again like I was the other night. We haven\u2019t had sex since then, not because I don\u2019t want to. I want to so fucking bad my cock gets hard just thinking about it. But after what Lila told me, I\u2019m not going to push things until I know she wants it. Plus, I want to go say good-bye to London first so I can hopefully have a completely clear head.</p><p>Lila meets me half way, brushing her lips against mine and she instantly groans and clutches on to me. By the time we finish kissing, we\u2019re lying on her bed, my body pressed on hers and I\u2019m sweatier than I was when I got home from work. \u201cI\u2019m going to go take a shower and pack,\u201d I say, my lips hovering over hers. I bite at her bottom lip and then suck it into my mouth before I force myself to move away and get up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asks, batting her eyelashes up at me as she grips my arms, trying to pull me back. \u201cWe could keep kissing and see where it will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know where it will go,\u201d I assure her. \u201cBut I also know that I need to pack and if I start kissing you again, I\u2019m not going to be able to stop. I\u2019ll probably want to keep going all night, over and over and over again.\u201d My voice drops to a husky growl and she blushes.</p><p>Trying to pretend she\u2019s not all hot and flustered, she gets to her feet and returns to her suitcase. \u201cAre you flying to Virginia today?\u201d She folds a pair of shorts up and places them in the suitcase.</p><p>I nod from the doorway with my hands braced on the door frame. \u201cI\u2019m flying out about the same time you are and then I\u2019ll fly to San Diego on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be spending three days in Virginia?\u201d she asks, fighting a frown as she folds up a shirt.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s obviously uncomfortable with the idea and I feel bad that she is. But I need to do this. I know it\u2019s going to be hard, finally letting go of London and my guilt after all these years of holding on to it. But I know I can do it, because I want Lila, want to give her what she deserves, needs, more than I\u2019ve wanted to do anything else in my life.</p><p>Lila</p><p>I\u2019m trying to be strong, but it\u2019s difficult. I\u2019ve finally opened myself up to someone and then he tells me about his one and only other girlfriend, who has amnesia apparently. I can see in his eyes that he still really cares for her and I wonder if he might still love her. It feels like my heart is breaking, until he calls me his girlfriend. That helps a little. As much as I want to be secure about our relationship, I\u2019m still battling with my inner self-doubting demons. I\u2019m still figuring out who I am and who I want to be. All I really know is that I love Ethan and haven\u2019t told him that yet. And now he\u2019s going to see his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling very bummed out and defeated by the time we arrive at the airport. It isn\u2019t very crowded today and we get through security pretty quickly. His flight leaves a half an hour before mine though so he drops me off at my gate and then heads to leave.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you can call me for anything,\u201d he says as he slings his bag over his shoulder.</p><p>I nod, trying not to pout as I stand near the seating area with my suitcase at my feet. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He walks backward, dodging to the side to get around people. \u201cEspecially if you feel the need to.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile, pretending I\u2019m more okay than I really am. \u201cStop worrying about me,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He returns my smile, but he\u2019s worried about me. I can see it in his eyes. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll see you in three days.\u201d He turns around and walks away, and it makes me sadder because he didn\u2019t even kiss me good-bye.</p><p>I watch him with a giant frown on my face. He\u2019s dressed in faded jeans secured by a studded belt, a dark plaid shirt, and there are leather bands on his wrists. His dark hair is all messy because he took too long in the shower and we had to rush out of the house before he had time to do anything with it, although he didn\u2019t really care. He\u2019s so gorgeous and I wish I knew for certain if he was mine, but I don\u2019t know that yet. These things take time to fully understand.</p><p>Once he\u2019s out of my sight, I turn toward the section where I\u2019ll board with my ticket in my hand. I\u2019m used to flying first class, but I can\u2019t afford it.</p><p>I\u2019m on the verge of tearing up when I feel someone grab me from behind. I open my mouth to scream bloody murder, but arms encircle my waist and I catch a scent of a very familiar cologne and relax into Ethan\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cI forgot something,\u201d he whispers in my ear, turning me toward him. His eyes are dark, his hair hanging in his face as his gaze drinks me in slowly, deliberately. I forget to breathe as he leans down and kisses me. And I mean kisses me, the kind of kiss that rips my breath right out of my lungs, makes me forget where I am, who I am. As our tongues entwine, it makes every single struggle I\u2019ve been through worth it because they\u2019ve gotten me right here to this moment\u2014they\u2019ve gotten me to him.</p><p>His hands comb through my hair and I breathe in the scent of him as I clutch on to his arms, wishing he wasn\u2019t leaving me. By the time we pull away, we\u2019re panting, my heart is slamming against my chest, and everyone is staring at us with silly smiles on their faces that I\u2019m certain match my own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few days.\u201d He kisses me on the cheek before backing away.</p><p>I nod, breathless and flushed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and then picks up his bag, turning around and walking away for real this time. I still feel sad, but I\u2019m twenty times lighter now, knowing I can make it three days.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I really, really do,\u201d I whisper so softly no one can hear. I want to tell him. I do because I think it\u2019ll be different from when I told Sean I loved him, but I can\u2019t quite get there yet. But I can feel myself headed in the right direction and that\u2019s got to mean something and gives me hope that when I do finally tell him, things will be different because Ethan\u2019s different.</p><p>And so am I.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Lila</p><p>Ella and Micha\u2019s house is adorable. I would have thought I\u2019d dislike the place, seeing how small it is and that it\u2019s perched at the end of this really bumpy road that weaves through a neighborhood where all the houses look different. It\u2019s pretty, though, the way the yellow shutters stick out from everything else around and how the grass is covered with a variety of flowers, none of which go together but make it colorful and lively. It\u2019s Thursday morning and the sun is hot, but in a bearable way, unlike the stifling desert air in Vegas.</p><p>\u201cI really love your house,\u201d I remark for probably the third time as Ella and I sit on the back porch beneath the sunlight. We have shorts and tank tops on. My hair hangs down to my shoulders and I haven\u2019t put my makeup on yet, but no one\u2019s around so it doesn\u2019t really matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She stretches her feet out in front of her. \u201cWe got it dirt cheap, too, thanks to Micha\u2019s mom,\u201d she says and when I glance at her funny, she adds, \u201cAn old friend of hers works out here as a realtor and she hooked us up with this place. They lady who owns it is really old and probably bought it back in the 1940s when it was built so she wasn\u2019t asking a lot for it. We were really lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I say. \u201cYou guys needed some good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did?\u201d She crooks her eyebrow, questioningly.</p> <p>\u201cI think everyone does,\u201d I say, hoping that I\u2019ll get some good luck soon and finally work up the courage to tell Ethan how I feel about him. That would be the best luck ever. \u201cSo,\u201d I say, changing the subject, \u201cyou\u2019re really getting married on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Ella nods, sipping her coffee as she stares out at the fence that divides her yard from the next-door neighbors, who apparently collect wind chimes, since there\u2019s a collection of them trimming the entire back end of the house.</p><p>\u201cI really am. Totally weird, huh?\u201d she asks, seeming a little nervous, but that\u2019s just how Ella is. When I nod, she adds with a discrete glance at me from the corner of her eye, \u201cAbout as weird as your new hairdo.\u201d</p><p>I touch the ends of my hair, scrunching my nose. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look that bad, does it?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and sets her coffee mug by her feet. \u201cNo, I like it...\u201d Her green eyes sweep over me as she readjusts the elastic around her auburn hair. \u201cIt just looks different\u2014you look different.\u201d</p> <p>I examine my nails, pretending to be blas\u00e9. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, staring at me with a quizzical look on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re dressing different... less fancy and more like me. And I don\u2019t know... you just look different. Happier or something.\u201d</p><p>That throws me off the slightest bit. \u201cHappier? That\u2019s weird, because a lot of people have said I was the happiest person they\u2019d ever met.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for her coffee, again tucking her foot underneath her as she brings the brim of the glass cup up to her mouth. \u201cI can see why they\u2019d say that, but I don\u2019t know...\u201d She takes a sip, shaking her head. \u201cYou just look different for some reason. I can\u2019t put my finger on it.\u201d She rotates her cup in her hand, pressing her lips together, and it looks like she\u2019s trying really hard not to smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I finally say as I reach for my coffee. A little laugh slips through my lips because she looks so amused and I have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on. \u201cWhy do you keep giving me weird looks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you want to tell me?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>I shrug, taking a gulp of the coffee. \u201cThat you have a nice house.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a tolerant look. \u201cLila.\u201d</p><p>I press back a smile, even though I have no clue what\u2019s going on. \u201cElla.\u201d</p><p>She grins, and then shakes her head, laughing. \u201cFine, if you\u2019re not going to fess up, then I\u2019ll just say it.\u201d She pauses, griping the handle of her mug. \u201cI heard a rumor that there finally might be something going on between you and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>I hold my cup in one hand and thrum my fingers on the wicker armrest of the chair. I haven\u2019t talked to Ethan since we parted at the airport. I texted him a few times, but he always gives one-word responses, so I decided to give him some space, seeing how he\u2019s probably really busy with London. God, even thinking about it hurts a little. \u201cBy rumor, you mean Micha told you about us.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, grinning amusedly. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say exactly?\u201d I ask curiously, a little worried about what he said, but the fact that he did tell him has to mean something, right? That he cares enough about me to tell Micha. \u201cOr should I say, what did Ethan tell him?\u201d</p><p>She turns her head toward me with a mischievous grin on her face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me your side and then I can compare?\u201d</p> <p>I set the coffee cup down on the ground again while she takes a drink of hers. \u201cFine, we fucked.\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a sharp breath and then quickly moves the mug away from her mouth as she spits coffee all over the deck in front of her feet. \u201cHoly shit, Lila.\u201d She presses her hand to her chest, coughing as she works to catch her breath. \u201cI was not expecting you to be so blunt about it.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help myself. A big silly grin rises on my lips. \u201cMe neither, but I think I\u2019ll have to do it more because it\u2019s really, really fun.\u201d</p><p>She wipes the coffee from her face with the back of her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new, fun you or the old, boring one who I first met?\u201d I joke. \u201cI need clarification.\u201d</p><p>She shields the sunlight with her hand. \u201cThe new one, which is the better one. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d I say. \u201cBut the Ella I\u2019ve always known, new or old, was still a good person and that\u2019s a great thing to be compared to.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, stifling a smile. \u201cAre we going to have a moment here or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cWe never really did have one in the entire two years that we\u2019ve known each other. Maybe it\u2019s time. We can hug, cry it out, and tell each other how much we love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one for crying.\u201d She lowers her hand to her lap. \u201cOr for throwing out the L word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and honestly I\u2019m trying to cut back on it,\u201d I joke. \u201cWe could have a girl-bonding moment though and you could ask me how sex with Ethan was while we eat popcorn and watch a really sappy movie.\u201d</p><p>She makes a gagging face, pressing her hand to her chest like she\u2019s choking on the idea. \u201cI never ever want to hear you talk about sex with him. Ever.\u201d She shudders. \u201cSo gross.\u201d</p><p>We giggle over it for a moment and then talk about lighter things, like how Micha and she have been over the last couple of months. She presses me for more Ethan details, asking me why he couldn\u2019t get off work to fly out with me. Apparently, Ethan never told anyone about London and I decide to keep it to myself, figuring Ethan must have his reasons. Other than that I don\u2019t have much to say, besides the fact that kissing Ethan is amazing and that only makes her dry heave. She understands my need to be vague for the most part, because she\u2019s pretty much the vaguest person I\u2019ve ever met, and she doesn\u2019t press much, which makes me glad she\u2019s my best friend. I didn\u2019t even realize how much I\u2019d missed being around her and it makes me feel happy that I have that kind of friendship with someone but kind of sad because I know I\u2019m only going to miss her when I go back to Vegas.</p><p>\u201cSo what about your dress?\u201d I ask as we head back into the kitchen, deciding for a subject change. I need to talk about something happy and clothes always do that for me.</p><p>She sets our mugs into the sink and rinses them off. \u201cYou want to see it?\u201d she asks, shutting the faucet off.</p><p>I nod eagerly and clap my hands together. \u201cOf course. I love wedding stuff. And the dress is the best part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She frowns as she winds around the tiny island in the middle of the kitchen. \u201cWhich makes me reluctant to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My face scrunches up. \u201cElla, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d She sighs. \u201cWhich is why you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>I stare blankly at her, confused, and she sighs and motions for me to follow her as she walks toward the hallway. She takes me back to a small bedroom. The blue walls are covered with artwork and there\u2019s a wrought-iron bed piled with sheets of paper that are smudged with penned lyrics.</p><p>I pick up one of the sheets of paper from the foot of the bed. \u201cWhat? Do you guys just sit around and write and draw together all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d she says, opening the closet door. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not in school right now and I only work part time down at this art gallery, so I have to fill up my day somehow.\u201d</p><p>I nod and set the drawing down on the dresser. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a job,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut I\u2019m having no luck.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s searching through the clothes hanging up, but pauses, glancing at me from over her shoulder with her eyebrows elevated. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d I sit on the edge of the bed and cross my legs, but then pull a face and put my hands on my lap. \u201cWait, is this safe to sit on?\u201d</p><p>She sifts through the small amount of clothes in the closet. \u201cMy bed? Why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause God knows what you two do on it.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, just keep your hands on your lap.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I lean over and examine the sheet of lyrics on the bed. \u201cSo, does Micha work every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she replies. \u201cSometimes he gets a week off at a time. Sometimes he\u2019s on the road all week. Right now, he\u2019s recording at a studio in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not hard for you?\u201d I ask. \u201cTo be away from him like that, because I remember how hard it was for you two the first time around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t, but I go with him to every performance I can and we spend every waking hour together when we\u2019re not working.\u201d</p><p>I sit up straight, leaning back on my hands. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised that you guys are doing well.\u201d</p><p>She removes a hanger from the rod and turns around. \u201cYou aren\u2019t? Really? Because I kind of am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you that you guys have the most beautiful relationship that\u2019s ever existed and although you\u2019re kind of crazy, you\u2019re not stupid and I knew you\u2019d eventually get it all right.\u201d I make a swoony face, tipping my head to the side as I drape my hand over my forehead. \u201cYou guys are so dreamy together.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cWhatever, Miss Smarty Pants. Maybe I should be giving you a hard time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lower my hand. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout whether or not you\u2019re in love with Ethan.\u201d She arches her eyebrows, waiting for my response.</p><p>I am! I want to scream, but I haven\u2019t told Ethan yet, so telling her first seems wrong. \u201cSo how about that dress?\u201d I say, trying for a subject change and reaching out for her to hand it over. \u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p> <p>She lets my abrupt subject change go and slowly pulls out a plain black tank dress. \u201cI hate white,\u201d she says, holding the fabric up to her body, \u201cso I thought this could work.\u201d</p><p>It goes to her knees and has no detail at all. Plus, it has a really high neckline and the straps look really worn out.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to a funeral?\u201d I ask, pulling a face at the hideous dress. \u201cOr a wedding?\u201d</p><p>She sighs, defeated, lowering the dress to her side. \u201cI don\u2019t like fancy stuff, okay. And besides, fancy dresses are expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy.\u201d I get to my feet. \u201cBut this...\u201d I touch the fabric and then cringe at the roughness of it, like it\u2019s been washed a thousand times. \u201cElla, you seriously can\u2019t get married in this. It\u2019s hideous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you suggest I wear?\u201d she asks. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of money and I don\u2019t have anyone to help me besides you.\u201d</p><p>I mull it over for a minute, wondering if I really want to go to where my brain\u2019s heading. How much do I care for Ella? A lot obviously, since I\u2019m even considering what I\u2019m considering right now. I mean, she\u2019s my best friend, and she deserves a really pretty dress. \u201cI have an idea, but you\u2019ll have to trust me. And I mean really, really trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She\u2019s wary. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not up to anything,\u201d I tell her, heading for the door. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to be shocked.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth turns downward as she trails after me. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll trust you, but I have a few rules.\u201d She counts down on her fingers. \u201cLike no ruffles, no pure white, no poofiness.\u201d</p><p>I laugh as we head out the door.</p> <p>Ethan</p><p>It\u2019s Thursday morning, only about twelve hours since I left Las Vegas and Lila behind. I find that I\u2019m missing her a lot more than I\u2019d expected. She\u2019s texted me a couple of times and I want to call and talk to her, but I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t until after I talked to London. That way I could have a clear head. Maybe. Hopefully.</p><p>I\u2019m at London\u2019s aunt\u2019s house, where London lives most of the time because it\u2019s closer to her doctor\u2019s office. I\u2019ve been sitting in a living room that smells like cat food for about an hour, counting the tics of the grandfather clock while drinking iced tea and listening to Rae talk about hope while we wait for London to come back from her doctor\u2019s appointment. I\u2019m getting a little restless waiting, wondering what she\u2019ll look like and the stupid part of me believes there\u2019s a small possibility that she\u2019ll walk into the room and recognize me. It\u2019s making me regret coming here and making me really want to hop onto a plane and go back to Lila, just so I can hold her.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to tell Rae that I can\u2019t do this when the front door swings open and London walks inside. It\u2019s mind-blowingly strange, seeing her again. She looks older, yet the same. Her black hair is still resting at her chin and streaked with purple, and she still has a scar on her lip and her nose is pierced. She also has a faint scar on her head where she hit it on the rock when she fell out the window, the thing that caused the brain damage. I swear, if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d guess that I\u2019d somehow stepped back in time four years.</p><p>There\u2019s this fleeting moment when I swear her eyes light up like they used to whenever she looked at me, but it vanishes so quickly I wonder if I was imagining it. She glances at her mother, who she does recognize, but not from her childhood. She can\u2019t remember anything from the past, except the basic functions of walking, talking, and breathing.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d she asks her mom in a robotic kind of voice.</p><p>Rae looks just how I remember her the last time I saw her right after London\u2019s accident. She\u2019s still the spitting image of London, only twenty-years older. She gets to her feet. \u201cThis is an old friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>London\u2019s eyes lock on me and I remember how she sometimes used to just stare at me with this thoughtful look on her face, like she was memorizing what I looked like. But now, well, she just looks lost, like someone who wandered off into the forest and can\u2019t find her way back.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember him,\u201d she says, stepping back toward the door. \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d</p><p>Rae quickly winds around the sofa and grabs London\u2019s arm, stopping her from bolting. \u201cHe came here to talk to you. A long way actually, so the least you could do is sit down and listen to what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>London glances at me and I force a smile. It\u2019s too weird. I just keep thinking about all the time we spent together and how I can remember it but she can\u2019t. I\u2019m a stranger to her, but I realize now she was kind of like a stranger to me the entire time we were dating.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she finally asks me.</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I get up from the sofa and walk toward her with my hands tucked into the pockets of my jeans. \u201cEthan Gregory.\u201d</p><p>She considers this for a moment. \u201cI have no idea who you are,\u201d she says and then shrugs like she\u2019s at a loss for words. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d I reply, but I\u2019m not quite sure what I\u2019m sorry for. Whether it\u2019s for leaving the house that day, not ripping the needle out of her hand when she was about to shoot up, or for the plain and simple fact that I can\u2019t make her remember me. Or maybe it\u2019s because even though I\u2019m standing here with her, I can\u2019t stop thinking about Lila, her smile, her sadness, and the fact that at the moment I really just want to be with her, not here.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you two sit down?\u201d Rae gestures at the sofas. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll go get you some iced tea.\u201d She smiles at me with hope in her eyes as she walks past me, heading to the kitchen and leaving me alone with London.</p><p>London shakes her head and then sighs and sits down on the sofa. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she tries so hard.\u201d She tucks her hands underneath her legs. \u201cI can barely remember her and she\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just cares about you.\u201d I take a seat in the recliner across from her. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a stupid thing, depending on how you look at it.\u201d She eyes me over as she leans back in the sofa. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I say, picking up the glass of iced tea Rea has placed beside me. She\u2019s disappeared back into the kitchen, and I can\u2019t help but wish I was back there with her. \u201cEthan Gregory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we dated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, pretty much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we had sex.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the middle of a sip and nearly spit the iced tea all over the floor. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d I say, setting the glass down.</p><p>\u201cWas I any good?\u201d she asks curiously as she leans forward. \u201cI mean I had to be if you\u2019re here to visit me.\u201d Her feistiness resembles the London I remember so much it\u2019s kind of hard to take in.</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d I admit, wiping my lips with the back of my hand.</p><p>She arches her eyebrow. \u201cThe best you ever had.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to answer, but then clamp my jaw shut because the answer is no. The best I\u2019ve ever had is back in San Diego doing who knows what, hopefully smiling and being happy.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d she states, her eyebrows arching as she relaxes back in the chair. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, sadly. \u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>She seems amused by this, the corners of her lips quirking. \u201cAre you in love with her?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, overlapping my hands on my knees. \u201cYou know, you ask a lot of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly about things I can\u2019t remember,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou know it\u2019s a pain in the ass not being able to remember everyone, yet they\u2019re always looking at you, hoping you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remember anything at all?\u201d I know the answer, but I still ask the question.</p><p>\u201cNope, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem so calm about it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot calm. I\u2019ve just accepted it. I can remember the last four years, so that\u2019s something. I\u2019m not completely clueless and from what I understand\u2014the fact that I threw myself out the window while on heroin\u2014maybe I needed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go that far,\u201d I say uneasily. \u201cForgetting your past is a really big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She pauses, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>I take a deep breath, preparing myself to say what I came here for. \u201cAbout that day... the day you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrew myself out the window,\u201d she finishes for me bluntly.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah... I wanted to say...\u201d I fidget with the sleeve of my shirt. \u201cI want to say that I\u2019m sorry. I should have never left you in that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left me?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou were frustrating me because you were obviously upset about something, yet you wouldn\u2019t talk about it\u2014you never would. You wanted to shoot up heroin instead and I didn\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ear, her analyzing gaze boring into me. \u201cYou told me not to do it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cA few times, but I should have tried harder. I should have made you stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you have done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... ripped the needle out of your hand or something.\u201d</p><p>She thrums her fingernails on the armrest, considering something. \u201cYou know, if I\u2019ve learned one thing through this whole ordeal it\u2019s that sometimes you can\u2019t make things happen, even if you want them to. You can\u2019t change things or make people do things they don\u2019t want to do or can\u2019t do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallow hard, understanding what she\u2019s saying. \u201cBut I could have tried harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the end I\u2019m sure I still would have put the needle in my arm,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd probably went out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut maybe.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut we\u2019ll never know. And it\u2019s not for you to feel guilty when I can\u2019t even remember you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. She\u2019s still so London and it\u2019s crazy. \u201cI guess so.\u201d I get what she\u2019s saying. I really do. But it\u2019s hard to accept because we\u2019ll never know what might have happened or might not have happened if I\u2019d just gotten her to put the needle down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about me anymore,\u201d she says dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m always talking about myself\u2014with my mom, the doctors, everyone I come across who used to know me. I get so sick of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about, then?\u201d I ask, leaning back in the seat, feeling a little lighter and at the same time a little sadder because I know this is it. This is how things will always be between us and I can\u2019t change it.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She crosses her legs and stares me down so hard I swear she\u2019s trying to burn a hole in my head.\u201d Tell me, Ethan Gregory, this girl who\u2019s the best you\u2019ve ever had, do you love her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou want to talk about love?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, feeling uncomfortable under her scrutiny. \u201cWhat the fuck is love anyway?\u201d Giving your heart to someone completely? Saying here, take it, I\u2019m yours? Letting them love you, hug you, own you? Yell at you and tell you you\u2019re worthless? Hold you and tell you you\u2019re important? What is the definition of love? How can you tell?</p><p>I open my mouth and decide to just go for it, letting the first answer that pops into my head slip out. \u201cI think I do.\u201d My mind is flying about a million miles an hour with the declaration and it\u2019s hard to process, especially since I just said it for the first time in front of my ex-girlfriend who has amnesia.</p><p>She tilts her head to the side, studying me. \u201cDid you love me?\u201d</p><p>I think about her question, knowing the real answer, but it\u2019s hard to admit it. \u201cI think I did, but in a different way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur love was kind of chaotic and careless and we really didn\u2019t know each other enough to actually completely love each other.\u201d I reach into my pocket and retrieve the bracelet London gave me, the one with our initials intertwined. \u201cBut I think in some way or another we did have some kind of love for each other.\u201d I lean over the table, holding my hand out to give her the bracelet.</p><p>\u201cBut not as much as this other girl?\u201d she asks, taking the bracelet from my hand. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it for me,\u201d I say, leaning back. \u201cYou said it would always help me remember the time we spent together.\u201d</p><p>She runs her finger along the leather. \u201cWas I going to break up with you when I gave it to you? Because it kind of sounds like I was.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and then shake my head. \u201cYou could have been thinking about it, but honestly I don\u2019t know. Half the time I never knew what you were thinking.\u201d</p><p>She grins as she looks down at the bracelet in her hand. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ll never know.\u201d Leave it to London to have a sick and twisted sense of humor about the whole thing. But she\u2019s right. I\u2019ll never know what she was thinking, how she really felt, how I really felt, because we never got around to telling each other. I was so afraid of my feelings that I held them in and now the chance to tell her is gone. She\u2019ll never know whether I loved her or not. How much I cared for her. I\u2019ll never know if she felt the same way, whether she loved me so much she\u2019d hang on to me if something happened to me and I was no longer part of her life. I will never know a lot of stuff about our relationship and there\u2019s no changing that. It\u2019s done. Final.</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d I offer her a small smile.</p> <p>She continues to stare at the bracelet, looking sadder with each passing moment. Finally she sighs and sets it down on the table. \u201cSo tell me something happy,\u201d she says, shifting her mood in the amount of time it takes me to catch my breath. \u201cAnd not about my past.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and start telling her about the last few years of my life, which aren\u2019t really happy or sad, just neutral, because I\u2019ve basically been stuck in the same mentality, never moving forward, always thinking about the past. Except in this very moment, I want to be moving forward to the other side of the country to be with some else. By the time we\u2019re done talking, it\u2019s midafternoon. My flight doesn\u2019t leave until the morning, but the idea of waiting until then seems impossible. I need to see Lila now and I need to tell her how I feel so I don\u2019t miss my chance again.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Lila</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I\u2019m becoming a very bad influence on you,\u201d Ella says as she roams through my old room in my parents\u2019 three-story mansion located up in the greener, more luxurious side of town. The ocean rushes toward the shore from outside the window and the sun beams brightly against the pale pink walls.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d I open my closet and walk into it, the immense space almost overwhelming because it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen it. So many memories overwhelm me, ones filled with loathing from my parents and self-loathing from myself. For a moment, I swear to God the damn walls feel like they\u2019re closing in on me again.</p><p>I run my fingers along the fabrics of each dress and shirt, remembering what it was like to have an endless amount of clothes, money, anything of material value. I was showered with things, and in return, I was not showered with affection and love. I would trade anything, live on the streets in a soggy wet box, just to have my parents genuinely love me.</p><p>Ella steps up behind me and evaluates my closet. \u201cAre you sure your maid\u2019s not going to tell your mom or dad we snuck in here?\u201d</p><p>I shrug as I sift through the dresses, the sight of each one making me sick to my stomach, because each one carries a memory of a time I wish I could forget. All the horrible things I\u2019ve done in them, all the horrible things I felt. \u201cI doubt it. She hates my mother and father almost as much as I do. It doesn\u2019t really matter, though.\u201d From the back section, I select a dress that flows to the floor. \u201cI mean, what are they going to do? Kick me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about make you stay,\u201d she says from behind me. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I glance over my shoulder at her, forcing a smile. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll just have to owe me for this big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that all kind of depends on why you brought me here.\u201d She wanders around, her eyes huge as she takes in the large selection of shoes on the back wall. \u201cBecause I\u2019m really confused right now.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her and then hold the dress out toward her. \u201cWe\u2019re here for this.\u201d</p><p>Ella examines the dress with a wary expression on her face. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a goof sometimes. Seriously.\u201d I push the dress at her. \u201cIt\u2019s for you. I thought you could wear it at your wedding.\u201d</p><p>She stares at the dress that has a shimmering black silk top, a red ribbon securing the back, and an elegant flowing white bottom bunched together in places by red and black sewn roses. She tentatively reaches out and touches the fabric with a stoic expression as she runs her fingers along one of the black flowers.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she asks, touching the silk top.</p><p>\u201cI wore it one year for... for Halloween,\u201d I say, choking down the images of what I did while wearing the dress. I drank drink after drink that night and chased them down with pills. I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t end up in the hospital, although I probably would have been better off, instead of sleeping with two different guys in the same night and then throwing up alone in the bathroom afterward. I almost puke just thinking about it now, thinking about who I was.</p><p>She glances up at me. \u201cYou wore this for Halloween?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cBut it was actually just a dress I bought from a store and then turned it into a Victorian-style dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed that much.\u201d She lets her arm fall to her side. \u201cBut it looks so... unlike anything you would wear.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, because she\u2019s right, yet at the same time I\u2019m also standing next to her in an old pair of shorts and a band T-shirt I stole form Ethan\u2019s room. \u201cI guess, but it was also Halloween and I was supposed to dress up as something unlike myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Her gaze returns to the dress and she bites back a smile. \u201cCan I try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I hand it to her and head for the door so she can change in the closet. \u201cYou\u2019re not offended I gave you an old costume, though, are you?\u201d I ask as I shut the door.</p><p>She shakes her head, slipping the dress\u2019s straps off the hanger. \u201cAre you kidding me? It\u2019s, like, the perfect dress, Lila. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI thought it might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She offers me a genuine smile and makes me feel good inside, like I did something right. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I return her smile wholeheartedly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and sink down on the four-post bed. It still has the same satin white comforter on it that\u2019s trimmed with lace. There are fluffy throw pillows all over it and the same floor-length curtains hang over the French doors. Everything is clean and tidy. Everything looks perfect. When I turned thirteen my mom spent weeks redecorating this room as a birthday present for me. I told her I wanted a pool party with my friends. Hell, I would have taken letting my friends come over and hang out over curtains and pillows that made the room pretty in theory\u2014but it\u2019d always felt so overly empty and unwelcoming. This used to be my life, and even back then I didn\u2019t like it very much, yet I always kept going with it because it was what I was supposed to do. This kind of lifestyle, flourishing on the outside and no substance on the inside, was ingrained into my mind since the day I entered the world. I was pretty much doomed to be just like either my mom or my sister, and I would have probably ended up like one of them eventually, but I got lucky. Lucky because I met Ethan. He saved me not just from an addiction but also from myself. He showed me that I was worth getting clean. I\u2019m worth more than self-destruction and emptiness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I really wish I could talk to him at the moment. I just want to hear the sound of his voice. God, I wish I could kiss him again, feel his arms around me, feel him inside me, pushing me over the edge, making my body feel things I never thought were possible. He said I could call him whenever I needed him and it feels like I need him because this God damn house is getting to me and is surfacing the need to take a pill. It affects my emotions too much, the place where I endured my father telling me over and over again just how worthless I am. It\u2019s where it all began, where I entered the world, doomed to strive for perfection, even though it doesn\u2019t exist. I strived and strived, with everything I had in me, nearly killing myself to achieve something that I could never achieve because it\u2019s not real. This life I\u2019m in now, with Ethan, with Ella, is what\u2019s real.</p><p>I decide to take Ethan up on the offer. I take my phone out of my back pocket and dial his number and put the phone up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says quickly, answering after the fourth ring.</p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me, Lila\u201d I say stupidly, and then roll my eyes at myself. We\u2019ve talked to each other a thousand times on the phone, but it feels different now that we\u2019ve had sex and I feel sort of nervous.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he replies in a rushed voice. \u201cYour name came up on the screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, duh.\u201d I coil a strand of my short hair around my finger, unsure how to react to his standoffish attitude. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m being a little bit spacey, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer right away and I can hear someone talking in the background. A woman. London probably. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d he finally asks, distracted.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say, unraveling my hair from my finger. \u201cI was just sitting in my old room and suddenly thought of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in your old room... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I start, but there\u2019s a loud crash in the background and then it gets really loud with voices and rustles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You sound busy. I\u2019ll just call back later.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to argue a little, but instead he quickly says, \u201cOkay, talk to you soon.\u201d Then he hangs up.</p><p>I try not to sulk or let it get to me, because I\u2019ve been so accustomed to guys blowing me off, but I wasn\u2019t in love with them. And I had my pills. As the urge to cry over his brush-off overpowers me, I want to leave the room and go track down my mother\u2019s stash, because she has them hidden all over the house.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lila,\u201d Ella calls out from the closet. \u201cIs there a secret to putting the dress on... I can\u2019t get the ribbon to tie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need my help?\u201d I say starting to get up when the closet door opens and she walks out, the flowing dress swishing with her steps. It\u2019s not tied and so it\u2019s loose in the front, but she still looks beautiful. I instantly place my hand over my mouth and shake my head, my eyes welling up. \u201cOh my God, you look so beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>She swallows hard, glancing down at the dress, gripping some of the fabric in her hands. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>I lower my hands from my mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy. Do you not like the dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I like the dress.\u201d She glances up at me, confused. \u201cIt just feels like there\u2019s something missing.\u201d</p><p>I move forward and fiddle with her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because you don\u2019t have any makeup on and your hair\u2019s not done, but we can get it done for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head again, turning it to the side and looking at her reflection in the full-length mirror on the wall next to the vanity. She stares at herself forever and I can tell she\u2019s about to cry. Sucking in a breath, she turns for the closet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get out of it,\u201d she mutters and then disappears into the closet, shutting the door.</p><p>I stand there for a moment, deciding whether or not to go in there and find out what\u2019s wrong. She\u2019s obviously hurting over something and I wonder if it\u2019s something about Micha or her family. My best guess would be her family, since they\u2019ve been the center of her problems in the past.</p><p>Deciding to go find out, I step forward toward the closet but stop when my mom walks into my room.</p> <p>She\u2019s wearing an unwrinkled cream-colored pencil skirt and silver satin blouse. Her heels match her shirt and the purse draped over her shoulder, the purse that I know holds her bottle of pills. Her blonde hair is done in a bun and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen her, but the lack of wrinkles in her face probably mean she\u2019s recently had Botox done.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d She stumbles back, surprised to see me and the heel of her shoe makes a streak across the shiny white-and-black marble floor. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>I clutch my hand around my phone, remembering the last time I saw her and my father and they both told me how stupid I was for moving to Vegas. That I was going to turn into nothing and that to my father I was already nothing, worthless, a huge massive disappointment that he wished had never been born. He didn\u2019t want garbage like me in his house. Those were his exact words and that\u2019s when I jumped into my car and drove back to Ella\u2019s, making the decision to never see them again. And I\u2019ve been good on my promise until today.</p><p>\u201cI walked through the front door,\u201d I say, regretting coming here, but Ella needed a dress. She deserves one, a good, pretty one that will make her feel special on her wedding day. Because whether she\u2019ll admit it or not, almost every girl wants the perfect dress.</p><p>My mother stands in the doorway, looking me over as she grips the doorknob. \u201cYou look like shit, Lila. That T-shirt...\u201d She makes a repulsed face. \u201cAnd that godawful haircut. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking anything,\u201d I tell her, eyeing her Botoxed face. \u201cOther than I was sick of looking artificial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, young lady,\u201d she warns, letting go of the doorknob and stepping forward. \u201cOr you won\u2019t get what you came here for.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and raise my eyebrows at her, unsure what she means. \u201cAnd why did I come here?\u201d</p><p>She waits, like she\u2019s expecting me to give her the answer, when I don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on. \u201cSo you finally took my advice and came back. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this, Lila.\u201d She walks into the room, her head held arrogantly high as she takes in my appearance like I\u2019m a sideshow circus freak. \u201cDo you know how frustrated your father and I have been with your life choices lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably about as frustrated as you\u2019ve been with them since I was born,\u201d I say, my voice coming out sharper than I intended.</p><p>She purses her lips and places her hands on her hips as she reaches me\u2014close enough, yet her eyes look so far away. \u201cLila Summers, you know the rules in this house. You won\u2019t talk to me like that while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve always been taught to obey, but seeing her like this, my vision undiluted, I feel like I\u2019m seeing her for the first time, along with everything she\u2019s done and said to me over the years. \u201cYes, I do, mother. Don\u2019t express anything, right? At least in a healthy way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d She rushes toward me and gets in my face. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to move back in here with me, there will be rules.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her politely, suddenly understanding what she thinks I\u2019m here for. I\u2019m about to say something when the closet door swings open and Ella walks out carrying the dress over her arm, her eyes red, like she\u2019s been crying. She stops dead in her tracks as she takes one look at me and my mother and tenses, eyeing the door like she\u2019s going to bolt. And I don\u2019t blame her. I\u2019m thinking the exact same thing.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d my mother asks curtly, her gaze sliding over Ella\u2019s torn shorts and faded purple tank top.</p><p>Ella glances at me with a what-the-hell-should-I-do look and I can see the apprehension on her face. She doesn\u2019t do well with parents, and even though I don\u2019t completely understand why, I\u2019m guessing that it\u2019s because her dad\u2019s an alcoholic and probably wasn\u2019t that nice to her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d I state, swinging around my mom and grabbing Ella\u2019s arm. I jerk her toward the door a little harder than I meant to, but I\u2019m trying to portray inner strength, even though it\u2019s hard to feel it whenever my mother\u2019s around. \u201cAnd we were just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you are.\u201d My mother\u2019s fingers snag my elbow and she yanks on my arm. The side of her purse brushes against my arm and I can\u2019t help but think how easy it would be to snatch it from her and steal her bottle of pills, knowing the instant one went down my throat, I\u2019d feel better, but it\u2019d be a fake better. \u201cYou aren\u2019t walking out of here, especially when you look like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook like what?\u201d I wrench my arm away from her. Inner strength. Do not let her get to you. It\u2019s difficult, though, without the pills. \u201cA normal human being?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turn icy as they narrow in on me. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you screw up your life, even though you\u2019ve been so determined to do so. It\u2019s time to start over.\u201d She cuts her gaze to Ella. \u201cAnd get away from the people who aren\u2019t suitable for you.\u201d</p><p>Ella glares at her as she starts to open her mouth and even though I\u2019m curious as to what\u2019s going to come out of it, I decide it\u2019s time for me to put my mother in her place, because I need to stand up for myself. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now.\u201d I flash her my most beautiful smile, and then grab Ella\u2019s hand and hurry for the front door.</p><p>One foot in front of the other. Get the hell away from here and all the emptiness it holds.</p><p>My mother starts yelling at us as she follows us through the house, saying mean things about me and Ella, and she even tries to take the dress away, telling me that neither one of us is worthy of having it, not when we looks so trashy. That\u2019s it. She can take jabs at me because I\u2019m used to it, but not at my friends. It\u2019s ridiculous and pathetic. As we reach the entryway, I whirl around and threaten her with the one thing I know will make her stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWalk away, Mother, or I\u2019ll tell everyone your secrets,\u201d I warn in a low tone, walking toward her. I get in her face, surprising her and myself. \u201cI will make sure everyone knows just how great of a person you are outside and inside.\u201d I smile as she frowns, her face draining of color, and inside I do a pleased dance.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth.\u201d Her voice trembles, but her face is subdued.</p><p>\u201cOh, I will.\u201d I let out a sharp laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it as I walk around announcing to anyone who will listen just how great you and Dad are behind closed doors.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m putting her worst fears out there. Part of me wants to keep going, slap her across the face, tell her how worthless she is, beat her down like she\u2019s done to me for years, but I don\u2019t want to turn into her either. Ella and I walk out of the house and I make a silent vow to myself that I will never, ever return, not to her, my father, that lifestyle, or the pills. There\u2019s nothing there for me. Never has been. Now that my head is finally clear, I can see that now. See what I want.</p><p>I want a life of my own.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Lila</p><p>After we drop the dress off at Ella\u2019s house, we change into nicer clothes and then I take her out to a nightclub as a sort of bachelorette party. I asked her if she wanted anyone else there, but she told me no and that besides Micha, I was really the only person she wanted to hang out with at the moment. The nightclub isn\u2019t as fancy as the ones I\u2019m used to, tucked in a corner of a run-down neighborhood, but the entrance fee was cheap and they have two-dollar Jell-O shots.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ella calls out over the loud, booming music, crossing her legs as she spins back and forth in the barstool. She has on a short green dress and her hair is down and curled at the ends. She keeps getting texts from Micha and each one brings this lovey-dovey look to her eyes that I envy and want. \u201cYou seem really sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d I have a backless white-and-black dress on that hits halfway above my knees. It looks really fancy but I actually bought it at a discount store.</p><p>She takes a sip of her drink, looking uncomfortable. \u201cBecause of your mom?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and sip my fruity drink. I promised myself I wasn\u2019t going to drink that much, but I\u2019m walking in dangerous territory right now, having just got done with my mother and the fact that I haven\u2019t heard from Ethan since we had that awkward, rushed conversation. \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t really want to talk about it if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She flips her hair over her shoulders and fans her hand in front of her face. There\u2019s no air conditioning inside the club and there are way too many people in the compacted area. \u201cOkay, what do you want to do then?\u201d A devious grin appears on her face as she slams back the Jell-O shot. \u201cTalk about Ethan?\u201d She slams the little plastic cup down on the counter top.</p><p>I shake my head. I haven\u2019t been trying to think too much about Ethan and the phone call. I keep trying to tell myself that he\u2019s probably just having a hard time. I mean, it has to be hard seeing someone you care about who can\u2019t remember you at all.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him either,\u201d I tell her, stirring my drink.</p><p>Ella sucks the last of her drink down, gagging as she swallows the alcohol piling up in the bottom beneath the ice. \u201cWhy not? You never used to be so closed off about guys. In fact, you told me stuff about Parker that I really didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan\u2019s different from Parker.\u201d I shrug as memories of what happened with Parker surface, but I swiftly shake them away. \u201cBesides... I don\u2019t know... I think that maybe Ethan and I should just be friends.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead furrows as she props her elbow on the countertop. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cI worry he might not be as into me as I\u2019m into him.\u201d</p><p>Ella muses thoughtfully over this with a trace of a smile playing at her lips and a drunken look in her eyes. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head to the side, studying the strange look on her face. \u201cYou know something, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a lot of things.\u201d She spins around in her stool so she\u2019s facing the packed dance floor. \u201cLike the fact that Ethan has never ever talked about a girl so excessively until you.\u201d</p> <p>I rotate around in my stool, too, leaving my empty glass on the counter. \u201cWhen has he ever talked about me?\u201d</p><p>She smiles, the glow of the lights on the dance floor shining across her face. \u201cFor, like, the last month. Micha says he hasn\u2019t stopped talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably saying what a pain in the ass I am,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m driving him crazy, living with him.\u201d Plus all the drama I\u2019ve brought into his life.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s both complained and gushed,\u201d she remarks, making an exaggeratedly swoony face and then rolls her eyes. \u201cWould you quit worrying? Jesus. You\u2019ve never been like this with guys before. Usually you don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d I lie, but it comes out so pathetic sounding that I give up and just say the truth. \u201cAll right, you know what, you\u2019re right. I do worry about how Ethan feels about me, but I also haven\u2019t felt this way about a guy before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d she asks with interest, leaning in so she can hear me over the music.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you yet because I need to tell him first.\u201d I give her a halfhearted smile. \u201cNow can we please have a subject change, perhaps something that doesn\u2019t have to do with me and my life?\u201d I thrum my fingernails on the counter. \u201cLike maybe you could tell me what had you all teary-eyed back at my house.\u201d</p><p>Her expression falls as she takes a deep breath and then, shaking her head, she grabs my hand and tugs me toward the dance floor. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s dance and have some fun,\u201d she says, steering us through the crowd.</p><p>She\u2019s acting weird and I wonder why, but I decide to let go of both of our problems and have fun. I laugh as I trip in my heels and push my way to the center of the dance floor. I start shaking my hips and spinning in circles, enjoying the moment, but in the back of my head something is on my mind that I continue to grow restless over. Ethan. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. I\u2019ve never been so consumed by a guy before. Not even with Sean. With Ethan it\u2019s so much different. For one thing, I know him, more than I know any other guy who\u2019s breezed in and out of my life. He\u2019s a good guy, sweet, even though he pretends otherwise. He\u2019s been there for me, more than anyone else in my life. What if he doesn\u2019t want me how I want him? Will I turn to pills? I\u2019m not sure what the answer is to that and it\u2019s kind of scary. However, there is a thin spot of hope left. I haven\u2019t run to the pills again, even when I was in my mother\u2019s house and knew I had full access to them. It makes me feel sort of strong and confident.</p><p>Ella suddenly lets out a deafening squeal as a guy rushes up behind her and wraps his arms around her waist. When he swings her around I see it\u2019s Micha, and he\u2019s laughing as she works to catch her breath. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him since he moved away. I remember how sexy I thought Micha was when I first met him. He had these striking aqua eyes and this really soft-looking sandy-blond hair. His lip was pierced, too, and I remember thinking how I\u2019d never kissed a guy with a lip ring before and the idea of doing so felt like I would be doing something naughty, like I was slumming it with a bad boy. Then I saw how he looked at Ella, the love in both their eyes, although Ella wouldn\u2019t admit it, and I knew there was no way I\u2019d ever be able to even so much as hit on Micha. I remember how bummed out I was about it because I was heading home and I really did feel like doing something with a guy who was different from the other guys I hooked up with. Then I met Ethan and I remember thinking how hot he was and how much I wanted to hook up with him. I figured I\u2019d get drunk, have sex with him, and return home feeling numb and content. The problem was Ethan wasn\u2019t like the guys I normally hooked up with and he wouldn\u2019t sleep with me. He insisted he\u2019d only be friends with me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lila.\u201d Micha grins at me and then kisses Ella\u2019s neck. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d he asks between peppering Ella with kisses.</p><p>She shivers into his touch. \u201cStop, that tickles,\u201d she protests through laughs, but I can tell by her expression that she likes it.</p><p>Micha bites at her neck and laughs when her eyes close and she protests more. He gives her a soft, loving kiss on the cheek, and then his eyes focus on me. \u201cYou look good, Lila, especially the hair. I like it.\u201d Micha has always had this charming way about him. Ella said that before her he slept with a lot of girls and I can see why. Still, so has Ethan and he is anything but charming. In fact, he\u2019s very blunt most of the time and I guess that can be sexy, too, since it worked on me.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I shout out over the music as I touch the tips of my hair. \u201cIt was an impulse cut.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me. \u201cA good impulse cut. It works on you.\u201d</p><p>I smile, glancing at Ella as she gets this weird look on her face, not looking at me but over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCould you tone down the dazzling, man.\u201d Ethan\u2019s voice rises over my shoulder and the second the sound touches my ears heat, want, self-doubt, and excitement rush through my body. \u201cSeriously, can\u2019t you turn it off for, like, two seconds? It\u2019s fucking ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d Micha replies in an innocent tone. \u201cBesides giving her a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Ethan says and then his hands touch my waist.</p><p>I pretty much die of a heart attack. My heart is acting insane, crashing against my chest, like it wants to flee. I tilt my head back and look over my shoulder at Ethan. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming here until tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>His expression is unreadable, his eyes dark, his hair all messy, and he\u2019s starting to get a five o\u2019clock shadow. I love the look on him, but the reluctance in his eyes makes me wary. \u201cCan we go somewhere and talk?\u201d he asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...\u201d I look back at Ella, who nods and motions at me to go ahead. I turn back to Ethan, who\u2019s trying to smooth the wrinkles out of his gray shirt. \u201cI guess I can.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, but there\u2019s worry behind it, and suddenly my mind flips on, running about a thousand miles a minute. He\u2019s just seen his ex-girlfriend. What if it turns out he still loves her? What if he\u2019s come to tell me this? What will I do? Break? The idea of going back to pills seems so easy and yet at the same time so hard. The idea of going back to that girl who relied on medication and sex to make her feel better almost makes me sick. I don\u2019t want to be her. I want to be the Lila who\u2019s been developing over the last month: the pill free, clear-headed one, who can live without money or fancy clothes. The one who felt every part of the experience with Ethan and didn\u2019t feel ashamed or worthless.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to die all over on the inside. I don\u2019t want beauty and money to define me. I want to thrive. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to choose to do.</p> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Lila</p><p>It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this nervous. Right after the thing with Sean happened, one of the Precious Bells told the entire school. I remember sitting in my room the day it happened, dreading going to class, fearing what everyone would say. I was actually sick to my stomach. In the end I had to go to school and everyone started calling me a whore. It was all a big joke to them. They cut me apart, ripped me to shreds, but nothing hurt as much as the fact that Sean had never called afterward. He\u2019d simply untied the ropes, zipped up his pants, grabbed his jacket, and muttered a \u201cThat was great,\u201d before slipping out the hotel room door.</p><p>As Ethan and I sit on the bed in Ella and Micha\u2019s quaint little guestroom, I feel like I\u2019m headed to that same place, but I\u2019m not sure why. Ethan hasn\u2019t really said anything. He was being standoffish on the phone. I need to stop overanalyzing.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s everything been for the last few days?\u201d Ethan asks, leaning against the headboard. He looks tired, bags under his eyes, like he hasn\u2019t slept in a while.</p> <p>I shrug, kneeling on the bed near where his knees are. \u201cIt\u2019s been going good... Although I did go to my house and ran into my mother.\u201d</p><p>He straightens up a little, his muscles tightening. \u201cWhy the hell did you go there? You should stay away from them. Your parents are fucking douche bags.\u201d He pauses, assessing me like he\u2019s afraid they physically broke me or something. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAs okay as I ever am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything to me. My father wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your mother say to you then?\u201d he asks, looking unhappy.</p> <p>I shrug, unable to keep a frown on my face from forming. \u201cNothing she hasn\u2019t said before.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips together and shakes his head. \u201cYou need to stay away from them... the things you told me they\u2019ve said to you... they don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>I love you. God, I do. I sit down, crossing my legs, my dress riding up a little. \u201cI know, but I didn\u2019t go there to see them. I went there to steal a dress out of the closet.\u201d</p><p>He arches an eyebrow. \u201cA dress?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and then tell him about the dress and what happened with my mom, surprised by how easy it is to tell him the truth, down to how I felt about knowing the pills were so close. I wanted to rip them out of her purse and devour them. I wanted to make myself feel better, but I didn\u2019t do it. I know now they don\u2019t make me feel better. They just make me not feel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal,\u201d he says when I\u2019m done. He sits up and turns to the side so he\u2019s facing me. \u201cTo want them when you know they\u2019re near. What\u2019s important is that you didn\u2019t take them.\u201d</p><p>I nod, trying to pick up his vibe, but he\u2019s stoic and it\u2019s frustrating me. \u201cHow about you? How was...\u201d God, this is so hard. \u201cHow was seeing London?\u201d</p><p>He waits a moment to respond, looking me over with his eyebrows furrowed as if he\u2019s perplexed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like how I thought it would be.\u201d</p> <p>I take a deep breath, fearing the answer, fearing the worst, but ultimately telling myself that I have to handle it because I won\u2019t go back to being what I was. \u201cAnd how did you think it would be?\u201d</p><p>He keeps staring at me, not saying anything and it drives me crazy, to the point that I feel like I\u2019m going to explode.</p><p>\u201cEthan, would you please tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d I kneel up in front of him as I wince at the neediness in my tone.</p><p>A breath eases out of his lips as he reaches for my hips, surprising me when he folds his fingers around me and brings me to his lap so I\u2019m straddling him. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that I missed you.\u201d His forehead creases as he says it. \u201cIn fact, I was kind of surprised how much I was thinking about you the entire time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure whether to be happy or offended. \u201cYou weren\u2019t planning to think about me at all?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, staring at me like he\u2019s lost. \u201cI honestly thought I\u2019d go there and be completely focused on saying goodbye and letting London go, but it turns out I think I already had in a way... I think it might have happened the moment I decided to be with you.\u201d He pauses, contemplating, his lips quirking. \u201cI\u2019m kind of sounding cheesy right now, huh?\u201d</p><p>I try not to smile, but I\u2019m failing. \u201cCheesy can be good, though. Like in the movies. Everyone always ends up happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re going to end up happy?\u201d He seems wary.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, but...\u201d I gather my breath and my courage as I place my hands on his shoulders. \u201cBut I\u2019d kind of like to find out.\u201d I hold my breath while I wait for him to say something.</p><p>He plays with a strand of my hair, twirling it around his finger and then tucking it behind my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to turn out like my parents... I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d I say. \u201cI want us to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationships can be ugly. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d I pause, not wanting to ask but needing to know. \u201cBut, Ethan, I don\u2019t get it. You say you don\u2019t want to be in a relationship, yet you were in one with this girl... London.\u201d</p><p>He keeps looking into my eyes, really looking at me as he cups my cheek and grazes his thumb across my cheekbone. \u201cThings with London were always intense and easy because we never talked about anything, really. She made me feel free in a strange way, because she never made me feel like I had to give her anything. We just kind of coexisted.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cIt sounds like your dream.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI thought so, but I was wrong. I never really knew anything about her. It was easy and fun to be with her, but I think that was because we were high all the time. I think I liked the idea of her, but with you...\u201d He trails off, his eyelids lowering as he chooses his words carefully. \u201cGod, half the time you drive me crazy. You challenge my patience. Piss me off. Make me feel things... That\u2019s the thing, Lila. You make me feel things for you, even when I\u2019m fighting it. No one has ever done that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want to be with me?\u201d I\u2019m so confused. \u201cEven though we sometimes clash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I did a long time ago,\u201d he says, brushing my hair from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the desert. Back when I told you we should go on a road trip together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were kidding about that.\u201d</p><p>He slowly shakes his head, never taking his eyes off me. \u201cAt the time I told myself I was, but deep down I\u2019ve known for a while that there\u2019s no way I could leave you behind.\u201d His chest rises and falls as he takes a deep breath. \u201cI... I love you, Lila.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops in my chest. I\u2019ve heard the words uttered many times in the heat of the moment, from guy after guy wanting to get into my pants, but never like this. I\u2019ve never known someone like this before we had sex. I\u2019ve never been friends first.</p><p>Tears start to form in my eyes as the last six years pour through me. All those years of feeling worthless, unloved, unworthy of love. God, it hurt more than I let on. I can still feel the pain inside my body, haunting me, along with every choice I\u2019ve ever made in life. But the thing is, they\u2019re in the past, and moving forward I need to stop being so fixated on the things that have happened and focus on what I want to happen.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I blurt out, overly excited but not caring. \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>He releases a breath and then smiles. \u201cJesus, for a second there I thought you were going to reject me or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I say and kiss him softly on the lips, feeling the connection I\u2019ve never felt with any other guy. \u201cI could never reject you.\u201d</p><p>I start to move back, but he cups his hand around the back of my head and kisses me forcefully. Our lips melt together as we kiss each other passionately, his hands wandering all over my body, across my bare back, tracing a line down my spine. He tastes me, steals my breath away as I press closer to him, wishing that we could stay this way forever.</p><p>My heart knocks in my chest as he slips the straps of my dress down my shoulders. I can feel every single aspect of his touch and I embrace it. All those years I was dead inside, locked in a coffin I built myself, and I\u2019m finally free. The contact of our skin sends a rush through my body and a hunger surges through me. I want to feel what I felt the night we had sex. I need to right now. I pull away and he watches me with confusion as I slip my dress down my body, unable to wait any longer. I need him close to me more than I need air.</p><p>After I kick my dress to the floor, I return to his lap and straddle him. Before I reconnect my lips to his, I slip his shirt over his head and he watches me the entire time, his expression unreadable. I throw his shirt onto the floor and then trace my fingers along the lines of his muscles and the tattoos that brand them. Each one I\u2019m sure tells a story and one day in the future\u2014our future\u2014I\u2019ll have to get him to tell them to me. I splay my palm flat across his chest, feeling his heart beat against my hand. It thumps hard, erratically, nervously like my own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I whisper, lifting my gaze from his chest to his eyes.</p><p>His tongue slips out as he wets his lips. Then he places his hand over mine and brings it away from his chest and to his lips. \u201cI was thinking about how badly I missed you.\u201d He touches the bottom of my wrist with his lips and places a kiss delicately on my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou already said that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but it felt like something that needed to be said twice.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at the nice, sweet side of Ethan Gregory that I\u2019ve always loved. I\u2019d tell him, but he\u2019d probably argue, so instead I just kiss him. At first, the kiss starts off sweet, but then suddenly the pace quickens as he undoes the clasp of my bra, tosses it aside, and flips me on my back. I let out a blissful moan as his lips travel from my lips, to my jawline, collarbone, finally resting on my breast. He kisses my nipple, hard, nipping and tugging in a way that almost instantaneously pushes my body to the edge. My back bows up into him and I bite my lip, suppressing a scream as I thread my fingers through his hair, pushing his face closer, wanting more. I\u2019m still not used to it, feeling everything without being medicated. I wish it would always stay this way. I wish we\u2019d want each other as much as we do now. And who knows, maybe we\u2019ll turn out to be one of the lucky ones. Either way it\u2019s worth the risk.</p><p>Ethan is worth the risk.</p><p>Ethan</p><p>I told her I loved her and she said it back. I\u2019m going against everything I believe in and I don\u2019t care. I want her. Want to be with her. Want to do everything with her and the feeling is strange, crazy, unnatural to me, yet it makes me content.</p> <p>As my fingers wander all over her body, the contentment shifts to passion. I\u2019m trying to take it slow, not wanting her to think that sex is all I\u2019m after, but the desire to feel her, thrust inside her, press our bodies together becomes too overpowering. I rip off her bra, flip her on her back, and cover her body with mine. I suck on her nipples and she keeps whimpering and tugging at my hair and it only makes me more anxious to be inside her. Finally, I can\u2019t take it anymore. I kiss a path down her stomach and spread her legs apart with my hands. She lets out a sequence of moans as I slide my fingers inside her and feel her thoroughly until she screams out my name. When I pull them out, she starts to protest until I bury my face between her legs and slip my tongue inside the spot where my fingers just left.</p><p>\u201cJesus... Ethan...\u201d She groans breathlessly, her hips arching up as she threads her fingers through my hair, tugging at the roots. I kiss her and lick her until she\u2019s quivering and my dick feels like it\u2019s going to explode. Then I move my lips toward her mouth, but she sits up.</p><p>Her blue eyes are glazed over as she reaches for the button of my jeans and she flicks it undone, her fingers shaking as she attempts to remove my pants. I help her out and slip out of the jeans and my boxers and kick them to the side. I reach for her panties and jerk them down her legs, noting that she\u2019s quivering. I toss them aside, and then take a condom out of the back pocket of my jeans. I\u2019m about to thrust inside, but pause. She\u2019s trembling even more and I\u2019m starting to grow worried.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, needing to make sure because I know what she\u2019s been through and the last thing I ever want to do is pressure her.</p><p>She nods her head up and down, her legs opening up as I kneel between them, her hair spread all over the pillow. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know... I just want this\u2014I want you. Really, really bad.\u201d</p><p>Relief washes through me as I lower myself over her, lining our bodies together, and prop an arm on each side of her head. I kiss her tenderly, trying to calm her down, but she continues to shiver and it only amplifies when I slowly slip inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God...\u201d she cries out, writhing her hips to meet my movement, nearly pushing me over the edge way too soon. \u201cIt feels so good... it does... God, I love you...\u201d</p><p>The ecstasy in her eyes makes it hard not to come and the sound of those words leaving her lips makes the sensation even more intense. I thrust inside her, over and over again, thinking only about her, feeling every part of it, our bodies connecting. I\u2019d always believed that love was never worth it. That if I loved someone we\u2019d eventually ruin each other, but this has to be different. What I\u2019m feeling right now has to mean something more. This has to be real love.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I whisper, sealing our lips together and ultimately our hearts.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Lila</p><p>Ella seemed really nervous when we left her at the house to finish getting ready. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s normal, since she\u2019s about to commit herself to one person forever. I would have stayed with her, but I wanted to decorate around the cliff area where they are getting married. I picked up some flowers and candles on my way down, hoping to spruce up the dirt area as much as I could. Micha and Ethan helped me out and then we took a cab to the cliff so Ella could have the car. Luckily the wind wasn\u2019t blowing, otherwise the flames wouldn\u2019t have stayed lit and the flowers would have blown away. Thankfully, for one day, the weather decided to be nearly perfect, the sky almost blue, the waves of the ocean content, and the temperature lukewarm, especially for December.</p> <p>Ethan and I are standing near the edge of a short cliff, the ocean out before us. The sun shines brightly down onto the sand and glows against my skin. Micha is standing next to the minister, waiting for Ella to get here. It\u2019s been amazing to watch the two of them and what they\u2019ve gone through to get to this place and I find myself wondering if I\u2019ll ever get here myself. Maybe. Someday. Hopefully. But right now I\u2019m just focusing on Ethan and the fact that he makes me feel happy, one day at a time. And I mean genuinely, freely, breathtakingly happy.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate weddings, right?\u201d Ethan remarks, glancing at me from the corner of his eye. \u201cThey\u2019re super cheesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked cheesy.\u201d I nudge him with my elbow a little roughly and he winces.</p><p>He rolls his eyes, fidgeting with the collar of his button-down shirt that I made him wear. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019ll have my cheesy and nice moments, but most of the time I\u2019ll probably be a douche.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes in response to his eye roll and smooth out the wrinkles of my red dress. \u201cYou\u2019re such a liar. In fact, there are very few times I\u2019ve ever thought you were a douche.\u201d</p><p>He turns his head toward me, slipping his fingers through mine. \u201cNot even when I told you to sell your clothes.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, holding his gaze. \u201cI might have when you said it, but now I\u2019m thankful you did... You changed me, Ethan Gregory, and in a good way.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, but then leans in and kisses my cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you\u2019re about to watch something you created?\u201d I remark, resting my head on his shoulder as I watch Micha and the minister talking to each other. \u201cI mean, if it wasn\u2019t for us encouraging them to be together, they probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>He tips his head down and rests his cheek on my head. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. We are pretty amazing together.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes, breathing in his words. Together. He\u2019s said it so much, yet each time it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. \u201cWe really are.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m enjoying the moment, basking in Ethan\u2019s scent, the feel of him next to me, and how he makes me feel so complete inside instead of empty. I\u2019m not even that jealous that Ella is going to be getting married in just a few minutes, if she\u2019d just get her damn ass down here. In fact, I\u2019m happy for her.</p><p>I\u2019m seriously considering keeping my eyes shut forever and staying in the moment as long as possible, but the sound of Ethan\u2019s voice causes me to open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, man?\u201d he says as Micha heads off toward the turnout area where the taxi dropped us off.</p><p>He shakes his head, holding up his phone. \u201cElla just called, but the reception here sucks and dropped my call.\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem worried or anything but all I keep thinking about is how worried Ella looked when I left her at the house.</p><p>We wait around for a while, and the minister\u2019s starting to look worried, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat if something\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, glancing back in the direction of where the turnout area is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he says with a shrug, but there\u2019s a hint of doubt in his tone. We\u2019ve both seen so much happen between the two of them\u2014and with our own lives\u2014that we know better than to think everything will always work out.</p><p>\u201cHey, quit worrying,\u201d Ethan says, hooking his finger underneath my chin and forcing me to look at him. \u201cIt\u2019ll all work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that, though? I mean, what if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d he insists, gazing out at the ocean. \u201cNow would you relax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d I sigh, fidgeting with my hair.</p><p>The sunlight reflects in his eyes as he contemplates something deeply. \u201cYou know what? I have an idea that will get you to calm down.\u201d He steps toward the cliff, grabbing my arm and hauling me with him. \u201cI say we jump, like how Ella and Micha did right before she moved the ring.\u201d</p><p>I blink at him, stunned. \u201cThey jumped off a cliff right before they officially got engaged. Who told you that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMicha did.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, wishing Ella would have told me herself. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grins at me as he reaches into his pockets, takes out his wallet and cell phone, and tosses it on the ground. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I warily glance over the cliff, watching the waves crash against the rocky shore. \u201cBecause it looks dangerous and I could drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never let you drown,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cI\u2019d never let anything happen to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I say and I mean it. Whether he\u2019ll admit it or not, he saved me, not just from the drugs but from myself. I place my hand in his, trusting him, and we inch toward the edge. \u201cWe\u2019ll be wet for the wedding,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if Ella gets mad?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cI doubt Ella\u2019s going to get mad at you for being soaking wet at her wedding. In fact, she\u2019ll probably love you for doing something as dangerous as cliff jumping.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. She probably will, so I nod and clutch on to his hand. Neither of us counts off, yet somehow we manage to jump at the same time, like we\u2019re in tune with each other\u2019s thoughts. When we land, he still has my hand and we swim to the top together. We burst through the surface and I gasp for air, looking back up at the cliff.</p> <p>\u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe I just did that,\u201d I say, raising my hands above my head, my body dripping with water. I feel so liberated.</p><p>\u201cFeels good to be bad.\u201d He grins and winks at me. Water drips down his hair and his face, pooling on his eyelashes. He moves his arms, paddling to keep himself afloat as waves lull against the rocks.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of does.\u201d I swim after him, then float just in front of him when he stops moving.</p><p>He smiles at me. \u201cSo what\u2019s next on your bad-girl list? We have you out of those stuffy clothes, you cut your hair, and we\u2019ve got you looking for a job.\u201d</p><p>I consider what he said as the water laps against my body. \u201cHow about a road trip?\u201d</p> <p>His expression is blank as he stares at me, the water hitting against his back. \u201cYou think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIf you think you can handle being with me like that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s emotionless for only a moment, but then lets a grin emerge from his lips. \u201cI can handle that and more.\u201d He grabs my waist and drags me to him, crashing our lips together as powerfully as the waves hitting the sand.</p><p>I kiss him back, only pulling away for a moment to whisper, \u201cOkay, then, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>I return my lips to his and kiss him while the sun lowers in the sky, casting rays of pink and orange across the sky. The moment is perfect, even to a girl who never really believed in perfection, but who kind of does now. Ethan is perfection in a strange sort of way, if I really look at it, because he\u2019s real with me and I love him. He\u2019s not artificial and not what I\u2019m supposed to have. In fact, if my mother were here, she\u2019d tell me a thousand reasons why he\u2019s wrong for me, from the fact that he had tattoos to the fact that he\u2019s poor. He\u2019s the opposite of everything I was, but not what I am now, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>He\u2019s what I want. What I need. He\u2019s the only guy who\u2019s ever made me worthy of love. He changed me in the best way possible and showed me that it was okay to love someone. That not everyone out there will break and crush my heart. And the best part of all, the thing that I will forever love him for, is that he showed me that I was worth loving.</p> <p>After we finish kissing, we swim to the shore and then hike back up to the path that leads to the cliff area we jumped from. I\u2019m so happy at the moment, I can\u2019t stop smiling, until we get up there, then all my happiness diminishes.</p><p>The minister is gone and Micha is sitting there by himself on a rock with his phone in his hand. His shoulders are hunched over and his head is hung low.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, rushing over to him.</p><p>He raises his head up and it looks like he\u2019s about to cry. \u201cI can\u2019t get ahold of Ella. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d I say, wringing the water out of the bottom of my dress. \u201cShe\u2019s probably just running late.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why she won\u2019t answer her phone. And she was acting weird this morning, too.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my bottom lip because I noticed Ella\u2019s weirdness, too. I turn to Ethan and stick out my hand. \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d</p><p>His forehead creases as he walks backward and scoops up his phone off the ground. \u201cWhy? What are you going to do?\u201d</p> <p>I take the phone from him and smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to get ahold of Ella and get her down there, so these two can finally get where they should have been a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and then leans in to give me a deep, passionate kiss that warms me from head to toe and it fills me with the determination that Ella and Micha are going to work out, just like Ethan and I hopefully will. Because he makes me happy and loves me, like Micha makes Ella happy and loves her, and really when it all comes down to it, happiness and love are what\u2019s most important and what makes life worth living. </p> </body></html>"]
