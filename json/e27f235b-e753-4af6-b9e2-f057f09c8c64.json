I CAN do this. No problem.</p><p>It\u2019s simply a matter of letting my higher self take over, achieving enlightenment, and becoming a radiant being of white light.</p><p>Easy-peasy.</p> <p>Surreptitiously I adjust myself on my yoga mat so I\u2019m facing the sun directly, and push down the spaghetti straps of my top. I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t reach ultimate-bliss consciousness and get an even tan at the same time.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on a hillside in the middle of Sri Lanka at the Blue Hills Resort and Spiritual Retreat, and the view is spectacular. Hills and tea plantations stretch ahead, then merge into a deep blue sky. I can see the bright colors of tea pickers in the fields, and if I swivel my head a little, I can glimpse a distant elephant padding slowly along between the bushes.</p><p>And when I turn my head still further, I can see Luke. My husband. He\u2019s the one on the blue yoga mat, in the cutoff linen trousers and tatty old top, sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed.</p><p>I know. It\u2019s just unbelievable. After ten months of honeymoon, Luke has turned into a totally different person from the man I married. The old corporate Luke has vanished. The suits have disappeared. He\u2019s tanned and lean, his hair is long and sun-bleached, and he\u2019s still got a few of the little plaits he had put in on Bondi Beach. Round his wrist is a beaded bracelet he got in Tanzania, and in his ear is a tiny silver hoop.</p><p>Luke Brandon with an earring! Luke Brandon sitting cross-legged!</p> <p>As though he can feel my gaze, he opens his eyes and smiles, and I beam back happily. Ten months married. And not a single row.</p><p>Well. You know. Only the odd little one.</p><p>\u201cSiddhasana,\u201d says our yoga teacher, Chandra. He\u2019s a tall, thin man in baggy white yoga trousers, and he always speaks in a soft, patient voice. \u201cClear your minds of all extraneous thought.\u201d</p><p>Around me I\u2019m aware of the eight or nine others in the group moving into position on their mats. Obediently I place my right foot on my left thigh.</p><p>OK. Clear my mind. Concentrate.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to boast, but I find clearing my mind pretty easy. I don\u2019t quite get why anyone would find it difficult! I mean, not thinking has to be a lot easier than thinking, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p>In fact, the truth is, I\u2019m a bit of a natural at yoga. We\u2019ve only been on this retreat for five days but already I can do the Lotus and everything! I was even thinking I might set up as a yoga teacher when we go back home.</p><p>Maybe I could set up a partnership with Trudie Styler, I think in sudden excitement. God, yes! And we could launch a range of yoga wear, too, all soft grays and whites, with a little logo\u2014</p><p>\u201cFocus on your breathing,\u201d Chandra is saying.</p><p>Oh, right. Yes. Breathing.</p><p>Breathe in... breathe out. Breathe in... breathe out. Breathe\u2014</p><p>God, my nails look fab. I had them done at the spa \u2014 little pink butterflies on a white background. And the antennae are little diamonds. They are so sweet. Except one seems to have fallen off. I must get that fixed\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky.\u201d Chandra\u2019s voice makes me jump. He\u2019s standing right there, gazing at me with this look he has. Kind of gentle and all-knowing, like he can see right inside your mind.</p><p>\u201cYou do very well, Becky,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a beautiful spirit.\u201d</p> <p>I feel a sparkle of delight all over. I, Rebecca Brandon, n\u00e9e Bloomwood, have a beautiful spirit! I knew it!</p><p>\u201cYou have an unworldly soul,\u201d he adds in his soft voice, and I stare back, totally mesmerized.</p><p>\u201cMaterial possessions aren\u2019t important to me,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cAll that matters to me is yoga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have found your path.\u201d Chandra smiles.</p><p>There\u2019s an odd kind of snorting sound coming from Luke\u2019s direction, and I look round to see him looking over at us in amusement.</p><p>I knew Luke wasn\u2019t taking this seriously.</p><p>\u201cThis is a private conversation between me and my guru, thank you very much,\u201d I say crossly.</p><p>Although, actually, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. We were warned about this on the first day of the yoga course. Apparently, when one partner finds higher spiritual enlightenment, the other partner can react with skepticism and even jealousy.</p><p>\u201cSoon you will be walking on the hot coals.\u201d Chandra gestures with a smile to the nearby pit of smoldering ashy coals, and a nervous laugh goes round the group. This evening Chandra and some of his top yoga students are going to demonstrate walking on the coals for the rest of us. This is what we\u2019re all supposed to be aiming for. Apparently, you attain a state of bliss so great, you can\u2019t actually feel the coals burning your feet. You\u2019re totally pain free!</p><p>What I\u2019m secretly hoping is that it\u2019ll work when I wear six-inch stilettos, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chandra adjusts my arms and moves on, and I close my eyes, letting the sun warm my face. Sitting here on this hillside in the middle of nowhere, I feel so pure and calm. It\u2019s not just Luke who\u2019s changed over the last ten months. I have too. I\u2019ve grown up. My priorities have altered. In fact, I\u2019m a different person. I mean, look at me now, doing yoga at a spiritual retreat. My old friends probably wouldn\u2019t even recognize me!</p><p>At Chandra\u2019s instruction, we all move into the Vajrasana pose. From where I am, I can just see an elderly Sri Lankan man carrying two old carpetbags, approaching Chandra. They have a brief conversation, during which Chandra keeps shaking his head, then the old man trudges away over the scrubby hillside. When he\u2019s out of earshot, Chandra turns to face the group, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis man is a merchant. He asks if any of you are interested in gems. Necklaces, cheap bracelets. I tell him your minds are on higher things.\u201d</p><p>A few people near me shake their heads as though in disbelief. One woman, with long red hair, looks affronted.</p> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t he see we were in the middle of meditation?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHe has no understanding of your spiritual devotion.\u201d Chandra looks around the group seriously. \u201cIt will be the same with many others in the world. They will not understand that meditation is food for your soul. You have no need for... sapphire bracelet!\u201d</p><p>A few people nod in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cAquamarine pendant with platinum chain,\u201d Chandra continues dismissively. \u201cHow does this compare to the radiance of inner enlightenment?\u201d</p><p>Aquamarine?</p> <p>Wow. I wonder how much\u2014</p><p>I mean, not that I\u2019m interested. Obviously not. It\u2019s just that I happened to be looking at aquamarines in a shop window the other day. Just out of an academic interest.</p><p>My eye drifts toward the retreating figure of the old man.</p><p>\u201cThree-carat setting, five-carat setting, he keeps saying. All half price.\u201d Chandra shakes his head. \u201cI tell him, these people are not interested.\u201d</p><p>Half price? Five-carat aquamarines at half price?</p><p>Stop it. Stop it. Chandra\u2019s right. Of course I\u2019m not interested in stupid aquamarines. I\u2019m absorbed in spiritual enlightenment.</p> <p>Anyway, the old man\u2019s nearly gone now. He\u2019s just a tiny figure on top of the hill. In a minute he\u2019ll have disappeared.</p><p>\u201cAnd now.\u201d Chandra smiles. \u201cThe Halasana pose. Becky, will you demonstrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I smile at Chandra and prepare to get into position on my mat.</p><p>But something\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t feel contentment. I don\u2019t feel tranquillity. The oddest feeling is welling up inside me, driving everything else out. It\u2019s getting stronger and stronger...</p><p>And suddenly I can\u2019t contain it anymore. Before I know what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m running in my bare feet as fast as I can up the hill toward the tiny figure. My lungs are burning, my feet are smarting, and the sun\u2019s beating down on my bare head, but I don\u2019t stop until I\u2019ve reached the crest of the hill. I come to a halt and look around, panting.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s gone. Where did he vanish to?</p><p>I stand for a few moments, regaining my breath, peering in all directions. But I can\u2019t see him anywhere.</p><p>At last, feeling a little dejected, I turn and make my way back down the hillside to the group. As I get near I realize they\u2019re all shouting and waving at me. Oh God. Am I in trouble?</p> <p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d the red-haired woman\u2019s yelling. \u201cYou did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ran over the hot coals! You did it, Becky!\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I look down at my feet... and I don\u2019t believe it. They\u2019re covered in gray ash! In a daze, I look at the pit of coals \u2014 and there\u2019s a set of clear footprints running through it.</p><p>Oh my God. Oh my God! I ran over the coals! I ran over the burning hot smoldering coals! I did it!</p><p>\u201cBut... but I didn\u2019t even notice!\u201d I say, bewildered. \u201cMy feet aren\u2019t even burned!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d demands the red-haired woman. \u201cWhat was in your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can answer.\u201d Chandra comes forward, smiling. \u201cBecky has achieved the highest form of karmic bliss. She was concentrating on one goal, one pure image, and this has driven her body to achieve a supernatural state.\u201d</p><p>Everyone is goggling at me like I\u2019m suddenly the Dalai Lama.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, really,\u201d I say, with a modest smile. \u201cJust... you know. Spiritual enlightenment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you describe the image?\u201d asks the red-haired woman in excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWas it white?\u201d someone else chimes in.</p><p>\u201cNot really white...\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWas it a kind of shiny blue green?\u201d comes Luke\u2019s voice from the back. I look up sharply. He\u2019s gazing at me, totally straight-faced.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I say with dignity. \u201cThe color wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid it feel like...\u201d Luke appears to think hard. \u201cLike the links of a chain were pulling you along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good image, Luke,\u201d chimes in Chandra, pleased.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say shortly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t. Actually, I think you probably have to have a higher appreciation of spiritual matters to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Luke nods gravely.</p><p>\u201cLuke, you must be very proud.\u201d Chandra beams at Luke. \u201cIs this not the most extraordinary thing you have ever seen your wife do?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a beat of silence. Luke looks from me to the smoldering coals to the silent group and back to Chandra\u2019s beaming face.</p><p>\u201cChandra,\u201d he says. \u201cTake it from me. This is nothing.\u201d</p><p>After the class is finished everyone heads to the terrace, where cool drinks are waiting on a tray. But I stay on my mat, meditating, to show how dedicated I am to higher things. I\u2019m half concentrating on the white light of my being and half imagining running over hot coals in front of Trudie and Sting while they applaud admiringly, when a shadow falls across my face.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, O Spiritual One,\u201d says Luke, and I open my eyes to see him standing in front of me, holding out a glass of juice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t have a beautiful inner being,\u201d I retort, and casually smooth back my hair so the red dot painted on my forehead shows.</p><p>\u201cInsanely,\u201d agrees Luke. \u201cHave a drink.\u201d</p> <p>He sits down beside me on the ground and hands me the glass. I take a sip of delicious, ice-cold passion-fruit juice and we both look out over the hills toward the distant horizon.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I could really live in Sri Lanka,\u201d I say with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. The weather... the scenery... all the people are so friendly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the same in India,\u201d Luke points out. \u201cAnd Australia,\u201d he adds as I open my mouth. \u201cAnd Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>God, Amsterdam. I\u2019d completely forgotten we went there. That was after Paris. Or was it before?</p><p>Oh, yes. It was where I ate all those weird cakes and nearly fell in the canal.</p><p>I take another sip of juice and let my mind range back over the last ten months. We\u2019ve visited so many countries, it\u2019s kind of difficult to remember everything at once. It\u2019s almost like a blur of film, with sharp, bright images here and there. Snorkeling with all those blue fish in the Great Barrier Reef... the pyramids in Egypt... the elephant safari in Tanzania... buying all that silk in Hong Kong... the gold souk in Morocco... finding that amazing Ralph Lauren outlet in Utah...</p><p>God, we\u2019ve had some experiences. I sigh happily and take another sip of juice.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot to tell you.\u201d Luke produces a pile of envelopes. \u201cSome post came from England.\u201d</p><p>I sit up in excitement and start leafing through the envelopes.</p><p>\u201cVogue!\u201d I exclaim as I get to my special subscriber edition in its shiny plastic cover. \u201cOoh, look! They\u2019ve got an Angel bag on the front cover!\u201d</p><p>I wait for a reaction \u2014 but Luke looks blank. I feel a tiny flicker of frustration. How can he look blank? I read him out that whole piece about Angel bags last month, and showed him the pictures and everything.</p><p>I know this is our honeymoon. But just sometimes, I wish Luke was a girl.</p><p>\u201cYou know!\u201d I say. \u201cAngel bags! The most amazing, hip bags since... since...\u201d</p><p>Oh, I\u2019m not even going to bother explaining. Instead I gaze lustfully at the photograph of the bag. It\u2019s made of soft, creamy tan calfskin, with a transparent resin handle and discreet zipper. But what makes it unique is the beautiful winged angel handpainted on the front, with the name Gabriel underneath in diamant\u00e9. There are six different angels: Gabriel, Michael, Dante, Raphael, Uriel, and Ariel. All the celebrities have been fighting over them, and Harrods is permanently sold out. HOLY PHENOMENON says the headline beside the picture.</p><p>I\u2019m so engrossed, I barely hear Luke\u2019s voice as he holds out another envelope.</p><p>\u201cOoze,\u201d he seems to be saying.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I look up in a daze.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another letter,\u201d he says patiently. \u201cFrom Suze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze?\u201d I drop Vogue and grab it out of his hand.

I always forget how totally grand Suze is. When she sent us a Christmas card it was a picture of her husband Tarquin\u2019s castle in Scotland with FROM THE CLEATH-STUART ESTATE printed inside. (Except you could hardly read it because her one-year-old, Ernie, had covered it with red and blue fingerpaints.)</p><p>I tear it open and a stiff card falls out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an invitation!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cTo the christening of the twins.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at the formal, swirly engraving, feeling a slight pang. Wilfrid and Clementine Cleath-Stuart. Suze has had two more babies and I haven\u2019t even seen them. They must be about two months old by now. I wonder what they look like. I wonder how Suze is doing. So much has been going on without us.</p> <p>I turn the card over and see that Suze has scrawled a message.</p><p>I know you won\u2019t be able to come, but thought you\u2019d like it anyway... Hope you\u2019re still having a wonderful time!All our love, SuzexxxPS Ernie loves his Chinese outfit, thank you so much!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in two weeks,\u201d I say, showing Luke the card. \u201cShame, really. We won\u2019t be able to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d agrees Luke. \u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence. Then Luke meets my eye. \u201cI mean... you\u2019re not ready to go back yet, are you?\u201d he says casually.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say at once. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve been traveling for only ten months, and we planned to be away for at least a year. Plus, we\u2019ve got the spirit of the road in our feet now. Maybe we\u2019ll never be able to go back to normal life, like sailors who can\u2019t go back and live on the land.</p><p>I put the invitation back in its envelope and take a sip of my drink. I wonder how Mum and Dad are. I haven\u2019t heard much from them recently. In fact, the last time I called home, they both seemed a bit distracted. Mum hardly listened to my story about the elephant orphanage, and before I could ask Dad how he did in the golf tournament, he said he had to go.</p><p>And little Ernie will be walking by now. I\u2019m his godmother and I\u2019ve never even seen him walk.</p><p>Anyway. Never mind. I\u2019m having amazing world experiences instead.</p><p>\u201cWe need to decide where to go next,\u201d says Luke, leaning back on his elbows. \u201cAfter we finish the yoga course. We were talking about Malaysia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, after a pause. It must be the heat or something, but I can\u2019t actually get up much enthusiasm for Malaysia.</p><p>\u201cOr back to Indonesia? Up to the northern bits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I say noncommittally. \u201cOh look, a monkey.\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe I\u2019ve gotten so blas\u00e9 about the sight of monkeys. The first time I saw those baboons in Kenya I was so excited I took about six rolls of film. Now it\u2019s just, \u201cOh look, a monkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Nepal... or back to Thailand...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could go back,\u201d I hear myself saying out of nowhere.</p><p>How weird. I didn\u2019t intend to say that. I mean, obviously we\u2019re not going to go back yet. It hasn\u2019t even been a year!</p><p>Luke sits up straight and looks at me.</p> <p>\u201cBack back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say with a little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m just joking!\u201d I hesitate. \u201cAlthough...\u201d There\u2019s a still silence between us.</p><p>\u201cMaybe... we don\u2019t have to travel for a year,\u201d I say tentatively. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Luke passes a hand through his hair, and the little beads on his plaits all click together.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready to go back?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I feel a little thrill of trepidation. \u201cAre we?\u201d</p><p>I can hardly believe we\u2019re even talking about going home. I mean, look at us! My hair\u2019s all dry and sun-bleached, I\u2019ve got henna on my feet, and I haven\u2019t worn a proper pair of shoes for months.</p><p>An image comes to my mind of me walking down a London street in a coat and boots. Shiny high-heeled boots by L.K. Bennett. And a matching handbag.</p><p>Suddenly I feel a wave of longing so strong I almost want to cry.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough of the world.\u201d I look at Luke. \u201cI\u2019m ready for real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Luke takes my hand and weaves his fingers between mine. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for a while, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said!\u201d He seemed so into it!

When we set off on this trip, I told Luke I was determined we were going to be real travelers, like in The Beach, and sleep only in little huts.</p><p>That was before I\u2019d spent a night in a little hut.</p><p>\u201cSo when we say \u2018back\u2019 \u201d\u2014Luke pauses\u2014\u201cwe are talking London?\u201d</p> <p>He looks at me questioningly.</p><p>Oh God. Finally, it\u2019s decision time.</p><p>We\u2019ve been talking for ten months about where we should live after the honeymoon. Before we got married, Luke and I were living in New York. And I loved it. But I kind of missed home, too. And now Luke\u2019s U.K. business is expanding into more of Europe, and that\u2019s where all the excitement is. So he\u2019d like to go back to London, at least for a while.</p><p>Which is fine... except I won\u2019t have a job. My old job was as a personal shopper at Barneys New York. And I adored it.</p><p>But never mind. I\u2019m bound to find a new job. An even better one!</p> <p>\u201cLondon,\u201d I say decisively, and look up. \u201cSo... can we be back in time for the christening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d Luke smiles, and I feel a sudden leap of exhilaration. We\u2019re going to the christening! I\u2019m going to see Suze again! And my mum and dad! After nearly a year! They\u2019ll all be so excited to see us. We\u2019ll have so many stories to tell them!</p><p>I have a sudden vision of myself presiding over candlelit supper parties with all my friends gathered round, listening avidly to tales of faraway lands and exotic adventures. I\u2019ll be just like Marco Polo or someone! Then I\u2019ll open my trunk to reveal rare and precious treasures... everyone will gasp in admiration\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better let them know,\u201d says Luke, getting up.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait,\u201d I say, grabbing his trousers. \u201cI\u2019ve had an idea. Let\u2019s surprise them! Let\u2019s surprise everybody!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise everybody?\u201d Luke looks doubtful. \u201cBecky, are you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea! Everyone loves a surprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves a surprise,\u201d I repeat confidently. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>We walk back through the gardens to the main hotel \u2014 and I do feel a slight twinge at the thought of leaving. It\u2019s so beautiful here. All teak bungalows and amazing birds everywhere, and if you follow the stream through the grounds, there\u2019s a real waterfall! We pass the wood-carving center, where you can watch craftsmen at work, and I pause for a moment, inhaling the delicious scent of wood.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon!\u201d The head craftsman, Vijay, has appeared at the entrance.</p><p>Damn. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d be around.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Vijay!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a hurry. I\u2019ll see you later... Come on, Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Vijay beams and wipes his hands on his apron. \u201cI just wanted to tell you that your table is ready.\u201d</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>Slowly Luke turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cTable?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYour dining table,\u201d says Vijay in happy tones. \u201cAnd ten chairs. I show you! We display the work!\u201d He snaps his fingers and barks some orders and suddenly, to my dismay, about eight men troop out, carrying a huge carved teak table on their shoulders.</p><p>Wow. It\u2019s a tad bigger than I remembered.</p><p>Luke looks absolutely stunned.</p><p>\u201cBring the chairs!\u201d Vijay is bossing the men. \u201cSet it up properly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d I say in superbright tones.</p><p>\u201cYou ordered a dining table and ten chairs... without telling me?\u201d says Luke, goggling as the chairs arrive.</p><p>OK. I don\u2019t have many options here.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... my wedding present to you!\u201d I say with sudden inspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise! Happy wedding, darling!\u201d I plant a kiss on his cheek and smile hopefully up at him.</p><p>\u201cBecky, you already gave me a wedding present,\u201d says Luke, folding his arms. \u201cAnd our wedding was a fairly long time ago now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been... saving it up!\u201d I lower my voice so Vijay can\u2019t hear. \u201cAnd honestly, it isn\u2019t that expensive...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, it\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s the space! This thing\u2019s a monstrosity!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big. And anyway,\u201d I quickly add before he can reply, \u201cwe need a good table! Every marriage needs a good table.\u201d I spread my arms widely. \u201cAfter all, what is marriage about if not sitting down at the table at the end of the day and sharing all our problems? What is marriage, if not sitting together at a solid wooden table and... and eating a bowl of hearty stew?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHearty stew?\u201d echoes Luke. \u201cWho\u2019s going to make hearty stew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can buy it at Waitrose,\u201d I explain.</p><p>I come round the table and look up at him earnestly. \u201cLuke, think about it. We\u2019ll never again be in Sri Lanka with authentic wood-carvers right in front of us. This is a unique opportunity. And I\u2019ve had it personalized!\u201d</p><p>I point to the panel of wood running down the side of the table. There, beautifully carved in among the flowers, are the words Luke and Rebecca, Sri Lanka, 2003.</p> <p>Luke runs a hand over the table. He feels the weight of one of the chairs. I can see him relenting. Then suddenly he looks up with a slight frown.</p><p>\u201cBecky, is there anything else you\u2019ve bought that you haven\u2019t told me about?\u201d</p><p>I feel a nervous flip inside, which I disguise by pretending to examine one of the carved flowers.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I say at last. \u201cOr... you know. Maybe just the odd little souvenir along the way. Just here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cIt\u2019s been ten months, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d I look at the table again. \u201cCome on, Luke, you must love it. We can have fantastic dinner parties... and it\u2019ll be an heirloom! We can hand it down to our children\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off a bit awkwardly. For a moment I can\u2019t quite look at Luke.</p><p>A few months ago we had this huge big discussion and decided that we\u2019d like to try for a baby. But so far nothing\u2019s happened.</p><p>I mean, not that it\u2019s a big deal or anything. It will happen. Of course it will.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d says Luke, his voice a little gentler. \u201cYou\u2019ve won me over.\u201d He gives the table a pat, then looks at his watch. \u201cI\u2019m going to e-mail the office, tell them about our change of plans.\u201d He gives me a wry look. \u201cPresumably you weren\u2019t expecting me to burst open the door of the boardroom and yell \u2018Surprise, I\u2019m back!\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I retort, barely missing a beat.</p> <p>That is, actually, kind of what I\u2019d pictured. Except I\u2019d be there too, with a bottle of champagne and maybe some party poppers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite that stupid,\u201d I add witheringly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Luke grins at me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you order us some drinks and I\u2019ll be out in a moment.\u201d</p><p>As I sit down at a table on the shady terrace, I\u2019m just a tad preoccupied. I\u2019m trying to remember all the things I\u2019ve bought and had shipped home without telling Luke.</p><p>I mean, I\u2019m not worried or anything. It can\u2019t be that much stuff. Can it?</p><p>Oh God. I close my eyes, trying to remember.</p><p>There were the wooden giraffes in Malawi. The ones Luke said were too big. Which is just ridiculous. They\u2019ll look amazing! Everyone will admire them!</p><p>And there was all that gorgeous batik art in Bali. Which I did intend to tell him about... but then kind of never got round to it.</p> <p>And there were the twenty Chinese silk dressing gowns.</p><p>Which... OK, I know twenty sounds like quite a lot. But they were such a bargain! Luke just didn\u2019t seem to understand my point that if we bought twenty now, they would last us a lifetime and be a real investment. For someone who works in financial PR, he can be a bit slow off the mark sometimes.</p><p>So I snuck back to the shop and bought them anyway, and had them shipped home.</p><p>The thing is, shipping just makes everything so easy. You don\u2019t have to lug anything about \u2014 you just point and ship: \u201cI\u2019d like that shipped, please. And that. And that.\u201d And you give them your card and off it goes, and Luke never even sees it...</p><p>Maybe I should have kept a list.</p><p>Anyway, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.</p><p>And, I mean, we want a few souvenirs, don\u2019t we? What\u2019s the point of going round the world and coming back empty-handed? Exactly.</p><p>I see Chandra walking past the terrace and give him a friendly wave.</p><p>\u201cYou did very well in class today, Becky!\u201d he says, and comes over to the table. \u201cAnd now I would like to ask you something. In two weeks\u2019 time I am leading an advanced meditation retreat. The others are mainly monks and long-term yoga practitioners, but I feel you have the commitment to join us. Would you be interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d Then I pull a regretful face. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. Luke and I are going home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Chandra looks shocked. \u201cBut... you are doing so well. You are not going to abandon the path of yoga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll buy a video.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Chandra walks off, he looks a little shell-shocked. Which actually, isn\u2019t surprising. He probably didn\u2019t even realize you could get yoga videos. He certainly didn\u2019t seem to have heard of Geri Halliwell.</p><p>A waiter appears and I order a beer for Luke, plus a mango and papaya cocktail, which in the menu is called Happy Juice. Well, that just about suits me. Here I am in the sunshine, on my honeymoon, about to have a surprise reunion with all the people I love. Everything\u2019s perfect!</p><p>I look up to see Luke approaching the table, holding his handheld computer. Is it my imagination, or is he walking faster and looking more animated than he has for months?</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly is.\u201d He seems full of a suppressed energy. \u201cIt\u2019s going very well. In fact, I want to set up a couple of meetings for the end of this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was quick!\u201d I say in astonishment.</p><p>Blimey. I\u2019d thought it would take about a week just to get ourselves organized.</p><p>\u201cBut I know how much you\u2019re getting out of this yoga retreat,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo what I propose is that I go on ahead, and you join me later... and then we return to Britain together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, where are your meetings?\u201d I say, confused.</p><p>\u201cItaly.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appears with my Happy Juice and Luke\u2019s beer.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be separated from you!\u201d I say as the waiter retreats. \u201cThis is our honeymoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have had ten solid months together... \u201d Luke gently points out.</p><p>\u201cI know. But still...\u201d I take a disconsolate sip of Happy Juice. \u201cWhere are you going in Italy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNowhere exciting,\u201d Luke says after a pause. \u201cJust a... northern Italian city. Very dull. I recommend you stay here. Enjoy the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I look around, feeling torn. It is pretty nice here. \u201cWhich city?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cMilan,\u201d Luke says reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cMilan?\u201d I nearly fall off my chair with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Milan? I\u2019ve never been to Milan! I\u2019d love to go to Milan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Luke. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Definitely! It\u2019s the fashion capital of the world! I mean, it\u2019s got Prada... and Dolce\u2014\u201d I break off as I catch his expression. \u201cAnd... er... it\u2019s a place of great cultural interest which no modern traveler should miss. Luke, I have to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Luke shakes his head ruefully. \u201cI must be mad, but OK.\u201d</p> <p>Elated, I lean back in my chair and take a big slurp of Happy Juice. This honeymoon just gets better and better!</p><p>Two</p><p>OK, I CANNOT believe Luke was planning to come to Milan without me. How could he come here without me? I was made for Milan.</p><p>No. Not Milan, Milano.</p><p>I haven\u2019t actually seen much of the city yet except for a taxi and our hotel room \u2014 but for a world traveler like me, that doesn\u2019t actually matter. You can pick up the vibe of a place in an instant, like bushmen in the wild. And as soon as I looked round the hotel foyer at all those chic women in Prada and D&amp;G, kissing each other while simultaneously downing espressos, lighting cigarettes, and flinging their shiny hair about, I just knew, with a natural instinct: this is my kind of city.</p><p>I take a gulp of room-service cappuccino and glance across at my reflection in the wardrobe mirror. Honestly, I look Italian! All I need is some capri pants and dark eyeliner. And maybe a Vespa.</p><p>\u201cCiao,\u201d I say casually, and flick my hair back. \u201cS\u00ec. Ciao.\u201d</p><p>I could so be Italian. Except I might need to learn a few more words.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ec.\u201d I nod at myself. \u201cS\u00ec. Milano.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll practice by reading the paper. I open the free copy of Corriere della Sera, which arrived with our breakfast, and start perusing the lines of text. The first story is all about the president washing his piano. At least I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what presidente and lavoro pieno must mean.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Luke, I could really live in Italy,\u201d I say as he comes out of the bathroom. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the perfect country. It has everything! Cappuccinos... yummy food... Everyone\u2019s so elegant... You can get Gucci cheaper than at home... \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the art,\u201d says Luke, deadpan. \u201cDa Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper, for instance.\u201d</p><p>I was just about to mention the art.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously the art,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cI mean, the art goes without saying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I flick over a page of Corriere della Sera and briskly skim the headlines. Then my brain suddenly clicks.</p><p>I put the paper down and stare at Luke again.</p><p>What\u2019s happened to him?</p><p>I\u2019m looking at the Luke Brandon I used to know back when I was a financial journalist. He\u2019s completely clean-shaven, and dressed in an immaculate suit, with a pale green shirt and darker green tie. He\u2019s wearing proper shoes and proper socks. His earring is gone. His bracelet is gone. The only vestige of our travels is his hair, which is still in tiny plaits.</p> <p>I can feel a bubble of dismay growing inside. I liked him the way he was, all laid-back and disheveled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve... smartened up a bit!\u201d I say. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bracelet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the woman in the Masai Mara said we must never take them off!\u201d I say in shock. \u201cShe said that special Masai prayer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t go into a meeting with an old bit of rope round my wrist.\u201d</p> <p>Old bit of rope? That was a sacred bracelet, and he knows it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still got your plaits!\u201d I retort. \u201cIf you can have plaits, you can have a bracelet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping my plaits!\u201d Luke looks incredulous. \u201cI\u2019ve got a haircut booked in\u201d\u2014he consults his watch\u2014\u201cten minutes.\u201d</p><p>A haircut?</p><p>This is all too fast. I can\u2019t bear the idea of Luke\u2019s sun-bleached hair being snipped off and falling to the floor. Our honeymoon hair, all gone.</p><p>\u201cLuke, don\u2019t,\u201d I say, before I can stop myself. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Luke turns and looks at me more closely. \u201cBecky, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>No. I\u2019m not OK.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t cut off your hair,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cThen it will all be over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart... it is over.\u201d Luke comes over and sits down beside me. He takes my hands and looks into my eyes. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s over. We\u2019re going home. We\u2019re going back to real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say, after a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s just... I really love your hair long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go into a business meeting like this.\u201d Luke shakes his head so the beads in his hair click together. \u201cYou know that as well as I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to cut it off!\u201d I say, suddenly inspired. \u201cPlenty of Italian men have long hair. We\u2019ll just take the plaits out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it! I\u2019ll take them out! Sit down.\u201d</p><p>I push Luke down onto the bed and carefully edge out the first few little beads, then gently start to unbraid his hair. As I lean close, I can smell the business-y smell of Luke\u2019s expensive Armani aftershave, which he always wears for work. He hasn\u2019t used it since before we got married.</p><p>I shift round on the bed and carefully start unbraiding the plaits on the other side of his head. We\u2019re both silent; the only sound in the room is the soft clicking of beads. As I pull out the very last one, I feel a lump in my throat \u2014 which is ridiculous.</p><p>I mean, we couldn\u2019t stay on our honeymoon forever, could we? And I am looking forward to seeing Mum and Dad again, and Suze, and getting back to real life...</p><p>But still. I\u2019ve spent the last ten months with Luke. We haven\u2019t spent more than a few hours out of each other\u2019s sight. And now that\u2019s all ending.</p><p>Anyway, it\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be busy with a new job... and all my friends...</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d</p><p>I reach for my Paul Mitchell Gloss Drops, put some on Luke\u2019s hair, and carefully brush it out. It\u2019s a bit wavy, but that\u2019s OK. He just looks European.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou look brilliant!\u201d</p><p>Luke surveys his reflection doubtfully and for an awful moment I think he\u2019s going to say he\u2019s still getting a haircut. Then he smiles.</p><p>\u201cOK. Reprieved. But it will have to come off sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, suddenly feeling light again. \u201cBut just not today.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Luke gathers some papers together and puts them in his briefcase.</p><p>\u201cSo... who exactly are you meeting with today?\u201d</p><p>Luke did tell me, on the flight from Colombo \u2014 but they were serving free champagne at the time, and I\u2019m not entirely sure I took it all in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going after a new client. The Arcodas Group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now I remember. So what are they? Fund managers?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s company is called Brandon Communications, and it\u2019s a PR agency for financial institutions like banks and building societies and investment houses. That\u2019s kind of how we met, actually, during my days on Successful Saving magazine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d Luke snaps his briefcase shut. \u201cWe want to broaden out of finance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a while.

How does he know I\u2019m not going to go and see some famous statues or something?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go shopping!\u201d I say haughtily. \u201cI simply mentioned the shopping malls to show an interest in your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Luke gives me a quizzical look, which bugs me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually here for the culture.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cAnd because Milan is a city I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Luke nods. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t planning to visit any designer shops today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say kindly, \u201cI am a professional personal shopper. Do you really think I\u2019m going to get excited by a few designer shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>I feel a slight swell of indignation. Didn\u2019t we make vows to each other? Didn\u2019t he promise to respect me and not ever doubt my word?</p><p>\u201cYou think I came here just to go shopping? Well, take this!\u201d I reach for my bag, then take out my purse and thrust it at him.</p><p>\u201cBecky, don\u2019t be silly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it! I\u2019ll just have a simple walk around the city! I\u2019ll go and look at the cathedral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then.\u201d Luke shrugs and pockets my purse.</p> <p>Damn. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually take it.</p><p>Anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter, because I have another credit card hidden in my bag, which Luke doesn\u2019t know about.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, folding my arms. \u201cKeep my money. I don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll survive,\u201d says Luke. \u201cYou can always use the credit card you keep hidden in your bag.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>How does he know about that? Has he been spying on me?</p><p>This has to be grounds for divorce, surely.</p><p>\u201cHave it!\u201d I say furiously, reaching into my bag. \u201cHave everything! Take the shirt off my back!\u201d I throw my credit card at him. \u201cYou may think you know me, Luke. But you don\u2019t. All I want is to soak up a little culture, and maybe invest in the odd souvenir or local artifact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocal artifact?\u201d echoes Luke. \u201cBy \u2018local artifact\u2019 do you mean \u2018Versace shoes\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, after a short pause.</p><p>Which is true.</p><p>True-ish.</p><p>I was thinking more of M\u00edu M\u00edu. Apparently it\u2019s really cheap over here!</p><p>\u201cLook, Becky, just don\u2019t go overboard, OK?\u201d says Luke. \u201cWe\u2019re up to our luggage limits as it is.\u201d He glances at our open cases. \u201cWhat with the South American ritual mask and the voodoo stick... Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the ceremonial dancing swords... \u201d</p><p>How many times is Luke going to give me grief about the ceremonial dancing swords? Just because they ripped his stupid shirt.</p><p>\u201cFor the millionth time, they\u2019re presents!\u201d I say. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have shipped them. We have to have them with us as we arrive, otherwise we won\u2019t look like proper travelers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. All I\u2019m saying is, we don\u2019t have room for South American masks and six extra pairs of boots.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he thinks he\u2019s so funny.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m not like that anymore, OK?\u201d I say, a little crushingly. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up a little. I would have thought you might have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Luke picks up my credit card, scrutinizes it, then gives it back to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got a couple of hundred pounds left on this one, anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What?</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I say in outrage. \u201cThat\u2019s my private credit card!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t hide the statement under the mattress. The maid in Sri Lanka found it when she was making the bed and gave it to me.\u201d He kisses me and picks up his briefcase. \u201cEnjoy the city!\u201d</p><p>As the door closes I feel a tad disgruntled. Little does Luke know. Little does Luke know I was actually planning to buy him a present today. Years ago, when I first met him, Luke had this belt which he really loved, made of gorgeous Italian leather. But he left it in the bathroom one day and it got hot leg-wax on it.</p> <p>Which was not entirely my fault. Like I told him, when you\u2019re in total agony, you don\u2019t think \u201cWhat would be the most suitable implement to scrape burning wax off my shins?\u201d You just grab the nearest thing.</p><p>Anyway. So I was planning to buy him a replacement today. A little \u201cend of honeymoon\u201d gift. But maybe he doesn\u2019t deserve it if he\u2019s going to spy on me and read my private credit card statements. I mean, what a cheek. Do I read his private letters?</p><p>Well, actually I do. Some of them are really interesting! But the point is\u2014</p><p>Oh my God. I freeze, struck by a dreadful thought. Does that mean he saw how much I spent in Hong Kong that day he went off to see the stock exchange?</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>And he hasn\u2019t said anything about it. OK, maybe he does deserve a present, after all.</p><p>I take a sip of cappuccino. Anyway, I\u2019m the one laughing, not Luke. He thinks he\u2019s so clever, but what he doesn\u2019t know is that I\u2019ve got a secret genius plan.</p><p>Half an hour later I arrive downstairs at reception, wearing tight black trousers (not quite capri but close enough), a striped T-shirt, and a scarf knotted round my neck, European-style. I head straight for the foreign exchange desk and beam at the woman behind it.</p><p>\u201cCiao!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cIl...\u201d</p><p>I trail off into silence.</p><p>What was I thinking? That if I started confidently enough, with hand gestures, Italian would just pour naturally out of my mouth?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to change some money into euros, please,\u201d I say, switching into English. I reach into my bag and triumphantly pull out a bundle of creased-up notes. \u201cRupees, dirhams, ringgits...\u201d I dump the notes on the counter and reach for some more. \u201cKenyan dollars...\u201d I peer at a strange pink note I don\u2019t recognize. \u201cWhatever that one is...\u201d</p><p>It is incredible how much money I was carrying around with me without even noticing! I had loads of rupees in my bath bag, and a whole bunch of Ethiopian birrs inside a paperback book. Plus there were loads of odd notes and coins floating around at the bottom of my carry-on bag.</p><p>And the point is, this is free money! This is money we already had.</p><p>I watch excitedly as the woman sorts it all into piles. \u201cYou have seventeen different currencies here,\u201d she says at last, looking a bit dazed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been to lots of countries,\u201d I explain. \u201cSo, how much is it all worth?\u201d</p><p>As the woman starts tapping on a small computer, I feel quite excited. Maybe the exchange rates on some of these have moved in my favor. Maybe this is all worth loads!</p><p>Then I feel a bit guilty. After all, it\u2019s Luke\u2019s money too. Abruptly I decide that if it\u2019s more than a hundred euros, I\u2019ll give half back to him. That\u2019s only fair. But that\u2019ll still leave me with fifty! Not bad, for doing absolutely nothing!</p><p>\u201cAfter commission...\u201d The woman looks up. \u201cSeven forty-five.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeven hundred and forty-five euros?\u201d I stare at her in joy and amazement. I had no idea I was carrying around that kind of money! God, it just shows! All those people who say, \u201cLook after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves\u201d... they\u2019re right! Who would have thought it?</p><p>I\u2019ll be able to buy a present for Luke and a pair of M\u00edu M\u00edu shoes, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot seven hundred and forty-five.\u201d The woman scribbles it on a piece of paper and hands it to me. \u201cSeven euros, forty-five cents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My happy smile slips off my face. That can\u2019t be right.</p><p>\u201cSeven euros, forty-five cents,\u201d repeats the woman patiently. \u201cHow would you like that?\u201d</p><p>How can so much genuine money be worth only seven euros? It makes no sense. As I explained to the woman, you could buy absolutely loads in India for those rupees. You could probably buy a whole car... or a palace, even. But she wouldn\u2019t budge. Oh, well.</p><p>I start walking down the street, carefully following the map the hotel concierge gave me. He was such a helpful man. I explained to him how I wanted to take in the cultural sights of Milan, and he started talking about Da Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper, which he \u201cknew\u201d I would be desperate to see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Obviously I do want to see it. Very much so. But priorities are priorities. So I politely explained I was actually more interested in contemporary Italian culture, and he started going on about some artist who does short films about death.</p><p>So then I clarified that by \u201ccontemporary Italian culture\u201d I was really referring to cultural icons such as Prada and Gucci \u2014 and his eyes lit up in understanding. He marked a street for me which is in an area called the Golden Quadrilateral and is apparently \u201cfull of culture\u201d which he was \u201csure I would appreciate.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a sunny day with a light breeze, and the sunlight is glinting off windows and cars, and whizzy Vespas are zipping everywhere. God, Milan is cool. Every single person I pass is wearing designer sunglasses and carrying a designer handbag \u2014 even the men!</p><p>For a moment I consider buying Luke a continental handbag instead of a belt. I try to imagine him walking into the office with a chic little bag dangling from his wrist...</p> <p>Hmm. Maybe I\u2019ll stick to a belt.</p><p>Suddenly I notice a girl in front of me wearing a cream trouser suit, high strappy shoes, and a pink scooter helmet with leopard-print trim.</p><p>I stare at her, gripped with desire. God, I want one of those helmets. I mean, I know I haven\u2019t got a Vespa \u2014 but I could wear the helmet anyway, couldn\u2019t I? It could be my signature look. People would call me the Girl in the Vespa Helmet. Plus, it would protect me from muggers, so it would actually be a safety feature...</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll ask where she got it.</p><p>\u201cExcusez-moi, mademoiselle!\u201d I call out, impressed at my own sudden fluency. \u201cJ\u2019adore votre chapeau!\u201d</p> <p>The girl gives me a blank look, then disappears round a corner. Which, frankly, I think is a bit unfriendly. I mean, here I am, making an effort to speak her lang\u2014</p><p>Oh. Oh, right.</p><p>OK, that\u2019s a bit embarrassing.</p><p>Well, never mind. I\u2019m not here to buy Vespa helmets, anyway. I\u2019m here to buy a present for Luke. That\u2019s what marriage is all about, after all. Putting your partner first. Placing his needs before your own.</p><p>Plus, what I\u2019m thinking is, I can always fly back here for the day. I mean, it wouldn\u2019t take any time from London, would it? And Suze could come too, I think with sudden delight. God, that would be fun. I suddenly have an image of Suze and me, striding down the street, arm in arm, swinging our bags and laughing. A girly trip to Milan! We have to do it!</p><p>I reach another corner and stop to consult my map. I must be getting closer. He said it wasn\u2019t that far away...</p> <p>Just then a woman walks past me carrying a bag from Versace, and I stiffen with excitement. I have to be getting close to the source! This is just like when we visited that volcano in Peru, and the guide kept pointing out signs that we were nearing the core. If I just keep my eyes peeled for more Versace bags...</p><p>I walk forward a little more \u2014 and there\u2019s another one! That woman in oversize shades having a cappuccino has got one, plus about six zillion bags from Armani. She gesticulates to her friend and reaches inside one of them \u2014 and pulls out a pot of jam, with an Armani label.</p><p>Armani jam? Armani does jam?</p><p>Maybe in Milan everything has a fashion label! Maybe Dolce &amp; Gabanna does toothpaste. Maybe Prada does tomato ketchup!</p><p>I start walking on again, more and more quickly, prickling with excitement. I can sense the shops in the air. The designer bags are appearing more frequently. The air is becoming heavy with expensive scent. I can practically hear the sound of hangers on rails and zips being done up...</p><p>And then, suddenly, there it is.</p><p>A long, elegant boulevard stretches before me, with the chicest, most designer-clad people on earth milling about. Tanned, model-like girls in Pucci prints and heels are sauntering along with powerful-looking men in immaculate linen suits. A girl in white Versace jeans and red lipstick is pushing along a pram upholstered in Louis Vuitton monogrammed leather. A blond woman in a brown leather miniskirt trimmed with rabbit fur is gabbling into a matching mobile phone while dragging along her little boy, dressed head to foot in Gucci.</p><p>And... the shops. Shop after shop after shop.</p> <p>Ferragamo. Valentino. Dior. Versace. Prada.</p><p>As I venture down the street, my head swiveling from side to side, I feel giddy. It\u2019s complete culture shock. How long has it been since I\u2019ve seen a shop that wasn\u2019t selling ethnic crafts and wooden beads? I mean... it\u2019s been months! I feel like I\u2019ve been on some starvation cure, and now I\u2019m gorging on tiramisu with double cream.</p><p>Just look at that amazing coat. Look at those shoes.</p><p>Where do I start? Where do I even\u2014</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m paralyzed in the middle of the street, like the donkey in that Aesop\u2019s fable who couldn\u2019t choose between the bales of hay. They\u2019ll find me in years to come, still frozen to the spot, clutching my credit card. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly my eyes fall on a display of leather belts and wallets in the window of a nearby boutique.</p><p>Leather. Luke\u2019s belt. This is what I\u2019m here to buy. Focus.</p><p>I totter toward the shop and push open the door, still in a daze. At once I\u2019m hit by the overwhelming smell of expensive leather. In fact, it\u2019s so strong it actually seems to clear my head.</p><p>The shop is amazing. It\u2019s carpeted in pale taupe, with softly lit display cabinets. I can see wallets, belts, bags, jackets... I pause by a mannequin wearing the most amazing chocolate brown coat, all leather and satin. I stroke it fondly, then lift the price tag \u2014 and nearly faint.</p> <p>But, of course, it\u2019s in lire. I smile in relief. No wonder it looks so\u2014</p><p>Oh no. It\u2019s euros now.</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>I gulp, and move away from the mannequin.</p><p>Which just proves that Dad was right all along \u2014 the single currency was a huge mistake. When I was thirteen I went on holiday to Rome with my parents \u2014 and the whole point about lire was, the prices looked like a lot but they weren\u2019t really. You could buy something for about a zillion lire \u2014 and in real life it cost about three quid! It was fantastic!</p> <p>Plus, if you accidentally ended up buying a bottle of really expensive perfume, no one (i.e., your parents) could blame you, because, like Mum said, who on earth can divide numbers like that in their head?</p><p>As I start to look through a display of belts, a stocky middle-aged man comes out of a fitting room, chomping on a cigar and wearing an amazing black cashmere coat trimmed with leather. He\u2019s about fifty and very tanned, with close-cropped gray hair and piercing blue eyes. The only thing which doesn\u2019t look quite so good is his nose, which to be honest is a bit of a mishmash.</p><p>\u201cOy, Roberto,\u201d he says in a raspy voice.</p><p>He\u2019s English! His accent is weird, though. Kind of transatlantic meets cockney.</p><p>A shop assistant in a black suit with angular black glasses comes hurrying out from the fitting room, holding a tape measure.</p><p>\u201cYes, Signor Temple?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much cashmere is in this?\u201d The stocky man smooths down the coat critically.</p><p>\u201cSignore, this is one hundred percent cashmere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best cashmere?\u201d The stocky man lifts a warning finger. \u201cI don\u2019t want you palming me off now. You know my motto. Only the best.\u201d</p><p>The guy in black glasses gives a little wince of dismay.</p><p>\u201cSignore, we would not, er... palm you off.\u201d</p><p>The man gazes at himself in a mirror silently for a few seconds, then nods.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll take three. One to London.\u201d He counts off on stubby fingers. \u201cOne to Switzerland. One to New York. Got it?\u201d</p><p>The assistant in black glasses glances over at me, and I realize it\u2019s totally obvious I\u2019m eavesdropping.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI\u2019d like to buy this, please, and have it gift wrapped.\u201d I hold up the belt I\u2019ve chosen.</p><p>\u201cSilvia will help you.\u201d He gestures dismissively toward the woman at the till, then turns back to his customer.</p><p>I hand the belt over to Silvia and watch idly as she wraps it up in shiny bronze paper. I\u2019m half admiring her deft ability with ribbon and half listening to Mr. Cashmere, who\u2019s now looking at a briefcase.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like the texture,\u201d he states. \u201cFeels different. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have changed our supplier recently... \u201d The black glasses guy is wringing his hands. \u201cBut it is a very fine leather, signore... \u201d</p><p>He trails off as Mr. Cashmere takes his cigar from his mouth and gives him a look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re palming me off, Roberto,\u201d he says. \u201cI pay good money, I want quality. What you\u2019ll do is make me up one using leather from the old supplier. Got it?\u201d</p><p>He looks over, sees me watching, and winks.</p><p>\u201cBest place for leather in the world, this. But don\u2019t take any of their crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d I beam back. \u201cAnd I love that coat, by the way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery kind of you.\u201d He nods affably. \u201cYou an actress? Model?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no. Neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d He waves his cigar.</p><p>\u201cHow will you pay, signorina?\u201d Silvia interrupts us.</p><p>\u201cOh! Er... here you are.\u201d</p><p>As I hand over my Visa card I feel a glow of goodness in my heart. Buying presents for other people is so much more satisfying than buying for yourself! And this will take me up to my limit on my Visa card, so that\u2019s my shopping all finished for the day.</p><p>What shall I do next? Maybe I\u2019ll take in some culture. I could go and look at that famous painting the concierge was talking about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can hear a buzz of interest coming from the back of the shop and turn idly to see what\u2019s happening. A mirrored door to a stockroom is open, and a woman in a black suit is coming out, surrounded by a gaggle of eager assistants. What on earth is she holding? Why is everyone so\u2014</p><p>Then suddenly I catch a glimpse of what she\u2019s carrying. My heart stops. My skin starts to prickle.</p><p>It can\u2019t be.</p><p>But it is. She\u2019s carrying an Angel bag.</p> <p>Three</p><p>IT\u2019S AN ANGEL bag. In the flesh.</p><p>I thought they were all sold out everywhere. I thought they were totally impossible to get hold of.</p><p>The woman sets it down ceremoniously on a creamy suede pedestal and stands back to admire it. The whole shop has fallen silent. It\u2019s like a member of the royal family has arrived. Or a movie star.</p><p>I\u2019m transfixed.</p> <p>It\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s totally stunning. The calfskin looks as soft as butter. The handpainted angel is all in delicate shades of aquamarine. And underneath is the name Dante written in diamant\u00e9.</p><p>My legs are all wobbly and my hands feel sweaty. This is better than when we saw the white tigers in Bengal. I mean, let\u2019s face it. Angel bags are probably rarer than white tigers.</p><p>And there\u2019s one in front of my nose.</p><p>I could just buy it flashes through my brain. I could buy it!</p><p>\u201cMiss? Signorina? Can you hear me?\u201d A voice pierces my thoughts, and I realize Silvia at the till is trying to get my attention.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cYes.\u201d I pick up the pen and scribble any old signature. \u201cSo... is that a real Angel bag?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she says in a smug, bored tone, like a bouncer who knows the band personally and is used to dealing with besotted groupies.</p><p>\u201cHow much...\u201d I swallow. \u201cHow much is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo thousand euros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod.</p><p>Two thousand euros. For a bag.</p><p>But if I had an Angel bag I wouldn\u2019t need to buy any new clothes. Ever. Who needs a new skirt when you have the hippest bag in town?</p><p>I don\u2019t care how much it is. I have to have it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to buy it, please,\u201d I say in a rush.</p> <p>There\u2019s a stunned silence around the shop \u2014 then all the assistants burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot buy the bag,\u201d says Silvia pityingly. \u201cThere is a waiting list.\u201d</p><p>Oh. A waiting list. Of course there would be a waiting list. I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to join the list?\u201d she asks as she hands my Visa card back.</p><p>OK, let\u2019s be sensible. I\u2019m not really going to go on a waiting list in Milan. I mean, for a start, how would I pick it up? I\u2019d have to get them to FedEx it. Or come over specially, or\u2014</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hear my own voice saying. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>After I write down my details, Silvia pops the form in a drawer. \u201cWe will call you when one is available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd... when might that be?\u201d I try not to sound too anxious.</p><p>\u201cI cannot say.\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cHow many people are ahead of me on the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not disclose such details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tiny dart of frustration. I mean, there it is. There\u2019s the bag, a few feet away from me... and I can\u2019t have it.</p><p>Never mind. I\u2019m on the list. There\u2019s nothing more I can do.</p><p>I pick up the carrier bag containing Luke\u2019s belt and slowly walk away, pausing by the Angel bag. God, it\u2019s heart-stopping. The coolest, most beautiful bag in the world.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly struck by an idea.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering,\u201d I say, hurrying back to the till. \u201cDo you know if everyone on the waiting list actually wants an Angel bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are on the list.\u201d Silvia says it as though she\u2019s speaking to a total moron.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they might all have changed their minds,\u201d I explain, my words tumbling out in excitement. \u201cOr already have bought one! And then it would be my turn! Don\u2019t you see? I could have this bag!\u201d</p><p>How can she look so impassive? Doesn\u2019t she understand how important this is?</p><p>\u201cWe will be contacting the customers in turn,\u201d says Silvia. \u201cWe will be in touch if a bag becomes available for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it for you, if you like,\u201d I say, trying to sound helpful. \u201cIf you give me their numbers.\u201d</p><p>Silvia looks at me silently for a moment.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. We will be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, deflating. \u201cWell, thanks.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing more I can do. I\u2019ll just stop thinking about it and enjoy the rest of Milan. Exactly. I give a final, longing glance at the Angel bag, then head out of the shop. I\u2019m not going to obsess about this. I\u2019m not even going to think about it. I\u2019m going to focus on... culture. Yes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly I stop dead in the street. I\u2019ve given her the number of Luke\u2019s flat in London. But didn\u2019t he say something a while ago about putting in new phone lines?</p><p>What if I\u2019ve left an obsolete number?</p><p>Quickly I retrace my steps and burst into the shop again.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d give you another set of contact details, in case you can\u2019t get through.\u201d I rummage about in my bag and pull out one of Luke\u2019s cards. \u201cThis is my husband\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Silvia says a little wearily.</p><p>\u201cOnly... come to think of it, if you speak to him, I wouldn\u2019t mention the actual bag.\u201d I lower my voice a little. \u201cSay \u2018the Angel has landed.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Angel has landed,\u201d echoes Silvia, writing it down as though she makes coded phone calls all the time.</p><p>Which, now that I think about it, maybe she does.</p><p>\u201cThe person to ask for is Luke Brandon,\u201d I explain, handing over the card. \u201cAt Brandon Communications. He\u2019s my husband.\u201d</p> <p>Across the shop, I\u2019m aware of Mr. Cashmere looking up from a selection of leather gloves.</p><p>\u201cLuke Brandon,\u201d repeats Silvia. \u201cVery well.\u201d She puts the card away and gives me a final nod.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you phoned anyone on the list yet?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cSignora Brandon,\u201d snaps Silvia in exasperation. \u201cYou will have to wait your turn! I cannot do any better than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so sure about that?\u201d a raspy voice cuts in and we both look up to see Mr. Cashmere approaching us from across the shop.</p><p>What\u2019s he doing?</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Silvia says haughtily, and he winks at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them palm you off, girl.\u201d He turns to Silvia. \u201cIf you wanted to, you could sell her this bag.\u201d He jerks his stubby thumb at the Angel bag on the pedestal and puffs on his cigar.</p><p>\u201cSignor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been listening. If you haven\u2019t called anyone on the waiting list, they don\u2019t know this has come in. They don\u2019t even know it exists.\u201d He pauses meaningfully. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got this young lady here, wants to buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point, signore.\u201d Silvia smiles tightly at him. \u201cThere is a strict protocol...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have discretion. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t. Oy, Roberto!\u201d he suddenly calls. The man in the black glasses hurries over from somewhere in the back.</p><p>\u201cSignor Temple?\u201d he says smoothly, his eyes darting at me. \u201cEverything is all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted this bag for my lady friend, would you sell it to me?\u201d The man blows out a cloud of smoke and raises his eyebrows at me. He looks like he\u2019s enjoying this.</p> <p>Roberto glances at Silvia, who jerks her head at me and rolls her eyes. I can see Roberto taking in the situation, his brain working hard.</p><p>\u201cSignor Temple.\u201d He turns to the man with a charming smile. \u201cYou are a very valued customer. It is a very different matter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roberto says, after a pause.</p><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d The man looks at Roberto expectantly.</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cSilvia,\u201d Roberto says at last. \u201cWrap up the bag for the signorina.\u201d</p><p>Oh my GOD!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d says Silvia, shooting me a dirty look.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe this has happened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I don\u2019t know how to thank you!\u201d I stutter. \u201cThat\u2019s the most wonderful thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me, ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d The man inclines his head and extends his hand. \u201cNathan Temple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky Bloomwood,\u201d I say, shaking it. \u201cI mean, Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really wanted that bag.\u201d He raises his eyebrows appreciatively. \u201cNever seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was desperate for it!\u201d I admit with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to you!\u201d</p><p>Nathan Temple waves his hand in a \u201cdon\u2019t mention it\u201d gesture, then takes out a lighter and lights his cigar, which has gone out. When he\u2019s puffing away again he looks up.</p><p>\u201cBrandon... as in Luke Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Luke?\u201d I\u2019m amazed. \u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy reputation.\u201d He blows out a cloud of cigar smoke. \u201cHe has quite a name, your husband. He\u2019s coming back to the company after his year off, I understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nathan Temple winks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my eye on him for a while. Talented man. Couple of years ago, all the banks were launching online services. But the one that got all the publicity was SBG. Your husband\u2019s client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSignor Temple.\u201d Roberto comes bustling over with several carrier bags, which he hands to my new friend. \u201cThe rest will be shipped according to your orders... \u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man, Roberto,\u201d says Nathan Temple, clapping him on the back. \u201cSee you next year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease let me buy you a drink,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cOr lunch! Or... anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I have to go. Nice offer, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to thank you for what you did. I\u2019m so incredibly grateful!\u201d</p><p>Nathan Temple lifts his hands modestly.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe one day you can do a favor for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything!\u201d I exclaim eagerly, and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the bag. All right, Harvey.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, a thin blond man in a chalk-striped suit has appeared. He takes the bags from Nathan Temple and the two walk out of the shop.</p><p>I lean against the counter, radiant with bliss. I have an Angel bag. I have an Angel bag!</p><p>\u201cThat will be two thousand euros,\u201d comes a surly voice from behind me.</p><p>Oh, right. I\u2019d kind of forgotten about the two thousand euros part.</p> <p>I automatically reach for my purse \u2014 then stop. Of course. I don\u2019t have my purse. And I\u2019ve maxed out my Visa card on Luke\u2019s belt... and I have only seven euros in cash.</p><p>Silvia\u2019s eyes narrow at my hesitation.</p><p>\u201cIf you have trouble paying...\u201d she begins.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have trouble paying!\u201d I retort at once. \u201cI just... need a minute.\u201d</p><p>Silvia folds her arms skeptically as I reach into my bag again and pull out a Bobbi Brown Sheer Finish compact.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a hammer?\u201d I say. \u201cOr anything heavy?\u201d</p><p>Silvia is looking at me as though I\u2019ve gone completely crazy.</p><p>\u201cAnything will do... \u201d Suddenly I glimpse a hefty-looking stapler sitting on the counter. I pick it up and start bashing as hard as I can at the compact.</p> <p>\u201cOdd\u00eco!\u201d Silvia screams.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK!\u201d I say, panting a little. \u201cI just need to... there!\u201d</p><p>The whole thing has splintered. Triumphantly I pull out a MasterCard, which was glued to the backing. My Defcon One, code-red-emergency card. Luke really doesn\u2019t know about this one. Not unless he\u2019s got X-ray vision.</p><p>I got the idea of hiding a credit card in a powder compact from this brilliant article I read on money management. Not that I have a big problem with money or anything. But in the past, I have had the odd little... crisis.</p><p>So this idea really appealed to me. What you do is, you keep your credit card somewhere really inaccessible, like frozen in ice or sewn into the lining of your bag, so you\u2019ll have time to reconsider before making each purchase. Apparently this simple tactic can cut your unnecessary purchases by 90 percent.</p><p>And I have to say, it really does work! The only, tiny, flaw is, I keep having to buy new powder compacts, which is getting a bit expensive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay with this,\u201d I say, and hand it to Silvia, who is peering at me as though I\u2019m a dangerous lunatic. She swipes it gingerly through her machine, and a minute later I\u2019m scrawling my signature on the slip. I thrust it back at her, and she files it away in a drawer.</p><p>There\u2019s a tiny pause. I\u2019m almost exploding with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSo... can I have it?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d she says sulkily, and hands me the creamy carrier.</p><p>My hands close over the cord handles and I feel a surge of pure, unadulterated joy.</p><p>It\u2019s mine.</p><p>As I get back to the hotel that evening I\u2019m floating on air. This has been one of the best days of my life. I spent the whole afternoon walking up and down the via Montenapoleone with my new Angel bag prominently displayed on my shoulder... and everyone admired it. In fact, they didn\u2019t just admire it... they gawped at it. It was like I was a sudden celebrity!</p><p>About twenty people came up to me and asked where I got it, and a woman in dark glasses who had to be an Italian movie star got her driver to come and offer me three thousand euros for it. And best of all, all I kept hearing was people saying, \u201cLa ragazza con la borsa di Angel\u201d! Which I worked out means the Girl with the Angel Bag! That\u2019s what they were calling me!</p><p>I drift blissfully through the revolving doors into the foyer of the hotel to see Luke standing by the reception desk.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d he says, sounding relieved. \u201cI was beginning to worry! Our taxi\u2019s here.\u201d He ushers me out into a waiting taxi and slams the door. \u201cLinate Airport,\u201d he says to the driver, who immediately zooms into an oncoming stream of traffic, to a chorus of horns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d I say, trying not to flinch as we\u2019re nearly hit by another taxi. \u201cHow was the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went well! If we can get the Arcodas Group as clients it\u2019ll be seriously good news. They\u2019re expanding hugely at the moment. It\u2019s going to be an exciting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... do you think you\u2019ll get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to woo them. When we get back I\u2019m going to start preparing a pitch. But I\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m definitely hopeful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell done!\u201d I beam at him. \u201cAnd was your hair OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair was fine.\u201d He gives a wry smile. \u201cIn fact... it was admired by all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I say with delight. \u201cI knew it would be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how was your day?\u201d says Luke as we swing round a corner at about a hundred miles an hour.</p><p>\u201cIt was fantastic!\u201d I\u2019m glowing all over. \u201cAbsolutely perfect. I adore Milan!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Luke looks intrigued. \u201cEven without this?\u201d He reaches into his pocket and produces my purse.</p><p>God, I\u2019d forgotten all about that.</p><p>\u201cEven without my purse!\u201d I say with a little laugh. \u201cAlthough... I did manage to buy you a little something.\u201d</p><p>I hand over the bronze-wrapped package and watch excitedly as Luke pulls out the belt.</p><p>\u201cBecky, that\u2019s... wonderful!\u201d he says. \u201cAbsolutely...\u201d He trails off, turning it over in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to replace the one I ruined,\u201d I explain. \u201cWith the hot wax, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember.\u201d He sounds utterly touched. \u201cAnd... this is really all you bought in Milan? A present for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p><p>I give a kind of noncommittal shrug and clear my throat, playing for time.</p><p>Marriages are based on honesty and trust. If I don\u2019t tell him about the Angel bag, then I\u2019m betraying that trust.</p><p>But if I do tell him... I\u2019ll have to explain about my Defcon One, code-red-emergency credit card. Which I\u2019m not sure is such a solid idea.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to spoil the last precious moments of our honeymoon with some stupid argument.</p><p>But we\u2019re married, I think in a rush of emotion. We\u2019re husband and wife! We shouldn\u2019t have secrets! OK, I\u2019m going to tell him. Right now.</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Luke cuts me off, his voice a little gruff. \u201cBecky, I want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Apologize?</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d changed. You said you\u2019d grown up. And... you have.\u201d He spreads his hands. \u201cTo be honest, I was expecting you to come back to the hotel having made some huge, extravagant purchase.\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cEr... Luke...\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself,\u201d he says, frowning. \u201cHere you are, your first visit to the fashion capital of the world \u2014 and all you\u2019ve bought is a present for me. Becky... I\u2019m really moved.\u201d He exhales sharply. \u201cChandra was right. You do have a beautiful spirit.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. This is my cue to tell him the truth.</p><p>But how can I tell him I don\u2019t have a beautiful spirit, I have a crappy old normal one?</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I find myself obsessively refolding the bronze wrapping paper. \u201cEr... you know. It\u2019s just a belt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a belt to me,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s... a symbol of our marriage.\u201d He clasps my hand for a few moments, then smiles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry... what did you want to say?\u201d</p><p>I could still come clean.</p><p>I could still do it.</p><p>\u201cUm... well... I was just going to tell you... the buckle\u2019s adjustable.\u201d I give him a slightly sickly smile and turn away, pretending to be fascinated by the view out the window.</p><p>OK. So I didn\u2019t tell the truth.</p><p>But in my defense, if he\u2019d just paid attention when I\u2019d read him Vogue he would have seen for himself. I mean, I\u2019m not hiding it or anything. Here I am with one of the most coveted status symbols in the world on my arm \u2014 and he hasn\u2019t even noticed!</p><p>And anyway, this is absolutely the last time I lie to him. From now on, no more white lies, no more gray lies, no more fibs. We will have a perfect marriage of honesty and truth. Yes. Everyone will admire our harmonious, loving ways, and people will call us the Couple Who\u2014</p><p>\u201cLinate Airport!\u201d The driver\u2019s voice interrupts my thoughts. I turn and look at Luke with a sudden apprehensive thrill.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d he says, and meets my eyes. \u201cStill want to go home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I reply firmly, ignoring the nervous flutters in my stomach.</p><p>I get out of the taxi and stretch my legs. Passengers are milling about with trolleys, and a plane is taking off with a thunderous roar, almost right above me.</p><p>God, we\u2019re really doing it. In a few hours we\u2019ll be in London. After all these months traveling.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThere was a message from your mother on my mobile this afternoon. She wanted to know if we were still in Sri Lanka, or had we gone to Malaysia yet?\u201d</p> <p>He lifts his eyebrows comically at me, and I feel a giggle rise. They are all going to get such a shock! They\u2019re all going to be so thrilled to see us!</p><p>And suddenly I\u2019m full of excitement. We\u2019re on our way home!</p><p>Four</p><p>OH MY GOD. We\u2019ve done it. We\u2019re back! We\u2019re actually back on English soil.</p><p>Or, at least, English tarmac. We spent last night in Luke\u2019s flat, and now we\u2019re driving along the Surrey roads in a hired car, all ready to surprise Mum and Dad. In about two minutes we\u2019ll arrive at their house! It\u2019s just after eleven, so they\u2019ll be having coffee in the garden as usual, with no idea!</p> <p>I can barely keep still for excitement. In fact, I keep banging my knee on the South American tribal mask. I can just see the looks on Mum and Dad\u2019s faces when they see us! Mum\u2019s face will light up, and Dad will look astounded, then his face will break into a smile... and we\u2019ll be running to each other through the clouds of smoke...</p><p>Actually, maybe there won\u2019t be any clouds of smoke. I\u2019m thinking of The Railway Children. But anyway, it\u2019ll be fantastic. The most fantastic reunion ever!</p><p>To be honest, Mum and Dad have probably found it quite hard-going without me. I\u2019m their only daughter, and this is the longest they\u2019ve ever had to go without seeing me. Ten whole months.</p><p>I will so make their day, coming back home.</p><p>We swing into Mayfield Avenue and for the first time I feel just the tiniest twinge of nerves.</p><p>\u201cLuke, should we have called?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cToo late now,\u201d Luke replies calmly, and signals left.</p><p>We\u2019re nearly at our street. Oh God. I really am starting to feel jittery.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re so shocked to see us that they have heart attacks?\u201d I say in sudden panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Luke laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><p>And now we\u2019re in Elton Road, my parents\u2019 road. We\u2019re coming up to their house. We\u2019re here.</p><p>Luke pulls into the drive and turns off the engine. For a moment neither of us moves.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>Feeling suddenly self-conscious, I get out of the car and slam the door. It\u2019s a bright, sunny day and the street is quiet, apart from a few birds twittering and the distant sound of a lawn mower.</p> <p>I walk up to the front door, hesitate, and then, with a sudden surge of excitement, lift my hand and firmly press the bell.</p><p>Nothing happens.</p><p>I wait a few moments, then ring again. But there\u2019s silence.</p><p>They\u2019re not in.</p><p>How can they not be in?</p><p>I feel indignant. Where on earth are my parents? They\u2019re always home! That\u2019s where they belong! Don\u2019t they realize their only beloved daughter is back from her round-the-world trip?</p><p>\u201cWe could go for a coffee and come back later,\u201d suggests Luke.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I say, trying to hide my disappointment.</p><p>This has ruined my whole plan. I was all ready for our great emotional reunion \u2014 not going off for a stupid cup of coffee!</p><p>Disconsolate, I walk up the path and lean on the wrought-iron gate. I fiddle with the broken catch, which Dad has said for twenty years he\u2019s going to mend, and look at the roses which Mum and Dad had put in last year for our wedding. God, we\u2019ve been married nearly a year. That\u2019s a weird thought.</p><p>Suddenly I hear the distant sound of voices traveling along the street. I raise my head and squint. A pair of figures has just rounded the corner.</p><p>It\u2019s them! It\u2019s Mum and Dad! Mum\u2019s in a print dress and Dad\u2019s in a pink short-sleeve shirt, and they both look tanned and healthy.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I shriek. \u201cDad!\u201d I open my arms wide. \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>Mum and Dad look up, and both freeze to the spot. Suddenly I notice they\u2019ve got someone else with them. Some woman. Or girl. I can\u2019t see properly in this bright sunlight.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I cry again. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>The strange thing is, they aren\u2019t moving. They must be too shell-shocked by my appearance or something. Maybe they think I\u2019m a ghost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d I yell. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Becky! Surprise!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, to my utter astonishment, Mum and Dad start retreating.</p><p>What... What are they doing? They were supposed to be running toward me.</p><p>They disappear round the corner and for a few moments I\u2019m too baffled to speak.</p><p>\u201cLuke, was that Mum and Dad?\u201d I say at last.</p> <p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Luke sounds equally puzzled.</p><p>\u201cAnd did they really... run away from me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stricken. My own parents, running away from me as though I\u2019ve got the plague.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Luke says quickly. \u201cOf course not. They probably just didn\u2019t see you. Look!\u201d He suddenly points. \u201cThere they are again.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Mum and Dad have appeared round the corner again, this time without the girl. They walk along for a few steps, then Dad dramatically grabs Mum and points at me.</p> <p>\u201cLook!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Mum exclaims in a stilted voice. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true!\u201d</p><p>She sounds just like she did in the amateur dramatics Agatha Christie last year, when she played the lady who discovered the body.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Luke!\u201d Dad calls.</p><p>And now they really are running toward us, and I feel a huge swell of emotion rising.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I shout. \u201cDad! We\u2019re back!\u201d</p> <p>I race toward them, throwing my hands out. I land in Dad\u2019s arms, and the next moment Mum\u2019s there too, and we\u2019re all in a great big hug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home!\u201d Dad exclaims. \u201cWelcome back, darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Mum peers at me anxiously. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine! We just decided to come home early! We wanted to see you all!\u201d I squeeze Mum tightly. \u201cWe knew you\u2019d be missing us!\u201d</p><p>All three of us walk back to the house, where Dad shakes Luke\u2019s hand and Mum gives him an enormous hug.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says, looking from Luke to me. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it. Luke, your hair! It\u2019s so long!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He grins at me. \u201cIt\u2019ll be coming off before I go to work.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth automatically to protest, then close it again. I\u2019m feeling too joyful to start arguing. Instead I beam happily back at him, my arm still linked inside Dad\u2019s. This is how I imagined it. Everyone together and happy. Although... I\u2019m still wondering what was going on earlier.</p> <p>Impulsively I hug Mum again with my free arm. \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you, darling!\u201d She hugs me back and I inhale the familiar scent of her Green Irish Tweed perfume, which she\u2019s been wearing as long as I can remember.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear!\u201d I laugh. \u201cBecause it almost looked like you were...\u201d I break off, feeling a bit awkward.</p><p>\u201cWhat, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it kind of looked as if you were... trying to avoid me!\u201d I give another little laugh, to show what a ridiculous idea this is.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 and I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think I see Mum and Dad glance at each other.</p><p>\u201cDad dropped his spectacles!\u201d says Mum brightly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Dad chimes in heartily. \u201cI dropped my specs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to go back for them,\u201d Mum explains.</p><p>Both she and Dad are watching me with alert expressions.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? Are they hiding something?</p><p>\u201cIs that Becky?\u201d A shrill voice pierces the atmosphere, and I look round to see Janice, our next-door neighbor, peering over the fence. She\u2019s wearing a pink flowery dress with matching eyeshadow, and her hair has been dyed a very strange shade of auburn. \u201cBecky!\u201d She clasps her hands breathlessly to her chest. \u201cIt is you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Janice!\u201d I say, trying to hide my discomfiture. \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so well!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cDon\u2019t they look well?\u201d she says to my parents. \u201cSo brown!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s traveling for you,\u201d I say nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd Luke! You look just like Crocodile Dundee!\u201d Janice is goggling at both of us with open admiration, and I can\u2019t help feeling gratified.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d says Mum. \u201cAnd you can tell us all about it!\u201d</p><p>This is the moment I\u2019ve pictured so many times. Sitting down with friends and family and telling all about our foreign adventures. Spreading out a crinkly map... describing sunrises over mountains... looking at the avid faces... listening to the gasps of admiration...</p><p>Except that now it\u2019s actually happening, it isn\u2019t going quite like I imagined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you go to Tenerife?\u201d Janice keeps interrupting as I try to describe wading through the Amazon. \u201cOr Majorca? You can get some lovely packages... \u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no,\u201d I say, feeling a twinge of annoyance. \u201cWe went to Africa... India...\u201d I spread my arms. \u201cEverywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand the heat.\u201d Janice shakes her head. \u201cNever could. Even in Florida.\u201d She suddenly brightens. \u201cDid you go to Disneyland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh well.\u201d Janice looks sympathetic. \u201cNever mind. Maybe next time!\u201d</p><p>Next time? What, next time we spend ten months traveling round the world?</p><p>\u201cIt certainly sounds like a lovely holiday,\u201d she adds encouragingly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a holiday! I want to exclaim. It was a traveling experience! Honestly. I bet when Christopher Columbus came back from America, people didn\u2019t meet him off the boat with \u201cOoh, Christopher, did you go to Disneyland?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at Mum and Dad, but they\u2019re not even listening. They\u2019re standing by the sink, and Mum\u2019s murmuring something to Dad.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like this. There is definitely something going on. I glance at Luke, and he\u2019s watching Mum and Dad too.</p><p>\u201cWe brought you presents!\u201d I exclaim loudly, reaching for my carrier bag. \u201cMum! Dad! Have a look!\u201d</p><p>With some difficulty I pull out the South American mask and present it to Mum. It\u2019s in the shape of a dog\u2019s face, with big teeth and huge circular eyes, and I have to say, it looks pretty impressive.</p><p>\u201cI brought it all the way back from Paraguay!\u201d I add with a glow of pride.</p><p>I feel like such an explorer! Here I am, bringing rare artifacts of the indigenous South American culture to Oxshott. I mean, how many people in Britain have even seen one of these? Maybe a museum will ask to borrow it for an exhibition or something!</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d says Mum, turning it over a little nervously. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional ritual mask made by Chiriguano Indians, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Janice says brightly.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to Paraguay, Janice?\u201d I say, taken aback.</p><p>\u201cOh no, love.\u201d She takes a sip of coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them in John Lewis.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I can\u2019t quite speak.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen them in... John Lewis?\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cIn Kingston. The gift department.\u201d She beams. \u201cYou can buy everything in John Lewis these days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever knowingly undersold,\u201d chimes in Mum.</p><p>I do not believe this. I\u2019ve lugged this mask approximately six thousand miles around the globe. It was supposed to be a rare and exotic treasure. And all the time it\u2019s been on sale at bloody John Lewis.</p> <p>Mum glimpses my face.</p><p>\u201cBut yours will be the real thing, love!\u201d she says quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ll put it on the mantelpiece next to Dad\u2019s golf trophy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say a bit gloomily. I glance up at Dad, and he\u2019s still staring out the window, not listening to a word. Maybe I\u2019ll give him his present later.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s been happening here?\u201d I say, taking a cup of coffee from Mum. \u201cHow\u2019s Martin? And Tom?\u201d I ask Janice.</p><p>\u201cBoth well, thank you!\u201d says Janice. \u201cTom\u2019s living with us for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I give an understanding nod.</p><p>Tom is Janice and Martin\u2019s son, and he\u2019s had a bit of a disaster with his marriage. His wife, Lucy, left him, basically because he wouldn\u2019t have a tattoo done to match hers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve sold their house,\u201d Janice says, looking wistful. \u201cDid very well out of it, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is he OK?\u201d</p><p>Mum and Janice exchange looks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been throwing himself into his hobbies,\u201d Janice says at last. \u201cKeeping himself busy. His new thing is woodworking. He\u2019s made all sorts of things for us!\u201d She looks slightly beleaguered. \u201cThree garden benches... two bird tables... and now he\u2019s working on a two-story summerhouse in the garden!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I say politely. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>An oven timer suddenly starts pinging, and I look up in surprise. Has Mum taken to baking while we\u2019ve been away?</p><p>\u201cAre you cooking something?\u201d I peer at the oven, which appears to be dead.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mum gives a trill of laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s to remind me to check eBay.\u201d</p><p>\u201ceBay?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cWhat do you mean, eBay?\u201d</p><p>How would Mum know about eBay? She doesn\u2019t know anything about computers. Two years ago I suggested she give Luke a new mouse mat for Christmas and she went to a pet shop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, darling!

Janice and I did a course. We\u2019ve gone broadband!\u201d She looks at me seriously. \u201cLet me give you a word of advice, Becky. If you\u2019re going broadband, I\u2019d install a decent firewall.\u201d</p><p>OK. This is all wrong. Parents are not supposed to know more about computers than their children. I nod carelessly and take a sip of coffee, trying to hide the fact that I don\u2019t have a clue what a firewall is.</p> <p>\u201cJane, it\u2019s ten to twelve,\u201d Janice says cautiously to Mum. \u201cAre you going to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mum says. \u201cYou go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I look from face to face. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d says Mum, putting down her coffee cup. \u201cIt\u2019s just we agreed to go to the Marshalls\u2019 lunch party today, with Janice and Martin. But don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll send our apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d I say at once. \u201cYou must go. We don\u2019t want to mess up your day.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d says Mum.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to say that. She was supposed to say, \u201cHow could my precious daughter mess up my day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say, in overbright tones. \u201cYou go to your lunch party and we\u2019ll have a proper chat later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d says Mum. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pop over and get ready,\u201d says Janice. \u201cLovely to see you back, Becky!\u201d</p><p>As she disappears through the kitchen door I look at Dad, who\u2019s still staring out the window, brooding.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Dad?\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, turning round with a quick smile. \u201cI\u2019m just a little distracted at the moment. Thinking about... a golf match I\u2019ve got next week. Very important.\u201d He mimes playing a putt.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to sound cheerful.</p><p>But inside I feel more and more uneasy. He\u2019s not really thinking about golf. Why is he so cagey?</p><p>What is going on?</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I say lightly. \u201cWho was that I saw you with earlier? That woman you were with.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019ve let off a gunshot or something. Mum and Dad are both paralyzed. I can see their eyes darting toward each other, then looking away again. They both look totally panic-stricken.</p><p>\u201cWoman?\u201d says Mum at last. \u201cI didn\u2019t...\u201d She looks at Dad. \u201cDid you see a woman, Brian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Becky means... that passerby,\u201d he says in a stilted tone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d exclaims Mum in her theatrical voice again. \u201cThere was a woman just passing by on the street. A stranger. That must have been it, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d</p><p>I try to smile, but inside I feel a bit sick. Are Mum and Dad lying to me?</p><p>\u201cWell... you go off to your lunch party!\u201d I say. \u201cHave a great time!\u201d</p><p>As the front door slams I feel like bursting into tears. I was so looking forward to today. But now I almost wish we\u2019d never come back. No one seems particularly excited to see us. My rare, exotic treasure isn\u2019t exotic or rare. And why are Mum and Dad being so weird?</p><p>\u201cDo you want another cup of coffee?\u201d asks Luke.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I scuff my foot on the kitchen floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admit in a small voice. \u201cNot really. Coming home isn\u2019t like I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Luke holds out his arms and I nestle into his chest. \u201cWhat were you expecting? That they would drop everything and throw a party?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!

But still, I can\u2019t believe they\u2019d keep it a secret!\u201d</p><p>I break away from Luke\u2019s arms and walk over to the window. I can\u2019t bear the idea of Mum and Dad selling this place. My eyes sweep over the garden in sudden nostalgia. They can\u2019t leave this garden. They just can\u2019t. This is where I learned to walk. This is where Luke and I got married.</p><p>Suddenly my attention is caught by the sight of Tom Webster in the garden next door. He\u2019s dressed in jeans and a T-shirt that says MY WIFE LEFT ME AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT and is struggling to carry the hugest plank of wood I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Blimey. He looks quite ferocious.</p><p>\u201cIt may not be that,\u201d Luke is saying behind me. \u201cI may be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d I turn round miserably. \u201cIt has to be that. What else could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... don\u2019t think about it. Come on. It\u2019s the christening tomorrow. You\u2019ll see Suze!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I feel my spirits rise. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>Luke\u2019s right. Maybe today hasn\u2019t gone quite according to plan \u2014 but tomorrow will be fantastic. I\u2019ll be reunited with Suze again, my best, most closest friend in the whole entire world. I just can\u2019t wait.</p><p>Five</p><p>THE TWINS\u2019 CHRISTENING is being held at Suze\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Hampshire, because they\u2019ve been living there while the east wing of Tarquin\u2019s Scottish castle is being rebuilt. They would have used his house in Pembrokeshire, but at the moment it\u2019s being lived in by some distant cousins. And his house in Sussex is being used as a location for a Jane Austen film.</p><p>This is what Suze\u2019s family is like. Nobody has just one house.</p><p>As we drive down the familiar tree-lined avenue I\u2019m jumping with excitement. The stone house looks as huge and grand as ever with its pillared entrance, although some of the ivy has been pruned away from the front. Two stone griffins stand like sentries by the front door, and there are flower garlands around their heads, just like there were on Suze\u2019s wedding day.</p><p>\u201cHurry up!\u201d I say as Luke maneuvers the car into a parking space. He hasn\u2019t even turned off the engine before I\u2019m leaping out of the car and sprinting over the gravel toward the house. Now that I\u2019m here, I just can\u2019t wait to see Suze!</p><p>The heavy front door is ajar and I push it open. Inside, the huge flagstone hall is decorated with the most amazing arrangements of lilies. A pair of waiters are striding through with champagne glasses on a tray. And on the ancient chair by the fireplace is a discarded saddle. Nothing\u2019s changed here, then.</p><p>The waiters disappear down a corridor, and I\u2019m left alone. Walking over the flagstones, I suddenly feel a bit nervous. What if Suze has gone all weird, like my parents?</p><p>And then I spot her through an open door, standing in the drawing room. Her blond hair is up in a chignon and she\u2019s wearing a gorgeous print wrap dress. And in her arms is a tiny baby dressed in a long christening robe. Wow. That must be one of the twins.</p><p>Tarquin is standing nearby holding a second baby, which is also in a christening robe. And although he\u2019s wearing the most ancient suit in the world, he\u2019s actually looking pretty good! Not quite as... stoaty. It occurs to me that maybe Tarquin will get better looking the older he gets. When he\u2019s fifty he\u2019ll probably be a sex god! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blond-haired toddler is clutching his leg and, as I watch, Tarquin gently prizes his fingers off.</p><p>\u201cErnie,\u201d he says patiently.</p><p>Ernie? I feel an almighty shock. My godson, Ernest? But last time I saw him he was a tiny little baby.</p><p>\u201cWilfie looks like a girl!\u201d Suze is saying to Tarquin, her brow crumpled in that familiar way. \u201cAnd Clementine looks like a boy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy sweet, they both look exactly like babies in christening robes,\u201d says Tarquin.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re both gay?\u201d Suze is looking anxiously at Tarquin. \u201cWhat if their hormones got mixed up when they were in the womb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine!\u201d</p><p>I feel ridiculously shy, hovering by the door. I don\u2019t want to interrupt. They look like a family. They are a family.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d Suze tries to consult her watch, but Ernie is now clinging to her arm, trying to jump up. \u201cErnie, sweetheart, I need to do my lipstick! Leave Mummy\u2019s arm alone... Can you take him for a sec, Tarkie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me just put Clemmie down somewhere... \u201d Tarquin starts looking around the room as though a cot might magically spring up out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her if you like,\u201d I say, my voice catching in my throat.</p><p>Suze whips round.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Her eyes widen to the size of dinner plates. \u201cBex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d I try to sound cool. \u201cSurprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d</p> <p>Suze thrusts the baby at Tarquin, who manfully does a kind of juggling act with the two of them. She races toward me and throws her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cBex! Mrs. Brandon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cleath-Stuart!\u201d I return, feeling tears prick at my eyes. I knew Suze wouldn\u2019t have changed. I knew it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re back!\u201d Suze\u2019s face is glowing. \u201cTell me all about your honeymoon! Tell me every single thing you\u2014\u201d She breaks off suddenly, staring at my bag. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she breathes. \u201cIs that a real Angel bag?\u201d</p><p>Ha! You see? People who know, know.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d I swing it nonchalantly on my arm. \u201cJust a little souvenir from Milan. Er... I wouldn\u2019t mention it in front of Luke, though,\u201d I add, lowering my voice. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t exactly know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d says Suze half reprovingly, half laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s your husband!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I meet her eye, and we both start giggling.</p> <p>God, it\u2019s like I never left.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s married life?\u201d asks Suze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d I sigh happily. \u201cTotally blissful. Well, you know. Like couples are on their honeymoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pregnant on our honeymoon.\u201d Suze looks a bit discomfited. She reaches out and strokes the Angel bag in awe. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were going to Milan! Where else did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went everywhere! All over the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go to the ancient shrine of Mahakala?\u201d A booming voice comes from the doorway. I swivel round to see Suze\u2019s mother, Caroline, coming into the room. She\u2019s dressed in the strangest dress I\u2019ve ever seen, made out of what looks like pea green canvas, accessorized with maroon tights and clumpy suede boots.</p><p>I have never seen Caroline in a normal outfit, ever.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say in delight. \u201cWe did!\u201d</p><p>It was Caroline who got me into the idea of traveling in the first place, when she told me her best friend in the world was a Bolivian peasant.</p><p>\u201cThe ancient Incan city of Ollantaytambo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stayed there!\u201d</p><p>Caroline\u2019s eyes gleam as though I\u2019ve passed the test, and I feel a glow of pride. I am a genuine traveler! I won\u2019t add that we were in the five-star spa.</p><p>\u201cNow, where\u2019s my hat?\u201d She frowns, looking around. \u201cI\u2019ve mislaid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe African headdress one?\u201d says Suze, flushing. \u201cEr... I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>I give her a piercing look. She\u2019s hidden her mum\u2019s hat, I know it.</p><p>\u201cCaroline!\u201d Suze\u2019s father\u2019s voice comes resounding through the air, and the next moment he\u2019s coming into the hall, dressed in a paisley silk dressing gown over a pair of pin-striped trousers. His hair is white and bushy, and his nose has become a lot redder in the year since I last saw him. In fact, it\u2019s practically purple.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sir Gilbert,\u201d I begin politely. \u201cHow are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaroline!\u201d he repeats, totally ignoring me. \u201cFella says we could have a lion in the front paddock. He\u2019ll ship it over, do all the paperwork. What about it?\u201d Sir Gilbert\u2019s bright blue eyes flash with excitement. \u201cThat\u2019d add a bit of spice to life, eh?\u201d He gives a sudden lionlike roar, and I jump. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA lion?\u201d Suze says in horror. \u201cDaddy, you can\u2019t have a lion here! It\u2019ll eat the babies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilbert, the lion belongs in the wild.\u201d Caroline looks thunderous. \u201cFree to roam its natural world. Anyone who has crossed the Serengeti Plain and seen a pride feeding at dawn...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does your dad want a lion?\u201d I murmur to Suze as Caroline continues.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to start a zoo and open it to the public,\u201d Suze mutters back. \u201cIt\u2019s one of his mad schemes. Like the tortoises, remember?\u201d</p> <p>About four years ago, when Suze and I were sharing a flat in London, her father decided to become a tortoise breeder, and it was us who had to take a delivery of twenty baby tortoises and look after them all weekend.</p><p>\u201cThe noble animal looked at me,\u201d Caroline is declaiming momentously, \u201cand a deep understanding seemed to pass between us... \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can look at my lion if you like,\u201d says Sir Gilbert. \u201cIn its cage.\u201d He bellows with laughter. \u201cEh?\u201d</p><p>He looks so pleased with himself, and Caroline looks so disapproving, I can\u2019t help a giggle. I just love Suze\u2019s family. God, it\u2019s good to be back.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go over to the church,\u201d I say, glancing at my watch. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat reminds me!\u201d Caroline breaks off. \u201cI saw the vicar and he was saying some rubbish about warm water for the baptism. I said absolutely not! A bit of cold water\u2019ll do these infants the power of good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d wails Suze. \u201cI especially asked for warm water! They\u2019re still so tiny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d booms Caroline. \u201cAt their age, you were swimming in the lake! At the age of six months you were trekking with me up the Tsodilo Hills of Botswana. No warm water there!\u201d</p><p>Suze gives me a despairing look, and I grin back sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go,\u201d she says. \u201cBex, I\u2019ll see you afterwards. You will stay a couple of days, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to!\u201d I say happily.</p> <p>\u201cOh, and you must meet Lulu!\u201d she adds, halfway out the door.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lulu?\u201d I call back, but she doesn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Oh, well. I\u2019ll soon find out. It\u2019s probably her new horse, or something.</p><p>I find Luke outside, where a tented walkway has been set up between the house and the church, just like at Suze\u2019s wedding. As we start walking along the matting, I can\u2019t help feeling a tingle of nostalgia. It was here that we first talked about getting married, in a roundabout sort of way. And then Luke proposed.</p><p>And now here we are. Married for nearly a year!</p><p>I hear footsteps coming up behind and look round to see Tarquin hurrying along the matting, holding a baby.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tarkie!\u201d I say as he joins us. \u201cSo... which twin is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is Clementine,\u201d says Tarquin, beaming. \u201cOur little Clemmie.\u201d</p> <p>I peer more closely, and try to hide my surprise. Blimey. Suze is right. She does look like a boy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cAbsolutely gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to think of something to say which will emphasize her very feminine qualities, when there\u2019s a faint sound from up above. A kind of chopper-chopper-chopper. Now it\u2019s getting louder. I look up, and to my astonishment, a huge black helicopter is approaching. In fact... it\u2019s landing, on the field behind the house.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a friend with a helicopter?\u201d I say, amazed.</p><p>\u201cUm... actually, that\u2019s mine,\u201d says Tarquin bashfully. \u201cLent it to a friend for a spin.\u201d</p><p>Tarquin has a helicopter?</p><p>\u201cBought it last year,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe Ring was on at Covent Garden, right in the middle of lambing season. Huge dilemma. I didn\u2019t want to miss either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... absolutely!\u201d I nod, as if I really can sympathize.</p><p>Which, in a way, I can. If I was given the choice of watching sheep give birth in freezing-cold fields or listening to an endless Wagner opera... I\u2019d buy a helicopter too. To escape.</p><p>By now we\u2019ve arrived at the church, which is bustling with guests. Luke and I slip into a pew near the back, and I look around at all Suze\u2019s relations. There\u2019s Tarquin\u2019s dad, wearing an aubergine-colored smoking jacket, and there\u2019s Fenella, Tarquin\u2019s sister. She\u2019s dressed in cream and is shrieking excitedly at some girl with blond hair I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that, Agnes?\u201d comes a piercing voice behind me. I glance round, and a woman with gray hair and a gigantic ruby brooch is peering at the blond girl too, through a lorgnette. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Fenella, dear!\u201d says the woman in blue sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean Fenella! I mean the other girl, talking to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you mean Lulu? That\u2019s Lulu Hetherington.\u201d</p><p>I raise my head in surprise. So. Lulu isn\u2019t a horse. She\u2019s a girl.</p> <p>Actually, she does look quite like a horse. She\u2019s very thin and rangy, like Suze, and wearing a pink tweed suit. She laughs at something Fenella says \u2014 and she\u2019s got one of those smiles which show all her teeth and gums.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a godmother,\u201d Agnes is saying. \u201cSuper girl. She\u2019s Susan\u2019s best friend!\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I look up, taken aback. That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m Suze\u2019s best friend. Everyone knows that.</p><p>\u201cLulu moved into the village six months ago and they\u2019ve become quite inseparable!\u201d Agnes continues. \u201cWe see them out riding together every day. She\u2019s so like dear Susan. Just look at the two of them together!\u201d</p> <p>Suze has appeared at the front of the church, holding Wilfrid. I suppose there is a superficial likeness between her and Lulu. They\u2019re both tall and blond. They\u2019ve both got their hair in the same chignon. Suze is talking to Lulu, her face shining with animation, and as I watch, they both burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course they have so much in common!\u201d Agnes\u2019s voice cuts through the air behind me. \u201cWhat with the horses and the children... they\u2019re wonderful support for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery girl needs a best friend,\u201d says the other woman wisely.</p><p>She breaks off as the organ starts playing. The congregation stands up and I reach for my service sheet along with everyone else. But I can\u2019t read a word. I\u2019m too jumbled up inside.</p><p>After the service is over, we all head back to the house, where a string quartet is playing in the hall and waiters are circulating with drinks. Luke is immediately accosted by some friend of Tarquin\u2019s who knows him through business, and I stand for a while on my own, brooding on what I heard in the church.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d I wheel round in relief as I hear Suze\u2019s voice behind me.</p> <p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I beam at her. \u201cThat was great!\u201d</p><p>Just seeing Suze\u2019s friendly face sweeps all my worries away. Of course we\u2019re still best friends!</p><p>I have to remember that I\u2019ve been away for a long time, so Suze had to make friends with people locally or whatever. But the point is, I\u2019m back now!</p><p>\u201cSuze, let\u2019s go shopping tomorrow!\u201d I say impulsively. \u201cWe can go up to London... I\u2019ll help you with the babies...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, I can\u2019t.\u201d Her brow wrinkles. \u201cI promised Lulu I\u2019d go riding tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I don\u2019t know what to say. Couldn\u2019t she cancel riding? She always rides, and I\u2019ve only just come home.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cWell... no problem. We\u2019ll do it another time!\u201d</p><p>The baby in Suze\u2019s arms has started to wail lustily and she pulls a face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go and feed them now. But then I must introduce you to Lulu. You two will love each other!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we will!\u201d I say, trying to sound enthusiastic. \u201cSee you later!\u201d</p><p>I watch as Suze disappears into the library.</p><p>\u201cChampagne, madam?\u201d says a waiter behind me.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I take a glass of champagne off the tray. Then, with a sudden thought, I take another. I head for the library door and am about to reach for the handle, when Lulu comes out, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello!\u201d she says in a posh, clipped voice. \u201cSuze is feeding in there, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smile. \u201cI\u2019m her friend Becky. I\u2019ve brought her some champagne.\u201d</p><p>Lulu smiles back \u2014 but her hand doesn\u2019t move off the door handle.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019d probably like some privacy,\u201d she says pleasantly.</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too astounded to reply.</p><p>Privacy? From me?</p><p>I was with Suze when she gave birth to Ernie! I feel like retorting. I\u2019ve seen more of her than you ever will!</p><p>But no. I\u2019m not going to get into scoring points with this person. Come on. Make an effort.</p><p>\u201cSo you must be Lulu,\u201d I say as warmly as I can, and hold out my hand. \u201cI\u2019m Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Becky. Yes, I\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d</p><p>Why does she look amused? What has Suze said?</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re Clementine\u2019s godmother!\u201d I say heartily. \u201cThat\u2019s... lovely!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying as hard as I can to make a connection. But there\u2019s just something about her that makes me shrink away. Her lips are a bit too thin. Her eyes are a bit too cold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCosmo!\u201d she suddenly barks.

None at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, feeling squashed.</p><p>How can Suze be friendly with this woman? How?</p><p>Suddenly there\u2019s a rattling at the library door and Suze appears. She\u2019s holding a baby in one arm and her mobile in the other and is a picture of consternation.</p><p>\u201cHi, Suze!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI was just bringing you a glass of champagne!\u201d I hold it out to her, but Suze doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cLulu, Wilfie\u2019s got a rash!\u201d she says anxiously. \u201cHave yours ever had this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d says Lulu, expertly taking the baby out of Suze\u2019s grasp. She examines him for a moment. \u201cI think it\u2019s heat rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like nettle rash to me,\u201d I say, trying to join in. \u201cHas he been near any nettles recently?\u201d</p><p>No one seems interested in what I think.</p><p>\u201cYou want Sudocrem,\u201d says Lulu. \u201cI\u2019ll get some for you, if you like. I\u2019m popping to the chemist\u2019s later on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lulu. You\u2019re an angel!\u201d Suze takes Wilfie back gratefully, just as her mobile rings.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says into it. \u201cAt last! Where are you?\u201d As she listens, her whole face crumples in dismay. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lulu and I say simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Happy!\u201d wails Suze, turning to Lulu. \u201cHe\u2019s got a flat tire! He\u2019s by Tiddlington Marsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Happy?\u201d I say in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cThe entertainer!\u201d says Suze desperately. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole roomful of children in there, just waiting for him!\u201d She gestures to a pair of double doors, beyond which I can see lots of children in party dresses and smart little shirts, racing about and throwing cushions at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll zip along and pick him up,\u201d Lulu says, putting down her glass. \u201cAt least we know where he is. I\u2019ll only be ten minutes. Tell him to stay put and look out for the Range Rover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLulu, you\u2019re a total star,\u201d says Suze, subsiding in relief. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy burns through me. I want to be the one who helps Suze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind picking him up!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d Lulu says kindly. \u201cBetter if I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the children?\u201d Suze glances nervously toward the room, where the sound of screaming kids is getting louder.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll just have to wait. If there isn\u2019t an entertainer, there isn\u2019t an entertainer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll entertain them!\u201d I say, before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d They both turn and gape at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, me,\u201d I say confidently.</p><p>Ha. I\u2019ll show them who\u2019s the most supportive friend to Suze.</p><p>\u201cBex... are you sure about this?\u201d Suze says, looking anxious.</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuze...\u201d I put a hand on her arm. \u201cPlease.

It\u2019s my bright pink gingham one with the bows.

She hangs around, helping to make the children\u2019s tea and clear up. Every time I try to help, she\u2019s there before me with a damp cloth or a beaker or some piece of mummy advice. She and Suze keep up a constant dialogue about the children, and it\u2019s impossible for me to get a word in.</p><p>It\u2019s not until about ten o\u2019clock at night that she leaves, and I finally find myself alone in the kitchen with Suze. She\u2019s sitting by the huge Aga stove, feeding one of the twins and yawning hugely every three minutes.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you had a lovely honeymoon?\u201d she says wistfully.</p><p>\u201cIt was fantastic. Totally perfect. We went to this amazing place in Australia where you could scuba dive, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off as Suze yawns again.

Everything\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd... you\u2019ve been spending loads of time with Lulu,\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she great?\u201d says Suze, her face lighting up.</p><p>\u201cEr... great.\u201d I pause carefully. \u201cShe does seem a teeny bit bossy... \u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy?\u201d Suze looks up in shock. \u201cBex, how can you say that? She\u2019s been my total savior out here! She\u2019s helped me so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I backtrack hastily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows exactly what I\u2019m going through.\u201d Suze sighs. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s had four! She really understands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s what she means.</p><p>As I stare into my glass of wine, there\u2019s a sudden heaviness about my head. None of my reunions are going quite like I thought they would.</p><p>I stand up and wander over to the Aga, where lots of family photos are always pinned up on the cork wall. There\u2019s a picture of me and Suze dressed up for a party in feather boas and glittery makeup. And one of Suze and me in hospital with a tiny Ernie.</p><p>Then, with a pang, I notice a brand-new picture of Suze and Lulu, sitting on their horses, in matching riding jackets and hairnets. They\u2019re beaming at the camera and look just like identical twins.</p><p>And as I gaze at it, I feel a sudden determination growing. I\u2019m not losing my best friend to some bossy, horse-faced riding queen. Whatever Lulu can do, I can do.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come riding with you and Lulu tomorrow,\u201d I say casually. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a spare horse.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll even wear a hairnet, if that\u2019s what it takes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come?\u201d Suze looks up, staggered. \u201cBut... Bex. You don\u2019t ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d I say airily. \u201cLuke and I did some riding on our honeymoon, actually.\u201d</p><p>Which is... sort of true. Nearly. We were going to go on a camel ride in Dubai, except in the end we went snorkeling instead.</p><p>But anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll just hold on tight... and it\u2019ll be fine!</p><p>Six</p><p>BY TEN O\u2019CLOCK the next morning I\u2019m ready. And I don\u2019t want to boast, but as I survey myself in the mirror, I look utterly fab! I went to the riding shop in the next village first thing in the morning, and totally kitted myself out. I\u2019m wearing snowy white jodhpurs, a tailored black riding jacket, shiny boots, and a beautiful new velvet riding hat.</p><p>Proudly I reach for my pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2014 a big red rosette with shiny ribbons. There were loads of them for sale, so I bought one in every color! I carefully pin it onto my collar like a corsage, smooth down my jacket, and look at the effect.</p><p>God, I look so cool. I look like I\u2019m going to win at Crufts.</p><p>No. I don\u2019t mean Crufts, that\u2019s the dog show. I mean the other one. The horse one.</p><p>I can start riding every day in Hyde Park, I think in a sudden burst of excitement. I\u2019ll practice hard and get really good! Then I can come down here every weekend and ride with Suze. While I was in the shop I even filled out a form for a riding competition next month, as a little incentive.</p><p>\u201cTallyho!\u201d says Luke, coming into the bedroom. \u201cYou look very dashing. Very sexy.\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cGreat boots. How long are you going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that long,\u201d I say knowledgeably. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go for a hack through the woods.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke looks at me carefully. \u201cHave you ever been on a horse in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!

As I look down at my own shiny gear I suddenly feel mortified. How could I have been so stupid?</p><p>But I\u2019m not going to act embarrassed in front of Lulu. Chin up.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make an effort!\u201d I say, trying to sound light and matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Lulu is looking incredulously at my rosette.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a corsage. They were selling them in the riding shop,\u201d I add pointedly.</p><p>\u201cFor the horses,\u201d Suze says gently. \u201cBex, they go on the horses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m a bit discomfited. But then... why shouldn\u2019t people wear them too?</p><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d Albert, who runs the horses at Suze\u2019s parents\u2019 place, interrupts us. He\u2019s leading an enormous brown horse along by the reins. \u201cWe\u2019re putting you on Ginger today. He\u2019s pretty good-natured, aren\u2019t you, boy?\u201d</p><p>I freeze in horror. This? He\u2019s expecting me to get on this monster? I was envisioning some nice little pony.</p><p>Albert hands me the reins and I take them automatically, trying not to panic. The horse takes a step forward with an enormous, heavy hoof, and I give a frightened jump out of the way. What if it steps on my foot?</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to mount?\u201d asks Lulu, swinging herself up into the saddle of a horse which is, if anything, bigger than mine.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say with a nonchalant laugh.</p><p>How? How am I supposed to get up there?</p> <p>\u201cWant a leg up?\u201d says Tarquin, who has been talking to Albert a few yards away. He comes up behind me, and before I know it, he\u2019s hefted me right up into the saddle.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>I\u2019m so high. When I look down, I feel dizzy. Suddenly Ginger takes a step sideways, and I try not to gasp in fright.</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d calls Suze, who is on her old black horse, Pepper, and with a clip-clop she\u2019s off through the gate, into the field. Lulu makes a clicking sound with her tongue, swings her horse round, and follows.</p><p>Right. My turn. Go.</p><p>Go on, horse. Move.</p><p>I have no idea what to do next. Do I kick it? Experimentally I pull on one of the reins, but nothing happens.</p><p>\u201cGee-up,\u201d I mutter under my breath. \u201cGee-up, Ginger!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, as though he\u2019s noticed that his friends have gone, he starts walking forward. And it\u2019s... OK. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just a bit more... bumpy than I\u2019d imagined. I look ahead at Lulu, and she\u2019s totally comfortable. In fact, she\u2019s got her reins gathered up in one hand.</p><p>\u201cClose the gate!\u201d she yells to me.</p><p>Close the gate? I think in panic. How am I supposed to close the gate?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Tarquin calls. \u201cHave a good time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I call back gaily.</p><p>Right. As long as we just keep ambling along, I\u2019ll be OK. In fact, this could almost be fun. The sun\u2019s shining, the breeze is ruffling the grass, and the horses are all lovely and shiny. Some people are walking along the side of the field on a footpath, and as we pass by I give them a nonchalant \u201cDon\u2019t I look great on my horse?\u201d nod and twirl my riding crop. And they look really impressed!</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ve found my natural talent. Maybe Luke and I should buy some horses and a few acres of land. We could do field events and show jumping, like Suze\u2014</p><p>Shit. What\u2019s going on? All of a sudden, Ginger has started jolting up and down.</p><p>OK. Don\u2019t panic. This must be trotting.</p><p>I look at Suze and Lulu, and they\u2019re both rising up and falling in time with their horses. I try to copy them, but all that happens is I crash painfully back onto the saddle. Ouch. God, saddles are hard. Why don\u2019t they make them padded? If I were a horse saddle designer I\u2019d make them really soft and comfy, with furry cushions and drinks holders, maybe, and\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShall we canter?\u201d Suze calls over her shoulder.

The only plus I can think of is it\u2019ll sound really cool when they report it in the papers.</p><p>A KEEN HORSEWOMAN, REBECCA BRANDON (N\u00c8E BLOOMWOOD) DIED WHILE OUT CANTERING WITH HER FRIENDS.</p><p>Oh God. I think he\u2019s slowing down. At last. We\u2019re trotting... we\u2019re kind of jogging... we\u2019re finally coming to a halt.</p> <p>Somehow I manage to unclench my hands.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d says Suze, turning round on Pepper. Her blond hair is streaming out from under her hat and her cheeks are flushed pink. \u201cShall we have a really good gallop?\u201d</p><p>Gallop?</p><p>You have to be kidding. If Ginger takes one more step, I\u2019ll throw up.</p><p>\u201cCan you jump yet, Bex?\u201d she asks. \u201cThere\u2019s just a couple of little ones coming up. But you should be able to manage them,\u201d she says encouragingly. \u201cYou\u2019re really good!\u201d</p><p>For a moment I can\u2019t speak.</p> <p>\u201cI just need to... er... adjust my stirrup,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cYou two go on.\u201d</p><p>I wait until the two of them are out of sight before I slither to the ground. My legs are all shaky and I feel nauseous. I am never leaving solid ground again. Never. Why on earth would people do this for fun?</p><p>I sink down onto the grass and take off my new riding hat \u2014 which, to be honest, has been hurting my ears since I put it on. Suze and Lulu are probably miles away by now. Galloping along and talking about nappies.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say to Ginger. \u201cLet\u2019s walk back.\u201d I stand up and cautiously pull the reins \u2014 and to my astonishment he obediently follows.</p><p>This is more like it.</p><p>As I walk across the grass, I start to relax a bit. A horse is actually a pretty cool accessory. Who says you need to get on it? I could still go to Hyde Park every day. I could buy a really pretty horse and just lead it around like a dog. And if any passersby asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you riding?\u201d I\u2019d just give them a knowing smile and say, \u201cWe\u2019re resting today.\u201d</p><p>We wander along for a while and at last come to an empty road. I stand for a moment, looking from left to right. In one direction, the road disappears up a hill and round a corner. In the other, I can see what seems to be quite a sweet little village, all beamed houses, and a patch of grass, and...</p><p>Ooh. Are those... shops?</p> <p>Half an hour later I feel a lot better.</p><p>I\u2019ve bought some gorgeous cheese with walnuts in it, and some gooseberry preserve, and some huge radishes, which Luke will love. And best of all, I found this amazing little shop that sells hats. Right here in this village! Apparently, the milliner is local and is practically the next Philip Treacy. I mean, not that I wear hats that often... but I\u2019m bound to be invited to a wedding soon, or Ascot or something. And the prices were fantastic. So I bought a white one decorated with ostrich feathers and a black velvet one all covered in jewels. They\u2019re a bit cumbersome in their hatboxes, but they were so worth it.</p><p>Ginger whinnies as I approach the lamppost where I tied him up, and stamps his foot on the ground.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d I say. \u201cI haven\u2019t left you out.\u201d I bought him a bagful of Chelsea buns and some \u201cextra sheen\u201d shampoo for his mane. I reach in the bag and feed him one of the Chelsea buns, trying not to shudder as he slobbers on my hand.</p><p>The only slight problem now is... where am I going to put all my shopping? I can\u2019t very easily hold all these carrier bags and lead Ginger along the road. Should I try to mount him carrying my shopping? What did people do in the olden days?</p><p>Then suddenly I notice a big buckle on one of Ginger\u2019s saddle straps. I could easily hang a bag off that. I pick up one of the paper carriers and loop it over the buckle \u2014 and it hangs there perfectly! And now that I look properly, there are handy buckles all over Ginger\u2019s tack. Genius!</p><p>Happily I start hanging bags from every available hook, strap, and buckle on Ginger\u2019s tack. This is great. I never realized a horse could hold so much shopping. Last of all I tie my two hatboxes onto the side. They are so gorgeous, all pink-and-white candy stripes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I untie Ginger and start leading him out of the village, trying to stop the hatboxes bobbing up and down too much. A couple of people gawp as we go by, but that\u2019s OK. They\u2019re probably just not used to strangers in these parts.</p><p>We\u2019re just approaching the first bend when I hear a clattering sound ahead. The next moment, Suze and Lulu appear on their horses.</p><p>\u201cThere she is!\u201d says Lulu, shading her eyes against the sun.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d cries Suze. \u201cWe were worried! Are you OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I call back. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a lovely time!\u201d</p><p>As they come nearer I can see Suze and Lulu exchanging stunned glances.</p><p>\u201cBex... what have you done to Ginger?\u201d says Suze, her eyes running over all the bags and boxes in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. I just took him shopping. I got these two great hats!\u201d</p><p>I wait for Suze to say \u201cLet\u2019s see them!\u201d but she looks totally gobsmacked.</p> <p>\u201cShe took a horse... shopping,\u201d Lulu says slowly. She glances at me, then leans over and whispers something in Suze\u2019s ear.</p><p>Suddenly Suze gives a helpless snort and claps her hand to her mouth.</p><p>I feel my face flame.</p><p>She\u2019s laughing at me.</p><p>Somehow I never thought Suze would laugh at me.</p><p>As soon as we\u2019re back at the house, Lulu heads off home, and Suze has to rush in and feed the twins. I\u2019m left in the stable yard with Albert, who is a total sweetie and helps me untie all my bags and packages from Ginger\u2019s tack.</p> <p>I\u2019m walking out when Luke approaches, in his Barbour and Wellingtons.</p><p>\u201cSo how was it?\u201d he says cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cIt was... all right,\u201d I say, staring at the ground. I\u2019m waiting for Luke to ask what\u2019s wrong, but he seems distracted.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019ve just had a call from Gary at the office,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to get going on the Arcodas Group pitch. I\u2019m really sorry, but I\u2019m going to have to head back to town. But listen. Why don\u2019t you stay on here for a few days?\u201d He smiles. \u201cI know how desperate you were to see Suze.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly I feel a swell of emotion. He\u2019s right. I was desperate to see Suze and I\u2019m bloody well going to. Who cares about stupid Lulu? I\u2019m going to have a proper chat with my best friend, right now.</p><p>I hurry into the house to find her in the kitchen, feeding both the twins at once while Ernie fights for a place on her lap.</p><p>\u201cSuze, listen,\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday coming up. I want to treat you to something really special. Let\u2019s go to Milan! Just the two of us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilan?\u201d She looks up, her face strained. \u201cErnie, stop it, sweetheart. Bex, I can\u2019t go to Milan! What about the babies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey could come with us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they couldn\u2019t,\u201d says Suze, sounding almost sharp. \u201cBex, you just don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>I smart at her words. Why does everyone keep telling me I don\u2019t understand? How do they know?</p><p>\u201cOK, then,\u201d I say, trying to stay cheerful. \u201cLet\u2019s have a fab birthday lunch right here! I\u2019ll bring all the food, you won\u2019t have to do a thing... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Suze says, without looking at me. \u201cActually I\u2019ve... I\u2019ve already made plans for my birthday. Lulu and I are going to a spa for the day. A special mother and baby day. She\u2019s treating me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hide my shock. Suze and I always spend our birthdays together.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I focus on the back of the door, where an ancient tweed jacket, about six dog leads, and what seems to be a dead pheasant are hanging. \u201cWell... have fun. Enjoy it!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>I\u2019ve never not known what to say to Suze.</p><p>\u201cBex... you weren\u2019t here,\u201d Suze says suddenly, and I can hear the distress in her voice. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here. What was I supposed to do? Have no friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have survived without Lulu. She\u2019s been a real support to me out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she has.\u201d Tears are suddenly pricking at my eyes and I turn away, fiercely blinking them back. \u201cWell... you have fun together. I\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, don\u2019t be like that. Look... I\u2019ll speak to Lulu about the spa. I\u2019m sure we could find a third place.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s taking pity on me. I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d With an almighty effort I manage a laugh. \u201cReally, it\u2019s no big deal. I probably wouldn\u2019t have time anyway. In fact... I came in to tell you we have to go back to London. Luke\u2019s got work engagements.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d Suze looks taken aback. \u201cBut I thought you were going to stay for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got loads to do!\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cEverything\u2019s different for me, too, you know.

I confirm that I have withdrawn your name from the following classes:</p><p>General Horsemanship</p><p>Open Jumping</p><p>Senior Dressage</p> <p>Perhaps you could let me know if you still wish to enter for \u201cBest Kept Pony.\u201d</p><p>With kind regards,</p><p>Marjorie Davies</p><p>Organiser</p><p>Seven</p><p>ANYWAY. IT DOESN\u2019T matter. People get married and they move on and their friends change. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s perfectly normal. Suze has her life... and I have my life. It\u2019s fine. A week has gone by since the christening \u2014 and she\u2019s barely crossed my mind.</p><p>I take a sip of orange juice, pick up the Financial Times, which Luke left on the breakfast counter, and begin flicking briskly through the pages.</p><p>Now that I\u2019m married, I expect I\u2019ll make loads of new friends, too. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m dependent on Suze or anything. I\u2019ll start an evening class or a book group or something. And my new friends will be really nice ones who don\u2019t ride horses and have children with stupid names like Cosmo...</p><p>I take a sip of coffee and plaster some more chocolate spread on my toast. I\u2019m sitting in the kitchen of Luke\u2019s flat in Maida Vale, having a late breakfast.</p><p>I mean... our flat in Maida Vale. I keep forgetting, it\u2019s half mine now! Luke lived here for ages before we were married, but when we went to live in New York he had it all done up and rented it out. And it is the trendiest place in the world. All minimalist, with this amazing stainless-steel kitchen, pale beige carpets, and just the odd piece of modern art here and there.</p><p>I do like it. Of course I do.</p><p>Although, I suppose if I\u2019m totally honest, it\u2019s a tad bare for my taste. Luke has quite a different style from mine when it comes to decorating. His approach is basically \u201cno things anywhere,\u201d whereas mine is more \u201clots of things everywhere.\u201d</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter, because I read this article about couples in an interiors magazine, and it said fusing two different styles need not be a problem. Apparently, all we have to do is meld our individual ideas and do some mood boards together and create a signature look.</p><p>And today is the perfect day to start. Because any minute now, all our honeymoon purchases are going to be delivered from the storage company! Luke\u2019s stayed behind from work especially to help. It\u2019ll be quite a project, I expect. Which just shows: I\u2019m so busy, I don\u2019t even have time for friends.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling really excited about seeing all our souvenirs again! Arranging the little mementos of our honeymoon around the apartment. It\u2019ll really make a difference to this place, having a few personal objets here and there.</p><p>\u201cThe post\u2019s here,\u201d Luke says, coming into the kitchen. He\u2019s in his suit, since he\u2019ll be going into the office later, and his hair is trimmed all short and businesslike again. He had it cut almost as soon as we got back to London \u2014 because, as he said, Italy is one thing, but Britain is another.</p><p>I suppose he has a point. But I can\u2019t help feeling a bit wistful every time I see his bare neck. That little untanned patch of skin below his hairline is the only reminder of the way he was on our honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a letter for you,\u201d he adds, handing me an envelope.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I take it from him, feeling nervous.</p><p>Ever since we got back to London, I\u2019ve been approaching all the big department stores for a job as a personal shopper. I\u2019ve got a great reference from Barneys and everyone\u2019s been really nice to me \u2014 but so far all I\u2019m getting told is that there are no openings right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which, to be honest, has been a bit of a blow. I thought I\u2019d be fighting off offers. I even had this little fantasy where all the head personal shoppers at Harrods and Harvey Nichols and Selfridges took me out to lunch and gave me free clothes to persuade me to join them.</p><p>As calmly as I can, I pull the letter out of the envelope. This one is from a new shop called The Look, which hasn\u2019t even opened yet. It\u2019s going to be a huge new store just up from Oxford Street, full of great clothes and accessories, and the gimmick is that there will be loads of personal shoppers available to help you pull your look together. They want someone to run and train the team, and had already heard about me from their contact in New York. I went to see them a couple of days ago and I thought I did OK, but...</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I look up in disbelief. \u201cI got it! They want me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d Luke\u2019s face creases in a smile. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d He puts an arm round me and gives me a kiss.</p> <p>\u201cExcept... I won\u2019t be needed for three months,\u201d I say, reading farther down. \u201cThat\u2019s when the store opens.\u201d I put the letter down and look at him. \u201cThree whole months. That\u2019s quite a long time not to have a job.\u201d</p><p>Or any money, I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something to do,\u201d says Luke cheerfully. \u201cSome project or other. You\u2019ll have plenty to keep you busy.\u201d</p><p>The buzzer suddenly goes in the hall and we look at each other.</p><p>\u201cThat must be the delivery people!\u201d I say, feeling my spirits rise. \u201cLet\u2019s go down!\u201d</p> <p>Luke\u2019s penthouse has its own lift right to the front door, which is just so cool!</p><p>\u201cSo, where shall we tell them to put everything?\u201d he says as he presses the ground-floor button.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could pile it all up in the corner of the sitting room,\u201d I suggest. \u201cBehind the door. Then I can sort it out while you\u2019re at work.\u201d</p><p>Luke nods. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly remember the twenty Chinese silk dressing gowns. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to smuggle them in without Luke\u2019s seeing.</p><p>\u201cAnd if there was any overspill,\u201d I add casually, \u201cwe could always put it in the second bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOverspill?\u201d Luke frowns. \u201cBecky, how much stuff are you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that much!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cHardly anything! I just meant if they\u2019ve packed things in really huge boxes or something. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Luke looks a bit suspicious, and I turn away, pretending to be adjusting my watch strap. Now the moment\u2019s nearly here, I\u2019m feeling just the odd tiny qualm.</p><p>I kind of wish I\u2019d told him about the wooden giraffes. Should I quickly confess?</p><p>No. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019ll be fine. Luke\u2019s flat is huge. I mean, it\u2019s vast! He\u2019ll never notice a few extra things.</p><p>We push open the double doors of Luke\u2019s building and walk out, to see a man in jeans, waiting on the side of the road by a small van.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brandon?\u201d he says, looking up.</p><p>I feel a small whoosh of relief. I knew we hadn\u2019t bought that much stuff. I mean, just look at that van. It\u2019s tiny!</p> <p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s me.\u201d Luke holds out his hand, with a pleasant smile.</p><p>\u201cAny idea where we can park the lorries?\u201d The man scratches his head. \u201cOnly we\u2019re in a no-parking zone round the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorries?\u201d echoes Luke. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018lorries\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His smile has kind of frozen on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got two lorries to unload. Can we take them into the parking bay there?\u201d The man gestures at the forecourt of the building.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say quickly, as Luke doesn\u2019t seem able to speak. \u201cGo ahead!\u201d</p><p>The man disappears. \u201cSo!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cThis is fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo... lorries?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cIt must be a shared load!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cWith someone else. I mean, obviously we haven\u2019t bought two lorry-loads of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Which is true.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous! In ten months, we couldn\u2019t possibly have\u2014</p><p>I\u2019m sure we couldn\u2019t have\u2014</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>There\u2019s a rumbling from round the corner, and a big white lorry appears, closely followed by another. They back into the forecourt of Luke\u2019s building, and there are huge grinding noises as the backs are lowered. Luke and I hurry round and peer into the crowded depths.</p><p>What an amazing sight. Each whole lorry is crammed with objects and furniture. Some wrapped in plastic, some in paper, and some barely wrapped at all. As I feast my eyes on all the stuff, I start to feel quite emotional. It\u2019s like seeing a home video of our entire honeymoon. The kilims from Istanbul. The gourds from Peru. And I\u2019d totally forgotten about buying that papoose carrier! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some men in overalls start lifting things up and carrying them out. We stand aside to let them pass, but I\u2019m still gazing around the inside of one of the lorries, lost in memories. I suddenly glimpse a bronze statue and turn round with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThe Buddha! Do you remember when we got that? Luke?\u201d</p><p>Luke isn\u2019t listening to a word. I follow his gaze, and feel a slight flip of apprehension. He\u2019s staring in disbelief at a man carrying a huge paper-wrapped package out of the other lorry. A wooden giraffe\u2019s leg is poking out of it.</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>And now here comes another man in overalls with the matching one.</p><p>\u201cBecky... what are these giraffes doing here?\u201d Luke says evenly. \u201cI thought we agreed not to buy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI know we did. But we would have regretted it. So I made an executive decision. Honestly, Luke, they\u2019ll look great! They\u2019ll be a focal point of the whole apartment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where did those come from?\u201d Now Luke\u2019s looking at a pair of huge porcelain urns, which I got in Hong Kong.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI was going to tell you about those. Guess what? They\u2019re copies of real Ming! The man said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what the fuck are they doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... bought them. They\u2019ll be perfect in the hall. They\u2019ll be a focal point! Everyone will admire them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that rug?\u201d He points to a huge multicolored rolled-up sausage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a \u2018dhurrie,\u2019 actually... \u201d My voice trails away at his expression. \u201cI got it in India,\u201d I add feebly.</p><p>\u201cWithout consulting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure I like Luke\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cOoh, look!\u201d I exclaim, trying to distract him. \u201cIt\u2019s the spice rack you bought at that Kenyan market.\u201d</p><p>Luke totally ignores me. He\u2019s goggling at a huge, unwieldy contraption being unloaded from the first lorry. It looks like a combination of a xylophone and a set of hanging copper saucepans all in one.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that? Is that some kind of musical instrument?\u201d</p><p>The gongs all start clanging loudly as the men unload it, and a couple of passersby nudge each other and giggle.</p><p>Even I\u2019m having second thoughts about this one.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cActually, that\u2019s an Indonesian gamelan.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence.</p> <p>\u201cAn Indonesian gamelan?\u201d echoes Luke, his voice caught a bit in his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cultural!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI thought we could learn to play it! And it\u2019ll be a great focal point\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly how many focal points are we planning to have?\u201d Luke looks beside himself. \u201cBecky, is all this stuff ours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDining table coming out!\u201d calls a guy in overalls. \u201cMind yourselves.\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness. OK, quick. Let\u2019s redeem the situation.</p><p>\u201cLook, darling,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cIt\u2019s our dining table from Sri Lanka. Remember? Our personalized table! Our symbol of married love.\u201d I give him an affectionate smile, but he\u2019s shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spoil the moment!\u201d I put an arm round him. \u201cIt\u2019s our special honeymoon table! It\u2019s our heirloom of the future! We have to watch it being delivered!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d Luke says at last. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>The men are carefully carrying the table down the ramp, and I have to say, I\u2019m impressed. Bearing in mind how heavy it is, they seem to be managing it quite easily.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it exciting?\u201d I clutch Luke\u2019s arm as it comes into sight. \u201cJust think! There we were in Sri Lanka\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off, a little confused.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the wooden table after all. It\u2019s a transparent glass table, with curved steel legs. And another guy behind is carrying a pair of trendy red felt-covered chairs.</p><p>I stare at it in horror. A cold feeling is creeping over me.</p><p>Shit. Shit.</p><p>The table I bought at the Copenhagen Design Fair. I had totally forgotten about that.</p><p>How could I forget I bought a whole dining table? How?</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Luke\u2019s calling, his hand raised. \u201cGuys, that\u2019s the wrong table. Ours is wooden. A big carved-wood table from Sri Lanka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one of them an\u2019 all,\u201d says the delivery guy. \u201cIn the other lorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we didn\u2019t buy this!\u201d says Luke.</p><p>He gives me a questioning look and I quickly rearrange my features as though to say \u201cI\u2019m as baffled as you are!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Inside, my mind is working frantically: I\u2019ll deny I\u2019ve ever seen it; we\u2019ll send it back; it\u2019ll all be fine\u2014</p><p>\u201c \u2018Shipped by Mrs. Rebecca Brandon,\u2019 \u201d the guy reads aloud from the label. \u201cTable and ten chairs. From Denmark. Here\u2019s the signature.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Very slowly, Luke turns toward me.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, did you buy a table and ten chairs in Denmark?\u201d he says almost pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I lick my lips nervously. \u201cEr... I\u2013I might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Luke closes his eyes for a moment as though weighing up a math problem. \u201cAnd then you bought another table \u2014 and ten more chairs \u2014 in Sri Lanka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about the first one!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI totally forgot! Look, it was a very long honeymoon... I lost track of a few things... \u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I can see a guy picking up the bundle of twenty Chinese silk dressing gowns. Shit.</p> <p>I think I have to get Luke away from these lorries as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sort it all out,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI promise. But now, why don\u2019t you go upstairs and have a nice drink? You just relax! And I\u2019ll stay down here and do the supervising.\u201d</p><p>An hour later it\u2019s all finished. The men close up the lorries and I hand them a hefty tip. As they roar away I look over to see Luke coming out the front door of the building.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say. \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t too bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come upstairs a minute?\u201d Luke says in a strange voice.</p><p>As we travel up in the lift I smile at Luke a couple of times, but he doesn\u2019t smile back.</p> <p>\u201cSo... did you put all the stuff in the sitting room?\u201d I say as we approach the front door. \u201cOr in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>My voice dies away as the door swings open.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Luke\u2019s flat is totally unrecognizable.</p><p>The beige carpet has disappeared under a sea of parcels, trunks, and pieces of furniture. The hall is crammed with boxes which I recognize from the outlet in Utah, plus the batik paintings from Bali and the two Chinese urns. I edge past them into the sitting room, and gulp as I look around. There are packages everywhere. Rolled-up kilims and dhurries are propped up in one corner. In another, the Indonesian gamelan is jostling for space with a slate coffee table turned on its side and a Native American totem pole.</p><p>I\u2019m sensing it\u2019s my turn to speak.</p><p>\u201cGosh!\u201d I give a little laugh. \u201cThere are quite a lot of... rugs, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen,\u201d says Luke, still in the same strange voice. \u201cI\u2019ve counted.\u201d He steps over a bamboo coffee table which I got in Thailand and looks at the label of a large wooden chest. \u201cThis box apparently contains forty mugs.\u201d He looks up. \u201cForty mugs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it sounds like a lot,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cBut they were only about 50p each! It was a bargain! We\u2019ll never need to buy mugs ever again!\u201d</p><p>Luke regards me for a moment.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I never want to buy anything ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook...\u201d I try to step toward him but bump my knee on a painted wooden statue of Ganesh, the god of wisdom and success. \u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s not that bad! I know it seems like a lot. But it\u2019s like... an optical illusion. Once it\u2019s all unpacked, and we put it all away... it\u2019ll look great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have five coffee tables,\u201d says Luke, ignoring me. \u201cWere you aware of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... well.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cNot exactly. So we might have to... rationalize a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRationalize?\u201d Luke looks around the room incredulously. \u201cRationalize this lot? It\u2019s a mess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it looks a bit of a mishmash at the moment,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cBut I can pull it all together! I can make it work! It\u2019ll be our signature look. If we just do some mood boards\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d Luke interrupts. \u201cWould you like to know what mood I\u2019m in right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p><p>I watch nervously as Luke shifts two packages from Guatemala aside and sinks down on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know is... how did you pay for all this?\u201d he asks, wrinkling his brow. \u201cI had a quick check through our bills, and there\u2019s no record of any Chinese urns. Or giraffes. Or tables from Copenhagen...\u201d He gives me a hard look. \u201cWhat\u2019s been going on, Becky?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m totally pinned. Even if I did want to run, I\u2019d probably skewer myself on Ganesh\u2019s pointy fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d I can\u2019t quite meet his eye. \u201cI do have this... this credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you keep hidden in your bag?\u201d says Luke without missing a beat. \u201cI checked that too.\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>There\u2019s no way out of this.</p> <p>\u201cActually... not that one.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cAnother one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d Luke is staring at me. \u201cYou have a second secret credit card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for emergencies!

I\u2019m not some kind of freeloader.\u201d</p><p>Luke looks at me for a few moments, then sighs.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says gently. He holds out his hand. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>After a moment I pick my way across the crowded floor to the sofa. I find a tiny space to sit down and he puts his arm round me. For a while we both look silently at the ocean of clutter. It\u2019s like we\u2019re two survivors on a desert island.</p><p>\u201cBecky, we can\u2019t carry on like this,\u201d Luke says at last. \u201cDo you know how much our honeymoon cost us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it strikes me that I have absolutely no idea what anything has cost. It was me who bought the round-the-world airline tickets, but apart from that, Luke\u2019s been doing all the paying, all the way along.</p><p>Has our honeymoon ruined us?</p> <p>I glance sideways at Luke \u2014 and for the first time see how stressed he looks.</p><p>Oh God. We\u2019ve lost all our money and Luke\u2019s been trying to hide it from me.</p><p>I suddenly feel like the wife in It\u2019s a Wonderful Life when James Stewart comes home and snaps at the children. Even though we\u2019re on the brink of financial disgrace, it\u2019s my role to be brave and serene.</p><p>\u201cLuke... are we very poor?\u201d I ask, as calmly as I can.</p><p>Luke turns his head and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, Becky,\u201d he says patiently. \u201cWe\u2019re not very poor. But we will be if you keep buying mountains of crap.\u201d</p><p>Mountains of crap? I\u2019m about to make an indignant retort when I see his expression. Instead, I close my mouth and nod humbly.</p><p>\u201cSo I think...\u201d Luke pauses. \u201cI think we need to institute a budget.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>A BUDGET.</p><p>This is OK. I can handle a budget. Easily. In fact, I\u2019m looking forward to it. It\u2019ll be quite liberating, knowing exactly how much I can spend.</p><p>Plus everyone knows, the point about budgets is that you make them work for you. Exactly.</p><p>\u201cSo... how much is my budget for today?\u201d I say, hovering by the study door. It\u2019s about an hour later and Luke is searching for something in his desk. He looks a bit stressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d he says without looking up.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering what my budget is for today. About twenty pounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Luke says distractedly.</p><p>\u201cSo... can I have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have my twenty pounds?\u201d</p><p>Luke stares at me for a moment as though I\u2019m completely mad, then takes his wallet out of his pocket, gets out a twenty-pound note, and hands it to me. \u201cOK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I look at the note. Twenty pounds. That\u2019s my challenge. I feel like some wartime housewife being given her ration book.</p><p>It\u2019s a very weird feeling, not having my own income. Or a job. For three months. How am I going to survive three whole months? Should I get some other job to fill the space? Maybe this is a great opportunity, it occurs to me. I could try something completely new!</p><p>I have a sudden image of myself as a landscape gardener. I could buy some really cool Wellingtons and specialize in shrubs.</p><p>Or... yes! I could start up some company offering a unique service that no one has ever provided, and make millions! Everyone would say \u201cBecky\u2019s a genius!

Of course. I can help him in his work!</p><p>I mean, that\u2019s the whole point of marriage! It should be a partnership. I can get totally involved in the running of his company, like Hillary Clinton, and everyone will know it\u2019s really me who has all the good ideas.

It\u2019s perfect! You wouldn\u2019t even have to pay me very much.\u201d</p> <p>Luke looks slightly gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut I could inject some new thoughts. Maybe on marketing. Like the time I came up with that slogan for Foreland Investments. You said I was really useful then. And when I came on that press tour to France, and I rewrote that media release for you? Remember that?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s barely listening.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, we\u2019re really busy with this Arcodas pitch. I haven\u2019t got time to take you in. Maybe after the pitch is over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take time!\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cI\u2019d save you time! I\u2019d be a help! You once offered me a job, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know I did. But taking on a real, full-time job is a bit different from filling in for three months. If you want to change careers, that\u2019s different.\u201d He goes back to sorting through his papers.</p><p>He is making a big mistake. Everyone knows companies have to cross-pollinate with other industries. My personal shopping experience would probably be invaluable to him. Not to mention my background as a financial journalist.</p><p>As I\u2019m watching, Luke tries to put a file away and bumps his shin on a wooden carton full of saris.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says irritably. \u201cBecky, if you really want to help me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say eagerly.</p><p>\u201cYou can tidy up this apartment.\u201d</p><p>Here I am, prepared to devote myself to Luke\u2019s company, and he thinks I should tidy up.</p><p>I heft a wooden carton onto the slate coffee table and prize the lid off with a knife, and white foam peanuts cascade out everywhere like snowflakes. I dig in through the foam and pull out a bubble-wrapped parcel. For a few seconds I peer at it blankly \u2014 then suddenly I remember. These are the handpainted eggs from Japan. Each one depicts a scene from the legend of the Dragon King. I think I bought five.</p> <p>I wipe my brow and glance at my watch. I\u2019ve been at it now for a whole hour, and to be honest, the room doesn\u2019t look any better than before. In fact... it looks worse. As I survey the clutter, I\u2019m suddenly full of gloom.</p><p>What I need is a cup of coffee. Yes.</p><p>I head out to the kitchen, already feeling lighter, and turn the kettle on. And maybe I\u2019ll have a biscuit, too. I open one of the stainless-steel cupboards, find the tin, select a biscuit, and put the tin away again. Every single movement makes a little clanging sound that echoes through the silence.</p><p>God, it\u2019s quiet in here, isn\u2019t it? We need to get a radio.</p><p>I trail my fingers over the granite work-top with a gusty sigh. Maybe I\u2019ll give Mum a ring and have a nice chat. Except she\u2019s still being all weird. I tried phoning home the other day and she sounded all shifty, and said she had to go because the chimney sweep was there. Like we\u2019ve ever had a chimney sweep in all my life.

What on earth are Mum and Dad doing here?</p><p>I quickly go into the kitchen, pour out the coffee, and arrange some biscuits on a plate, then hurry back out to the lift.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say as the doors open. \u201cCome on in! I\u2019ve made you some coffee!\u201d</p><p>As I hug Mum and Dad I can see them glancing at each other apprehensively. They\u2019re both dressed quite smartly and Mum has even got on the pearl brooch she normally wears to weddings.</p><p>What is going on? What?</p><p>\u201cI hope we\u2019re not disturbing you, love,\u201d Mum says as she follows me into the flat.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, obviously I have my chores... things to be getting on with...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Mum nods. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to take up your time. It\u2019s just...\u201d She breaks off. \u201cShall we go and sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er...\u201d I glance through the door of the sitting room. The sofa is surrounded by boxes spilling their contents, and covered in rugs and foam peanuts. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite got the sitting room straight yet. Let\u2019s go in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Whoever designed our trendy kitchen bar stools obviously never had their parents come over for a cup of coffee. It takes Mum and Dad about five minutes to climb up onto them, while I watch, completely petrified they\u2019re going to topple over.</p> <p>\u201cSpindly legs, aren\u2019t they?\u201d puffs Dad as he tries for the fifth time. Meanwhile Mum\u2019s inching slowly onto the seat, gripping the granite breakfast bar for dear life.</p><p>At last, somehow, they\u2019re both perched up safely on the steel seats, looking all self-conscious as though they\u2019re on a TV talk show.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I say anxiously. \u201cBecause I could go and get some different chairs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d says Dad at once. \u201cThis is very comfy!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s lying. I can see him clenching his hands round the edges of the slippery seat and glancing down at the slate floor below as though he\u2019s balanced on a forty-fourth-floor ledge.</p><p>\u201cThe seats are a little hard, aren\u2019t they, love?\u201d ventures Mum. \u201cYou should get some nice tie-on cushions from Peter Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... maybe.\u201d</p><p>I hand Mum and Dad their cups, pull out a bar stool for myself, and nonchalantly swing myself up onto it.</p><p>Ow. That hurt.</p><p>God, they are a bit tricky to get onto. Stupid shiny seats.</p><p>\u201cSo... are you both well?\u201d I say, reaching for my coffee.</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence.</p><p>\u201cBecky, we came here for a reason,\u201d says Dad. \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He looks so grave, I feel worried. Maybe it\u2019s not the house after all. Maybe it\u2019s something worse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to do with me,\u201d he continues.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ill,\u201d I say before I can stop myself. \u201cOh God. Oh God. I knew there was something wrong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ill. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s... something else.\u201d He massages his temples, then looks up. \u201cBecky, years ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak it to her gently, Graham!\u201d Mum interrupts.</p><p>\u201cI am breaking it to her gently!\u201d retorts Dad, swiveling round. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not!\u201d says Mum. \u201cYou\u2019re rushing in!\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m totally bewildered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBreak what to me gently?\u201d I say, looking from face to face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, before I met your mother...\u201d Dad avoids my gaze. \u201cThere was another... lady in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, my throat thick.</p><p>Mum and Dad are getting divorced and that\u2019s why they\u2019re selling the house. I\u2019m going to be the product of a broken home.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost touch,\u201d Dad continues. \u201cBut recently... events have occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re confusing her, Graham!\u201d exclaims Mum.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not confusing her! Becky, are you confused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... a bit,\u201d I admit.</p><p>Mum leans over and takes my hand.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, love, the long and the short of it is... you have a sister.\u201d</p><p>A sister?</p><p>I stare at her blankly. What\u2019s she talking about?</p><p>\u201cA half sister, we should say,\u201d Dad adds, nodding earnestly. \u201cTwo years older than you.\u201d</p><p>My brain is short-circuiting. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. How could I have a sister and not know about it?</p><p>\u201cDad has a daughter, darling,\u201d Mum says gently. \u201cA daughter he knew nothing about until very recently. She got in touch with us while you were on honeymoon. We\u2019ve seen each other a few times, haven\u2019t we, Graham?\u201d She glances at Dad, who nods. \u201cShe\u2019s... very nice!\u201d</p> <p>The kitchen is completely silent. I swallow a few times. I can\u2019t quite take this in. Dad had another child?</p><p>Dad had another\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I falter. \u201cWho was this other lady in your life?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking my own father about his love life. Even if it is his love life of thirty years ago.</p><p>Dad doesn\u2019t flinch at the question.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Marguerite,\u201d he says with a steadfast gaze. \u201cI was traveling a lot for business then and she was a stewardess on the 7:40 London to Carlisle train.\u201d</p><p>A stewardess on a train. I have a sudden image of a young Dad sitting in a pale 1970s suit with flappy lapels, smiling up at a uniformed girl as she pours him coffee. She brushes against him as she moves the trolley on...</p><p>OK, I\u2019m not sure I want to think about this.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy was very handsome then,\u201d Mum puts in. \u201cWhen he had his mustache.\u201d</p><p>I gape at her. Dad had a mustache? God, how many secrets does our family have?</p><p>Then all of a sudden it hits me.</p><p>\u201cThat girl! The day we got back.\u201d My heart is pounding. \u201cThe one you were with. Was that...?\u201d</p><p>Mum glances at Dad, who nods.</p><p>\u201cThat was her. Your half sister. She was visiting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we saw you, love... we didn\u2019t know what to do!\u201d says Mum, with an anxious laugh. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to give you the shock of your life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe decided we\u2019d tell you when you\u2019d settled in a bit,\u201d chimes in Dad. \u201cWhen you\u2019d got a bit sorted out.\u201d</p><p>Now I feel totally dazed. That was her. I\u2019ve seen my half sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s... what\u2019s her name?\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Jessica,\u201d says Dad after a pause. \u201cJessica Bertram.\u201d</p><p>Jessica. My sister, Jessica.</p><p>Hi. Have you met my sister, Jessica?</p><p>I look from Dad\u2019s worried face to Mum\u2019s bright, hopeful eyes, and suddenly I feel very weird. It\u2019s like a bubble is rising up inside me. Like a load of really strong emotions are pushing their way out of my body.</p><p>I\u2019m not an only child.</p><p>I have my own sister. I have a sister.</p><p>I have a SISTER!</p><p>Nine</p><p>FOR THE PAST week I haven\u2019t been able to sleep. Or concentrate on anything. All I can think about is the fact that I have a real, blood sister.</p><p>At first I felt totally shaken up. It\u2019s OK for Mum and Dad; they\u2019ve had weeks to get used to the idea. But to find out Dad had an affair years ago... and got somebody pregnant... I never thought Dad was like that, to be honest.</p><p>But he\u2019s been really sweet about it. The day he and Mum came round to tell me, he could see I was a bit shell-shocked. So he sat down on the sofa with me and told the whole story. He kept reiterating that this all happened before he even met Mum, and that he had no idea he\u2019d fathered a child. Apparently Marguerite the stewardess broke off their relationship with no warning. Dad got on the train one Monday morning, and she just wasn\u2019t there. Another stewardess told him she\u2019d had a whirlwind romance and married another passenger, who owned a frozen food business. Dad was so crushed, he started taking another train. And then they moved his work to Birmingham... and that was the end of it. He had no idea there was a baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was. A little girl called Jessica. All my life, without knowing it, I\u2019ve had a sister, growing up miles away, with no idea I existed either.</p><p>And today, at last, I\u2019m going to meet her!</p><p>Just the thought makes me feel exhilarated and jumpy all at once. How will we be the same? How will we be different? What will her voice be like? What will her clothes be like?</p><p>\u201cDo I look OK?\u201d I ask Luke, while anxiously surveying my appearance in the mirror. We\u2019re in my old bedroom at my parents\u2019 house, and I\u2019m putting the finishing touches to my meeting-my-long-lost-sister outfit. It\u2019s taken me several days, but after a lot of thought I\u2019ve decided on my most flattering Seven jeans, some boots with spiky heels, a gorgeous pale pink Marc Jacobs jacket, and a T-shirt made ages ago for me by Danny.</p> <p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Luke says patiently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like... balancing formal with informal,\u201d I explain. \u201cSo the jacket says \u2018This is a special occasion,\u2019 whereas the jeans say, \u2018We\u2019re sisters, we can be relaxed with each other!\u2019 And the T-shirt says...\u201d</p><p>I pause. Actually, I\u2019m not sure what the T-shirt says, apart from \u201cI\u2019m friends with Danny Kovitz.\u201d And I\u2019m not even sure how true that is anymore. He hasn\u2019t called back, even though I\u2019ve left two messages.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d says Luke, \u201cI don\u2019t honestly think it matters what you wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I wheel round in disbelief. \u201cOf course it matters! This is one of the most important moments of my life! I\u2019ll always remember what I was wearing the day I met my sister for the first time. I mean... you remember what you were wearing when you met me for the first time, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Luke looks blank.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t remember? How can he not remember?</p><p>\u201cWell, I remember,\u201d I say crossly. \u201cYou were wearing a gray suit and a white shirt and a dark green Herm\u00e8s tie. And I was wearing my short black skirt and my suede boots and that awful white top which made my arms look fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Luke raises his eyebrows.</p><p>I smooth down my T-shirt. \u201cI just want to look right. Like a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do sisters look like?\u201d Luke asks, looking amused.</p> <p>\u201cThey look... fun!\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cAnd friendly. And supportive. And like they\u2019ll tell you if your bra strap is showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do look exactly like a sister.\u201d Luke kisses me. \u201cBecky, relax! It\u2019s going to be fine!\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m a bit wound-up, but I just can\u2019t get over the idea of having a sister after being an only child for so long.</p><p>Not that I\u2019ve minded being on my own or anything. Mum and Dad and I have always had a great time together. But sometimes I\u2019ve heard other people talking about their brothers and sisters and wondered what it was like. I never thought I would actually get to find out!</p><p>What\u2019s really spooky is that all this week, I\u2019ve suddenly been noticing sisters. They\u2019re everywhere! For example, the film of Little Women was on telly the other afternoon \u2014 and right after was a program about the Beverley Sisters! And every time I\u2019ve seen two women together in the street, instead of just noticing what they were wearing, I\u2019ve thought, \u201cAre they sisters?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like there\u2019s a whole world of sisters out there and finally I\u2019m part of it.</p><p>I feel a smarting in my eyes and blink hard. It\u2019s ridiculous, but ever since I heard about Jessica, my emotions have been all over the place. Last night I was reading this brilliant book called Long-Lost Sisters: The Love They Never Knew They Had and tears were streaming down my cheeks! The stories were just amazing. One was about these three Russian sisters who were in the same concentration camp during the war but didn\u2019t know it. Then there was this woman who was told her sister had been killed but she would never believe it, and then she got cancer and there was no one to look after her three children, but they found the sister alive, just in time for them to say goodbye...</p><p>Oh God, I\u2019m going to cry just thinking about it.</p> <p>I take a deep breath and wander over to the table where I\u2019ve put my present for Jessica. It\u2019s a big basket full of Origins bath stuff, plus some chocolates, plus a little photo album of pictures of me when I was little.</p><p>I also got her a silver bean necklace from Tiffany, which exactly matches mine, but Luke said it might be a bit overwhelming, presenting her with jewelry on our first meeting. Which I didn\u2019t really understand. I mean, I\u2019d love it if someone gave me a Tiffany necklace! But he was really insistent, so I said I\u2019d keep it for later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run my eyes over the basket, slightly dissatisfied. Should I maybe\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe present is fine,\u201d says Luke, just as I open my mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to add any more.\u201d</p><p>How did he know what I was going to say?</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say reluctantly. I look at my watch and feel a swoop of excitement. \u201cNot long now! She\u2019ll be here soon!\u201d</p> <p>The plan is, Jessica\u2019s going to phone when her train gets in to Oxshott Station, then Dad will go and pick her up. It\u2019s pure coincidence that she\u2019s going to be in London this week. She lives in Cumbria, which is miles away, but apparently she was coming down anyway, for an academic conference. So she\u2019s come down a day early, especially to meet me!</p><p>\u201cBecky, before all the excitement starts... I wanted to have a quick word. On the subject of our honeymoon purchases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge of resentment. Why does Luke have to bring this up now? This is a special day! There should be a general reprieve from all arguments, like in the war when they played football on Christmas Day.</p><p>Not that we\u2019re at war or anything. But we did have a bit of a row yesterday when Luke found the twenty Chinese dressing gowns under the bed. And he keeps asking when I\u2019m going to sort out the apartment.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know that I\u2019ve spoken to the furniture merchants,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThey\u2019ll be coming by on Monday to take away the Danish table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say sheepishly. \u201cThanks. So, are they giving us a full refund?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well! So we didn\u2019t do too badly in the end!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t,\u201d agrees Luke. \u201cUnless you count the storage costs, the delivery costs, the expense of packaging it all up again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cOf course. Well, anyway... all\u2019s well that ends well!\u201d</p> <p>I try a conciliatory smile, but Luke\u2019s not even looking. He\u2019s opening up his briefcase and pulling out a wad of \u2014 oh God.</p><p>Credit card bills. My secret code-red-emergency bills, to be exact. Luke asked for them the other day and I had no choice but to get them out of their hiding place.</p><p>I was kind of hoping he\u2019d be too busy to read them, though.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say, my voice slipping up two notches. \u201cSo... you\u2019ve seen those, then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve paid them all off,\u201d Luke says shortly. \u201cHave you cut up the card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. And thank you for paying them off,\u201d I add humbly. Luke gives me a hard look.</p><p>\u201cHave you really cut it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I threw the pieces in the bin!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d Luke turns back to the bills. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t anything else to come? Anything you\u2019ve paid for recently?\u201d</p><p>I feel a tiny clenching in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cEr... no,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell him about the Angel bag. I just can\u2019t. He still thinks all I bought in Milan was a present for him. That\u2019s about my only redeeming feature right now.</p><p>And, anyway, I can pay it off myself, no problem. I mean, in three months I\u2019ll have a job and my own income! It\u2019ll be easy!</p><p>To my slight relief my mobile phone starts ringing. I scrabble in my bag and pull it out. Suze\u2019s number is flashing on the display.</p><p>Suze.</p><p>At once I feel a gigantic leap of nerves and a familiar hurt starting to rise inside me.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken once to Suze since I left her house. She hasn\u2019t called... and neither have I. If she\u2019s all busy and happy with a fab new life, then so be it. She doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019ve got a sister.</p><p>I press the green button and take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cHi, Suze!\u201d I exclaim in airy tones. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d says Suze. \u201cWe\u2019re all fine. You know... same old...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s Lulu?\u201d I say lightly. \u201cI expect you two have been busy doing lots of fun things together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s... fine.\u201d Suze sounds awkward. \u201cListen, Bex... about that. I wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve got a bit of exciting news of my own. Guess what? It turns out... I\u2019ve got a long-lost sister!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze says at last.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! I\u2019ve got a half sister that I never knew about. I\u2019m meeting her today for the first time. She\u2019s called Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Suze sounds totally poleaxed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a sister?

Not me.</p><p>I thrust my mobile phone back into my bag and look up to see Luke regarding me with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSuze all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d I say a little defiantly, shaking my hair back. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>As I come down the stairs, Suze\u2019s hurt voice lingers in my mind, but I try to ignore it. I can\u2019t spend time dwelling on her. I\u2019ve got important things to focus on. Jessica will be arriving here soon! This is one of the biggest days of my life... ever!</p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d says Mum, as we go into the kitchen. She\u2019s wearing a smart blue dress and is wearing her \u201cspecial occasion\u201d makeup \u2014 she uses lots of shiny highlighter under her eyebrows to \u201copen up the eyes.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it in the makeup book Janice gave her for Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cDid I hear you say you\u2019re selling some furniture?\u201d she adds as she turns on the kettle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re returning a table,\u201d Luke says easily. \u201cWe seem to have ordered two by mistake. But it\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly I was going to say, you should sell it on eBay!\u201d says Mum. \u201cYou\u2019d get a good price!\u201d</p><p>eBay.</p><p>\u201cSo... you can sell anything on eBay, can you?\u201d I ask casually.</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d says Mum. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d</p><p>Like, say, handpainted eggs depicting the legend of the Dragon King. Yes! This is the answer. It\u2019ll solve everything!</p><p>I have to stop myself from punching the air with glee.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s exciting, isn\u2019t it, love?\u201d says Mum, watching me fondly. \u201cLet\u2019s all have some nice coffee while we\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p><p>We all involuntarily glance at the clock. Jessica\u2019s train should arrive at Oxshott in five minutes. Five minutes!</p><p>\u201cToodle-oo!\u201d There\u2019s a knocking at the back door and we all look round, to see Janice peering through the glass.</p><p>Oh my goodness. Where did she get that sparkly blue eyeshadow?</p><p>Please don\u2019t let her give any to Mum, I find myself praying.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Janice!\u201d says Mum, opening the door. \u201cAnd Tom! What a nice surprise!\u201d</p><p>Blimey, Tom\u2019s looking rough. His hair is rumpled and unwashed, his hands are all blistered and cut, and there\u2019s a deep furrow in his brow.</p><p>\u201cWe just came to wish you luck,\u201d says Janice. \u201cNot that you need it!\u201d She pops her box of Canderel sugar substitute down on the counter, then turns to look at me. \u201cSo, Becky. A sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d says Tom. \u201cOr whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d</p><p>Janice shakes her head and looks at Mum a bit reproachfully.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been keeping this a secret from us, Jane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted Becky to be the first to know,\u201d says Mum, patting me on the shoulder. \u201cHazelnut whirl, Janice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d says Janice, taking a biscuit from the plate and sitting down. She nibbles it thoughtfully for a few moments, then looks up. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is... why did this girl get in touch? After all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a very good reason,\u201d I say with an air of solemn drama. \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019ve got a hereditary disease.\u201d</p><p>Janice gives a little scream.</p><p>\u201cA disease! Jane! You never told me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a disease,\u201d says Mum. \u201cBecky, you know it\u2019s not a disease! It\u2019s a \u2018factor.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cA... \u2018factor\u2019?\u201d echoes Janice, looking even more horrified than before. \u201cWhat kind of factor?\u201d I can see her eyeing her hazelnut whirl as though she\u2019s afraid it might contaminate her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not life-threatening!\u201d laughs Mum. \u201cIt\u2019s just a blood disorder, which can be a risk in certain situations.

She\u2019d always known she had a father somewhere but didn\u2019t know his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she asked her mother who her long-lost father was... \u201d Janice chimes in avidly, as though she\u2019s following a Ruth Rendell miniseries on the telly.</p> <p>\u201cHer mother is dead,\u201d explains Mum.</p><p>\u201cDead!\u201d exclaims Janice, looking appalled. \u201cFrom the blood factor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mum responds patiently. \u201cFrom a car crash. But her aunt had the name of Jessica\u2019s father written down in an old diary. So she got it out and gave it to Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was the name?\u201d breathes Janice.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause.</p> <p>\u201cMum, it was Graham!\u201d says Tom, rolling his eyes. \u201cGraham Bloomwood. Obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Janice, looking almost let down. \u201cOf course it was. Well, goodness me.\u201d She exhales sharply. \u201cWhat a dreadful shock. For all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in quite a state when we got the news,\u201d Mum admits. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t come to the Hawaiian quiz evening at the church. Graham didn\u2019t really have a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d says Janice. \u201cI said to Martin at the time, \u2018Something\u2019s not right with the Bloomwoods.\u2019 But I had no idea it was a long-lost family member!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Mum comfortingly, \u201chow could you?\u201d</p><p>Janice is silent for a moment, taking it all in. Then suddenly she stiffens and lays a hand on Mum\u2019s arm.</p> <p>\u201cJane. Just be careful. Has this girl laid any claim to Graham\u2019s fortune? Has he altered his will in her favor?\u201d</p><p>OK. Janice has definitely been watching too many TV murder mysteries.</p><p>\u201cJanice!\u201d says Mum with a laugh. \u201cNo! It\u2019s nothing like that. As it happens, Jess\u2019s family is\u201d\u2014she lowers her voice discreetly\u2014\u201crather well-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d breathes Janice.</p><p>Mum lowers her voice still further. \u201cThey\u2019re rather big in frozen food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d says Janice. \u201cSo she\u2019s not all alone in the world, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d says Mum, back to normal. \u201cShe\u2019s got a stepfather and two brothers. Or is it three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no sisters,\u201d I chime in. \u201cWe\u2019ve both had that gap in our life. That... unfulfilled longing.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cHave you had an unfulfilled longing, Becky?\u201d asks Janice.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Definitely.\u201d I take a pensive sip of coffee. \u201cLooking back, I think I always somehow knew I had a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, love?\u201d Mum says in surprise. \u201cYou never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said anything.\u201d I give Janice a brave smile. \u201cBut deep down I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d says Janice. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt it in here,\u201d I say, clasping my hands to my chest. \u201cIt was as if... a part of me was missing.\u201d</p><p>I make a sweeping gesture with my hand \u2014 and make the mistake of catching Luke\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cWhich particular part of you was missing?\u201d he says with apparent interest. \u201cNot a vital organ, I hope.\u201d</p><p>God, he has no heart. None. Last night, he kept reading out bits from my Long-Lost Sisters book, then looking up and saying, \u201cYou cannot be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe soul mate part, actually,\u201d I shoot back.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He raises his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of soul mate! A sisterly soul mate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Suzie?\u201d says Mum, looking over in surprise. \u201cShe\u2019s been like a sister to you, surely. She\u2019s such a dear girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends come and go,\u201d I say, looking away. \u201cShe\u2019s not like family. She doesn\u2019t understand me like a true sister would.\u201d</p><p>Janice looks at Mum sympathetically. \u201cYou\u2019re being very brave, dear. But you must have suffered when you found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was difficult,\u201d says Mum, sitting down at the table. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend it wasn\u2019t. Although, of course, the affair happened long before Graham met me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Janice says hastily. \u201cOf course it did! I wasn\u2019t for a moment suggesting that... that he... you...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She breaks off, flustered, and takes a gulp of coffee.</p><p>\u201cAnd in some ways...\u201d Mum pauses, stirring her drink, with a rueful smile. \u201cIn some ways it was to be expected. Graham was quite the Don Juan when he was younger. It\u2019s no wonder he found women throwing themselves at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... right,\u201d Janice says doubtfully.</p><p>Dad? Don Juan?</p> <p>I try to picture him standing at some glamorous bar, with his seventies mustache and a wide, patterned tie, surrounded by gorgeous women drinking martinis. Then my gaze drifts out the window to see him coming over the lawn, toward the back door. His graying hair is all tousled, his face is red, and even though I\u2019ve told him a million times not to, he\u2019s wearing socks inside his sandals.</p><p>\u201cWomen could never resist him,\u201d says Mum. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth of it.\u201d She brightens a little. \u201cBut we\u2019re having therapy to help us through the crisis. At the new holistic health center in Wood Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherapy?\u201d I echo in astonishment. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d says Dad, coming in at the back door. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three sessions already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a very nice girl, our therapist,\u201d says Mum. \u201cAlthough a bit nervy. Like all these young people.\u201d</p> <p>Wow. I had no idea Mum and Dad were having therapy. But it makes sense. I mean, bloody hell. How would I feel if Luke suddenly announced he had a long-lost daughter?</p><p>\u201cTherapy!\u201d Janice is saying. \u201cI can hardly believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to be realistic, Janice,\u201d says Mum. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect this kind of revelation to have no repercussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA discovery of this scale can tear a family apart,\u201d agrees Dad, popping a hazelnut whirl into his mouth. \u201cIt can rock the very foundations of a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d Janice claps a hand over her mouth, looking from Mum to Dad and back with wide eyes. \u201cWhat... what sort of repercussions are you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be anger, I expect,\u201d Mum says knowledgeably. \u201cRecriminations. Coffee, Graham?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, thanks, love.\u201d He beams at her.</p><p>\u201cTherapy is a pile of crap,\u201d says Tom suddenly. \u201cI tried it with Lucy.\u201d</p><p>We all turn and look at him. He\u2019s holding a cup of coffee in both hands and glowering at us over the top of it.</p><p>\u201cThe therapist was a woman,\u201d he adds, as though that explains everything.</p><p>\u201cI think they often are, love,\u201d Mum says cautiously.</p><p>\u201cShe took Lucy\u2019s side. She said she could understand her frustrations.\u201d Tom\u2019s hands clench more tightly round his cup. \u201cWhat about my frustrations? Lucy was supposed to be my wife! But she wasn\u2019t interested in any of my projects. Not the conservatory, not the en suite bathroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your summerhouse, Tom!\u201d I cut in quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s very... big!\u201d</p><p>In fact, it\u2019s monstrous. I nearly died when I saw it out the window this morning. It\u2019s three stories high, with gables and a deck.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just a bit worried about the planning regulations, aren\u2019t we?\u201d says Janice, nervously glancing at Tom. \u201cWe\u2019re worried it might be classed as a residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a real achievement!\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cTo build something like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy working with wood,\u201d Tom says in a gruff voice. \u201cWood doesn\u2019t let you down.\u201d He drains his cup. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d better get back to it. Hope it all goes well.\u201d</p><p>As the back door closes behind him there\u2019s an awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to make a boat next,\u201d says Janice, looking strained. \u201cA boat, on the lawn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice, have another coffee,\u201d Mum says soothingly. \u201cShall I put a splash of sherry in it?\u201d</p><p>Janice looks torn.</p><p>\u201cBetter not,\u201d she says at last. \u201cNot before twelve.\u201d</p><p>She rootles in her handbag and produces a little pill, which she pops into her mouth. Then she zips up her bag again and smiles brightly. \u201cSo! What does Jessica look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s... she\u2019s nice-looking,\u201d begins Mum. \u201cIsn\u2019t she, Graham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice-looking!\u201d says Dad. \u201cTall... slim...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark hair,\u201d adds Mum. \u201cQuite a reserved girl, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m listening avidly as they describe her. Although I glimpsed her in the street that day we got back, the sunlight was so bright and I was so distracted by Mum and Dad\u2019s weird behavior, I only got a vague impression. So all week I\u2019ve been trying to build on that image. Mum and Dad keep saying how tall and slim she is, so I\u2019ve kind of pictured her like Courteney Cox. All willowy and elegant, in a white silk trouser suit, maybe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I keep having visions of our first meeting.

Maybe it\u2019ll turn out that Jessica is a personal shopper, too, and is married to a man called Luke! She\u2019ll turn up in exactly the same Marc Jacobs jacket as me, and we can go on breakfast TV and everyone will say\u2014</p><p>Oh, except she\u2019s not a personal shopper, I suddenly remember.

In Cumbria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe North!\u201d says Janice, with as much trepidation as though Mum\u2019s said the North Pole. \u201cThat\u2019s a long way to travel! What time does she arrive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d Mum looks at the clock and frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s a point. She should have arrived by now. Graham, love, what time does Jess\u2019s train get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was about now... \u201d Dad\u2019s brow wrinkles. \u201cMaybe I should phone the station.

A few moments later, Dad\u2019s voice comes from the hall. \u201cI think it\u2019s her!\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God.</p><p>She\u2019s here. My new sister. My new soul mate!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll slip away,\u201d says Janice. \u201cLet you have your precious family moment.\u201d She squeezes my hand, then disappears out the back door.</p><p>\u201cLet me just tidy my hair,\u201d says Mum, hurrying out to the hall mirror.</p><p>\u201cQuick!\u201d I say. \u201cWhere\u2019s the present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d says Luke, handing me the cellophane-wrapped gift basket. \u201cAnd Becky...\u201d He puts a hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re excited to meet Jessica,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so am I. But remember. You are strangers. I\u2019d just... take it easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not strangers!\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister! We\u2019ve got the same blood in us!\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Doesn\u2019t Luke know anything?</p><p>I hurry out to the hall, clutching the basket. Through the frosted glass pane of the front door I can see an indistinct, blurry figure.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d says Mum as we advance toward the door, \u201cshe likes to be called Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d says Dad with a twinkle.</p><p>This is the moment! I quickly adjust my jacket, smooth down my hair, and put on my widest, most welcoming and loving smile.</p><p>Dad reaches for the handle and pulls back the front door with a flourish.</p><p>And there, standing on the doorstep, is my sister.</p><p>Ten</p><p>MY FIRST THOUGHT is that she\u2019s not exactly like Courteney Cox. Nor is she wearing a white silk trouser suit.</p><p>Her dark hair is cropped short, and she\u2019s wearing a plain, workmanlike brown shirt over jeans. I guess it\u2019s a kind of... utility chic.</p><p>And she\u2019s pretty! Prettyish. Even though I\u2019d say her makeup is maybe a bit too natural.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says in a flat, matter-of-fact voice.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say tremulously. \u201cI\u2019m Becky! Your long-lost sister!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to rush forward and fling my arms around her neck when I realize that I\u2019m holding the basket. So instead, I thrust it at her. \u201cThis is from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a present, love!\u201d Mum adds helpfully.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Jess, looking down at it. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence. I\u2019m waiting for Jess to tear off the wrappings impatiently, or say \u201cCan I open it right now?\u201d or even just exclaim \u201cOoh, Origins! My favorite!\u201d But she just puts it down on the hall table.</p><p>She\u2019s probably being polite, it occurs to me. I mean, she\u2019s never met me before.

This is just like one of the scenes in my Long-Lost Sisters book!</p><p>\u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I say, smiling to conceal my rising emotion. \u201cDidn\u2019t you somehow know you had a sister all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jess, looking blank. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, feeling a bit discomfited.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to say that. She was supposed to say \u201cI always felt you in my heart!\u201d and burst into tears.</p><p>I\u2019m not quite sure what to say next.</p><p>\u201cAnyway!\u201d Mum says cheerfully. \u201cCome on in, Jess! You must need some coffee after your journey!\u201d</p><p>As Mum ushers Jess in, I look in surprise at the brown rucksack she\u2019s carrying. It\u2019s not very big at all. And she\u2019s staying a whole week at the conference!</p> <p>\u201cIs that all your luggage?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m a light packer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you FedEx the rest?\u201d I say in an undertone, and give her a friendly \u201cI understand\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glances at Mum. \u201cThis is all I\u2019ve brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d I smile conspiratorially. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>I knew we\u2019d be kindred spirits. I knew it.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome, my dear girl!\u201d says Dad.</p><p>As he gives Jess a hug, I suddenly feel a bit weird. It\u2019s as though it\u2019s hitting me for the first time. Dad has another daughter. Not just me.</p><p>But then... that\u2019s what families are about, isn\u2019t it? Getting bigger. Adding new members.</p><p>\u201cThis is Luke, my husband,\u201d I say quickly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d he says pleasantly, coming forward. As he shakes her hand I feel a little glow of pride in each of them. I look at Mum, and she gives me an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go through!\u201d She leads the way into the living room, where there are flowers on the table, and plates of biscuits laid out invitingly. We all sit down, Jess looking a little uncomfortable on the soft, squashy sofa.</p><p>This is unreal.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting opposite my half sister. As Mum pours out the coffee I peer at Jess, mapping her face onto mine, trying to see the similarities between us. And there are loads! Or at least... some.</p> <p>She\u2019s got pretty much the same eyes as mine, except a different color and a slightly different shape. Plus her nose would be just like mine if it didn\u2019t have that pointy end. And her hair would be exactly the same \u2014 if she just grew it a bit and dyed it and maybe put on a deep-conditioning treatment.</p><p>She\u2019s probably scrutinizing me in exactly the same way, I suddenly realize.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hardly been able to sleep!\u201d I say, and give her a slightly bashful smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting to meet you at last!\u201d</p><p>Jess nods but doesn\u2019t say anything. Gosh, she is very reserved. I\u2019ll have to draw her out a bit.</p><p>\u201cAm I anything like you imagined?\u201d I give a self-conscious little laugh and smooth my hair back.</p><p>Jess surveys me for a moment, moving her eyes around my face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really imagine what you\u2019d be like,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine things much,\u201d she adds. \u201cI just take them as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a biscuit, Jess,\u201d Mum says pleasantly. \u201cThese are pecan and maple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Jess, taking one. \u201cI love pecans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I look up in astonishment. \u201cI love them too!\u201d</p><p>God, it just shows. Genes will out. We were brought up miles away from each other in different families... but we still have the same tastes!</p><p>\u201cJess, why didn\u2019t you call from the station?\u201d Dad says, taking a cup of coffee from Mum. \u201cI would have picked you up. You didn\u2019t need to take a cab!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a cab,\u201d says Jess. \u201cI walked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walked?\u201d says Dad in surprise. \u201cFrom Oxshott Station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Kingston. I took the coach down.\u201d She gulps her coffee. \u201cIt was far cheaper. I saved twenty-five pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walked all the way from Kingston?\u201d Mum looks appalled.</p><p>\u201cIt was no distance,\u201d says Jess. \u201cAnd the bus would have been three pounds fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess is a very keen walker, Becky,\u201d explains Mum. She smiles at Jess. \u201cIt\u2019s your main hobby, isn\u2019t it, love?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is too much.

I look around at the bewildered faces of my family. Honestly! What\u2019s wrong with them?</p><p>\u201cIs walking your hobby, love?\u201d Mum says uncertainly.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it is! I walk round London all the time! Don\u2019t I, Luke?\u201d</p><p>Luke gives me a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cCertain streets of London have been pounded down by your feet, yes,\u201d he agrees.</p><p>\u201cDo you do power walking, then?\u201d Jess asks, looking interested.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I think for a few moments. \u201cIt\u2019s more like... I combine it with other activities. For variety.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike cross-training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... kind of.\u201d I nod, and take a bite of biscuit.</p><p>There\u2019s another little silence, as if everyone\u2019s waiting for everyone else to speak. Why are we all so awkward? We should be natural.</p><p>\u201cDo you like... films?\u201d I ask at last.</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d replies Jess, frowning thoughtfully. \u201cI like films that say something. That have some sort of message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I agree fervently. \u201cEvery film should definitely have a message.\u201d</p> <p>Which is true. I mean... take the Lord of the Rings movies \u2014 they\u2019ve got loads of messages. Like \u201cDon\u2019t lose your ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore coffee, anyone?\u201d says Mum, looking round. \u201cThere\u2019s another coffeepot ready in the kitchen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I chime in, leaping up from the sofa. \u201cAnd, Luke, why don\u2019t you come and... er... help me? In case I... can\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>I know I don\u2019t sound very convincing, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just dying to talk to Luke.</p><p>As soon as we\u2019re in the kitchen I shut the door and look at him eagerly. \u201cSo? What do you think of my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she great? And there are so many similarities between us! Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Luke stares at me.</p> <p>\u201cJess and me! We\u2019re so alike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlike?\u201d Luke looks flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, a tad impatiently. \u201cWeren\u2019t you listening? She likes pecans, I like pecans... she likes walking, I like walking... we both like films... \u201d I make a whirling motion with my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s already this amazing understanding between us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d he says dubiously.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like her?\u201d I say, crestfallen.</p><p>\u201cOf course I like her! But I\u2019ve hardly spoken two words to her. And nor have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... I know,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut that\u2019s because we\u2019re all so stilted in there. We can\u2019t chat properly. So I thought I\u2019d suggest the two of us go out together somewhere. Really have a chance to bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. For a walk. Or... a little shopping trip, maybe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d He nods. \u201cA little shopping trip. Good idea. I\u2019m assuming this would be on your daily budget of twenty pounds.\u201d</p><p>What? I cannot believe he\u2019s bringing up the budget at a time like this. I mean, how many times do you go shopping with your long-lost sister for the very first time?</p><p>\u201cThis is a one-off, extraordinary event.\u201d I\u2019m trying to control my impatience. \u201cClearly I need an extra budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed, no one-offs,\u201d says Luke. \u201cNo \u2018unique opportunities.\u2019 Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>I feel a surge of outrage.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say, folding my arms. \u201cI won\u2019t bond with my sister.\u201d</p><p>The only sound in the kitchen is the ticking of the wall clock. I give a huge sigh and glance surreptitiously at Luke, but he seems unmoved.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Mum\u2019s voice interrupts us. \u201cWhere\u2019s the coffee? We\u2019re all waiting!\u201d She comes into the kitchen and looks from Luke to me in alarm. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a problem, is there? You\u2019re not arguing?\u201d</p><p>I turn to Mum.</p><p>\u201cI want to take Jess out shopping, but Luke says I\u2019ve got to stick to my budget!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d exclaims Mum reproachfully. \u201cI think that\u2019s a lovely idea, Becky! You two girls should spend some time together. Why not pop to Kingston? You could have lunch, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d I\u2019m shooting resentful vibes at Luke. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t got any money except twenty quid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd as I say, we\u2019re on a budget,\u201d says Luke in implacable tones. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that successful budgeting is the first rule of a happy marriage, Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course...\u201d says Mum, looking distracted. Suddenly her face brightens. \u201cThe Greenlows!\u201d</p><p>The who?</p><p>\u201cYour cousins in Australia! They sent a check for your wedding present! I\u2019ve been meaning to give it to you. It\u2019s in Australian dollars... but even so, it\u2019s quite a lot... \u201d She roots around in a drawer and pulls it out. \u201cHere we are! Five hundred Australian dollars!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d I take the check from her and examine it.</p><p>\u201cSo now you can treat yourself and Jess to something nice!\u201d Mum squeezes my arm with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I say in triumph.</p><p>\u201cOK. You win. This time.\u201d Luke rolls his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly excited, I hurry into the living room.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Jess!\u201d I say. \u201cD\u2019you want to go out somewhere? Like to the shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jess looks taken aback. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, love!\u201d says Mum, coming in behind me. \u201cHave a little spree!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go and have lunch somewhere... really get to know each other... What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d</p> <p>I feel a zing of anticipation. My first-ever shopping trip with my sister! This is so thrilling!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d says Jess. \u201cJust before you go. I brought you something too. It\u2019s not much, but...\u201d</p><p>She goes over to her rucksack, opens it, and takes out a parcel wrapped up in paper printed all over with the words happy new year 1999.</p><p>That is so cool!</p><p>\u201cI love kitsch wrapping paper!\u201d I say, admiring it. \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was free from the bank,\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cEr... excellent!\u201d</p> <p>I rip off the wrapping and find a plastic box, divided into three compartments.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I exclaim at once. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic! Thank you so much! It\u2019s just what I wanted!\u201d I fling an arm round Jess\u2019s neck and give her a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, love?\u201d Mum asks, looking at it with interest.</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019m not actually quite sure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a food saver,\u201d explains Jess. \u201cYou can keep leftovers in it, and they all stay separate. Rice... casserole... whatever. I couldn\u2019t live without mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant! It\u2019ll be so useful.\u201d I look at the three compartments thoughtfully. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep all my lip balms in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLip balms?\u201d says Jess, clearly taken aback.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always losing them! Aren\u2019t you?\u201d I put the lid back on and admire it for a few more moments. Then I pick up the wrapping paper and crumple it into a ball.</p><p>Jess winces as though someone just trod on her foot.</p><p>\u201cYou could have folded that up,\u201d she says, and I look at her, puzzled.</p><p>Why on earth would I fold used wrapping paper?</p><p>But then, maybe this is one of her pet habits that I\u2019ll have to get used to. We all have little quirks.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I say. \u201cOf course. Silly me!\u201d</p><p>I uncrease the crumpled paper, smooth it out, and fold it carefully into quarters.</p><p>\u201cThere we are.\u201d With a cheerful smile I drop it in the wastepaper bin. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>IT ONLY TAKES fifteen minutes by car to get to Kingston, which is the nearest big shopping center to Mum and Dad. I find a meter, and after about twenty attempts manage to park the car vaguely in a straight line. Jess sits stoically beside me in the passenger seat, saying nothing. Not even when the lorry driver starts hooting at me.</p><p>Anyway, never mind. The point is, we\u2019re here! It\u2019s a fantastic day, sunny but not too warm, with tiny clouds scudding across the blue sky. As I get out, I look around the sunlit street, feeling all buzzy with anticipation. My first shopping trip with my sister! What shall we do first?</p><p>As I start to feed the parking meter, I go through all the options in my head. We should definitely get a free makeover, and check out that new underwear shop Mum was talking about...</p><p>\u201cHow long exactly are we planning to stay here?\u201d Jess asks as I shove in my sixth pound coin.</p><p>\u201cThis should take us up to six o\u2019clock... and after that, parking\u2019s free!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock?\u201d She looks a bit stunned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cThe shops don\u2019t close at six. They\u2019ll be open till at least eight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And we have to go into a department store, and try on lots of evening dresses. One of my best times ever was when I spent a whole afternoon trying on posh dresses in Harrods with Suze. We kept putting on more and more outrageous million-pound frocks, and swooshing around, and all the snooty assistants got really annoyed and kept asking had we made our choice yet?</p><p>At last Suze said she thought she had... but she wanted to see it with a Cartier diamond tiara just to make sure, and could Jewelry possibly send one up?</p><p>I think that\u2019s when they asked us to leave.</p><p>God, Suze and I used to have fun together. She is just the best person in the world for saying \u201cGo on! Buy it!\u201d Even when I was stone broke, she\u2019d say \u201cBuy it! I\u2019ll pay! You can always pay me back.\u201d And then she\u2019d buy one too, and we\u2019d go and have a cappuccino.</p> <p>But anyway. There\u2019s no point getting all nostalgic.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I turn to Jess. \u201cWhat do you feel like doing first? There are loads of shops here: two department stores...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate department stores,\u201d says Jess. \u201cThey make me feel ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d That\u2019s fair enough. Loads of people hate department stores.</p><p>\u201cWell, there are lots of boutiques too. In fact, I\u2019ve just thought of the perfect place!\u201d</p> <p>I lead her off the main high street, away from the pedestrianized shopping precinct, and turn left down a cobbled side road. As we walk, I hitch my Angel bag higher on my shoulder, admiring its reflection in a shop window across the street. That bag was worth every single penny.</p><p>I\u2019m slightly surprised Jess hasn\u2019t said anything about it, actually. If my sister had an Angel bag, it would be the first thing I\u2019d mention. But then, maybe she\u2019s trying to be all cool and blas\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cSo... where do you normally shop?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWherever\u2019s cheapest,\u201d replies Jess.</p><p>\u201cMe too! I got the most fab Ralph Lauren top at this designer outlet in Utah. Ninety percent off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tend to do a lot of bulk buying,\u201d says Jess with a little frown. \u201cIf you buy large enough quantities, you can get pretty good savings.\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God. We are totally on the same wavelength. I knew we would be!</p><p>\u201cYou are so right!\u201d I exclaim in delight. \u201cThat\u2019s what I keep trying to explain to Luke! But he just can\u2019t see the logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you belong to a warehouse club?\u201d Jess looks at me with interest. \u201cOr a food co-op?\u201d</p><p>A food co-op?</p><p>\u201cEr... no. But on my honeymoon, I did loads of excellent bulk buying! I bought forty mugs and twenty silk dressing gowns!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilk dressing gowns?\u201d echoes Jess, looking taken aback.</p><p>\u201cThey were such an investment! I told Luke it made financial sense, but he just wouldn\u2019t listen... OK! Here we are! This is it.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve arrived at the glass doors of Georgina\u2019s. It\u2019s a big, light boutique selling clothes, jewelry, and the most gorgeous bags. I\u2019ve been coming here since I was twelve, and it\u2019s one of my favorite shops in the world.</p> <p>\u201cYou are going to love this shop,\u201d I say to Jess happily, and push the door open. Sandra, one of the assistants, is arranging a collection of beaded purses on a pedestal, and she looks up as the door pings. Her face lights up immediately.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Long time no see! How was the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s married life treating you?\u201d She grins. \u201cHad your first big bust-up yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d I say, grinning back. I\u2019m about to introduce Jess, when Sandra shrieks.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Is that an Angel bag? Is it real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I glow. Owning an Angel bag is just total bliss.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s got an Angel bag!\u201d Sandra calls out to the other two assistants. They rush to the front of the shop, gasping, \u201cCan I touch it? Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Becky Bloomwood.\u201d Sandra\u2019s shaking her head. \u201cOnly Becky Bloomwood would walk in here with an Angel bag. So how much did that cost you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She strokes it gingerly. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely... amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so special?\u201d Jess asks blankly. \u201cI mean... it\u2019s just a bag.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned pause, then we all burst out laughing. God, Jess is quite witty!</p><p>\u201cSandra, I want to introduce you to someone.\u201d I pull Jess forward. \u201cThis is my sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister?\u201d Sandra looks at Jess in shock. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeither did I!

You won\u2019t believe it! Becky Bloomwood\u2019s here \u2014 and she\u2019s got a sister! There are two of them!\u201d</p><p>A curtain swishes back and Georgina, the owner of the shop, comes out. She\u2019s in her fifties, with slate-gray hair and the most amazing turquoise eyes. She\u2019s wearing a velvet tunic top with pencil-thin black trousers and she\u2019s holding a fountain pen. Her eyes sparkle when she sees me and Jess.</p> <p>\u201cTwo Bloomwood sisters,\u201d she says softly. \u201cWell. What a wonderful thing.\u201d</p><p>She exchanges looks with the assistants.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll reserve two fitting rooms,\u201d says Sandra promptly.</p><p>\u201cIf there aren\u2019t enough, we can always share a fitting room, can\u2019t we, Jess!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Jess looks startled.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sisters!\u201d I give her an affectionate squeeze. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be shy with each other!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d says Sandra, glancing at Jess\u2019s face. \u201cThere are plenty of fitting rooms. Take your time walking round... and enjoy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you this was a nice place!\u201d I say happily to Jess. \u201cSo... let\u2019s start here!\u201d</p><p>I head over to a rack full of delicious-looking tops and start leafing through the hangers. \u201cIsn\u2019t this gorgeous?\u201d I pull out a pink T-shirt with a little butterfly motif. \u201cAnd this one with the daisy would really suit you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to try them?\u201d says Sandra. \u201cI can pop them in the fitting rooms for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d I hand them over and smile at Jess.</p> <p>But she doesn\u2019t smile back. In fact, she hasn\u2019t moved from the spot.</p><p>I suppose it can be a bit weird, shopping for the first time with someone new. Sometimes it just clicks straightaway, like when I went shopping for the first time with Suze and we both reached for the same Lulu Guinness makeup bag simultaneously. But sometimes it can be a bit awkward, not knowing what each other\u2019s tastes are yet... and you keep trying different things and asking \u201cDo you like this? Or this?\u201d</p><p>I think Jess might need a bit of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cThese skirts are fabulous!\u201d I say, going over to another rack, which is filled with evening wear. \u201cThis black one with the netting would look amazing on you!\u201d I take it down and hold it up against Jess. She reaches for the price tag, looks at it, and goes pale.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe these prices,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty reasonable, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I murmur back.</p><p>\u201cAnd the skirt?\u201d says Sandra, popping up behind us.</p><p>\u201cYes, please! And I\u2019ll try it in the gray... ooh, and the pink!\u201d I add, suddenly noticing a rose-colored skirt hiding at the back.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later we\u2019ve been round the whole shop and two piles of clothes are waiting for us in the fitting rooms at the back. Jess hasn\u2019t spoken much. In fact, she hasn\u2019t spoken at all. But I\u2019ve made up for it, picking out all the clothes I think would look great on her, and adding them to the pile.</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I say, exhilarated. \u201cLet\u2019s go and try them on! I bet you look fantastic in that pink skirt! You should put it with the off-the-shoulder top, and maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to try anything on,\u201d says Jess. She shoves her hands in her pockets and leans against a patch of empty wall.</p><p>I can\u2019t have heard her correctly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to try anything on.\u201d She nods toward the fitting rooms. \u201cBut you go ahead. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>Did I miss something?</p><p>\u201cBut... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any new clothes,\u201d replies Jess.</p><p>Now I\u2019m utterly baffled. Across the shop, I\u2019m aware of the assistants exchanging bewildered glances.</p><p>\u201cYou must need something!\u201d I say. \u201cA T-shirt... a pair of trousers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even want to try on one of those gorgeous tops?\u201d I hold up a fabulous little Juicy T-shirt encouragingly. \u201cJust to see what they look like on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to buy them.\u201d Jess shrugs. \u201cSo what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on me!\u201d I say, suddenly realizing. \u201cYou do know this is all my treat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste your money. Don\u2019t let me stop you, though,\u201d she adds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m at a complete loss.

OK,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p> <p>I try on most of the clothes, but my excitement\u2019s evaporated. It\u2019s not the same on my own. I wanted us to try things on together. I wanted it to be fun.</p><p>I just don\u2019t understand it. How can she not try anything on?</p><p>She must totally hate my taste, I realize with a plunge of despair. And she hasn\u2019t said anything because she wants to be polite.</p><p>\u201cAny good?\u201d says Georgina as I finally emerge.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes!\u201d I say, trying to sound upbeat. \u201cI\u2019ll take two of the tops and the pink skirt. It\u2019s really gorgeous on!\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Jess, but she\u2019s staring into space. Suddenly she comes to, as if she\u2019s just noticed me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. I\u2019ll just go and pay.\u201d</p><p>We head over to the front desk, where Sandra starts scanning in my purchases. Meanwhile Georgina is surveying Jess.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not in the mood for clothes,\u201d Georgina says suddenly, \u201cwhat about jewelry?\u201d She pulls out a tray from under the cash desk. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some lovely bracelets in. Only ten pounds. This might suit you.\u201d She lifts up a beautiful bracelet made of plain silver ovals linked together. I hold my breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d Jess nods, and I feel a huge pang of relief.</p> <p>\u201cFor Becky\u2019s sister...\u201d says Georgina, \u201cthree pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I beam at her. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic! Thank you so much, Georgina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d says Jess. \u201cI don\u2019t need a bracelet.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>My head swivels in shock. Did she not understand?</p><p>\u201cBut... it\u2019s only three pounds,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a total bargain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d Jess shrugs.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m at a loss for words. How can you not buy a bracelet for three pounds? How?</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Becky!\u201d says Sandra, handing over the rope cords of my carrier bags. There are two of them \u2014 all pale pink and glossy and scrumptious \u2014 but as my hands close round the handles I don\u2019t feel my customary rush of delight. In fact, I barely feel anything. I\u2019m too confused.</p><p>\u201cWell... bye, then!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd thanks! See you soon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Becky darling!\u201d says Georgina. \u201cAnd... Jess,\u201d she adds. \u201cSee you again, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d says Sandra. \u201cBefore you go, just let me give you the leaflet about our sale.\u201d</p><p>She hurries over, hands me a glossy leaflet, and leans forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being funny or anything,\u201d she says into my ear. \u201cBut... are you sure she\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say uncertainly as we emerge into the street. \u201cThat was fun!\u201d I glance at Jess, but she\u2019s got that composed, matter-of-fact expression and I can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s thinking. I wish just once she\u2019d smile. Or say, \u201cYes, it was fab!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t find anything in Georgina\u2019s,\u201d I venture. \u201cDid you... like the clothes?\u201d</p><p>Jess shrugs. I knew it. She just hates my taste. All that pretending she doesn\u2019t need any clothes was just to be polite.</p><p>I mean, who doesn\u2019t need a T-shirt?</p><p>Well, never mind. We\u2019ll just have to find different shops. Shops that Jess likes. As we head down the sunny street, I\u2019m thinking hard. Not skirts... not bracelets... Jeans! Everyone likes jeans. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cI really need a new pair of jeans,\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jess frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the jeans you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... nothing. But I need some more!\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cI want some a bit longer than these, not too low-slung, maybe in a really dark inky blue... \u201d</p><p>I look at Jess expectantly, waiting for her to respond. But she just continues walking.</p><p>\u201cSo... do you need any jeans?\u201d I feel like I\u2019m pushing a heavy rock uphill.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jess. \u201cBut you go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe another time.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>By now we\u2019ve reached the corner \u2014 and yes! L.K. Bennett is having a sale!</p><p>\u201cLook at these!\u201d I exclaim in excitement, hurrying to the big window filled with colorful strappy sandals. \u201cAren\u2019t they gorgeous? What kind of shoes do you like?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jess runs her eyes over the display.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really bother much with shoes,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one ever notices shoes.\u201d</p><p>For a moment my legs feel weak with shock.</p><p>No one ever notices shoes?</p> <p>But... of course! She\u2019s joking! I\u2019m going to have to get used to her dry sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh, you!\u201d I say, and give her a friendly push. \u201cWell... I might just pop in and try some on, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>If I try on enough pairs, I\u2019m thinking, Jess is bound to join in too.</p><p>Except... she doesn\u2019t. Not at the next shop, either. Nor does she try any of the perfumes or makeup at Space.NK. I\u2019m laden with bags, but Jess still doesn\u2019t have one thing. She can\u2019t be enjoying herself. She must think I\u2019m a rubbish sister.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any... kitchenware?\u201d I suggest in desperation.</p> <p>We could buy cool aprons, or some chrome gadgety things... But Jess is shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI get all mine from the discount warehouse. It\u2019s much cheaper than the high street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what about... luggage!\u201d I exclaim, suddenly inspired. \u201cLuggage is one of those areas you can really forget about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any luggage,\u201d says Jess. \u201cI\u2019ve got my rucksack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m totally running out of ideas. What else is there? Lamps, maybe? Or... rugs?</p> <p>Suddenly Jess\u2019s eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d she says, sounding more animated than she has all day. \u201cDo you mind if I go in here?\u201d</p><p>I stop still. We\u2019re outside a tiny, quite nondescript stationery shop, which I\u2019ve never been into.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d My words come tumbling out in a whoosh of relief. \u201cGo ahead! Fantastic!\u201d</p><p>Stationery! Of course! Why on earth didn\u2019t I think of that before? She\u2019s a student... she writes all the time... that must be her thing!</p><p>The shop is so narrow I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll fit in with all my carrier bags, so I wait outside on the pavement, thrilled she\u2019s finally shown an interest in something. I wonder what she\u2019s buying. Gorgeous notebooks? Or handmade cards? Or maybe some beautiful fountain pen?</p><p>I mean, all kudos to her. I\u2019d never even noticed this shop before!</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you buy?\u201d I demand in excitement as soon as she comes out holding two bulging carrier bags. \u201cShow! Show!\u201d</p> <p>Jess looks blank.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy anything,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cBut... your carrier bags! What\u2019s in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the sign?\u201d She gestures at a handwritten postcard in the window. \u201cThey\u2019re giving away used padded envelopes.\u201d</p><p>She opens up her carriers to reveal a selection of battered Jiffy bags and a bundle of squashed-up, graying bubble wrap.</p><p>\u201cI must have saved at least ten pounds,\u201d she adds with satisfaction. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll always come in handy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m speechless.</p><p>\u201cEr... fab!\u201d I manage at last. \u201cThey\u2019re really gorgeous! I love the... um... labels. So... we\u2019ve both done really well! Let\u2019s go and have a cappuccino!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a coffee shop round the corner, and as we approach it my spirits begin to rise again. So maybe the shopping hasn\u2019t gone as I imagined, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, here we are, two sisters, coming for a cappuccino and a gossip together! We\u2019ll sit at a lovely marble table, and sip our coffees, and tell each other all about ourselves...</p><p>\u201cI brought a flask,\u201d comes Jess\u2019s voice behind me.</p><p>I turn round to see Jess taking a white plastic flask out of her rucksack.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say faintly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want that overpriced coffee.\u201d She jabs a thumb at the caf\u00e9. \u201cThe markup at those places is appalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can sit on this bench. I\u2019ll just wipe it clean.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at her in rising dismay.

You could save hundreds of pounds a year. Just buy a secondhand flask. And you can use coffee grounds at least twice.

I\u2019m not entirely sure she got it.</p><p>\u201cMy Ph.D. is on the petrogenesis and geochemistry of fluorite-hematite deposits,\u201d she says, showing more animation than she has all day.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I understood one bit of that.</p><p>\u201cEr... great!\u201d I say. \u201cSo... how come you decided to study rocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father got me into it,\u201d says Jess, and her face relaxes into a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s his passion too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I say in amazement. \u201cI never knew he was into rocks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your dad.\u201d She gives me a scathing look. \u201cMy dad. My stepfather. The man who brought me up.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t mean Dad. That was really stupid.</p><p>Suddenly my head is full of questions.</p><p>\u201cSo... did your dad... did he always know that you...\u201d I trail off, not quite knowing how to put it.</p><p>\u201cMy dad knew I wasn\u2019t his, pretty much from the word go.\u201d Jess is turning a spoon over and over in her fingers. \u201cBut he raised me all the same. He never treated me any different from my brothers.\u201d</p><p>I dart a look at her averted face.</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d I ask hesitantly. \u201cThat he wasn\u2019t really your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But we didn\u2019t talk about it. He was my real dad, as far as I was concerned. Still is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever want to go looking for your... biological father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have done.\u201d She stops rotating the spoon. \u201cOnce. But then Mum died and Dad was all I had left. I didn\u2019t need another dad. It was only when I found out about this blood disorder. I realized there could be people related to me, not knowing they were at risk. I felt responsible. It would have preyed on my mind.\u201d She looks up. \u201cYou should get yourself tested, Becky.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cDad already has been, but he\u2019s OK.

Don\u2019t you find it amazing?\u201d I lean forward and put my hand next to hers. \u201cLook! We have the same blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Jess looks unmoved. \u201cIt\u2019s just a biological fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... haven\u2019t you always wanted a sister? Haven\u2019t you always wondered what it would be like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d She must see the hurt on my face. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s been interesting to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Interesting? It\u2019s been interesting?</p> <p>I push the froth around the cappuccino with my spoon. She doesn\u2019t want to get to know me. My own sister doesn\u2019t want to get to know me. What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>Nothing\u2019s going the way I planned. I thought today would be one of the best days of my life. I thought shopping with my sister would be fun. I thought we\u2019d be bonded by now. I thought we\u2019d be having coffee, surrounded by all our fab new things, laughing and teasing each other...</p><p>\u201cSo, shall we go back to your mum\u2019s?\u201d says Jess, draining her cup.</p><p>\u201cWhat... already?\u201d I say, startled. \u201cBut... we\u2019ve got hours left. You haven\u2019t even bought anything yet!\u201d</p><p>Jess sighs impatiently.</p><p>\u201cLook, Becky. I wanted to be polite, so I came along today. But the truth is, I really can\u2019t stand shopping.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks. I knew she wasn\u2019t having a good time. I knew she hated my taste. I have to salvage this.</p><p>\u201cI know we haven\u2019t found the right shops yet.\u201d I lean forward eagerly. \u201cBut there are more. We can go into different ones\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jess interrupts. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t like shopping. Full stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatalogs!\u201d I say, suddenly inspired. \u201cWe could go home, get a load of catalogs... it\u2019d be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get this through your head?\u201d Jess exclaims in exasperation. \u201cRead my lips very carefully. I. Hate. Shopping.\u201d</p><p>When we arrive home, Luke is in the front garden, talking to Dad. As he sees us pulling into the drive he looks stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing back so soon?\u201d he says, hurrying over to the car. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine!\u201d I say. My brain still feels like it\u2019s short-circuited. \u201cWe were just... quicker than I thought we\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Jess, getting out.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>As Jess heads toward Dad, Luke gets into the car beside me and closes the door.</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... fine. I think.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t quite get my head round the day. My mind keeps replaying the way I fantasized it would be.

But this weekend will be better, I just know it will. I mean, in hindsight, the first meeting was bound to be a bit awkward. But this time we\u2019ll have gotten through that first hurdle and will be far more relaxed and easy with each other. Plus, I\u2019m far more prepared than I was last time. After Jess left on Saturday, Mum and Dad could see I was a bit down, so they made a pot of tea and we had a good old chat. And we all agreed it\u2019s impossible to get on with someone straightaway if you don\u2019t know anything about her. So Mum and Dad racked their brains for all the details they knew about Jess and wrote them all down. And I\u2019ve been learning them all week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like, for instance: she did nine GCSE exams and got As in all of them.

And her favorite dog is a...</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I grab the crib sheet and scan down.</p><p>Oh yes. A border collie.</p> <p>It\u2019s Saturday morning, and I\u2019m in our spare room, making my final preparations for Jess\u2019s arrival. I bought a book this week called The Gracious Hostess, and it said the guest room should be \u201cwell thought-out, with little individual touches to make your guest feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>So on the dressing table are flowers and a book of poetry, and by the bed I\u2019ve put a careful selection of magazines: Rambling News, Caving Enthusiast, and Potholing Monthly, which is a magazine you can order only on the Internet. (I had to take out a two-year subscription, actually, just to get a copy. But that\u2019s all right. I can just forward the other twenty-three copies to Jess.)</p><p>And on the wall is my pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, which I am so proud of. It\u2019s an enormous poster of a cave! With stalag... things.</p><p>I fluff up the pillows, anticipating the weekend. Tonight will be totally different from last time. For a start, we won\u2019t go near any shops. I\u2019ve just planned a nice, simple, relaxed evening in. We can watch a movie and eat popcorn, and do each other\u2019s nails, and really chill. And then later on I\u2019ll come and sit on her bed and we can wear matching pajamas and eat peppermint creams, and talk long into the night.</p><p>\u201cThis all looks very nice,\u201d says Luke, coming in behind me. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job. In fact, the whole apartment looks amazing!\u201d He wanders out, and I follow him into the hall. Although there are still a few boxes here and there, the whole place looks so much clearer!</p> <p>We walk into the sitting room, now utterly transformed. All the piles of rugs and boxes and crates have disappeared. There are just two sofas, two coffee tables, and the Indonesian gamelan.</p><p>\u201cHats off to you, Becky,\u201d says Luke, looking around. \u201cIn fact, I owe you an apology. You told me you could make it all work \u2014 and I doubted you. But I would never have guessed so much clutter could be so well organized.\u201d He looks around the room incredulously. \u201cThere were so many things in here! Where have they all gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just... found homes for them!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m really impressed,\u201d he says, running his hand over the mantelpiece, which is bare except for the five handpainted eggs. \u201cYou should become a storage consultant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will!\u201d</p><p>OK, I think I want to get off this subject now. Any minute Luke\u2019s going to start looking a bit more closely and say something like \u201cWhere are the Chinese urns?\u201d or \u201cWhere are the wooden giraffes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just check my e-mails,\u201d I say casually. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make us some nice coffee?\u201d</p><p>I wait until Luke\u2019s safely in the kitchen, then hurry to my computer and type in</p><p>www.eBay.co.uk</p><p>eBay has totally saved my life. Totally.</p><p>In fact, what did I ever do before eBay? It is the most brilliant, genius invention since... well, since whoever invented shops.</p><p>The minute I got back from Mum\u2019s last Saturday I joined, and put up for sale the Chinese urns, the wooden giraffes, and three of the rugs. And in three days they\u2019d all been sold! Just like that! So the next day I put up five more rugs and two coffee tables. And since then, I haven\u2019t stopped.</p><p>I quickly click on \u201cItems I\u2019m Selling,\u201d glancing at the door every so often. I mustn\u2019t be long or Luke\u2019ll come in and see me, but I\u2019m desperate to find out if anyone has bid on the totem pole.</p><p>A moment later the page appears... and yes! Result! Someone\u2019s bid fifty pounds! I feel a hit of adrenaline and punch the air with a whoop (a quiet one, so Luke won\u2019t hear). It\u2019s such a power kick, selling stuff! I\u2019m totally addicted!</p> <p>And the best thing of all is, I\u2019m killing two birds with one stone. I\u2019m solving our clutter problems \u2014 and I\u2019m making money. Quite a lot of money, actually! I don\u2019t want to boast \u2014 but every single day this week I\u2019ve made a profit. I\u2019m just like a City bond trader!</p><p>For example, I got \u00a3200 for the slate coffee table \u2014 and we certainly didn\u2019t pay more than a hundred for it. I got \u00a3100 for the Chinese urns, and \u00a3150 each for the five kilims, which only cost about \u00a340 each in Turkey, if that. And best of all, I made a cool \u00a32,000 on ten Tiffany clocks I don\u2019t even remember buying! The guy even paid in cash and came to pick them up! Honestly, I\u2019m doing so well, I could make eBay trading my career! I can hear Luke getting mugs out in the kitchen, and I click off \u201cItems I\u2019m Selling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, very quickly, I click on \u201cItems I\u2019m Bidding On.\u201d</p><p>Obviously I joined eBay very much as a seller rather than a bidder. But I just happened to be browsing the other day when I came across this amazing orange vintage coat from the fifties with big black buttons. It\u2019s a total one-off, and no one had made a single bid on it. So I made a tiny exception, just for that.</p><p>And also for a pair of Prada shoes, which only had one bid on them, for fifty quid. I mean, Prada shoes for fifty quid!</p><p>And that fantastic Yves Saint Laurent evening dress, which some other bidder got in the end. God, that was annoying. I won\u2019t make that mistake again.</p> <p>I click on the vintage coat \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe it. I bid \u00a380 yesterday, which is the reserve price, and I\u2019ve been trumped with \u00a3100. Well, I\u2019m not losing this one. No way. I quickly type in \u201c\u00a3120\u201d and close down, just as Luke comes in with a tray.</p><p>\u201cAny e-mails?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cEr... some!\u201d I say brightly, and take a cup of coffee. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t told Luke about the whole eBay thing because there\u2019s no need for him to get involved in every mundane detail of the household finances.</p><p>\u201cI found these in the kitchen.\u201d Luke nods toward a tin of luxury Fortnum and Mason chocolate biscuits on the tray. \u201cVery nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a little treat.\u201d I smile at him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all within the budget.\u201d</p><p>Which is true! My budget is so much bigger now, I can afford a few luxuries!</p><p>Luke takes a sip of coffee. Then his eyes fall on a pink folder lying on his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>I wondered when he was going to notice that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you,\u201d I say casually. \u201cJust a little thing I\u2019ve put together to help you. My ideas for the future of the company.\u201d</p> <p>It hit me in the bath the other day. If Luke wins this great big pitch, he\u2019s going to have to expand the company. And I know all about expansion.</p><p>The reason is, when I was a personal shopper at Barneys, I had this client named Sheri, who owned her own business. I heard the whole saga of how she expanded too fast and all the mistakes she made, like renting six thousand square feet of office space in TriBeCa which she never used. I mean, at the time I thought it was really boring. I actually dreaded her appointments. But now I realize it\u2019s all totally relevant to Luke!</p><p>So I decided to write down everything she used to say, like consolidating your key markets and acquiring competitors. And that\u2019s when an even better idea came to me: Luke should buy up another PR firm.</p><p>I even know which one he should buy! David Neville, who used to work for Farnham PR, set up his own firm three years ago, when I was still a financial journalist. He\u2019s really talented and everyone keeps saying how well he\u2019s doing. But I know he\u2019s secretly been struggling, because I saw his wife, Judy, at the hairdresser\u2019s last week and she told me.</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke\u2019s frowning. \u201cI haven\u2019t got time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll be useful to you!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cWhen I was at Barneys I learned all about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarneys? Becky, I run a PR company. Not a fashion store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve had these ideas\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky,\u201d Luke interrupts impatiently. \u201cRight now my priority is bringing in new business. Nothing else. I don\u2019t have time for your ideas, OK?\u201d He stuffs the folder into his briefcase without opening it. \u201cI\u2019ll look at it sometime.\u201d</p><p>I sit down, feeling a bit crestfallen. The doorbell rings and I look up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh! Maybe that\u2019s Jess, early!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019ll be Gary,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019ll let him in.\u201d</p><p>Gary is Luke\u2019s second in command. He ran the London office while we were living in New York and on our honeymoon, and he and Luke get on really well. He even ended up being Luke\u2019s best man at our wedding. Kind of.</p><p>The wedding\u2019s a bit of a long story, actually.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Gary doing here?\u201d I ask in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI told him to meet me here,\u201d replies Luke, heading out to the entry phone and buzzing it. \u201cWe have some work to do on the pitch. Then we\u2019re planning to go to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, trying to hide my disappointment.</p><p>I was really looking forward to spending a bit of time with Luke today, before Jess arrives. He\u2019s so busy these days. He hasn\u2019t been home once before eight all week, and last night he didn\u2019t arrive back until eleven. I know they\u2019re working hard at the moment. And I know the Arcodas pitch is important. But still. For months and months, Luke and I were together twenty-four hours a day... and now I hardly ever see him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe I could help with the pitch,\u201d I suggest. \u201cI could join the team!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Luke says without even looking up.</p><p>\u201cThere must be something I could do,\u201d I say, leaning forward eagerly. \u201cLuke, I really want to help the company. I\u2019ll do anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all pretty much under control,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBut thanks. Do you want to come out to lunch with us?\u201d he adds kindly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome if you don\u2019t mind a bit of shop talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201d I give a little shrug. \u201cHave fun. Hi, Gary,\u201d I add, as he appears at the front door.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky!\u201d Gary says cheerfully. He\u2019s tall and well-built with a broad, amiable face. He\u2019s worked for Luke for three years, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him look angry, or even rattled.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Luke says, and ushers him into the study. The door closes \u2014 then almost immediately it opens again and Luke looks out. \u201cBecky, if the phone rings, could you answer it? I don\u2019t want to be disturbed for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>Answering the phone is not what I meant by helping the company.</p> <p>I wander down the corridor toward the sitting room, feeling deflated. I\u2019m an intelligent, creative person. I could be a help, I know I could. I mean, Luke and I are supposed to be a partnership. We\u2019re supposed to do things together.</p><p>The phone rings and I jump. Maybe it\u2019s Jess. Maybe she\u2019s here! I hurry to the receiver and pick it up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Brandon?\u201d comes a man\u2019s raspy voice.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nathan Temple here.\u201d</p> <p>My mind is totally blank. Nathan? I don\u2019t know any Nathans...</p><p>\u201cYou may recall, we met in Milan a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. It\u2019s the man from the shop! I should have recognized his voice straightaway.</p><p>\u201cHello! Of course I remember! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, thank you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you? Enjoying your new bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely love it!\u201d I can\u2019t hide my enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my whole life! Thank you so much again for what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Down the line I hear the click of his lighter. I\u2019m not entirely sure what to say next.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I could buy you lunch,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cAs a proper thank-you. Anywhere you like!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d He sounds amused. \u201cBesides which, my doctor has put me on a diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. That\u2019s a shame\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, since you mention it... As you said yourself in Milan, one good turn deserves another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! I really owe you one! If there\u2019s anything I can do, anything at all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of your husband, Luke. I was hoping he might do me a small favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d love to!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI know he would!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he there? Might I have a quick word?\u201d</p><p>If I get Luke to the phone now I\u2019ll have to disturb him. And explain who Nathan Temple is... and how I met him... and about the Angel bag...</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I say, turning back to the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s not in right now, I\u2019m afraid. But can I take a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation is this. I\u2019m opening a five-star hotel on the island of Cyprus. It\u2019s going to be a top-of-the-range resort and I\u2019m planning a big launch. Celebrity party, press coverage. I\u2019d very much like your husband to be involved.\u201d</p><p>A celebrity party in Cyprus? A five-star hotel?</p><p>Oh my God. This would be so wonderful for Luke\u2019s business! Forget about Arcodas. The Nathan Temple account could be fab!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to!\u201d I say, regaining my voice. \u201cIt sounds fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband\u2019s very talented. He has a very classy reputation. Which is what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I can\u2019t help but glow with pride. \u201cHe is pretty good at what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather he specializes in financial institutions, though. Would a hotel launch be a problem?\u201d</p><p>My heart starts thudding. I can\u2019t let this opportunity slip away. I have to sell Brandon Communications.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I say smoothly. \u201cWe at Brandon Communications are skilled in all areas of public relations, from finance to big business to hotels. Versatility is our motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He sounds pleased. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping to hear. I attended a party run by your husband last year as a guest of a guest. A property investment launch in New York. Very slick affair, and a huge media attendance. I was impressed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn that amazing brownstone?\u201d I chime in, delighted. \u201cWith the marble staircase and the champagne cocktails? I was there too!\u201d</p><p>I nearly add that I was the one in a backless red Donna Karan dress, but stop myself in time.</p><p>\u201cYou work for the company, then?\u201d He sounds interested.</p><p>\u201cI have a... small consultancy role,\u201d I say, crossing my fingers. \u201cSpecializing in strategy. And by sheer chance, one of our current strategies is an expansion into the... er... five-star travel arena.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it looks like we might be able to help one another out,\u201d says Nathan Temple. \u201cPerhaps we could set up a meeting this week? As I say, we\u2019re very anxious to have your husband, Luke, on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mr. Temple,\u201d I say in my most charming manner. \u201cYou did me a favor. Now this is my chance to repay it. My husband would be delighted to help you. In fact, he\u2019ll make it a priority!\u201d I beam at the phone. \u201cLet me take your number, and I\u2019ll get Luke to call you later today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to your husband\u2019s call. Nice talking to you again, Mrs. Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! Call me Becky!\u201d</p><p>As I replace the receiver I\u2019m grinning from ear to ear.</p> <p>There\u2019s Luke and Gary, slaving away over their pitch \u2014 and meanwhile I\u2019ve snaffled them a fabulous new client without even trying! And not even some dreary old bank. A five-star hotel in Cyprus! A huge, prestigious job!</p><p>Just then the study door opens and Luke comes out, holding a folder. As he picks up his briefcase he glances over and gives me a distracted smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Becky? We\u2019re off to lunch. Who was that on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... just a friend of mine,\u201d I say carelessly. \u201cBy the way, Luke... maybe I will come along to lunch after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>When he hears how I\u2019ve been wheeling and dealing with top business magnates on his behalf, he\u2019ll be totally gobsmacked! And then maybe he\u2019ll see just how much of a help I can be to him.</p> <p>Just wait till I tell them the news. Just wait!</p><p>All the way to the restaurant, I\u2019m hugging my secret. Honestly, Luke should hire me! I should become some kind of ambassador for the company! A chance meeting in Milan \u2014 and this is what results. A brand-new client for the company. Luke\u2019s going to be so impressed when I tell him the news. He\u2019ll probably order a bottle of champagne straightaway.</p><p>This could be an amazing new business opportunity for him! He could start a whole division devoted to five-star hotels and spas. Brandon Communications Luxury Travel. And I could be part of it, maybe.</p><p>I could be the one who test-markets the spas.</p><p>\u201cSo... still on the dinner we\u2019re hosting,\u201d Gary is saying to Luke as we sit down. \u201cYou\u2019ve sorted out the gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThey\u2019re at home. What about transport? Have we organized cars for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get someone onto it.\u201d Gary makes a careful note on a little pocket pad, then looks up at me. \u201cSorry, Becky. This must be boring. You know this pitch is pretty important to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I say with a demure smile. \u201cLuke was just telling me how winning new business is your number-one priority right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Gary nods.</p><p>\u201cI expect it\u2019s quite hard work, bringing in new clients,\u201d I add innocently.</p><p>\u201cYes, it can be.\u201d Gary smiles.</p><p>I so want to blurt out the whole story. But I must time my revelation perfectly.</p><p>As the waiter pours mineral water for Luke and Gary, I suddenly notice three girls at a nearby table, nudging each other and pointing at my Angel bag. Trying to hide my delight, I casually adjust the bag on my chair so that the embossed angel and Dante are clearly visible.</p><p>It\u2019s just amazing. Everywhere I go, people notice this bag. It is the best thing I have ever bought, ever, ever. And now it\u2019s brought Luke new business, too. It\u2019s a lucky charm!</p><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d I say, lifting my glass as the waiter retreats. \u201cTo new clients!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew clients,\u201d Luke and Gary echo in unison. Gary takes a sip of water, then turns to Luke. \u201cSo, Luke, just regarding the last proposal we\u2019re making... I spoke to Sam Church the other day\u2014\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t wait a moment longer. I have to tell them.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of churches!\u201d I interrupt in bright tones.</p><p>There\u2019s a startled pause.</p><p>\u201cBecky, we weren\u2019t talking about churches,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were! Kind of.\u201d</p><p>Luke looks bemused. OK, I could have managed this a little more smoothly. But never mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, speaking of churches...\u201d I press on. \u201cAnd... er... religious buildings in general... I suppose you\u2019ve heard of a man called Nathan Temple, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I look from Luke to Gary, unable to hide my elation. Both men look back at me curiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve heard of Nathan Temple,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>Ha! I knew it.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty big player, right? Pretty important.\u201d I raise my eyebrows in a cryptic manner. \u201cHe\u2019s probably someone you\u2019d really like to network with. Maybe even get as a new client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly!\u201d Luke wrinkles his nose as though he\u2019s found a worm in his apple.</p><p>I pause uncertainly. What\u2019s \u201chardly\u201d supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cOf course you would!\u201d I persist. \u201cHe\u2019d be a great client!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Becky. He wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Luke takes a sip of water. \u201cSorry, Gary, what were you saying?\u201d</p> <p>This is not going according to plan. I had the whole conversation mapped out in my head. Luke was going to say, \u201cI\u2019d adore Nathan Temple as a client, of course \u2014 but how does one get to him?\u201d Then Gary was going to sigh and say, \u201cNo one can get to Nathan Temple.\u201d And then I was going to lean across the table with a confidential little smile...</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve spoken to Sam Church,\u201d resumes Gary, taking some papers out of his briefcase. \u201cAnd he gave me these. Have a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I interrupt, trying to haul the conversation back on track. \u201cSo, Luke, why wouldn\u2019t you want Nathan Temple as a client? I mean, he\u2019s rich... he\u2019s famous... \u201d</p><p>\u201cInfamous, more like,\u201d Gary puts in with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou do know who Nathan Temple is,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s a top businessman and... er... a high-class hotelier\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, he runs the seediest chain of motels in the land.\u201d</p><p>My smile freezes on my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I manage at last.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d says Gary. \u201cBe fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he used to,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThat\u2019s how he made his money. Value Motels. Water beds thrown in for free. And whatever other business went on behind closed doors.\u201d He pulls a disdainful face and pours out more water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard the rumor he\u2019s considering buying up the Daily World?\u201d asks Gary.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Luke says with a grimace. \u201cSpare us. You know he has a conviction for grievous bodily harm?\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning. A conviction? But he seemed so nice. He was so sweet! He got me my Angel bag!</p> <p>\u201cApparently he\u2019s reformed.\u201d Gary shrugs. \u201cBecome a new person. So he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new person?\u201d says Luke dismissively. \u201cGary, he\u2019s little better than a gangster.\u201d</p><p>I nearly drop my glass on the floor. I owe a favor to a gangster?</p><p>\u201c \u2018Gangster\u2019s\u2019 a little harsh,\u201d says Gary, amused. \u201cThat was years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese people never change,\u201d says Luke firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard man, Luke!\u201d Gary says with a laugh. Then he suddenly spots my face. \u201cBecky, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say shrilly, and take a gulp of water. \u201cLovely!\u201d</p><p>I feel hot and cold all over. This is not going to plan.</p><p>This is not going remotely to plan.</p><p>My first brilliant networking triumph. The first big client I woo for Brandon Communications. And he turns out to be a motel king with a criminal conviction.</p><p>But how was I supposed to know? How? He seemed so charming. He was so well dressed!</p><p>And now I\u2019ve said Luke will work for him.</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>I mean... I didn\u2019t actually promise anything, did I?</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I can hear my own voice now, gaily chirping: \u201cMy husband would be delighted to do it. In fact, he\u2019ll make it a priority!\u201d</p><p>I gaze at my menu, trying to stay calm. OK, it\u2019s obvious what I have to do. I have to tell Luke. Yes. Just confess the whole thing. Milan... the Angel bag... the phone call today... everything. It\u2019s the grown-up option.</p><p>I glance at Luke\u2019s taut face as he reads through his paperwork and feel a spasm of fear.</p><p>I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny you should have mentioned Nathan Temple, Becky,\u201d says Gary, sipping his water. \u201cI haven\u2019t even told you this yet, Luke, but he\u2019s been in touch with us about doing the PR for some new hotel.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Gary\u2019s genial face and feel a huge wave of relief.</p><p>Of course they would have made an official approach too. Of course! I\u2019ve been worrying about nothing! Luke will do the job and I\u2019ll be quits with Nathan Temple and everything will be fine... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI take it we\u2019ll decline,\u201d Gary adds.</p><p>Decline?

Let alone the rest of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s so... narrow-minded!

And prospective clients.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not my client. Nor my prospective client,\u201d says Luke with finality. \u201cAnd neither will he ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well... that\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d</p><p>We all study our menus. At least, the other two are studying their menus. I\u2019m pretending to study mine, while my mind goes skittering round and round.</p><p>So I can\u2019t persuade Luke. So I\u2019ll just have to manage the situation. This is what supportive wives do. They deal with problems discreetly and efficiently. I bet Hillary Clinton\u2019s done this kind of thing millions of times.</p><p>It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll simply phone up Nathan Temple, thank him for his kind offer, and say that, unfortunately, Luke\u2019s really, really busy\u2014</p><p>No. I\u2019ll say he tried to call but no one answered...</p><p>\u201cBecky? Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>I look up to see both men looking at me with concern. Abruptly I realize I\u2019m tapping the table harder and harder with one of Gary\u2019s pencils.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great!\u201d I say, and quickly put it down.</p><p>OK. I have a plan. What I will do is... I will say that Luke is ill.</p><p>Yes. No one can argue with that.</p><p>So as soon as we get home and Luke is closeted with Gary in the study, I hurry to the phone in our bedroom. I kick the bedroom door shut and quickly dial the number Nathan Temple gave me. To my huge relief, it clicks straight into voice mail.</p><p>And now that I\u2019m listening properly, he sounds exactly like a motel king with a criminal past. Why on earth didn\u2019t I hear it before? I must be deaf or something!</p><p>The beep goes, and I jump in fright.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice light and easy. \u201cThis is a message for Mr. Temple. It\u2019s Becky Brandon here. Er... I told my husband all about your hotel, and he thought it sounded fab! But I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not very well at the moment. So he won\u2019t be able to do the launch after all. Which is a real shame! Anyway, I hope you find someone else! Bye!\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down and sink onto the bed, my heart thumping. All this stress is going to give me a heart attack. Maybe I should try some of my yoga exercises from Sri Lanka. I cross my legs and close my eyes.</p><p>Breathe in. Breathe out. I am a radiant being of white light. My body is a temple.</p><p>Temple. Oh God...</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke opens the door, and I nearly fall off the bed in terror.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Luke looks alarmed. \u201cBecky, are you hyperventilating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust doing a bit of relaxing yoga!\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just wanted to tell you\u201d\u2014Luke smiles\u2014\u201cJess is here.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p> <p>\u201cSHE\u2019S COMING UP in the lift,\u201d says Luke, opening the front door. \u201cWho were you on the phone with, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI was just... er... checking the time.\u201d</p><p>Gradually my pulse is slowing down. It\u2019s fine, I tell myself firmly. It\u2019s done. Everything\u2019s sorted.</p><p>I can hear the lift moving, down below. Jess is on her way! Quickly I grab my crib sheet and skim it one last time. Border collies... hates avocados... math teacher was called Mr. Lewis...</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019d put that away before she arrives,\u201d says Luke, looking amused.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>I stuff it into my pocket and take a few deep breaths to prepare myself.</p><p>\u201cListen, Becky,\u201d says Luke, watching me. \u201cBefore she arrives... I sincerely hope you two hit it off this time. But you are keeping a sense of proportion? You don\u2019t have all your hopes pinned on this visit, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Luke,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cDon\u2019t you know me better than that?\u201d</p><p>Of course I have all my hopes pinned on this visit. Because I know it\u2019s going to work out. Things will be different this time. For a start, we won\u2019t do anything that Jess doesn\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m just going to follow her lead.</p><p>And the other thing I must remember is a tip that Luke gave me. He said it was great that I was so friendly toward Jess \u2014 but that she\u2019s quite reserved, and maybe great big hugs weren\u2019t her style. So he suggested I should be a bit more collected, just until we know each other better. Which is a fair point.</p> <p>From the hall comes the noise of the lift getting closer. Why is this lift so slow? And then suddenly the doors are opening to reveal Jess in jeans and a gray T-shirt, holding her rucksack.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I cry, running forward. \u201cWelcome! We can do whatever you want this weekend! Anything! Just name it! You\u2019re the boss!\u201d</p><p>Jess doesn\u2019t move. In fact... she seems frozen to the spot.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jess,\u201d Luke says more calmly. \u201cWelcome to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in!\u201d I spread my arms. \u201cMake yourself at home! No avocados here!\u201d</p><p>Jess stares at me uncertainly, then glances at the buttons of the lift, almost like she wants to go back down again.</p><p>\u201cLet me take your bag,\u201d says Luke. \u201cHow was your conference?\u201d</p><p>He ushers Jess into the flat, and she looks around warily.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, thanks,\u201d she says. \u201cHi, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! It\u2019s so great you\u2019re here! I\u2019ll show you your room.\u201d</p><p>I open the door of the guest room proudly, waiting for her to comment on the cave picture, or Potholing Monthly. But she says nothing, just \u201cThanks,\u201d as Luke puts down her bag.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I point out. \u201cIt\u2019s a cave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d says Jess, looking slightly bewildered.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 and I feel a tiny spasm of alarm.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s all have a drink!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cLet\u2019s open a bottle of champagne!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky... it\u2019s only four o\u2019clock,\u201d says Luke. \u201cMaybe a cup of tea would be more appropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a cup of tea,\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cTea, then!\u201d I say. \u201cExcellent idea!\u201d</p><p>I lead the way into the kitchen, and Jess follows, peering all around the flat.</p><p>\u201cNice place,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s done a great job on it,\u201d Luke says pleasantly. \u201cYou should have seen it this time last week. We\u2019d had a load of purchases delivered from our honeymoon... and you could not move for the stuff.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI still don\u2019t know how you did it, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d I say modestly. \u201cJust a question of organization.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m switching on the kettle as Gary comes into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThis is my associate, Gary,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThis is Becky\u2019s half sister, Jess. She comes from Cumbria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d says Gary as he shakes Jess\u2019s hand. \u201cI know Cumbria! Beautiful part of the country. Whereabouts do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA village called Scully,\u201d replies Jess. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rural. Very different from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to Scully!\u201d says Gary. \u201cYears ago. Isn\u2019t there a famous walk nearby?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou probably mean Scully Pike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! We tried to climb it, but the weather took a turn. Nearly fell off the bloody thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be dangerous,\u201d says Jess. \u201cYou have to know what you\u2019re doing. Idiots come up from the south and get in all sorts of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Gary says cheerfully. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth it for the scenery. Those drystone walls are spectacular,\u201d he adds to Luke. \u201cLike works of art. Miles and miles of them, strung out across the countryside.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m listening to the conversation in total fascination. I\u2019d love to get to know a bit of rural England a bit better. I\u2019d love to see some drystone walls. I mean, all I know is London and Surrey, which is practically London anyway.</p><p>\u201cWe should buy a cottage in Cumbria!\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cIn Jess\u2019s village! Then we could see you all the time,\u201d I add to Jess. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s quite a long silence.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Jess at last. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be buying any cottages in the near future,\u201d says Luke. \u201cWe\u2019re on a budget, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I retort. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sticking to it, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIncredibly, you are.\u201d He looks at the tin of Fortnum biscuits on the counter. \u201cAlthough, quite frankly, I have no idea how you\u2019re managing it.\u201d He opens the fridge. \u201cLook at all this. Stuffed olives... smoked lobster... and this is supposed to be on a budget?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling a little glow of pride. All that food is courtesy of selling those Tiffany clocks! I was so delighted, I went straight out and bought a big hamperful of all Luke\u2019s favorite things.</p><p>\u201cJust a question of good household management,\u201d I say nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Luke gives me a suspicious look, then turns to Gary. \u201cWe must get on.\u201d</p><p>The two men head out of the kitchen, and I\u2019m left alone with Jess. I perch on a bar stool opposite her.</p> <p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say. \u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m easy,\u201d Jess says with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you! Totally!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really mind.\u201d Jess sips her tea.</p><p>The kitchen is still and quiet, apart from the tap dripping slowly into the sink.</p><p>Which is fine. This is just one of those companionable, quiet moments you can have with members of your family. In fact, it shows we\u2019re easy with each other. It\u2019s not remotely awkward or anything\u2014</p><p>Oh God, speak. Please.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do some weight training,\u201d says Jess suddenly. \u201cI normally work out every day. But I haven\u2019t had time this week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say in delight. \u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant idea! I\u2019ll do it too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jess looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I take a final sip of tea, then put my cup down. \u201cI\u2019ll just go and get ready!\u201d</p><p>What a marvelous idea. Doing exercise together will be totally bonding! We can go to Taylor\u2019s Health Club round the corner, where I\u2019m a gold member, do a bit of a workout, and then head to the juice bar. I know the juice bar will be open, because I\u2019ve been there loads of times before at about this hour of the day.</p><p>And I should think the gym bit will be open too, downstairs.</p><p>Or is it upstairs?</p><p>Anyway. Wherever it is.</p><p>I yank open my wardrobe doors and pull out my drawer full of gym kit. I could wear my Juicy tracksuit, except I might get too hot... or that really cool pink top, except I\u2019ve seen a girl in the juice bar wearing the same exact one...</p><p>At last I select some black leggings with retro piping up the sides, plus a white T-shirt and my fab hi-tech trainers that I got in the States. They cost quite a lot, but then, as the leaflet points out, they are biomechanically balanced with a dual-density midsole. Plus their advanced engineering means you can take them seamlessly from the marathon track to the outdoor terrain of the trail hike.</p><p>I quickly put on the whole outfit, tie my hair up in a ponytail, and add my cool Adidas sports watch. (Which just shows how wrong Luke is. I knew I would need a sports watch one day.) I hurry to the guest room and knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Jess\u2019s voice sounds muffled and kind of weird. Cautiously I push open the door. She\u2019s changed into old gray shorts and a cropped T-shirt and to my surprise is lying on the floor.</p><p>Doing sit-ups, I suddenly realize as her entire torso rises off the ground. Blimey. She\u2019s quite good at them. And I\u2019ve never seen such a muscled stomach, except in a Cindy Crawford video. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now she\u2019s doing those twisty ones that I\u2019ve never been able to manage more than about three of.</p><p>\u201cSo... shall we go?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d Jess says without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cTo the gym! I thought you wanted to...\u201d I trail off as she starts raising her legs off the ground too.</p> <p>OK, now that\u2019s just showing off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to go anywhere. I can work out here.\u201d</p><p>Here? Is she serious? But there aren\u2019t any mirrors. There isn\u2019t any MTV. There isn\u2019t a juice bar.</p><p>My gaze falls on a snakelike scar at the top of Jess\u2019s shin. I\u2019m about to ask how she did it, when she catches me looking and flushes red.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s sensitive. I\u2019d better not mention it.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need weights?\u201d I say instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got them.\u201d She reaches in her rucksack and pulls out two old water bottles filled with sand.</p><p>Those are her weights?</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go near a gym,\u201d she says, starting to raise the bottles above her head. \u201cWaste of money. Half the people who join gyms never go, anyway. They buy expensive outfits and never even wear them. What\u2019s the point in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI totally agree.\u201d</p><p>Jess stops and adjusts her grip on one of the weights. Then her eye falls on the back of my leggings.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I reach round with my hand.</p><p>Damn. It\u2019s the price tag hanging out.</p><p>\u201cEr... nothing!\u201d I say, hastily tucking it in. \u201cI\u2019ll just go and get some... weights of my own.\u201d</p><p>As I return from the kitchen with two bottles of Evian, I can\u2019t help feeling a bit disconcerted. This isn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind. I\u2019d pictured the two of us running effortlessly along on adjacent machines, with some upbeat song playing and the spotlights making our hair look all shiny.</p><p>Anyway, never mind.</p><p>\u201cSo... I\u2019ll follow you, shall I?\u201d I say, joining Jess on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on to some biceps work,\u201d says Jess. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward.\u201d She starts raising her arms up and down, and I copy what she\u2019s doing. God, she exercises quite fast, doesn\u2019t she?</p> <p>\u201cShall I put on some music?\u201d I say after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need music,\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cNo. Neither do I,\u201d I say quickly.</p><p>My arms are starting to ache. This can\u2019t be good for them, surely. I glance at Jess, but she\u2019s steadfastly pumping away. Casually I lean down, pretending to adjust my shoelace. Then suddenly I have a thought.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be a moment,\u201d I say, and hurry out to the kitchen again. A few moments later I\u2019m back, holding two slim silver bottles.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a health drink,\u201d I say, proudly holding one out to Jess. \u201cSo you can rebalance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can what?\u201d Jess puts down her weights with a frown.</p><p>\u201cIt says it on the bottle, look,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt has a unique blend of life-enhancing vitamins and herbs.\u201d</p><p>Jess is scanning the label.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just sugar and water. Look. Water... glucose syrup...\u201d She puts it down. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s got special properties!\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cIt rebalances, revitalizes, and moisturizes your skin from the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much is it?\u201d Jess picks the bottle up again and looks at the price tag. \u201cIt\u2019s \u00a32.95!\u201d She seems totally scandalized. \u201cThree pounds for some sugar and water? You could buy a twenty-kilo sack of potatoes for that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... I don\u2019t want a twenty-kilo sack of potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should!\u201d says Jess. \u201cPotatoes are one of the most nutritious, cost-effective foods available.\u201d She eyes me reprovingly. \u201cPeople underestimate them. But did you know a potato in its skin has more vitamin C than an orange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could live off potatoes and milk.\u201d She starts hefting her weights again. \u201cYou\u2019d get practically every nutrient the body needs, just from those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s... really good! Er... I\u2019ll just go and have a shower.\u201d</p><p>As I close the door of the bedroom, I feel totally bewildered. What was all that about potatoes? I\u2019m not even sure how we got onto the subject.</p><p>I head down the corridor and see Luke through the door of the study, getting something down from a shelf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look very sportif,\u201d he says, glancing up. \u201cGoing to the gym?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess and I have been working out together,\u201d I reply, flicking my ponytail.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. So you\u2019re getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting along brilliantly!\u201d I say, and carry on along the corridor.</p> <p>Which... I think is true. Although to be honest, it\u2019s a bit hard to tell with Jess. She doesn\u2019t exactly overwhelm you.</p><p>But anyway, so far so good. And now we\u2019ve done our workout, we can reward ourselves! What we need is a few drinks, and a bit of a party atmosphere and some music. Then we\u2019ll really loosen up.</p><p>As I shower, I start to feel excited. You cannot beat a good girls\u2019 night in. Suze and I had so many great evenings when we were living together. There was the time Suze had been dumped by her awful boyfriend and we spent the whole evening sending off forms in his name to receive impotence cures. There was the time we made mint juleps and both nearly got alcohol poisoning. There was the time we decided to become redheads \u2014 and then had to find a twenty-four-hour hairdresser. And then there were lots of evenings when nothing special happened... except we watched movies and ate pizza and talked and laughed, and had a good time.</p><p>I pause, halfway through toweling my hair. It\u2019s weird, not speaking to Suze anymore. She hasn\u2019t called once since I told her about having a sister. Nor have I called her. My chin stiffens. But that\u2019s what happens in life. People find new friends and new sisters. It\u2019s called natural selection.</p><p>And Jess and I will have a fab time tonight. Better than I ever had with Suze.</p> <p>I throw on some jeans and a T-shirt with SISTERHOOD emblazoned in silver, then turn on my dressing table lightbulbs and get out every single item of makeup I own. I rummage in a box under the bed and retrieve my three wigs, four hairpieces, false eyelashes, spray glitter, and temporary tattoos. Then I open up my special cupboard, where all my shoes are stored.</p><p>I love my shoe cupboard.</p><p>I mean, I love my shoe cupboard. It is the best thing in the entire world! All my shoes are arranged in gorgeous rows, and there\u2019s even a built-in light so you can see them properly. I look with satisfaction along the rows of L.K. Bennetts and Jimmy Choos for a few moments, then choose all the most fun, spangly high-heeled ones and toss them onto the bed.</p><p>Ready for the makeovers!</p><p>Next the sitting room. I spread all my favorite videos out in a fan on the floor, and add piles of magazines. Back in the kitchen I empty crisps, popcorn, and sweets into bowls, light some candles, and get out the champagne. As I look around the kitchen the granite is gleaming, and the stainless steel sparkles in the light. It looks so pretty!</p><p>It\u2019s nearly six o\u2019clock. Jess must have finished working out by now. I head to the guest room and tap on the door.</p> <p>\u201cJess?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>No answer. She must be in the shower or something.</p><p>But as I head to the kitchen, I suddenly hear her voice coming from the study. That\u2019s weird. I gently push open the door \u2014 and there\u2019s Jess, sitting at the computer with Luke and Gary on either side of her, peering at the screen, where I can see Luke\u2019s head, talking against a green background.</p><p>\u201cYou can superimpose the graphics like this,\u201d she\u2019s saying, tapping at the keyboard. \u201cAnd synchronize with the sound track. I can do it for you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I say in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our new corporate CD,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThe guys who did it had no bloody idea. The whole thing needs reediting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is a real whiz at this software!\u201d says Gary.</p><p>\u201cI just know it backwards,\u201d says Jess, clicking rapidly. \u201cThe whole university went over to it a year ago. And I\u2019m a bit of a techie. I like this kind of stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I say. I hover at the door for a few moments as Jess taps at the keyboard some more. \u201cSo... do you want to come and have a drink? I\u2019ve got everything ready for our girls\u2019 night in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Luke, looking at me in sudden realization. \u201cI\u2019m keeping you, Jess. We\u2019ll be OK from here. But thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d echoes Gary.</p><p>They\u2019re both looking at her with such admiration, I can\u2019t help but feel a tiny bit jealous.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cThere\u2019s champagne waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Jess,\u201d says Luke. \u201cYou\u2019re a star!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Jess gets up and follows me out of the room.</p><p>\u201cMen!\u201d I say as soon as I\u2019m out of earshot. \u201cAll they think about is computers!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like computers,\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cEr... me too,\u201d I backtrack hastily. \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>Which is kind of true.</p><p>I mean, I love eBay.</p> <p>As I lead Jess into the kitchen I feel a rush of excitement. I reach for the CD remote control, and a moment later, Sister Sledge belts through the kitchen speakers at top volume. I bought the album especially for this!</p><p>\u201c \u2018We are family!\u2019 \u201d I sing along, while taking the champagne bottle out of its ice bucket. I pop the cork. \u201cHave some champagne!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer something soft, if you\u2019ve got it,\u201d she says, looking at the bottle without enthusiasm. \u201cChampagne gives me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, halted. \u201cWell... OK!\u201d</p><p>I pour her out a glass of Aqua Libra and quickly put the bottle away before she can see the price and start talking about potatoes again.</p> <p>\u201cI thought tonight we could just relax,\u201d I say over the music. \u201cJust enjoy ourselves... talk... have fun...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d says Jess, nodding.</p><p>\u201cSo, my idea was, we could do makeovers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakeovers?\u201d Jess looks as though she\u2019s never even heard the word.</p><p>\u201cCome with me!\u201d I pull her along the corridor and into the bedroom. \u201cWe can do each other\u2019s makeup... try on all different clothes... I could blow-dry your hair if you like... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jess\u2019s shoulders are hunched uncomfortably.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun! Look, sit down in front of the mirror. Try on one of my wigs!\u201d I pull the blond Marilyn one onto my own head. \u201cIsn\u2019t that fab?\u201d</p><p>Jess flinches.</p><p>\u201cI hate mirrors,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I never wear makeup.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, a bit nonplussed. How can anyone hate mirrors?</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m happy with the way I look,\u201d she adds a bit defensively.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are!\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point! It\u2019s just supposed to be... you know. Fun.\u201d</p><p>Jess doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cBut anyway!\u201d I say, trying to hide my deflation. \u201cIt was just an idea. We don\u2019t have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>I take off the Marilyn wig and switch off the dressing table lightbulbs. The room is immediately plunged into semi-gloom, which is kind of how I feel. I was really looking forward to doing Jess up. I had all these great ideas for her eyes.</p><p>But never mind. We can still have a good time!</p><p>\u201cSo! Shall we... watch a movie?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Jess nods.</p><p>And anyway, a movie is better. Everyone likes movies, plus we can chat during all the boring bits. I lead the way into the sitting room and gesture enthusiastically at the fanned-out videos on the floor. \u201cTake your pick. They\u2019re all here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jess starts looking through the videos.</p><p>\u201cAre you a Four Weddings girl?\u201d I prompt her. \u201cOr Sleepless in Seattle... When Harry Met Sally...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d says Jess at last, looking up. \u201cYou choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have a favorite!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t really my kind of thing,\u201d says Jess, with a little grimace. \u201cI prefer something a bit more heavyweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cOh, right. Well... I can go and get a different video from the rental shop if you like! It won\u2019t take me five minutes. Tell me what you\u2019d like to watch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t want to put you out.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cLet\u2019s just watch one of these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t like any of them! We can do... something else! No problem!\u201d</p><p>I smile at Jess, but inside I\u2019m a bit disquieted. I don\u2019t quite know what else to suggest. My backup plan was the Dancing Queen karaoke tape \u2014 but something tells me she won\u2019t want to do that either. Plus we\u2019re not wearing the wigs.</p><p>Why is everything so awkward? I thought we\u2019d be laughing hysterically together by now. I thought we\u2019d be having fun.</p><p>Oh God. We can\u2019t just sit here in silence all night. I\u2019m going to come clean.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jess,\u201d I say, leaning forward. \u201cI want to do whatever you want to do. But you\u2019ll have to guide me. So... be honest. Suppose I hadn\u2019t invited you here for the weekend. What would you be doing right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Jess thinks for a moment. \u201cI was supposed to be at an environmental meeting this evening. I\u2019m an activist for a local group. We raise awareness, organize pickets and protest marches... that kind of thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s do that!\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cLet\u2019s organize a picket!

You\u2019re the guest \u2014 you choose!\u201d</p> <p>Jess is just staring at me in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t just organize pickets. You have to start with the issues. With the environmental concerns. They\u2019re not supposed to be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cLet\u2019s forget the picket. How about if you hadn\u2019t been at the meeting? What would you be doing now? And whatever it is... we\u2019ll do it. Together!\u201d</p><p>Jess frowns in thought, and I watch her face with hope. And a sudden curiosity. For the first time I feel like I\u2019m actually going to learn something about my sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d probably be doing my accounts,\u201d she says at last. \u201cIn fact, I brought them with me, in case I had time.\u201d</p> <p>Her accounts. On a Friday night. Her accounts.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I manage at last. \u201cFab! Well, then... let\u2019s do our accounts!\u201d</p><p>OK. This is fine. This is good.</p><p>We\u2019re both sitting in the kitchen, doing our accounts. At least, Jess is doing her accounts. I\u2019m not quite sure what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>I\u2019ve written Accounts at the top of a sheet of paper and underlined it twice.</p><p>Every so often Jess glances up, and I quickly scribble something down, just to look like I\u2019m into it. So far my page reads:</p> <p>20 pounds... budget... 200 million pounds... Hello, my name is Becky...</p><p>Jess is frowning over a pile of what look like bank statements, leafing backwards and forwards and consulting a small bankbook.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I say sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tracking down a bit of lost money,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s in one of my other cashbooks.\u201d She gets up. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d</p><p>As she leaves the kitchen I take a sip of champagne and glance toward the pile of bank statements.</p><p>Obviously I\u2019m not going to look at them or anything. They\u2019re Jess\u2019s private property and I respect that. It\u2019s none of my business. None at all. The only thing is, my leg is feeling itchy. It genuinely is. I lean over to scratch it... then casually lean a bit farther... and a bit more... until I can glimpse the bottom figure on the top statement.</p><p>\u00a330,002.</p><p>I hastily sit up again, nearly knocking over my champagne glass. Thirty thousand pounds? Thirty thousand pounds?</p> <p>That\u2019s a bigger overdraft than I\u2019ve ever had. Ever!</p><p>Now it\u2019s all starting to make sense. It\u2019s falling into place. No wonder she makes her own weights. No wonder she takes her coffee flask everywhere. She\u2019s probably on an economy drive, just like I went on once. She\u2019s probably read Controlling Your Cash by David E. Barton!</p><p>God, who would have thought it?</p><p>As Jess comes back into the room, I can\u2019t help looking at her with new eyes. She picks up one of her bank statements and sighs heavily \u2014 and I feel a sudden wave of affection for her. How many times have I picked up a bank statement and sighed? We\u2019re kindred spirits!</p><p>She\u2019s perusing the figures, still looking hassled. Well, no wonder, with a whopping great overdraft like that!</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, with an understanding smile. \u201cStill trying to track down that bit of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be here somewhere.\u201d She frowns and turns to another statement.</p><p>God, maybe the bank\u2019s about to foreclose on her or something. I should give her a few tips.</p><p>I lean forward confidingly.</p><p>\u201cBanks are a nightmare, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re useless,\u201d she replies, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes wonder why they give people overdrafts if they\u2019re going to be so unsympathetic...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an overdraft,\u201d she says, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop as her words hit my brain. She doesn\u2019t have an overdraft. Which means\u2014</p><p>I feel a bit faint.</p><p>That thirty thousand pounds is actual...</p><p>It\u2019s actual money?</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you OK?\u201d Jess gives me an odd look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... fine!\u201d I say in a strangled voice and take several gulps of my champagne, trying to regain my cool. \u201cSo... you\u2019re not overdrawn. That\u2019s good! That\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been overdrawn in my life,\u201d Jess says firmly. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. Anyone can stay within their means if they really want to. People who get into debt just lack self-control. There\u2019s no excuse.\u201d She begins to straighten her papers, then stops. \u201cBut you used to be a financial journalist, didn\u2019t you? Your mum showed me some of your articles. So you must know all this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hazel eyes meet mine expectantly and I feel a ridiculous tweak of anxiety.

It\u2019s all a question of... of planning ahead and careful management.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d says Jess with approval. \u201cWhen any money comes in, the first thing I do is put half aside to save.\u201d</p><p>Half? Even my dad doesn\u2019t save that much.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d I manage. \u201cIt\u2019s the only sensible option.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in total shock.

But I never thought anyone would actually save half.</p><p>Jess is looking at me with a fresh interest and maybe even affection.</p><p>\u201cSo... you do the same, do you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds I can\u2019t quite formulate a response.</p> <p>\u201cEr... well!\u201d I say at last, and clear my throat. \u201cMaybe not exactly half every month...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just the same.\u201d Her face relaxes into a smile. \u201cSometimes I only manage twenty percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty percent!\u201d I echo feebly. \u201cWell... never mind. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d says Jess, leaning forward across the table. \u201cYou must understand that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen her face look so open.</p><p>Oh my God. We\u2019re bonding.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty percent of what?\u201d comes Luke\u2019s voice as he and Gary enter the kitchen, both looking in good spirits.</p><p>Maybe now is the time to move the conversation on.</p><p>\u201cEr... nothing!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking about finances,\u201d says Jess to Luke. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been doing our accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour accounts?\u201d says Luke, giving a small shout of laughter. \u201cWhat accounts would those be, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cMy financial affairs and so forth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Luke nods, pulling a bottle of wine from the fridge. \u201cSo... have you called out the SWAT teams yet? And the Red Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d says Jess, puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re traditionally summoned to disaster areas, aren\u2019t they?\u201d He grins at me.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say quickly, trying to change the subject. \u201cDid anyone... er... see EastEnders last night?\u201d</p><p>No one seems to hear me.</p><p>\u201cBut Becky was a financial journalist!\u201d says Jess, sounding disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cFinancial journalist?\u201d Luke looks highly amused. \u201cYou want to hear a story about your sister\u2019s days as a financial journalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I put in. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cashpoint card,\u201d says Gary, reminiscing.</p><p>\u201cThe cashpoint card!\u201d Luke slaps the table in delight. \u201cThis was during Becky\u2019s illustrious career as a TV finance expert,\u201d he says to Jess. \u201cShe was filming an item on the perils of cashpoint use. She put in her own cashpoint card to demonstrate...\u201d He starts laughing again. \u201cAnd it got swallowed on camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey showed that the other night on a TV clips show,\u201d says Gary to me. \u201cThe bit where you start bashing the machine with your shoe is a classic!\u201d</p><p>OK, he is off my Christmas card list.</p><p>\u201cBut why did it get swallowed?\u201d says Jess, looking perplexed. \u201cWere you... overdrawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Becky overdrawn?\u201d Luke says cheerfully, getting out some glasses. \u201cIs the Pope Catholic?\u201d</p><p>Jess looks confused.</p><p>\u201cBut, Becky, you said you saved half your salary every month.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Luke slowly turns round. \u201cBecky said she did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... that\u2019s not exactly what I said,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cI said it\u2019s a good idea to save half your salary. In principle. And... it is! It\u2019s a very good idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about not running up huge credit card bills which you keep secret from your husband?\u201d says Luke. \u201cIs that a good idea in principle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCredit card bills?\u201d says Jess, looking at me in horror. \u201cSo... you\u2019re in debt?\u201d</p><p>God, why does she have to say it like that? Debt. Like it\u2019s some kind of plague. Like I\u2019m about to go to the workhouse. This is the twenty-first century.

I bought the picture of the cave... and I prepared all those yummy snacks... and I tried to plan the best evening I could. And she hasn\u2019t even tried to join in.

She\u2019s my sister, but I don\u2019t understand one single thing about her. Luke was right all along. It is all nurture. Nature doesn\u2019t come into it.</p><p>I start dejectedly leafing through the videos. Maybe I\u2019ll watch one of them on my own. And have some popcorn.

I\u2019m going to stuff my face and watch a nice movie.</p><p>I\u2019m just reaching for Pretty Woman when the phone rings.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say, picking up.</p><p>\u201cHello, Bex?\u201d comes a familiar high-pitched voice. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I feel a huge rush of joy. \u201cOh my God! Hi! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine! Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly with all my heart I wish Suze were here. Like the old days in Fulham. I miss her so much. So much.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was the spa with Lulu?\u201d I ask, trying to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cIt was... fine,\u201d she says after a pause. \u201cYou know. Kind of... a bit different... but fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cAnd... and I was wondering how it\u2019s all going with your new sister,\u201d Suze says hesitantly. \u201cAre you... are you really good friends?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t admit the truth to Suze. I just can\u2019t admit the whole thing\u2019s been a failure. That she goes on spa trips with her new friend, but I can\u2019t even manage one evening with my own sister.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d I say. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be better! We\u2019re getting on so well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Suze, sounding a bit crushed.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! In fact, we\u2019re having a girls\u2019 night in together right now! Watching movies... having a laugh... just hanging out. You know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d says Suze at once.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I look at the blank TV screen. \u201cPretty Woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Pretty Woman,\u201d Suze says longingly. \u201cThe scene in the shop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! That is just the best scene ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the end, when Richard Gere climbs up!\u201d Her voice is tumbling out with enthusiasm. \u201cOh God, I want to watch it right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I say without thinking. \u201cI mean... I want to watch the... er... rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Suze says in a different voice. \u201cI must be interrupting you. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go. You must want to get back to your sister. It sounds like you\u2019re having an amazing time.\u201d Her voice is wistful. \u201cYou two must have so much to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, looking round the empty room. \u201cYes, we... we certainly do!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...

Meanwhile, Jess, Luke, and Gary spent hours around the computer. Even when I took them in some pizza, they barely looked up. So I just watched the whole of Pretty Woman and then half of Four Weddings and a Funeral, before going to bed on my own.</p><p>As I blearily put on a dressing gown, Luke is already showered and dressed in the \u201ccasual weekend\u201d clothes he wears when he\u2019s actually going to spend the whole time in the office.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you finish last night?\u201d I ask, my throat all hoarse and croaky.</p><p>\u201cNot till late.\u201d Luke shakes his head. \u201cOnce we started discussing it, we couldn\u2019t stop. Jess had a lot of ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I try to sound enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I take it back about her,\u201d he adds, tying up his shoelaces. \u201cYour sister\u2019s got a lot going for her. She couldn\u2019t have been more helpful last night. She certainly knows her way around a computer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. She\u2019s great!\u201d He stands up and gives me a kiss. \u201cYou were right. I\u2019m very glad you invited her for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I say, forcing a bright smile. \u201cWe\u2019re all having so much fun!\u201d</p><p>I shuffle into the kitchen, where Jess is sitting at the counter in her jeans and a T-shirt, with a glass of water.</p><p>Cleverclogs. I expect she\u2019ll split the atom this morning. In between sit-ups.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMorning!\u201d I say in my most pleasant, good-hostess manner.</p><p>I was rereading The Gracious Hostess last night, and it says that even if your guest is annoying you, you must behave with charm and decorum.</p><p>Well, fine. I can be charming. I can be decorative.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well? Let me get you some breakfast!\u201d</p><p>I open the fridge and get out the freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, and cranberry juices. I reach into the bread bin and pull out some seeded granary bread, croissants, and muffins. Then I start rooting around in the cupboards for jams. Three kinds of luxury marmalade, strawberry jam with champagne, wild blossom honey... and Belgian chocolate spread. Finally I get down a range of luxury coffees and teas to choose from. There. No one\u2019s going to say I don\u2019t give my guests a good breakfast.</p><p>I\u2019m aware of Jess watching my every move, and as I turn round she\u2019s got a strange expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she says awkwardly. She folds her napkin into little squares. \u201cLuke told me last night. About your... problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour spending.\u201d</p><p>I try to hide my dismay. He did, did he?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem,\u201d I say, flashing her a smile. \u201cHe was exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019re on a budget.\u201d Jess looks concerned. \u201cIt sounds like money\u2019s a bit tight at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I say pleasantly. Not that it\u2019s any of your business, I think. I can\u2019t believe Luke\u2019s been blabbing everything to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo... how come you can afford luxury coffee and strawberry jam with champagne?\u201d She gestures at all the food laid out on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThrifty management,\u201d I say smoothly. \u201cPrioritizing. If you save on some items you can splash out on others. That\u2019s the first rule of financial management. As I learned at financial journalism school,\u201d I add.</p><p>OK, that\u2019s a slight lie. I didn\u2019t go to financial journalism school.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 which items are you saving on?\u201d says Jess, her brow creased. \u201cI can\u2019t see anything in this kitchen that doesn\u2019t come from Fortnum\u2019s or Harrods.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to make an indignant rejoinder when I realize she might be right. I got into a bit of a Harrods Food Hall habit after I started making all this money off eBay. But then, Harrods is a perfectly legitimate food shop.</p><p>\u201cMy husband appreciates a good standard of living,\u201d I say crisply, opening a fresh jar of marmalade.</p><p>\u201cBut you could do it on less.\u201d Jess leans forward, looking animated. \u201cYou could make savings everywhere! I could give you some tips.\u201d</p><p>Tips? Tips from Jess?</p><p>Suddenly the oven timer goes off with a ping. It\u2019s time!</p> <p>\u201cAre you cooking something?\u201d says Jess, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cEr... not exactly. Just help yourself... I\u2019ll be back in a minute... \u201d</p><p>I hurry into the study and switch on the computer. Bidding on the orange vintage coat ends in five minutes, and I am bloody well going to get it.

Well, take this, kittybee111.</p><p>I get out Luke\u2019s stopwatch from the desk and set it for three minutes.

Go.</p><p>As quickly as I can, I type in</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>Shit. What have I typed? Delete... retype... \u00a3200.50.</p><p>I jab SEND and the next screen comes up.

Did I... did I...</p><p>Congratulations! You won the item!</p><p>\u201cYeeess!\u201d I cry out, unable to stop myself, and punch the air. \u201cYes! I got it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot what?\u201d Jess has advanced across the room and is peering over my shoulder at the screen. \u201cIs that you? You\u2019re on a tight budget and you\u2019re buying a coat for two hundred pounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d I say, rattled at her disapproving expression. I get up, close the door of the study, and turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say, keeping my voice lowered. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve got all this money which Luke doesn\u2019t know about. I\u2019ve been selling off all the stuff we bought on our honeymoon \u2014 and I\u2019ve made loads! I sold ten Tiffany clocks the other day and made two thousand quid!\u201d I lift my chin proudly. \u201cSo I can easily afford this.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t waver.</p><p>\u201cYou could have put that money into a high-interest savings account,\u201d she says. \u201cOr used it to clear an outstanding bill.\u201d</p><p>I quell a sudden urge to snap.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I say, forcing a pleasant tone. \u201cI bought a coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Luke has no idea?\u201d Jess fixes me with an accusing gaze.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to have any idea! Jess, my husband is a very busy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lie to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery marriage needs an air of mystery,\u201d I respond coolly. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-known fact.\u201d</p><p>Jess shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd is this how you can afford all the Fortnum\u2019s jam, too?\u201d She gestures to the computer. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you just be honest?\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Doesn\u2019t she understand anything?</p><p>\u201cJess... let me explain,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cOur marriage is a complicated, living organism, which only the two of us can really understand. I naturally know what to tell Luke and what not to bother him with.

This just proves what a fantastic relationship we have and how Jess is totally wrong. About everything.</p><p>I throw open the apartment door and stand expectantly by the lift. This\u2019ll show her! I\u2019ll take my flowers straight into the kitchen and give Luke a huge passionate kiss, and she\u2019ll say something really humble like \u201cI had no idea what a perfect relationship you two had.\u201d And I\u2019ll smile kindly and say \u201cYou know, Jess\u2014\u201d</p><p>My thoughts are interrupted as the lift doors start opening. And oh... my God. Luke must have spent an absolute fortune!</p><p>Two uniformed deliverymen are carrying the most enormous bouquet of roses \u2014 plus a huge fruit basket full of oranges, papayas, and pineapples, all wrapped up in trendy raffia.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I say in delight. \u201cThose are absolutely fantastic!\u201d I beam at the man offering me a clipboard and scribble my signature.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll pass them on to Mr. Brandon,\u201d says the man as he gets back into the lift.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say gaily.</p><p>A moment later his words register.</p><p>Hang on a minute. These are for Luke? Who on earth is sending flowers to Luke?</p><p>I spot a card nestled among the flowers and pull it out with a pleasant thrill of curiosity.</p><p>Dear Mr Brandon</p><p>I was extremely sorry to hear of your illness.

And be assured, we can delay the hotel launch as long as is necessary to enable your full recovery.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Nathan Temple</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed with horror. Nathan Temple wasn\u2019t supposed to send flowers. He wasn\u2019t supposed to delay the hotel launch. He was supposed to go away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d comes Luke\u2019s voice. I start in panic and look up to see him heading out of the kitchen toward me.</p><p>In one seamless movement I crumple Nathan Temple\u2019s card and stuff it into the pocket of my dressing gown.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, my voice a little high-pitched. \u201cAren\u2019t these great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those for me?\u201d Luke says incredulously, spotting the delivery label. \u201cWho are they from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re... um... they\u2019re... from me!\u201d I say brightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom you?\u201d Luke stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYes!

But... why did you send me all this? Why did you send me a fruit basket?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I have to have a reason to send my husband a fruit basket?\u201d I say at last, managing to sound a little hurt. \u201cI just thought they could be a token of our marriage.

That\u2019s lovely.\u201d He peers more closely at the bouquet. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>I follow his gaze only to see a set of gold plastic lettering nestled inside the flowers, spelling out Get Well Soon.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cGet well soon?\u201d Luke looks up, taken aback.</p> <p>My mind races frantically.</p><p>\u201cThat... that... doesn\u2019t mean get well soon,\u201d I say with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s... in code!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Every marriage needs a secret code between husband and wife! You know, for little loving secret messages.

Why didn\u2019t I think of that?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve rumbled me!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cDrat! How did you guess? You just know me too well. Now... er... go and have some nice breakfast and I\u2019ll get ready for the supermarket.\u201d</p> <p>As I put on my makeup my mind is going round and round in circles.</p><p>What if Nathan Temple phones up to see how Luke is? What if he sends more flowers? What if he wants to come and visit Luke\u2019s sickbed?</p><p>OK, just... stay calm. Let\u2019s go through all the options.</p><p>Option 1. Tell Luke everything.</p><p>No. No way. Just the thought of it makes my stomach churn. He\u2019s so busy with this Arcodas pitch. It\u2019ll just get him all hassled and angry.</p><p>Option 2. Tell Luke something.</p><p>Like the edited highlights. Maybe tweaked in a way that leaves out the name Nathan Temple.</p><p>Oh God. Impossible.</p><p>Option 3. Manage situation in discreet Hillary-style manner.</p><p>But I tried that already and it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>Anyway, I bet Hillary had help. What I need is a team, like in The West Wing. Then I\u2019d just go up to Allison Janney and whisper, \u201cWe have a problem \u2014 but don\u2019t let the president know.\u201d And she\u2019d murmur, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll contain it.\u201d Then we\u2019d exchange warm but tense smiles and walk into the Oval Office, where Luke would be promising a group of underprivileged kids that their playground would be saved. And his eyes would meet mine... and we\u2019d flash back to the two of us waltzing in the White House corridors the night before, watched only by an impassive security guard\u2014</p><p>The grinding motor of a dustbin truck outside brings me back to reality. Luke isn\u2019t president. I\u2019m not in The West Wing. And I still don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Option 4. Do nothing.</p><p>This has a lot of obvious advantages. And the point is... do I actually need to do anything?</p><p>I reach for my lip liner and start applying it thoughtfully. I mean, all that has actually happened is that someone has sent Luke some flowers. That\u2019s all.</p><p>Plus he wants Luke to work for him. And reckons he\u2019s owed a favor.</p><p>And is a gangster.</p><p>No. Stop it. He\u2019s not a gangster. He\u2019s a... a businessman with a former criminal conviction. It\u2019s totally different.</p><p>And anyway \u2014 anyway \u2014 he was probably just being polite in that note, wasn\u2019t he? Like he\u2019s really going to hold up an entire hotel launch so Luke can do it. What a ludicrous idea.</p><p>The more I think along these lines, the more reassured I feel. Nathan Temple can\u2019t seriously be expecting Luke to work for him. He\u2019ll have found some other PR company already. The whole thing will be under way and he\u2019ll have forgotten all about Brandon Communications. Exactly. So I don\u2019t have to do anything at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even so, I might write a short letter of thanks. And kind of mention that Luke\u2019s unfortunately taken a turn for the worse.</p><p>So before we head off to the supermarket I scribble a polite card to Nathan Temple and drop it in the pillar-box outside. As I stride away I actually feel rather satisfied. I have this whole situation under control, and Luke doesn\u2019t know a thing. I am superwife!</p><p>My spirits rise even further as we walk into the supermarket. God, supermarkets are great places. They\u2019re all bright and airy and music is playing, and they\u2019re always giving away free samples of cheese or something. Plus you can buy loads of CDs and makeup, and it all goes on the credit card bill as Tesco.</p><p>The first thing that catches my eye as I walk in is a display of specialty teas, with a free flower-shaped tea infuser if you buy three.</p> <p>\u201cBargain!\u201d I say, grabbing three boxes at random.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a bargain,\u201d Jess intones disapprovingly beside me. Why did she have to come along?</p><p>Never mind. I\u2019ll just stay polite and courteous.</p><p>\u201cIt is a bargain,\u201d I explain. \u201cThey\u2019re giving away a free gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever drink jasmine tea?\u201d she retorts, looking at the box in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p><p>Jasmine tea. That\u2019s the one that tastes like old compost heaps, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>But so what? The tea infuser is really cute, and I don\u2019t have one.</p><p>\u201cYou can always find a use for jasmine tea,\u201d I say airily, and toss it into my trolley. \u201cRight! What next?\u201d</p><p>I head toward the vegetable section, pausing to pick up a copy of InStyle as I go.</p><p>Ooh. And the new Elle is out too. With a free T-shirt!</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d comes Jess\u2019s sepulchral voice in my ear. Is she going to quiz me all the way round the bloody shop?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shopping!\u201d I reply, and sling a new paperback book into the trolley.</p><p>\u201cYou could get that out of the library for nothing!\u201d says Jess, looking horrified.</p><p>The library? I look at her in equal horror. I don\u2019t want some thumbed copy in a horrible plastic jacket, which I have to remember to take back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a modern classic, actually,\u201d I say. \u201cEveryone should have their own copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she persists. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you get it out of the library?\u201d</p><p>My temperature is beginning to rise.</p><p>Because I just want my own nice shiny copy! And piss off and leave me alone!</p> <p>\u201cBecause... I might want to make notes in the margin,\u201d I say loftily. \u201cI have quite an interest in literary criticism, you know.\u201d</p><p>I push my trolley on, but she comes hurrying after me.</p><p>\u201cBecky, look. I want to help you. You have to gain control of your spending. You have to learn to be more frugal. Luke and I were talking about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I say, stung. \u201cHow nice for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you some tips... show you how to be thrifty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help!\u201d I retort in indignation. \u201cI\u2019m thrifty! I\u2019m as thrifty as they come.\u201d Jess looks incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s thrifty to buy expensive magazines you could read for nothing in a public library?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I can\u2019t quite think of a reply. Then my glance falls on Elle. Yes!</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t buy them, I wouldn\u2019t get the free gifts, would I?\u201d I retort in triumph, and wheel my trolley round the corner.</p><p>So there, Miss Smarty-pants.</p><p>I head to the fruit section and start loading bags into my trolley.</p><p>How thrifty is this? Nice healthy apples. I look up \u2014 and Jess is wincing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should buy those loose.\u201d She gestures to the other side of the aisle, where a woman is laboriously picking her way through a mound of apples and filling a bag. \u201cThe unit cost is far lower! You\u2019d save... twenty pence.\u201d</p><p>Twenty whole pence!</p><p>\u201cTime is money,\u201d I reply coolly. \u201cFrankly, Jess, it\u2019s not worth my while to be sorting through apples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re unemployed.\u201d</p><p>I gasp, affronted. Unemployed? I am not unemployed! I\u2019m a skilled personal shopper! I have a job lined up! In fact... I\u2019m not even going to dignify that with a response. I turn on my heel and stalk over to the salad counter. I fill two huge cartons with luxury marinated olives and take them back to the trolley \u2014 and stop in astonishment.</p><p>Who put that huge sack of potatoes in my trolley?</p><p>Did I say I wanted a big sack of potatoes? Did I say I wanted any potatoes? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if I\u2019m on the Atkins diet?</p><p>I look around furiously, but Jess is nowhere to be seen. And the bloody thing\u2019s too heavy to lift on my own. Where\u2019s she gotten to, anyway?</p><p>Suddenly I spot her coming out of a side door, holding a big cardboard box and talking to a store employee. What\u2019s she doing now?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been speaking with the produce manager,\u201d she says, approaching me. \u201cWe can have all these bruised bananas for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>I look in the box and it\u2019s full of the most revolting, manky bananas I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re perfectly good. If you cut away the black bits,\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to cut away the black bits!\u201d My voice is shriller than I intended, but I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cI want to have nice yellow bananas! And I don\u2019t want this stupid great sack of potatoes, either!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make three weeks\u2019 worth of meals from that one sack,\u201d says Jess, looking offended. \u201cThey\u2019re the most economical, nutritious food you can buy. One potato alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>Please! Not another potato lecture.</p> <p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to put them?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a cupboard big enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cupboard in the hall,\u201d says Jess. \u201cYou could use that. If you joined a warehouse club you could use it to store flour and oats, too.\u201d</p><p>Oats? What do I want oats for? And anyway, clearly she hasn\u2019t looked inside that cupboard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my handbag cupboard,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd it\u2019s totally full.\u201d Jess shrugs.</p><p>\u201cYou could get rid of some of your handbags.\u201d</p><p>Is she seriously suggesting I should get rid of some of my handbags... for potatoes?</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s carry on,\u201d I say at last, and push the trolley forward as calmly as I can.</p><p>Stay polite. Stay gracious. She\u2019ll be gone in twenty-four hours.</p><p>But as we progress round the store I am really starting to lose my cool. Jess\u2019s voice is constantly droning in my ear like a bumblebee, on and on until I want to turn round and swat her.</p><p>You could make your own pizzas for half the price... Have you considered buying a secondhand slow-cooker?... Store-brand washing powder is 40p cheaper... You can use vinegar instead of fabric softener...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to use vinegar!\u201d I almost snap. \u201cI want to use fabric softener, OK?\u201d I put a bottle of it into the trolley and stalk off toward the juice section, Jess following behind.</p><p>\u201cAny comments?\u201d I say as I load two cartons into the trolley. \u201cAnything wrong with lovely, healthy orange juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Jess, shrugging. \u201cExcept you could get the same health benefits from a glass of tap water and a cheap bottle of vitamin C tablets.\u201d</p><p>OK. Now I seriously want to slap her.</p> <p>Defiantly I dump another two cartons in my trolley, yank it round, and make for the bread section. There\u2019s a delicious smell of baking in the air, and as I get near I see a woman at a counter, demonstrating something to a small crowd of people. She\u2019s got a shiny chrome gadget plugged into the wall, and as she opens it up, it\u2019s full of heart-shaped waffles, all golden brown and yummy-looking.</p><p>\u201cThe waffle-maker is quick and easy to use!\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cWake up every morning to the smell of fresh waffles baking.\u201d</p><p>God, wouldn\u2019t that be great? I have a sudden vision of me and Luke in bed, eating heart-shaped waffles and maple syrup, with big frothy cappuccinos.</p><p>\u201cThe waffle-maker normally costs \u00a349.99,\u201d the woman is saying. \u201cBut today we are selling it at a special reduced price of... \u00a325. That\u2019s 50 percent off.\u201d</p><p>Fifty percent off? OK, I have to have one.</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d I say, and push my trolley forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d says Jess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m buying a waffle-maker, obviously.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cCan you get out of my way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Jess, planting herself firmly in front of the trolley. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you waste twenty-five pounds on a gadget you don\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m outraged. How does she know what I do or don\u2019t need?</p><p>\u201cI do need a waffle-maker!\u201d I retort. \u201cIt\u2019s on my list of things I need. In fact, Luke said only the other day, \u2018What this house really needs is a waffle-maker.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Which, OK, is a bit of a stretch. What he really said was \u201cIs there anything for breakfast except Coco Pops?\u201d</p><p>But he might have done. How would she know he didn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cPlus I\u2019m saving money, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d I push the trolley round her. \u201cIt\u2019s a bargain!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bargain if you don\u2019t need one!\u201d She grabs the trolley and tries to haul it back.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off my trolley!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cI need a waffle-maker!

I\u2019ll take one,\u201d I add to the woman, and take a box off the table.</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t,\u201d says Jess, grabbing it out of my arms.</p><p>What? What?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m only doing it for your own good, Becky! You\u2019re addicted to spending! You have to learn how to say no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can say no!\u201d I practically spit in fury. \u201cI can say no whenever I like! I\u2019m just not choosing to say it right now! I will take one,\u201d I say to the nervous-looking woman. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll take two. I can give one to Mum for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I snatch two more boxes and defiantly put them in my trolley.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to waste fifty pounds, are you?\u201d says Jess contemptuously. \u201cJust throw away money you don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not throwing it away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloody not!\u201d I retort. \u201cAnd I do have the money. I have plenty of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re living in a total fantasyland!\u201d Jess suddenly shouts. \u201cYou have money until you run out of stuff to sell. But what happens then? And what happens when Luke finds out what you\u2019ve been doing? You\u2019re just storing up trouble!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not storing up trouble!\u201d I lash back angrily.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m no\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you two sisters just stop fighting for once!\u201d interrupts an exasperated woman\u2019s voice, and we both jump.</p><p>I look around in bewilderment. Mum isn\u2019t here, is she?</p><p>Then suddenly I spot the woman who spoke. She isn\u2019t even looking at us. She\u2019s addressing a pair of toddlers in a trolley seat.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I push the hair back off my hot face, suddenly feeling a bit shamefaced. I glance over at Jess \u2014 and she\u2019s looking rather shamefaced too.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and pay,\u201d I say in dignified tones, and push the trolley on.</p><p>We drive home without exchanging a word, but underneath my calm exterior I\u2019m seething. Who does she think she is, lecturing me? Who does she think she is, telling me I have a problem?</p><p>We get home and unload the shopping with minimal communication. We barely even look each other in the eye.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d I say with exaggerated formality as I put the last packet away.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she replies with equal formality.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just busy myself in the kitchen, if you can amuse yourself for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She disappears into her room and the next moment comes out again holding a book called Petrography of British Igneous Rocks.</p><p>Boy, she really knows how to have fun.</p><p>As she sits down on a bar stool I flick on the kettle and get down a couple of mugs. A few moments later Luke wanders in, looking harassed.</p><p>\u201cHi, darling!\u201d I say, injecting even more warmth into my voice than usual. \u201cI got us a lovely waffle-maker! We can have waffles every morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d he says distractedly, and I shoot a glance of vindication at Jess.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. Thanks.\u201d He rubs his brow and peers behind the kitchen door.

Things can\u2019t just vanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I say sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019ll help you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Luke shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a work thing. It\u2019ll turn up. It can\u2019t have disappeared out of the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to help!\u201d I run an affectionate hand along his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you that, darling. Tell me what you\u2019re looking for, and we\u2019ll search as a team. Is it a file... or a book... some papers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you.\u201d He kisses me. \u201cActually, it\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s a box of clocks. From Tiffany. Ten of them.\u201d</p><p>My breath catches in my throat.</p><p>Across the room I\u2019m aware of Jess lifting her head out of her book.</p><p>\u201cDid you say...

I tiptoe to the door of the kitchen, then creep out to the hall, edging as close as I can to the study door, then press my ear against it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can live with her,\u201d Jess is saying, and I feel a jolt of indignant shock. How can she say that? She\u2019s only just met me!</p> <p>I can\u2019t move, I can\u2019t breathe, waiting for Luke\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d comes Luke\u2019s voice at last.</p><p>Something cold plunges into my heart.</p><p>Luke finds it difficult to live with me.</p><p>There\u2019s a noise as if someone\u2019s coming toward the door, and I leap back in fright. I hurry back to the kitchen and close the door, my eyes hot with tears.</p><p>We\u2019ve only been married eleven months. How can he find it difficult to live with me?</p><p>The kettle\u2019s come to a boil, but I don\u2019t want tea anymore. I open the fridge, get out a half-open bottle of wine, and slosh some into a glass. I drain the entire thing in three gulps, and am refilling the glass as Jess comes back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seems like Luke\u2019s sorted out the gift problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say tightly, and take another swig of wine.</p><p>So she and Luke sort everything out now, do they? She and Luke have little conversations which I\u2019m not invited to. As I watch her sit down and open her book again, a great tide of anger and hurt starts welling up inside me.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought you might take my side.\u201d I\u2019m trying to sound calm. \u201cWe are supposed to be sisters, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jess frowns.</p><p>\u201cYou could have defended me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefended you?\u201d Jess looks up. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to defend you when you\u2019re that irresponsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m irresponsible,\u201d I say, a little savagely. \u201cAnd you\u2019re perfect, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not perfect! But yes! You\u2019re irresponsible!\u201d Jess claps her book shut. \u201cFrankly, Becky, I think you need to get your act together. You seem to have no idea of personal duty... You\u2019re obsessed with spending money... you lie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a misery!\u201d My words come out in a roar. \u201cYou\u2019re a skinflint miserable cow who doesn\u2019t know how to have a good time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jess looks utterly dumbfounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI made every effort this weekend!\u201d I cry. \u201cI did everything I could to make you welcome, and you wouldn\u2019t join in with anything!

But you could have pretended!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather I was insincere?\u201d says Jess, folding her arms. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I lied? That just about sums you up, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not lying to pretend you like something!\u201d I shout in frustration. \u201cI just wanted us to have a good time together! I did research, and I planned your room and everything... and you\u2019re so cold! It\u2019s like you don\u2019t have any feelings!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I feel close to tears. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m yelling at my sister. I can\u2019t believe things have disintegrated this badly. I break off and take a few deep breaths, trying to regroup. Maybe I can retrieve things. Maybe we can still make it work.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, Jess... I did it all because I wanted us to be friends,\u201d I say. And it\u2019s true. I really did. \u201cI just wanted us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>I expect to see her face softening, but if anything she looks more contemptuous than before.</p><p>\u201cAnd you always have to get what you want,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>I feel my face flame.</p><p>\u201cWh-What do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean you\u2019re spoiled!\u201d Her harsh voice cuts like a knife. \u201cWhat you want, you get! Everything\u2019s handed to you on a plate. If you get into trouble your parents bail you out, and if they don\u2019t, Luke does! Your whole life makes me sick.\u201d She gestures with her book. \u201cIt\u2019s empty! You\u2019re shallow and materialistic... and I\u2019ve never met anyone so obsessed with their own appearance and shopping\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about obsessed!\u201d I shriek. \u201cTalk about obsessed! You\u2019re obsessed with saving money! I\u2019ve never met anyone so bloody miserly! You\u2019ve got thirty grand in the bank and you go around like you\u2019re penniless! Getting free bubble wrap and horrible bruised bananas! Who cares if washing powder costs forty pence less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d care if you\u2019d been buying your own washing powder since the age of fourteen,\u201d Jess snaps back. \u201cMaybe if you took a little more care of the forty pence here and there you wouldn\u2019t get into trouble. I heard about how you nearly ruined Luke in New York. I just don\u2019t understand you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t understand you!\u201d I yell, in tears. \u201cI was so excited when I heard I had a sister, I thought we\u2019d bond and be friends. I thought we could go shopping, and have fun... and eat peppermint creams on each other\u2019s beds... \u201d</p><p>\u201cPeppermint creams?\u201d Jess looks at me as though I\u2019m crazy. \u201cWhy would we want to eat peppermint creams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d I flail my arms in frustration. \u201cBecause it would be fun!

They\u2019re just... rocks! They\u2019re the most boring hobby in the world! Which just about suits you!\u201d</p><p>Jess gasps. \u201cRocks are... not boring!\u201d she lashes back, grabbing her book. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot more interesting than peppermint creams and mindless shopping and getting yourself into debt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a fun bypass operation or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a responsibility bypass operation?\u201d yells Jess. \u201cOr were you just born a spoiled brat?\u201d</p><p>We glare at each other, both trying to collect ourselves.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in my sticking around.

I have altered your will according to your instructions. Clause 5, section (f) now reads:</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing at all to Jess, since she\u2019s so mean. And anyway, she\u2019s got heaps of money.\u201d</p><p>With kind regards,</p><p>Jane Cardozo</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>I DON\u2019T CARE. Who needs a sister? Not me.</p><p>I never wanted one in the first place. I never asked for one. I\u2019m fine on my own.</p> <p>And anyway, I\u2019m not on my own. I\u2019ve got a strong and loving marriage. I don\u2019t need some crummy sister!</p><p>\u201cStupid sister,\u201d I say aloud, wrenching the lid off a pot of jam. It\u2019s nearly two weeks since Jess left. Luke\u2019s got a late meeting in town, and Mum and Dad are coming over on their way to the airport, so I\u2019m making breakfast for everyone.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d says Luke, coming into the kitchen. He looks pale and tense, as he has for the last few days. The Arcodas Group are making their decision about the pitch and now all he can do is wait. And Luke\u2019s not that good at waiting. Plus, he\u2019s stressing about this pitch more than usual, because it\u2019s the first mainstream account he\u2019s gone for. I heard him talking to Gary on the phone last night, saying if they didn\u2019t get it, what kind of message would it send out?</p><p>The trouble with Luke is, he always has to succeed straightaway. Maybe I should tell him the story about the plucky little spider trying to build its web over and over again.</p><p>On second thought, maybe not.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about Jess,\u201d I say. \u201cYou were absolutely right about her. We were never going to get on in a million years! I\u2019ve never met such a misery-guts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d says Luke absently, pouring himself some orange juice.</p><p>He could be a little more supportive.</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll take your advice,\u201d I say, trying to engage his attention. \u201cI should never even have invited her here. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re actually supposed to be related!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she was all right in the end,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBut I can see why you two wouldn\u2019t get on.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to say \u201cI thought she was all right.\u201d He was supposed to say \u201cWhat a total bitch, I can\u2019t believe you put up with her for even a minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky... what are you doing?\u201d Luke\u2019s gaze lands on the crumbs and plastic packaging littering the granite work-top.</p><p>\u201cMaking waffles!\u201d</p><p>And that just proves another thing. Jess was totally wrong. I\u2019ve used the waffle-maker practically every day. So there! I almost wish she were here to see it.</p><p>The only tiny thing is, I\u2019m not very good at making the mixture. So my method is: buy ready-made waffles, cut them into heart shapes, and put them in the waffle-maker to heat up.</p><p>But what\u2019s wrong with that? I\u2019m using it, aren\u2019t I? We\u2019re eating waffles, aren\u2019t we?</p><p>\u201cWaffles... again?\u201d says Luke, with the tiniest of grimaces. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, discomfited. \u201cWell, how about some toast? Or eggs? Or... muffins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine on coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to have something!\u201d I say, regarding him with sudden alarm. He\u2019s definitely gotten thinner, worrying about this pitch. I need to feed him up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you some pancakes!\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cOr an omelette!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, leave it!\u201d he snaps. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He strides out of the kitchen, snapping open his mobile phone. \u201cAny news?\u201d I hear him say before the study door closes.</p><p>I look down at the broken waffle in my hand, trying to keep my spirits up.</p><p>I know Luke\u2019s really tense about work. And that\u2019s probably why he\u2019s being a bit short-tempered with me at the moment. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s any bigger problem or anything.</p><p>But deep down inside, I keep remembering what I heard him say to Jess that night. That he finds it difficult to live with me. In fact, I\u2019ve been thinking about it for the last two weeks, trying to make sense of it.</p><p>How can I be difficult to live with?

And besides, I read an article in Marie Claire yesterday which said it\u2019s the little, niggling things which count in a relationship.</p> <p>I hurry to the sitting room and head straight for the jumbled pile of CDs by the music system.

This must be Mum and Dad. I\u2019ll have to get back to our marriage later.</p><p>I knew that Mum and Dad had really got into their counseling, but somehow I wasn\u2019t expecting them to turn up with slogans on their sweatshirts.

And so sociable! We did a group session the other day and who do you think should have turned up? Marjorie Davis, who used to live across the road!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cDid she get married, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Mum lowers her voice tactfully. \u201cShe has boundary issues, poor thing.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t quite get my head round all this. What on earth are boundary issues?</p><p>\u201cSo... er... do you have issues?\u201d I say as we go into the kitchen. \u201cHas it all been really hard going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ve been to the abyss and back,\u201d says Mum, nodding. \u201cHaven\u2019t we, Graham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight to the edge,\u201d says Dad agreeably.</p><p>\u201cBut the rage and guilt are behind us now. We\u2019re both empowered to live and love.\u201d She beams at me and roots around in her holdall. \u201cI brought a nice Swiss roll. Shall we put the kettle on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum\u2019s found her inner goddess,\u201d says Dad proudly. \u201cShe walked on hot coals, you know!\u201d</p><p>I gape at her.</p><p>\u201cYou walked on hot coals? Oh my God! I did that in Sri Lanka! Did it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all!

And a daughter, no less. But then... it was all before he met me. And the truth is, a man as handsome as your father was bound to have a few escapades.\u201d Mum looks at Dad with a coquettish smile. \u201cI could never resist him... so why should other women?\u201d</p><p>Is Mum fluttering her eyelashes?</p><p>\u201cI could never resist you,\u201d Dad replies with a flirty lift to his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019re gazing at each other adoringly over the plate of Swiss roll slices.

Which should be particularly interesting for us.\u201d</p><p>I feel an uncomfortable twinge. I don\u2019t want to think about long-lost family members.

Why should you have anything more in common with Jess than with... say...\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cKylie Minogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s got far more in common with Jess than with Kylie Minogue!\u201d exclaims Dad at once. \u201cKylie Minogue\u2019s Australian, for a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove anything,\u201d says Mum. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the Commonwealth, aren\u2019t we? Becky would probably get on very well with Kylie Minogue. Wouldn\u2019t you, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d have nothing to say to each other,\u201d says Dad, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they would!\u201d retorts Mum. \u201cThey\u2019d have a lovely conversation! I expect they\u2019d become great friends!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Cher,\u201d says Dad. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky doesn\u2019t want to be friends with Cher!\u201d Mum says indignantly. \u201cMadonna, maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, the day I meet Kylie Minogue, Cher, or Madonna, I\u2019ll let you know, OK?\u201d I say, a little more snappily than I meant to.</p><p>Mum and Dad turn to survey me. Then Mum glances at Dad.</p><p>\u201cGraham, go and give Luke his coffee.\u201d She hands a mug to Dad, and as soon as he\u2019s gone, she gives me a searching look.</p><p>\u201cBecky, love!\u201d she says. \u201cAre you all right? You seem a bit tense.\u201d</p> <p>Mum\u2019s sympathetic face makes my composure crumble. Suddenly all the worries I\u2019ve been trying so hard to bury start rising to the surface.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Jess,\u201d she says kindly. \u201clt doesn\u2019t matter in the least if you two girls don\u2019t get on. Nobody will mind!\u201d</p><p>I busy myself with the coffeepot, hoping to stem the tears I can feel right behind my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Jess,\u201d I say. \u201cAt least, it\u2019s not just Jess. It\u2019s... Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d says Mum in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t going too well at the moment. In fact...\u201d My voice starts to wobble. \u201cIn fact... I think our marriage is in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Now I\u2019ve said it aloud it sounds totally true. Our marriage is in trouble.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, love?\u201d Mum looks perplexed. \u201cYou both seem very happy to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not! We\u2019ve just had this horrible huge row!\u201d</p><p>Mum bursts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cIt was awful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was, love!\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re coming up to your first anniversary, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. That\u2019s the time for your First Big Row! You knew that, didn\u2019t you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say blankly.</p><p>\u201cYour First Big Row!\u201d She tuts at my expression. \u201cDear me! What do the women\u2019s magazines teach you girls nowadays!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... how to put on acrylic nails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell! They should be teaching you about happy marriages! All couples have a First Big Row at around a year. A big argument, then the air is cleared, and everything\u2019s back to normal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never knew that,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cSo... our marriage isn\u2019t in trouble after all?\u201d</p><p>This makes a lot of sense. A First Big Row \u2014 and then everything\u2019s calm and happy again. Like a thunderstorm. Clear air and renewal. Or one of those forest fires that seem awful but in fact are good because all the little plants can grow again. Exactly. But the real point is... Yes! This means none of it was my fault! We were going to have a row anyway, whatever I did! I\u2019m really starting to cheer up again. Everything\u2019s going to be lovely again. I beam at Mum and take a huge bite of Swiss roll.</p><p>\u201cSo... Luke and I won\u2019t have any more rows,\u201d I say, just to be on the safe side.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d says Mum reassuringly. \u201cNot until your Second Big Row, which won\u2019t be until\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s interrupted by the kitchen door banging open and Luke appearing in the doorway. He\u2019s holding the phone and his face is elated.</p><p>\u201cWe got it. We\u2019ve got the Arcodas Group!\u201d</p><p>I knew everything was going to be all right! I knew it. It\u2019s all lovely! In fact, it\u2019s been like Christmas all day long!</p><p>Luke canceled his meeting and went straight into the office to celebrate \u2014 and after seeing Mum and Dad off in a taxi I joined him there. God, I love the Brandon Communications office. It\u2019s all chic, with blond wood and spotlights everywhere, and it\u2019s such a happy place. Everyone just mills around, merrily swigging champagne all day! Or at least, they do when they\u2019ve just won an enormous pitch. All day long, there\u2019s been the sound of laughter and excited voices everywhere, and someone\u2019s programmed all the computers to sing \u201cCongratulations\u201d every ten minutes.</p><p>Luke and his senior people held a quick celebration/strategy meeting, which I sat in on. At first they were all saying things like \u201cThe work starts here\u201d and \u201cWe need to recruit\u201d and \u201cThere are huge challenges ahead.\u201d But then Luke suddenly exclaimed, \u201cFuck it. Let\u2019s party. We\u2019ll think about the challenges tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>So he got his assistant on the phone to some caterers, and at five o\u2019clock loads of guys in black aprons appeared in the offices with more champagne, and canap\u00e9s arranged on cool Perspex boxes. All the employees piled into the biggest conference room, and there was music on the sound system, and Luke made a little speech in which he said it was a great day for Brandon C, and well done, and everyone cheered.</p><p>And now a few of us are going out to dinner for another celebration! I\u2019m in Luke\u2019s office redoing my makeup, and he\u2019s changing into a fresh shirt.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d I say for the millionth time. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good day.\u201d Luke grins at me, doing up his cuffs. \u201cThis could pave the way for a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto.\u201d Luke\u2019s face suddenly softens. He comes over and wraps his arms round me. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been distracted lately. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say, looking down. \u201cAnd I\u2019m... I\u2019m sorry I sold the clocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Luke strokes my hair. \u201cI know things haven\u2019t been easy for you. What with coming home... your sister...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d I say at once. \u201cLet\u2019s not think about her. Let\u2019s think about us. The future.\u201d I pull his head down and kiss him. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be great.\u201d</p><p>For a while we\u2019re both quiet. But in a good way. It\u2019s just us, in each other\u2019s arms, relaxed and content and together, like we used to be on our honeymoon. I feel a great swell of relief. Mum was so right! That First Big Row totally cleared the air! We\u2019re closer than ever!</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Luke kisses my nose. \u201cWe should get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll go down and see if the car\u2019s here yet.\u201d</p><p>I head along the corridor, floating on a cloud of joy. Everything\u2019s perfect. Everything! As I pass the caterers\u2019 trays, I pick up a glass of champagne and take a few sips. Maybe we\u2019ll go dancing tonight. After dinner. When everyone else has gone home, Luke and I will go on to a club and celebrate properly, just the two of us.</p> <p>I trip happily down the stairs, still holding my glass, and open the door into reception. Then I stop, puzzled. A few yards away, a thin-faced guy in a chalk-striped suit is talking to Janet, the receptionist. He seems kind of familiar, somehow, but I can\u2019t quite place him...</p><p>Yes. I can.</p><p>It\u2019s that guy from Milan. The one who carried Nathan Temple\u2019s bags out of the shop. What\u2019s he doing here? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cautiously I take a few steps forward so I can hear their conversation.</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Brandon\u2019s not ill?\u201d he\u2019s saying.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>I retreat behind a door and slam it shut. What do I do now?</p> <p>I take a gulp of champagne to calm my nerves \u2014 and then another. A couple of guys from IT saunter past and give me an odd look, and I smile gaily back.</p><p>OK. I can\u2019t cower behind this door forever. I inch my head above the glass panel in the door until I can see into reception \u2014 and thank God. Chalk-stripe guy has gone. With a whoosh of relief I push the door open and stride nonchalantly into the reception area.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say casually to Janet, who\u2019s typing busily on her computer. \u201cWho was that just now? That man talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him! He works for a man called... Nathan Temple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And... what did he want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was weird!\u201d she says, pulling a face. \u201cHe kept asking if Luke was \u2018better.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell him?\u201d I say, trying to depress the tone of urgency in my voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I said he\u2019s fine, of course! Never better!\u201d She laughs gaily, then as she sees my face she suddenly stops typing. \u201cOh my God. He isn\u2019t fine, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a doctor, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d She leans forward, looking stricken. \u201cYou can tell me, Becky. Did Luke catch some tropical disease while you were away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it his heart, then? His kidneys?\u201d Her eyes are watering. \u201cYou know... I lost my dear aunt this year. It really hasn\u2019t been easy for me... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cBut honestly, don\u2019t worry! Luke\u2019s fine! Everything\u2019s fine, it\u2019s all fine... \u201d</p><p>I glance up \u2014 and the words wither on my lips.</p><p>Please, no.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>Nathan Temple himself is walking into the building.</p><p>He\u2019s bigger and more barrel-chested than I remember, and is wearing the same leather-trimmed coat he was wearing in Milan. He exudes power and money and a smell of cigars. And his sharp blue eyes are looking right at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d he says in his Cockney rasp. \u201cMrs. Brandon. We meet again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell-Hello!\u201d I say. \u201cGosh! What a... lovely surprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill enjoying the bag?\u201d He smiles briefly.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes! It\u2019s fab!\u201d</p><p>I have to get him out of here. I have to get him out of here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to talk about my hotel with your husband,\u201d he says pleasantly. \u201cWill that be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I swallow. \u201cOf course. Great! The only thing is, Luke\u2019s a bit tied up, unfortunately. But would you like a drink? We could go to a bar... have a really nice chat... You could tell me all about it... \u201d</p><p>Yes. Genius. I\u2019ll hustle him out... buy him a few drinks... Luke will never know...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind waiting,\u201d he says, easing his huge frame down into a leather chair. \u201cIf you\u2019ll let him know I\u2019m here.\u201d There\u2019s a glint in his eyes. \u201cI gather he\u2019s recovered from his illness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! He\u2019s... he\u2019s a lot better! Thanks for the flowers!\u201d</p><p>I glance at Janet, who\u2019s been following this exchange in confusion.</p><p>\u201cShall I ring up and tell Luke?\u201d she says, reaching for the phone.</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean... don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll pop up myself,\u201d I say, my voice shrill.</p><p>I start walking toward the lifts. OK. I can still deal with this. I get Luke out of the building the back way by telling him somebody\u2019s spilled water on the foyer floor and it\u2019s really slippery. Yes. And we get in the car... then I pretend I\u2019ve forgotten something, and I go back to Nathan Temple, and I say\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>I leap about ten feet and look up. Luke is coming down the stairs, two steps at a time. His face is glowing and he\u2019s putting on his coat.</p><p>\u201cSo, is the car here yet?\u201d He peers at my frozen expression in surprise. \u201cSweetheart... are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Or I could tell Luke everything.</p><p>When this is over, I promise myself, I will never tell him a lie again. I will be honest and straight and truthful. Plus I will learn to make waffles.</p><p>\u201cEr... Luke?\u201d I manage at last.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s... there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cI should have told you ages ago, but...

This is important.\u201d He pulls out his phone and taps in a number. \u201cGary,\u201d he says in low tones. \u201cWhat\u2019s Nathan Temple doing in our foyer? You were supposed to be dealing with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke\u2014\u201d I try again.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, wait a minute.\u201d He turns back to the phone. \u201cWell, he\u2019s here.

It\u2019s about Nathan Temple!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can it be to do with Nathan Temple? Becky, you don\u2019t even know Nathan Temple!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... well... actually... yes, I do.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Luke closes up his phone. \u201cYou \u2018kind of\u2019 know Nathan Temple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Mr. Brandon!\u201d A voice rings out and we both look up to see that Janet at the reception desk has spotted us. \u201cLuke, you\u2019ve got a visitor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust coming, Janet,\u201d Luke calls back with a professional smile. He turns to me, still smiling. \u201cBecky, what the fuck has been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... It\u2019s a bit of a long story,\u201d I say, my face hot.</p> <p>\u201cWere you planning to share this story with me at any stage?\u201d Luke\u2019s smile is fixed in place, but there\u2019s a definite edge to his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course! I was just... waiting for the right moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this might possibly be a good moment? Bearing in mind he\u2019s a few fucking yards away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes! Absolutely.\u201d I cough nervously. \u201cWell. It all began... er... in a shop, as it happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d interrupts Luke in an undertone. \u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>I follow Luke\u2019s gaze to see that Nathan Temple has got out of his chair and is advancing toward us.</p><p>\u201cSo, here he is.\u201d His hoarse voice greets us. \u201cThe elusive Luke Brandon. You\u2019ve been keeping your husband from me, young lady, haven\u2019t you?\u201d He wags a mock-accusing finger at me.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I laugh shrilly. \u201cEr... Luke, do you know Nathan Temple? We met in Milan, um... remember, darling?\u201d I give a bright, fake smile as if I\u2019m a dinner party hostess and this is all perfectly normal.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Temple,\u201d says Luke calmly. \u201cHow nice to meet you properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d Nathan Temple claps Luke on the back. \u201cSo, you\u2019re feeling better, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes flicker toward me, then immediately back to Nathan Temple.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling quite well,\u201d he replies. \u201cMay I ask what this... unexpected visit is regarding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Nathan Temple, reaching in his coat pocket for a monogrammed silver cigar case. \u201cSeems you won\u2019t take calls from my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very busy this week,\u201d Luke replies without flinching. \u201cI do apologize if my secretaries have failed to pass on your messages. Was there something in particular you wanted to discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hotel project,\u201d says Nathan, offering Luke a cigar. \u201cOur hotel project, I should say.\u201d</p><p>Luke starts to reply, but Nathan Temple lifts a hand to stop him. He carefully lights his cigar and puffs on it a few times. \u201cForgive me for turning up here out of the blue,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBut when I want something... I don\u2019t hang around. I go and get it. Much like your good wife here.\u201d His eyes twinkle. \u201cI\u2019m sure she told you the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she was probably saving up the best part,\u201d Luke says with a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cI like your wife,\u201d Nathan Temple says affably. He blows out a cloud of smoke and runs appraising eyes over me. \u201cYou want to come to work for me anytime, sweetheart, you just give me a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh!\u201d I say, a bit thrown. \u201cEr... thanks!\u201d</p><p>I glance apprehensively at Luke. A vein is throbbing in his forehead.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d he says in polite, measured tones. \u201cMight we have a little word?

And I was really grateful... \u201d I\u2019m twisting my hands into knots. \u201cSo then when we were back in England he phoned up and said he wanted you to be involved with his hotel... \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d says Luke, his voice dangerously quiet.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is\u201d\u2014I swallow\u2014\u201cI thought you\u2019d love to do a hotel launch.\u201d</p><p>The door suddenly bursts open and Gary comes into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he says, wide-eyed. \u201cWhat\u2019s Nathan Temple doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Becky.\u201d Luke gestures toward me. \u201cIt seems she\u2019s been having quite the correspondence with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI had no idea! He was just this lovely Cockney man who got me my bag...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBag?\u201d says Gary, his eyes swiveling from me to Luke. \u201cWhat bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky appears to have offered my services to Nathan Temple in return for a handbag,\u201d says Luke curtly.</p><p>\u201cA handbag?\u201d Gary looks stunned.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just any old handbag!\u201d I exclaim, rattled. \u201cIt was a limited edition Angel bag! There\u2019s only a few of them in the whole world! It was on the cover of Vogue! All the movie stars want one and everything!\u201d</p><p>Both men look at me as though I\u2019m speaking Martian.</p><p>\u201cAnd anyway,\u201d I say, my face burning, \u201cI thought doing a hotel launch would be fab! It\u2019s five-star and everything! You\u2019d get to meet celebrities!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrities?\u201d echoes Luke, suddenly losing it. \u201cBecky, I don\u2019t need to meet those kind of celebrities! I don\u2019t need to be launching some tacky criminal\u2019s hotel! I need to be here, with my team, focusing on my new client\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI thought it was a brilliant networking coup!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, boss,\u201d Gary says to Luke soothingly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t promised him anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has.\u201d Luke gestures toward me, and Gary now seems at a total loss.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t... promise exactly.\u201d My voice shakes a little. \u201cI just said... you\u2019d be delighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize how much harder this makes it for me?\u201d Luke is holding his head in his hands. \u201cBecky, why didn\u2019t you tell me? Why didn\u2019t you tell me about it in Milan?\u201d</p><p>The room is very still.</p><p>\u201cBecause the Angel bag cost two thousand euros,\u201d I say at last in a tiny voice. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ...\u201d Luke sounds at the end of his tether.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I didn\u2019t want to bother you! You were so busy with the Arcodas pitch... I thought I\u2019d deal with it myself. And I was dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Dealing with it,\u2019 \u201d echoes Luke incredulously. \u201cHow were you dealing with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Nathan Temple you were ill,\u201d I gulp.</p><p>Comprehension dawns on Luke\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThe bunch of flowers,\u201d he says in even tones. \u201cWas that from Nathan Temple?\u201d Oh God.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHe sent you flowers?\u201d says Gary in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cAnd a fruit basket,\u201d says Luke shortly.</p><p>Gary gives a sudden snort of laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d says Luke, his voice like whiplash. \u201cWe\u2019ve just won the biggest pitch of our lives. We should be out celebrating. Not having to deal with bloody Nathan Temple sitting in our foyer.\u201d He sinks into a chair.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make an enemy of him, Luke,\u201d says Gary, pulling a small face. \u201cNot if he\u2019s going to buy the Daily World.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke\u2019s face is tense and motionless. I don\u2019t dare say a word.</p><p>Then abruptly he stands up. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit here all day. I\u2019ll go and see him. If I have to do the job I have to do the job.\u201d He gives me a look. \u201cI just hope the handbag was worth it, Becky. I really hope it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sudden stab of pain.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I never meant... I never realized\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Becky,\u201d he interrupts in weary tones. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>He leaves the room, followed by Gary. And I just sit there. Suddenly there\u2019s a tear rolling down my cheek. Everything was so perfect. And now it\u2019s all ruined.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>THIS HAS BEEN the worst week of our entire marriage.</p><p>I\u2019ve barely seen Luke, he\u2019s been so tied up with work. He\u2019s had meetings every day with the Arcodas Group, plus there\u2019s been a huge crisis with one of his banking clients, and one of his main account managers was rushed to the hospital with meningitis. It\u2019s all been total mayhem.</p> <p>And today, instead of having a chance to relax and regroup, he\u2019s got to fly out to Cyprus to visit Nathan Temple\u2019s hotel and start planning the launch. A launch which he doesn\u2019t want to do, but has to \u2014 because if he pulls out with some excuse, Nathan Temple might get offended. According to all the business press, it\u2019s looking likely that Nathan Temple\u2019s going to buy the Daily World newspaper. So as Luke said, he can\u2019t afford to antagonize him.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d I say nervously as I watch him put shirts into a suitcase.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>This is how he\u2019s been all week. All quiet and scary and barely looking me in the eye. And when he does look me in the eye, he looks so fed up that I feel a bit sick.</p><p>I\u2019m trying really hard to keep positive and look on the bright side. I mean, it\u2019s probably totally normal for couples to have blips like this. Just like Mum said. This is the Second Big Row of our marriage, and the air will clear again and everything will be fine... Except I\u2019m not sure the Second Big Row should come two days after the First Big Row. And I\u2019m not sure it should last a whole week.</p><p>I tried e-mailing Mum on her cruise ship to ask her advice, but I got a message back saying that the Mind Body Spirit cruise was a retreat from the outside world, and no passengers could be contacted until next Friday, when they dock in Athens.</p> <p>Luke zips up his suit carrier and disappears into the bathroom without even looking at me. He\u2019ll be gone in a few minutes. We can\u2019t leave each other like this. We just can\u2019t.</p><p>He comes out again and dumps his shaving kit in his suitcase.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our first anniversary soon, you know.\u201d I\u2019d been hoping Luke and I could do something romantic, like a candlelight picnic. \u201cWe should... plan something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll be back in time,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>He sounds like he doesn\u2019t care, either. Our first anniversary and he\u2019s not even interested. Suddenly my head is hot and I can feel tears pushing at my eyes. The whole week has been awful and now Luke\u2019s leaving and he won\u2019t even smile at me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so unfriendly, Luke,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cI know I\u2019ve made a mess, but I didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m sorry about a zillion times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Luke in the same old weary tones.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to do, Becky?\u201d he retorts in sudden exasperation. \u201cSay it doesn\u2019t matter? Say I don\u2019t mind that just when I should be putting all my efforts into the Arcodas Group, I find myself flying off to some godforsaken island?\u201d He clicks his case shut. \u201cYou want me to say I\u2019m happy to be associated with some tacky hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be tacky!\u201d I exclaim in dismay. \u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t! Nathan Temple said it was going to be of the highest quality! You should have seen him in that shop in Milan, Luke. He would only accept the best! The best leather... the best cashmere...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have the best water beds,\u201d Luke says with a sarcastic edge to his voice. \u201cBecky, don\u2019t you understand? I have a few principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d I say in shock. \u201cI have principles! But that doesn\u2019t make me a snob!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a snob,\u201d retorts Luke tightly. \u201cI simply have standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a snob!\u201d My voice rushes out before I can stop it. \u201cJust because he used to run motels! I\u2019ve been looking up Nathan Temple on the Internet. He does loads for charity, he helps people... \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe also dislocated a man\u2019s jaw,\u201d Luke cuts in. \u201cDid you read about that?\u201d</p><p>For a few moments I\u2019m halted.</p><p>\u201cThat was... years ago,\u201d I say at last. \u201cHe\u2019s made amends... he\u2019s reformed... \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Becky.\u201d Luke sighs and picks up his briefcase. \u201cCan we just leave it?\u201d</p> <p>He heads out of the room and I hurry after him.</p><p>\u201cNo. We can\u2019t leave it.

I follow him into the kitchen, where he\u2019s running water into a glass. \u201cThere must be something I could do. I could do research\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Luke interrupts, and swigs down his ibuprofen. \u201cNo more help. All your \u2018help\u2019 does is waste my bloody time. OK?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, my face burning. He must have looked at my ideas in the pink folder. He must have thought they were total rubbish.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWell... I won\u2019t bother anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d He walks off into the study, and I can hear him opening desk drawers.</p><p>I want to say something else. Something witty and incisive which will prove him wrong. But I can\u2019t think of it.</p> <p>As I\u2019m standing there, the blood thumping round my head, I hear the sound of the letter box. I go into the hall, where a package is lying on the doormat. It\u2019s a slim Jiffy bag for Luke, with a smudged postmark. I pick it up and stare at the handwriting, written in black marker pen. It looks kind of familiar \u2014 except it\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a parcel,\u201d I say.</p><p>Luke comes out of the study, holding a pile of files, and dumps them in his briefcase. He takes the package from me, rips it open, and pulls out a compact disc, together with a letter.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he exclaims, sounding more pleased than he has all week. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>I feel like he\u2019s hit me in the solar plexus.</p><p>My sister? Jess? My eyes drop down to the package in disbelief. That\u2019s Jess\u2019s handwriting?</p> <p>\u201cWhy...\u201d I\u2019m trying to keep my voice calm. \u201cWhy is Jess writing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s edited that CD for us.\u201d He scans to the bottom of the page. \u201cShe really is a total star. She\u2019s better than our own IT guys. And you know, she wouldn\u2019t take any payment. I must send her some flowers.\u201d</p><p>His voice is all warm and appreciative, and his eyes are glowing. Suddenly there\u2019s a huge lump in my throat.</p><p>He thinks Jess is fab, doesn\u2019t he? Jess is fab... and I\u2019m crap.</p><p>\u201cSo Jess has been a help to you, has she?\u201d I say, my voice trembling.</p><p>\u201cYes. To be honest, she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d rather she was here than me. I suppose you\u2019d rather we swapped places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Luke folds up the letter and pops it back in the Jiffy bag.</p><p>\u201cIf you think Jess is so great, why don\u2019t you just go and live with her?\u201d I can\u2019t seem to control the words \u2014 they escape in an avalanche. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go and... and talk about computers together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, calm down,\u201d says Luke, clearly amazed.</p><p>But I can\u2019t calm down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK! You can be honest! If you prefer a miserable skinflint with zero dress sense and zero sense of humor to me... just say so! Maybe you should marry her if she\u2019s so great! I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have a wonderful time together... \u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Luke cuts me off with a look which chills me to the marrow. \u201cJust stop right there.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t dare move a muscle. I feel like we\u2019ve plunged to some new, scary place in our relationship.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t get along with Jess,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBut you should know this. Your sister is a good person. She\u2019s honest, reliable, and hardworking. She spent hours on this for us.\u201d He taps the disc. \u201cShe volunteered to do it herself, and she didn\u2019t ask for any pay or any thanks. I would say she\u2019s a truly selfless person.\u201d He takes a few steps toward me, his expression unrelenting. \u201cYou could learn a lot from your sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open my mouth to speak, but nothing will come out. I feel quite hollow with fear. Right now there\u2019s nothing in Luke\u2019s face to say he\u2019s my husband and he loves me.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Luke looks at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll get my stuff.\u201d</p><p>He strides out of the kitchen. But I can\u2019t move from the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off.\u201d Luke reappears at the kitchen door holding his case. \u201cI\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d At last I\u2019ve found my voice, even if it is all shaky. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been such a disappointment to you.\u201d I raise my head, trying to keep a grip on myself. \u201cBut if you really want to know... you\u2019ve been a disappointment to me too. You\u2019ve changed. You were fun on our honeymoon. You were fun and you were laid-back and you were kind... \u201d</p><p>Suddenly I have a memory of Luke as he was. Sitting on his yoga mat with his bleached plaits and his earring. Smiling at me in the Sri Lankan sunshine. Reaching over to take my hand.</p><p>I feel an unbearable yearning for that easy, happy man, who bears no resemblance to the stressed corporate animal standing in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d The words come out in a sob and I can feel a tear trickling down my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone back to the way you used to be before. The way you promised you\u2019d never be again.\u201d I wipe away the tear roughly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I thought married life would be like, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor me,\u201d says Luke. There\u2019s a familiar wryness to his voice, but he isn\u2019t smiling. \u201cI have to go. Bye, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>A few moments later I hear the front door slam.</p><p>I sink down onto the floor and bury my face in my knees. And he didn\u2019t even kiss me goodbye.</p><p>For a while I don\u2019t move. I just sit there in the hall, hugging my knees. Our marriage is in tatters. And it hasn\u2019t even been a year.</p><p>At last I rouse myself and get stiffly to my feet. I feel numb and spaced-out. Slowly I walk into the silent, empty dining room, where our carved wooden table from Sri Lanka is standing proudly in the middle of the room.</p><p>The sight of it makes me want to cry all over again. I had such dreams for that table. I had such dreams of what our married life was going to be like. All the visions are piling back into my head: the glow of candlelight, me ladling out hearty stew, Luke smiling at me lovingly, all our friends gathered round the table...</p><p>Suddenly I feel an overwhelming, almost physical longing. I have to talk to Suze. I have to hear her sympathetic voice. She\u2019ll know what to do. She always does.</p> <p>I hurry, almost running, to the phone and jab in the number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d It\u2019s answered by a high-pitched woman\u2019s voice \u2014 but it\u2019s not Suze.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cIt\u2019s Becky here. Is that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lulu speaking! Hi, Becky! How are you?\u201d</p><p>Her abrasive voice is like sandpaper on my nerves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say. \u201cIs Suze there, by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just putting the twins into their car seats, actually! We\u2019re off for a picnic, to Marsham House. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I rub my face. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you should definitely visit it! Cosmo! Sweetie! Not on your Petit Bateau overalls! It\u2019s a super National Trust house. And wonderful for the children, too. There\u2019s a butterfly farm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I manage. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her to call back in two secs, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say in relief. \u201cThat would be great. Just tell her... I really need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>I wander over to the window, press my face against the glass, and stare down at the passing traffic below. The traffic light at the corner turns red and all the cars come to a halt. It turns green again and they all zoom off in a tearing hurry. Then they turn red again \u2014 and a new set of cars come to a stop.</p><p>Suze hasn\u2019t called. It\u2019s been more than two secs.</p><p>She isn\u2019t going to call. She lives in a different world now. A world of Petit Bateau overalls and picnics and butterfly farms. There\u2019s no room for me and my stupid problems.</p><p>My head feels thick and heavy with disappointment. I know Suze and I haven\u2019t been getting on that well recently. But I thought... I honestly thought...</p><p>Maybe I could call Danny. Except... I\u2019ve left about six messages for him and he\u2019s never returned any of them.</p><p>Never mind. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll just have to pull myself together on my own.</p><p>What I will do is... I will make myself a cup of tea. Yes. And take it from there. With as much determination as I can muster I walk to the kitchen. I flick on the kettle, drop a tea bag in a mug, and open the fridge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No milk.</p><p>For an instant I feel like falling to the floor again and crying till nightfall.

It\u2019ll be good to get some fresh air and take my mind off things.</p><p>I pick up my Angel bag, slick on some lip gloss, and head out of the apartment. I walk briskly out the gates and down the street, past the weird shop with all the gold furniture, and into the delicatessen on the corner.</p><p>The moment I get inside I start to feel a bit more steady. It\u2019s so warm and soothing in here, with the most delicious smell of coffee and cheese and whichever soup they\u2019re cooking that day. All the assistants wear long striped ticking aprons, and look like they\u2019re genuine French cheese-makers.</p> <p>I pick up a wicker basket, head to the milk counter, and load in a couple of pints of organic semi-skimmed. Then my eye falls on a pot of luxury Greek yogurt. Maybe I\u2019ll buy myself a few little treats to cheer myself up. I put the yogurt into my basket, along with some individual chocolate mousses. Then I reach for a gorgeous handblown glass jar of gourmet brandied cherries.</p><p>That\u2019s a waste of money, a voice intones in my head. You don\u2019t even like brandied cherries.</p><p>It sounds a bit like Jess\u2019s. Weird. And anyway, I do like brandied cherries. Kind of.</p><p>I shake my head irritably and thrust the jar into my basket, then move along to the next display and reach for a mini olive-and-anchovy focaccia pizza.</p><p>Overpriced rubbish, comes the voice in my head. You could make it yourself at home for 20p.</p> <p>Shut up, I retort mentally. No, I couldn\u2019t. Go away.</p><p>I dump the pizza in my basket, then move along the displays more swiftly, putting in punnets of white peaches, miniature pears, several cheeses, dark chocolate truffles, a French strawberry g\u00e2teau...</p><p>But Jess\u2019s voice is constantly in my head.</p><p>You\u2019re throwing money away. What happened to the budget? You think indulging yourself like this will bring Luke back?</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I say aloud, feeling rattled. God, I\u2019m going crazy. Defiantly I shove three tins of Russian caviar into my overflowing basket and stagger to the checkout. I drop the basket down on the counter and reach inside my bag for my credit card.</p><p>As the girl behind the till starts unloading all my stuff, she smiles at me.</p> <p>\u201cThe g\u00e2teau\u2019s delicious,\u201d she says, carefully packing it into a box. \u201cAnd so are the white peaches. And caviar!\u201d She looks impressed. \u201cAre you having a dinner party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cI\u2019m not having a dinner party. I\u2019m just... I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden I feel like a fool. I look at my piles of stupid, overpriced food bleeping through the register and feel my face flame. What am I doing? What am I buying all this stuff for? I don\u2019t need it. Jess is right.</p><p>Jess is right.</p><p>The very thought makes me wince. I don\u2019t want to think about Jess.</p><p>But I can\u2019t help it. I can\u2019t escape the thoughts wheeling round in my head like big black crows. Out of nowhere I hear Luke\u2019s voice. She\u2019s a good person... she\u2019s honest, reliable, and hardworking... you could learn a lot from your sister...</p><p>You could learn a lot from your sister.</p><p>And suddenly it hits me like a bolt of lightning. Oh my God. This is the answer.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be a hundred and thirty pounds, seventy-three pence,\u201d says the girl behind the checkout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I have to go,\u201d I say. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your food!\u201d says the girl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any of it.\u201d</p><p>I turn and stumble out of the shop, still clutching my credit card in my hand. It\u2019s all fallen into place. I must go and learn from Jess.</p><p>Like Yoda.</p><p>I\u2019ll be her apprentice and she\u2019ll teach me all her frugal ways. She\u2019ll show me how to become a good person, the kind of person that Luke wants. And I\u2019ll learn how to save my marriage.</p><p>She tried to help me before and I didn\u2019t listen. But this time I\u2019ll be grateful. I\u2019ll pay attention to every word she says.</p><p>I start walking along the street more and more quickly, until I\u2019m breaking into a run. I have to go to Cumbria. Right this minute.</p><p>I sprint all the way home, and up about three flights of stairs before I realize my lungs are nearly exploding and I\u2019m never going to make it all the way up to the penthouse. Puffing like a steam engine, I sit down for a few minutes, then take the lift up the rest of the way. I burst into the apartment and run to the bedroom, where I pull a bright red leather suitcase out from under the bed and start throwing things randomly into it, like they do on the telly. A T-shirt... some underwear... a pair of turquoise pumps with diamant\u00e9 buckles... I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter what I take, does it? I just have to get up there and build bridges with Jess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last I snap the case shut and haul it off the bed. I grab a jacket, wheel the case down the hall and out onto the landing, then turn and double-lock the front door. I take one last look at it, then step into the lift, feeling strong with a new resolve. Everything\u2019s going to change from this moment on. My new life starts here. Off I go, to learn what\u2019s really important in\u2014</p><p>Oh. I forgot my hair straighteners.</p><p>Instinctively I jab at the halt button. The lift, which was about to descend, gives a kind of grumpy little bump but stays put.</p><p>I can\u2019t possibly go without my hair straighteners. And my Kiehl\u2019s lip balm.</p> <p>OK, I might have to rethink the whole it-doesn\u2019t-matter-what-you-take strategy.</p><p>I hurry back out of the lift, unlock the front door, and head back into the bedroom. I haul another case out from under the bed, this one bright lime green, and start tossing things into that too.</p><p>Finally I pick up my Angel bag. And as I glimpse my reflection in the mirror, with no warning, Luke\u2019s voice resounds through my head: I just hope the handbag was worth it, Becky.</p><p>I stop still. For a few moments I feel a bit sick.</p><p>I almost feel like leaving it behind.</p> <p>Which would be just ridiculous. How can I leave behind my most prized possession?</p><p>I heft it over my shoulder, trying to recapture the desire and excitement I felt when I first saw it. It\u2019s an Angel bag, I remind myself defiantly. I have the most coveted item in existence. People are fighting over these. There are waiting lists all over the world.</p><p>I shift uncomfortably. Somehow it feels heavier on my shoulder than before. Which is very weird. A bag can\u2019t just get heavier, can it?</p><p>Oh, right. I put my mobile phone charger in there. That\u2019s why.</p><p>OK. Enough of this. I\u2019m going, and I\u2019m taking the bag with me.</p><p>I descend to the ground floor and wheel the cases out of the gates. A lit-up taxi comes barreling along, and I stick out my hand. I load in my cases, feeling suddenly rather stirred up by what I\u2019m planning to do.</p> <p>\u201cEuston Station, please,\u201d I say to the driver, my voice catching in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to reconcile with my long-lost-found-then-estranged sister.\u201d</p><p>The driver eyes me, unmoved.</p><p>\u201cIs that the back entrance you want, love?\u201d</p><p>Honestly. You\u2019d think taxi drivers would have some sense of drama. You\u2019d think they\u2019d learn it at taxi school.</p><p>The roads are clear, and we arrive at Euston in about ten minutes. As I totter toward the ticket booth, dragging my cases behind me, I feel as though I\u2019m in some old black-and-white movie. There should be clouds of steam everywhere, and the shriek and whistle of trains, and I should be wearing a well-cut tweed suit and fur stole, with marcelled hair.</p><p>\u201cA ticket to Cumbria, please,\u201d I say with a throb of emotion, and drop a fifty-pound note on the counter.</p><p>This is where a lantern-jawed man should notice me and offer me a cocktail, or get grit out of my eye. Instead, a woman in an orange nylon uniform is regarding me as though I\u2019m a moron.</p><p>\u201cCumbria?\u201d she says. \u201cWhere in Cumbria?\u201d</p> <p>Oh. That\u2019s a point. Does Jess\u2019s village even have a station?</p><p>Suddenly I have a blinding flash of memory. When I first met Jess, she talked about coming down from\u2014</p><p>\u201cNorth Coggenthwaite. A return, please. But I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m coming back.\u201d I smile bravely. \u201cI\u2019m going to reconcile with my long-lost-found\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman cuts me off unsympathetically.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be a hundred and seventy-seven pounds.\u201d</p><p>What? How much? I could fly to Paris for that.</p><p>\u201cEr... here you are,\u201d I say, handing over some of my Tiffany clock cash.</p><p>\u201cPlatform nine. Train leaves in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I turn and start walking briskly over the concourse to platform nine. But as the huge intercity train comes into view, my confidence wanes a little. People are streaming round me, hugging friends, hefting luggage, and banging carriage doors.</p><p>I\u2019ve come to a standstill. My hands feel sweaty round the suitcase handles. This has all felt like a kind of game up until now. But it\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s real and I can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m really going to go through with it.</p><p>Am I really going to travel hundreds of miles to a strange place \u2014 to see a sister who hates me?</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>OH MY GOD. I\u2019m here.</p><p>It\u2019s five hours later and I\u2019m actually here, in Cumbria, in Jess\u2019s village. I\u2019m in the North!</p><p>I\u2019m walking along the main road of Scully \u2014 and it\u2019s so scenic! It\u2019s just like Gary described, with the drystone walls and everything. On either side of me are old stone houses with slate roofs. Beyond the houses are steep, craggy hills with rocks jutting out and sheep grazing on the grass, and looming high above all the others is one huge hill which is practically a mountain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I pass a gorgeous little stone cottage I notice a curtain twitching and someone peering out at me. I suppose I do look a teeny bit conspicuous with my red and lime green suitcases. My wheels are trundling noisily on the road, plus my hatbox is banging up and down with every step I take. As I walk past a bench, two old ladies in print dresses and cardigans eye me suspiciously and I can see one pointing to my pink suede shoes. I give them a friendly smile and am about to say \u201cI got them at Barneys!\u201d when they get up and shuffle off together, still glancing back at me. I take a few more strides along the street, then stop, panting slightly.</p><p>It\u2019s quite hilly, isn\u2019t it? Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with hills. This isn\u2019t a problem for me at all. But even so, I might just take a few moments to admire the countryside and get my breath back. The taxi driver offered to take me to the door, but I told him I\u2019d rather walk the last bit, just to steady my nerves. I\u2019m starting to feel a bit jittery about seeing Jess again, which is ridiculous because I had hours on the train to prepare.</p><p>I even ended up getting some expert help! I\u2019d popped into the train bar and ordered a Bloody Mary \u2014 just for a bit of Dutch courage \u2014 and there was a whole group of Shakespearean actors, swigging wine and smoking, on tour with Henry V. We got to chatting and I ended up telling them the whole story and how I was off to try and reconcile with Jess. And they all got quite stirred up. They said it was just like King Lear, and ordered Bloody Marys all round, and insisted on coaching me in my speech.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll do every single thing they suggested. Like calling myself a \u201cwretched wench.\u201d But a lot of their tips were really helpful! For example, never upstage your fellow actor, which means never stand so they have to turn away from the audience. They all agreed this was the worst possible thing I could do to my sister, and if I did, there would be zero chance of a reconciliation and frankly they wouldn\u2019t blame her. I pointed out there wouldn\u2019t be an audience, but they said nonsense, a crowd would gather.</p> <p>The wind is blowing my hair all over the place, and I can feel my lips getting chapped by the strong northern air, so I get out my lip salve and put some on. Then, with a twinge, I reach for my mobile phone for the millionth time to see if Luke has called and I\u2019ve somehow missed it. But there\u2019s no signal at all. We must be out of the area. I stare for a minute at the blank little display, my heart beating with stupid hope. If there\u2019s no signal, maybe he\u2019s tried to call! Maybe he\u2019s phoning right this minute and he just can\u2019t get through...</p><p>But deep down inside I know it\u2019s not true. Six hours have gone by since he left. If he wanted to call, he would have called before now.</p><p>Our row has been echoing angrily round my brain all day. Luke\u2019s harsh voice. The way he looked at me just before he left, so disappointed and weary. All the things he said. To my horror, tears suddenly start pricking at my eyes, and I furiously blink them back. I\u2019m not going to cry. It\u2019s all going to be OK. I\u2019m going to make amends and turn into a new person and Luke won\u2019t even recognize me.</p><p>Determined, I start wheeling my cases up the hill again, until I reach the corner of Hill Rise. I stop and peer along the gray stone terrace of cottages, stiff with apprehension. This is Jess\u2019s road. She lives in one of these houses!</p><p>I\u2019m reaching in my pocket to check the exact number when suddenly I notice a movement in an upstairs window a few houses along. I look up \u2014 and it\u2019s Jess! She\u2019s standing at the window, gaping down at me in utter astonishment.</p> <p>Despite everything that\u2019s happened between us, I feel a swell of emotion at the sight of her familiar face. This is my sister, after all. I start running up the street, my cases trundling behind me, my hatbox bouncing up and down. I reach the door, breathless, and am about to lift the knocker, when the door opens. Jess is standing in front of me in pale brown cords and a sweatshirt, looking aghast.</p><p>\u201cBecky... what the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess, I want to learn from you,\u201d I say in a wobbly voice, and lift my hands in supplication like the Shakespearean actors told me. \u201cI\u2019ve come to be your apprentice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She takes a step backwards in horror. \u201cBecky, have you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, yes. A few Bloody Marys, maybe... but I\u2019m not drunk, I promise! Jess, I want to be a good person.\u201d The words come tumbling out in a rush. \u201cI want to learn from you. And get to know you. I know I\u2019ve made mistakes in life... but I want to learn from them. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t listen before, but now I\u2019m ready. Jess, I want to be like you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s an ominous silence.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be like me?\u201d she says at last. \u201cI thought I was a \u2018skinflint miserable cow.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Damn. I was hoping she might have forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cEr... I\u2019m really sorry I said that,\u201d I mutter, abashed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p> <p>Jess isn\u2019t looking convinced. Quickly I cast my mind back to the coaching session on the train. \u201cTime has healed the wounds between us... \u201d I begin, reaching out for her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t!\u201d says Jess, pulling it away. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a bloody nerve coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m asking you to help me, as my sister!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI want to learn from you! You\u2019re Yoda, and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoda?\u201d Jess\u2019s eyes widen in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like Yoda,\u201d I add hastily. \u201cNothing like! I just meant\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not interested,\u201d Jess interrupts. \u201cIn you, or your latest stupid idea. Just go away.\u201d</p><p>She slams the front door shut, leaving me standing on the street. Jess has shut the door on me? Me, her own sister?</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve come all the way here from London!\u201d I call through the door.</p><p>There\u2019s no reply.</p><p>I refuse to give up. Not just like that.</p><p>\u201cJess!\u201d I start hammering on the door. \u201cYou have to let me in! Please! I know we\u2019ve had our differences\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave my door alone!\u201d The door is wrenched open and Jess is standing there again. But this time she doesn\u2019t just look hostile. She looks positively livid. \u201cBecky, we haven\u2019t just had our differences! We are different. I have no time for you. Frankly, I wish I\u2019d never met you. And I have no idea what you\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say quickly, before she can slam the door again. \u201cEverything\u2019s gone wrong. Luke and I have argued. I... I did something stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a surprise.\u201d Jess folds her arms.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve brought it on myself.\u201d My voice starts to tremble. \u201cI know it\u2019s my own fault. But I think our marriage is in real trouble. I really do.\u201d</p><p>As I say the words, I can feel tears threatening again. I blink hard, trying to hold them off.</p><p>\u201cJess... please help me. You\u2019re the only person I can think of. If I could learn from you, maybe Luke would come round. He likes you.\u201d I feel a tightening in my throat, but force myself to look right at her. \u201cHe likes you better than he likes me.\u201d</p><p>Jess shakes her head, but I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t believe me or she doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d she says flatly.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand English? Go home!\u201d She waves her hand as though she\u2019s shooing a dog.</p><p>\u201cBut... I\u2019m your family!\u201d My voice is starting to shake. \u201cFamily help each other! Family watch out for one another. Jess, I\u2019m your sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not my fault,\u201d says Jess curtly. \u201cI never asked to be your sister. Bye, Becky.\u201d</p><p>She slams the door shut again, so hard that I flinch. I lift my hand to knock again \u2014 but there\u2019s no point, is there?</p><p>I\u2019ve come all this way for nothing.</p><p>What do I do now? Slowly, I turn round and start trundling my suitcases back along the street.</p><p>The thought of going straight home again is unbearable. All those hours on the train \u2014 to what? An empty flat. An empty flat and no husband.</p><p>And at the thought of Luke, suddenly I can\u2019t keep control of myself any longer. Tears start pouring down my cheeks and I can\u2019t help but begin sobbing. As I reach the corner, a couple of women with prams look at me curiously, but I barely notice. I\u2019m crying too hard. My makeup must have smeared everywhere... and I haven\u2019t got a free hand to get a hankie, so I\u2019m having to sniff... I need to stop. I need to sort myself out.</p><p>There\u2019s a kind of village green to my left, with a wooden bench in the middle. I head for it, then drop my cases and sink down, my head in my hands, and give way to a stream of fresh tears.</p><p>Here I am, hundreds of miles away from home, all on my own and no one wants to know me. And it\u2019s all my own fault. I\u2019ve ruined everything.</p><p>And Luke will never love me again.</p><p>I have a sudden vision of me moving out. Packing up my shoes. Luke telling me he wants to keep the Indonesian gamelan...</p><p>Dimly I hear a man\u2019s voice above my head. \u201cNow, now.

It seems a million years ago now.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not about to run out of milk, anyway,\u201d he adds, turning into a cottage with SCULLY STORES in black lettering above the doorway. A bell starts tinkling as we walk in, and from somewhere at the back I can hear a dog barking.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look around with fresh interest. \u201cThis is a shop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the shop,\u201d he corrects me. He puts down my cases and gently moves me off the mat, at which point the bell stops tinkling. \u201cBeen in the family for fifty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I look around the cozy store. There are racks of fresh bread, shelves with tins and packets lined up neatly, old-fashioned jars of sweets, and a display of postcards and gift items. \u201cThis is lovely! So... are you Mr. Scully?\u201d</p><p>Jim looks bemused. \u201cScully is the name of the village we\u2019re in, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d I blush. \u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Smith. And I think you need that cup of tea. Kelly?\u201d He raises his voice, and a few moments later a girl appears through a door at the back. She\u2019s about thirteen, skinny, with fine brown hair pulled into a ponytail and carefully made-up eyes. She\u2019s wearing jeans and a pink sleeveless T-shirt, and is holding a Heat magazine.</p><p>\u201cI was minding the shop, honest, Dad,\u201d she says at once. \u201cI just went upstairs for a magazine\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, love. I\u2019d like you to make a nice cup of tea for this lady. She\u2019s been through a bit of... distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Kelly peers at me a bit doubtfully, and it suddenly occurs to me that I must look an absolute fright.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d Jim pulls out a chair.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say gratefully. I put down my hatbox and fish in my Angel bag for my makeup case. I snap open my mirror and peer at myself \u2014 and oh God. I have never looked worse in my life. My nose is all red, my eyes are bloodshot, my eyeliner is smudged like a panda, and a streak of turquoise \u201c24-hour eye dazzle\u201d has somehow ended up on my cheek.</p><p>I quickly take out a cleansing wipe and get rid of the whole lot until my face is bare and pink, staring sadly at me from the mirror. Half of me feels like leaving it at that. Why should I put on any makeup? What\u2019s the point, if my marriage is over?</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d A steaming cup of tea appears in front of me on the counter, and I look up to see Kelly watching me avidly.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d I say, my voice still a little unsteady. \u201cYou\u2019re really sweet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d says Kelly, as I take the first delicious sip. God, a cup of tea is the answer to everything.</p><p>\u201cIs that...\u201d I look up, to see Kelly suddenly gawping at my bag with eyes like dinner plates. It must have been hidden behind the hatbox before. \u201cIs that... a real Angel bag?\u201d</p><p>I feel a huge inward twinge, which I manage to hide with a weak smile. If she only knew.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a real Angel bag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad, she\u2019s got an Angel bag!\u201d Kelly exclaims to Jim, who\u2019s unloading bags of sugar from a box. \u201cI showed you about them in Glamour magazine!\u201d Her eyes are shining with excitement. \u201cAll the film stars have got them! They\u2019ve sold out at Harrods! Where did you get yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn... Milan,\u201d I say after a pause.</p><p>\u201cMilan!\u201d breathes Kelly. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d Now her eyes have fallen on the contents of my makeup bag. \u201cIs that Stila lip gloss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily Masters has got Stila lip gloss,\u201d she says wistfully. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s all that.\u201d</p> <p>I look at her lit-up eyes and flushed cheeks, and suddenly I want to be thirteen again. Going to the shops on Saturday to spend my allowance. With nothing to worry about except biology homework and whether James Fullerton fancied me.</p><p>\u201cLook... have this,\u201d I say, scrabbling in my makeup bag for a brand-new Stila lip gloss in grapefruit. \u201cI\u2019m never going to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Kelly gasps. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you want this cream blusher?\u201d I hand over the box. \u201cNot that you need blusher...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, wait just a moment,\u201d comes Jim\u2019s voice from across the shop. \u201cKelly, you can\u2019t take this lady\u2019s makeup off her.\u201d He shakes his head at her. \u201cGive them back, love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe offered, Dad!\u201d says Kelly, her translucent skin staining pink. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for them or anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Jim. Kelly can have them. I\u2019m never going to use them. I only bought them in the first place because you got a free perfume if you spent over eighty quid... \u201d</p><p>Suddenly tears spring up in my eyes again. God, Jess is right. I\u2019m a total flake.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d says Kelly in alarm. \u201cHave them back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cI just need to... think about something else.\u201d</p><p>I dab my eyes with a tissue, get to my feet, and wander over to the gift display. I might as well get some souvenirs while I\u2019m here. I pick up a pipe rack for Dad and a painted wooden tray which Mum will like. I\u2019m just looking at a glass model of Lake Windermere and wondering whether to get it for Janice, when I notice two women standing outside the window. As I watch, they\u2019re joined by a third.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they waiting for?\u201d I say in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d says Jim. He looks at his watch, then puts out a sign reading TODAY\u2019S BREAD HALF PRICE.</p> <p>Immediately the women come bustling into the shop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take two bloomers, please, Jim,\u201d says one with metal-gray hair and a beige mac. \u201cHave you any reduced croissants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d says Jim. \u201cAll full price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take three large wholemeal,\u201d chimes in the second woman. She\u2019s wearing a green head scarf and holding a big brown handbag. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d She jerks her thumb at me. \u201cWe saw you crying on the green. Are you a tourist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always get themselves lost,\u201d says the first woman. \u201cWhich hotel are you at, love? Does she speak English? Speke Inglese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks Danish,\u201d says the third woman knowledgeably. \u201cWho speaks Danish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m English,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not lost. I was upset because...\u201d I hesitate, trying to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cBecause my marriage is in trouble. And I came up here to ask my sister for help, but she wouldn\u2019t give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister?\u201d says the woman in the head scarf suspiciously. \u201cWho\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives in this village.\u201d I take a sip of tea. \u201cShe\u2019s called Jessica Bertram.\u201d</p><p>The women look like I\u2019ve hit them over the head with a hammer. I look around in confusion, to see Jim\u2019s jaw has dropped by about a foot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jess\u2019s sister?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWell... yes. I am. Her half sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look around the shop, but no one\u2019s moved.

I\u2019m sorry, Dad, but it\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>I can feel my cheeks growing bright red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m normal! I\u2019m just... a bit different from Jess. We like different things. She likes rocks. I like... shops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you not interested in rocks, then?\u201d says the woman with the green head scarf.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I admit. \u201cIn fact... that was a bit of an issue between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kelly asks, clearly rapt.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I scuff my foot awkwardly on the floor. \u201cI told Jess I\u2019d never heard of a more boring hobby than rocks in my life, and that it suited her.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a universal gasp of incredulity.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be rude about rocks to Jess,\u201d says the beige-mac woman, shaking her head. \u201cShe loves those rocks of hers, bless her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJess is a good girl,\u201d chimes in the green \u2014 head-scarf woman, giving me a stern look. \u201cSturdy. Reliable. She\u2019d make a fine sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hope for better,\u201d agrees the third woman, pulling her cable-knit cardigan around her.</p><p>Their looks make me feel defensive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! I want to reconcile with her! But she isn\u2019t interested in being my sister! I just don\u2019t know how it all went wrong. I so wanted to be friends. I arranged this whole weekend for her, but she didn\u2019t like any of it. And she was so disapproving. We ended up having a huge row... and I called her all sorts of things... \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d Kelly asks avidly.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I rub my nose. \u201cI said she was a misery. I said she was really boring... \u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another huge gasp. Kelly raises a hand as though to stop me, but I don\u2019t want to stop. This is cathartic. Now I\u2019ve started, I want to confess everything.</p><p>\u201c... and the most skinflint person I\u2019d ever met in my life.\u201d I\u2019m goaded by their appalled faces. It\u2019s like I\u2019m on the crest of a roller coaster. \u201cWith zero dress sense, who must have had a fun bypass operation\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I realize there\u2019s a tinkling sound in the air. A tinkling sound which, now that I think about it, has been going on for a few seconds. Cold to the core, I turn round.</p><p>Jess is standing in the doorway, her face pale.</p><p>\u201cJess!\u201d I stammer. \u201cGod, Jess! I wasn\u2019t... I didn\u2019t mean any of... I was just explaining... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you were in here,\u201d she says, speaking with an obvious struggle. \u201cI came to see if you were OK. To see if you wanted a bed for the night. But... I think I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d She looks directly at me. \u201cI knew you were shallow and spoiled, Becky. I didn\u2019t realize you were a two-faced bitch as well.\u201d</p><p>She turns and strides out, closing the door behind her with a bang.</p><p>Kelly is bright red; Jim\u2019s looking anywhere but me. The whole atmosphere is prickling with awkwardness.</p><p>Then the woman in the green head scarf folds her arms.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cYou buggered that one up, didn\u2019t you, love?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in a state of total shock.</p><p>I came up here to reconcile with Jess \u2014 and all I\u2019ve done is made things worse.</p><p>\u201cHere you are, love,\u201d says Jim, placing a fresh mug of tea in front of me. \u201cThree sugars.\u201d</p><p>The three women are all drinking cups of tea too. Jim\u2019s introduced them to me as Edie (green head scarf), Lorna (metal-gray hair), and Bea (cable-knit cardigan) and has even produced a cake. I get the feeling they\u2019re all waiting for me to do something else to entertain them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a two-faced bitch,\u201d I say in despair. \u201cHonestly! I\u2019m nice! I came here to build bridges! I mean, I know Jess and I don\u2019t get along. But I wanted to learn from her. I thought she could help me save my marriage... \u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sharp intake of breath around the shop.</p><p>\u201cIs her marriage in trouble as well?\u201d Edie says to Jim, and clicks her tongue. \u201cDear, oh, dear.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt never rains but it pours,\u201d booms Lorna lugubriously. \u201cRun off with a fancy woman, has he?\u201d</p><p>Jim glances at me, then leans toward the women, lowering his voice.</p><p>\u201cApparently he\u2019s gone to Cyprus with a man called Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Edie\u2019s eyes open very wide. \u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Becky?\u201d says Kelly, biting her lip.</p><p>Go home, flashes through my mind. Give up.</p><p>But I keep seeing Jess\u2019s pale face in my mind, and feeling a little stab in my heart. I know just what it\u2019s like to be bitched about. I\u2019ve known enough horrible bitches in my time. An image comes to me of Alicia Bitch Long-legs, the meanest, snidest girl I ever knew.</p><p>I can\u2019t bear it if my own sister thinks I\u2019m like her.</p><p>\u201cI have to apologize to Jess,\u201d I say, looking up. \u201cI know we\u2019ll never be friends. But I can\u2019t go home with her thinking the worst of me.\u201d I take a sip of scalding tea, then look up. \u201cIs there anywhere I can stay around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEdie runs a bed-and-breakfast,\u201d says Jim. \u201cGot any rooms free, Edie?\u201d</p><p>Edie reaches into her huge brown bag, then brings out a notebook and consults it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in luck,\u201d she says, looking up. \u201cI\u2019ve one deluxe single left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdie\u2019ll take good care of you,\u201d Jim says, so kindly that I feel ridiculous tears welling up again.</p><p>\u201cCould I take it for tonight, please?\u201d I say, wiping my eyes. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d I take another sip of tea, then notice my mug. It\u2019s blue pottery with Scully handpainted on it in white. \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I say with a gulp. \u201cDo you sell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the rack at the back,\u201d says Jim, looking at me with amusement.</p> <p>\u201cCould I have two? I mean, four?\u201d I reach for a tissue and blow my nose. \u201cAnd I just want to say... thank you. You\u2019re all being so nice.\u201d</p><p>The bed-and-breakfast is a large white house directly across the green. Jim carries my suitcases and I carry my hatbox and my carrier bag full of souvenirs, and Edie follows behind me, giving me a list of rules I have to keep.</p><p>\u201cNo gentleman visitors after eleven... no parties of more than three people in the room... no abuse of solvents or aerosol cans... payment in advance, cash or check accepted, much obliged,\u201d she concludes as we reach the lit-up door.</p><p>\u201cAll right from here, Becky?\u201d says Jim, putting my cases down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. And thank you so much,\u201d I say, feeling so grateful, I half-want to give him a kiss. But I don\u2019t quite dare to \u2014 so I just watch as he walks off across the grass again.</p><p>\u201cMuch obliged,\u201d repeats Edie meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say, realizing she means she wants to be paid. \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>I scrabble inside my bag for my purse, and my fingers brush against my mobile phone. From force of habit I pull it out and peer at the display. But there\u2019s still no signal.</p> <p>\u201cYou can use the pay phone in the hall if there\u2019s anyone you want to call,\u201d says Edie. \u201cWe have a pull-down privacy hood.\u201d</p><p>Is there anyone I want to call?</p><p>With a twinge I think of Luke in Cyprus, still furious with me; Mum and Dad engrossed in a therapy workshop on their cruise; and Suze, picnicking on some picturesque sun-dappled lawn with Lulu and all their children in cute overalls.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s OK,\u201d I say, trying to smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t got anyone to call. To be honest... no one will have even noticed I\u2019ve gone.\u201d</p><p>5 jun 03 16:54</p><p>to Becky</p><p>from Suze</p><p>Bex. Sorry I missed u. Why aren\u2019t u answering the phone?

I seem to have spent the whole night staring at the uneven ceiling of Edie\u2019s B&amp;B, my mind going round and round in circles. Except I must have slept for a bit, because when I wake up in the morning my head is full of a terrible dream where I turned into Alicia Bitch Long-legs. I was wearing a pink suit and laughing with a horrible sneer and Jess was looking all pale and crushed. In fact, now that I think about it, Jess looked a bit like me.</p><p>Just the thought of it makes me queasy. I have to do something about this.</p><p>I\u2019m not hungry, but Edie has cooked a full English breakfast and doesn\u2019t seem impressed when I say I normally have just a piece of toast. So I nibble at some bacon and eggs and pretend to have a go at the black pudding, all the while avoiding the attempts at conversation by a kindly German couple on holiday. After a final sip of coffee I leave to find Jess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I head up the hill to her house, the morning sun is in my eyes, and a cool wind blows through my hair. Across the green I can see Jim outside his store, unloading crates of apples from a delivery truck, and he lifts his hand in greeting. I wave back, my spirits lifted. This feels like a day for reconciliations. Fresh starts and clean slates.</p><p>I approach the all-too-familiar brown front door, ring the bell, and wait.</p><p>There\u2019s no reply.</p><p>OK, I am really tired of people not being in when I want to have emotional reunions with them. I squint up at the windows, wondering whether she might be hiding. Maybe I should throw some stones up at the windowpanes.</p> <p>Except what if I broke one? Then she\u2019d really hate me.</p><p>I ring the bell a few more times, then give up and walk back down the path. I sit on a piece of wall and settle myself comfortably. This is fine. It\u2019s a lovely day. I\u2019ll just wait, and when she arrives back home I\u2019ll spring up with a speech about how sorry I am.</p><p>The wall isn\u2019t quite as comfortable as I first thought, and I shift a few times, trying to find a good position. I check the time, then watch an old lady and her little dog walk slowly along the pavement on the other side of the road.</p><p>Then I check the time again. Five minutes have gone by.</p><p>God, how on earth do stalkers do it? They must get bored out of their minds.</p> <p>I get up to stretch my legs and walk up to Jess\u2019s house again. I ring the bell, just to be on the safe side, then meander back to the wall again. As I do so, I see a policeman coming up the street toward me. What\u2019s a policeman doing here, out on this little street at ten o\u2019clock in the morning? I thought they were all tied to their desks by paperwork or zooming around inner cities in squad cars.</p><p>I feel a bit apprehensive as I see that he\u2019s looking directly at me. But I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, am I? I mean, it\u2019s not like stalking is against the law.</p><p>Oh. Well, OK, maybe stalking is against the law. But I\u2019ve only been doing it for five minutes. Surely that doesn\u2019t count. And anyway, how does he know I\u2019m stalking anyone? I might just be sitting here for pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d he says as he approaches.</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks!\u201d</p><p>He looks at me expectantly.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cCould you move along, miss? This isn\u2019t a public seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d I say boldly. \u201cThat\u2019s what is wrong with this country! Anyone who doesn\u2019t conform is persecuted! Why shouldn\u2019t you be able to sit on a wall without being harassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my wall,\u201d he says, and gestures to the front door. \u201cThis is my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I flush red and leap to my feet. \u201cI was just... er... going. Thanks! Really nice wall!\u201d</p><p>OK. Stalking over. I\u2019ll have to come back later.</p><p>I trail down the hill to the village green, and find myself turning toward the shop. As I enter, Kelly is sitting behind the till with a copy of Elle, and Jim is arranging apples on the display rack.</p><p>\u201cI went to see Jess,\u201d I say morosely. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019ll have to wait till she comes back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall I read out your horoscope?\u201d says Kelly. \u201cSee if it says anything about sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, young lady,\u201d says Jim reprovingly. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be revising for your exams. If you\u2019re not working, you can go and wait at the tea shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Kelly hastily. \u201cI\u2019m revising!\u201d She pulls a face at me, then puts Elle down and reaches for a book called Elementary Algebra.</p><p>God, algebra. I\u2019d totally forgotten that existed. Maybe I\u2019m quite glad I\u2019m not thirteen anymore.</p><p>I need a sugar rush, so I head toward the biscuit section and grab some chocolate digestives and Orange Club biscuits. Then I drift over to the stationery shelf. You can never have too much stationery, so I pick up a packet of thumbtacks in the shape of sheep, which will always come in useful. And I might as well get the matching stapler and folders.</p><p>\u201cAll right there?\u201d says Jim, eyeing my full arms.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks!\u201d</p><p>I take my goodies over to the till, where Kelly rings them up.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want a cup of tea?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, thanks.\u201d I say politely. \u201cI couldn\u2019t intrude. I\u2019d get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the way of what?\u201d she retorts. \u201cNobody\u2019ll be in until four, when the bread comes down. And you can test me on my French vocab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well.\u201d I brighten. \u201cIf I\u2019d be useful...\u201d</p><p>Three hours later I\u2019m still there. I\u2019ve had three cups of tea, about half a packet of chocolate digestives, and an apple, and I\u2019ve stocked up on a few more presents for people at home, like a set of toby jugs and some place mats, which everyone needs. Plus I\u2019ve been helping Kelly with her work. Except now we\u2019ve progressed from algebra and French vocab revision to Kelly\u2019s outfit for the school disco. We\u2019ve got every single magazine open, and I\u2019ve made her up with each eye different, just to show her what the possibilities are. One side is really dramatic, all smoky shadow and a spare false eyelash I found in my makeup bag; the other is all silvery and sixties, with white space-age mascara. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your mother see you like that,\u201d is all Jim keeps saying as he walks by.</p><p>\u201cIf only I had my hairpieces,\u201d I say, studying Kelly\u2019s face critically. \u201cI could give you the most fantastic ponytail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look amazing!\u201d Kelly\u2019s goggling at herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got wonderful cheekbones,\u201d I tell her, and dust shimmery powder onto them.</p> <p>\u201cThis is so much fun!\u201d Kelly looks at me, eyes shining. \u201cGod, I wish you lived here, Becky! We could do this every day!\u201d</p><p>She looks so excited, I feel ridiculously touched.</p><p>\u201cWell... you know,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll visit again. If I patch things up with Jess.\u201d</p><p>But even at the thought of Jess, my insides kind of crumble. The more time goes by, the more nervous I am at seeing her again.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to do makeovers like this with Jess,\u201d I add, a bit wistfully. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, she\u2019s dumb,\u201d says Kelly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. She\u2019s... she likes different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a prickly character,\u201d Jim puts in, walking by with some bottles of cherryade. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to credit you two are sisters.\u201d He dumps the bottles down and wipes his brow. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s in the upbringing. Jess had it pretty hard going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her family, then?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He nods. \u201cNot well, but I know them. I\u2019ve had dealings with Jess\u2019s dad. He owns Bertram Foods. Lives over in Nailbury. Five miles away.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m burning all over with curiosity. Jess has barely told me a word about her family, despite my subtle probing.</p> <p>\u201cSo... what are they like?\u201d I say, as casually as I can. \u201cHer family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I say, she\u2019s had a pretty hard time. Her mum died when she was fifteen. That\u2019s a difficult age for a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew that!\u201d Kelly\u2019s eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cAnd her dad...\u201d Jim leans pensively on the counter. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. A fair man. Very successful. He built up Bertram Foods from nothing, through hard work. But he\u2019s not what you\u2019d call... warm. He was always as tough on Jess as he was on her brothers. Expected them to fend for themselves. I remember Jess when she started big school. She got into the high school over in Carlisle. Very academic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried for that school,\u201d says Kelly to me, pulling a face. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a clever girl, that Jess,\u201d says Jim admiringly. \u201cBut she had to catch three buses every morning to get there. I used to drive past on my way here \u2014 and I\u2019ll remember the sight till I die. The early-morning mist, no one else about, and Jess standing at the bus stop with her big schoolbag. She wasn\u2019t the big, strong lass she is now. She was a skinny little thing.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t quite find a reply. I\u2019m thinking about how Mum and Dad used to take me to school by car every day. Even though it was only a mile away.</p><p>\u201cThey must be rich,\u201d says Kelly, rooting around in my makeup bag. \u201cIf they own Bertram Foods. We get all our frozen pies from them,\u201d she adds to me. \u201cAnd ice cream. They\u2019ve a huge catalog!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re well off,\u201d says Jim. \u201cBut they\u2019ve always been close with their money.\u201d He rips open a cardboard box of Cup-a-Soups and starts stacking them on a shelf. \u201cBill Bertram used to boast about it. How all his kids worked for their pocket money.\u201d He straightens a bundle of chicken and mushroom sachets on the shelf. \u201cAnd if they couldn\u2019t afford a school trip or whatever... they didn\u2019t go. Simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool trips?\u201d I can\u2019t get my head round this. \u201cBut everyone knows parents pay for school trips!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the Bertrams. He wanted to teach them the value of money. There was a story going around one year that one of the Bertram boys was the only kid in school not to go to the pantomime. He didn\u2019t have the money and his dad wouldn\u2019t bail him out.\u201d Jim resumes stacking the soups. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was true. But it wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d He gives Kelly a mock-severe look. \u201cYou don\u2019t know you\u2019re born, young lady. You\u2019ve got the easy life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do chores!\u201d retorts Kelly at once. \u201cLook! I\u2019m helping out here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She reaches for some chewing gum from the sweets counter and unwraps it, then turns to me. \u201cNow I\u2019ll do you, Becky!\u201d She riffles in my makeup bag. \u201cHave you got any bronzer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d I say, distracted. \u201cSomewhere.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still thinking about Jess standing at the bus stop, all little and skinny.</p><p>Jim is squashing the empty Cup-a-Soup box down flat. He turns and gives me an appraising look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. You\u2019ll make up with Jess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I try to smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sisters. You\u2019re family. Family always pull through for each other.\u201d He glances out the window. \u201cAy-up. They\u2019re gathering early today.\u201d</p><p>I follow his gaze, and see two old ladies hovering outside the shop. One of them squints at the bread display, then turns and shakes her head at the other.</p><p>\u201cDoes nobody buy bread full price?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNot in this village,\u201d says Jim. \u201cExcept the tourists. But we don\u2019t get so many of those. It\u2019s mostly climbers who want to have a go at Scully Pike \u2014 and they don\u2019t have much call for bread. Only emergency services.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow d\u2019you mean?\u201d I say, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhen the stupid buggers get stuck.\u201d Jim shrugs and reaches for the half-price sign. \u201cNo matter. I\u2019ve got to thinking of bread as a loss leader, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so yummy when it\u2019s all fresh and new!\u201d I say, looking along the rows of plump loaves. Suddenly I feel really sorry for them, like they haven\u2019t been asked to dance. \u201cI\u2019ll buy some. Full price,\u201d I add firmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to reduce it,\u201d Jim points out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll have two big white ones and a brown one.\u201d I march over to the bread display and pluck the loaves off the shelf.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with all that bread?\u201d says Kelly.</p> <p>\u201cDunno. Make toast.\u201d I hand Kelly some pound coins and she pops the three loaves into a bag, giggling.</p><p>\u201cJess is right, you are mad,\u201d she says. \u201cShall I do your eyes now? What look do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCustomers\u2019ll be coming in,\u201d warns Jim. \u201cI\u2019m about to put the sign up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just do one eye,\u201d says Kelly, quickly reaching for a palette of eye shadows. \u201cThen when they\u2019ve all gone, I\u2019ll do the other one. Close your eyes, Becky.\u201d</p><p>She starts to brush eye shadow onto my eyelid, and I close my eyes, enjoying the brushing, tickling sensation. I\u2019ve always adored having my makeup done.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I\u2019m doing some eyeliner. Keep still... \u201d</p><p>\u201cSign\u2019s going up now,\u201d comes Jim\u2019s voice. There\u2019s a pause \u2014 then I hear the familiar tinkling sound, and the bustle of people coming in.</p><p>\u201cEr... don\u2019t open your eyes yet, Becky.\u201d Kelly sounds a bit alarmed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this has gone right... \u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me see!\u201d</p><p>I open them and grab my makeup mirror. One of my eyes is a wash of bright pink eye shadow, with shaky red eyeliner across the top lid. I look like I have some hideous eye disease.</p><p>\u201cKelly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt said in Elle!\u201d she says defensively, gesturing to a picture of a catwalk model. \u201cPink and red is in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like a monster!\u201d I can\u2019t help bursting into giggles at my lopsided face. I have never looked so terrible in my life. I glance up to see if any of the customers have noticed and my laughter dies away.</p><p>Jess is coming into the shop along with the other reduced-price shoppers.</p><p>She looks so cold and hostile, a far cry from that skinny eleven-year-old waiting for the bus in the early morning. Her gaze runs dismissively over the magazines, the open makeup case, and all my makeup scattered over the counter. Then she turns away without speaking and begins to root through the basket of reduced cans.</p><p>The bustle of the shop has dwindled to nothing. I\u2019m sure everyone knows exactly what\u2019s been going on.</p><p>I glance at Jim, who gives me an encouraging nod.</p><p>\u201cEr... Jess,\u201d I begin. \u201cI came to see you this morning. I wanted to explain... \u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to explain.\u201d She turns over the cans roughly, not even looking at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re still doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing makeovers with me,\u201d Kelly says loyally. \u201cAren\u2019t you, Becky?\u201d</p><p>I dart a grateful smile at her, but my attention is still fixed on Jess.</p><p>\u201cI stayed because I want to talk to you. To... to apologize. Could I take you out to supper tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought I was well-dressed enough to have supper with you, Becky,\u201d Jess says tonelessly. Her face is still and set \u2014 but now I can see the hurt underneath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd anyway, I\u2019m busy.\u201d Jess dumps three battered cans on the counter, together with one that has lost its paper covering altogether and is marked at 10p. \u201cDo you know what this is, Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFruit cocktail, I think.\u201d He frowns. \u201cBut it could be carrots...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d She plonks some coins on the counter and fishes a crumpled paper carrier out of her pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t need a bag. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother night, then!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cOr lunch...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>She strides out of the shop and I just sit there, my face tingling as though I\u2019ve been slapped. Gradually the hush turns into whispers, which grow into full-blown chatter. I\u2019m aware of people\u2019s prying eyes as they come up to the counter to pay, but I\u2019m too defeated to care.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, Becky?\u201d Kelly says, touching my shoulder tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve blown it.\u201d I drop my arms in a hopeless gesture. \u201cYou saw her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe always was a stubborn little cuss.\u201d Jim shakes his head. \u201cEven when she was a kid. She\u2019s her own worst enemy, that Jess. Hard on herself and hard on the rest of the world too.\u201d He pauses, cleaning some dirt off his Stanley knife. \u201cShe could do with a sister like you, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad,\u201d Kelly says robustly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need her! Just forget she\u2019s your sister. Pretend she doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as simple as that, though, is it?\u201d says Jim. \u201cNot with family. You can\u2019t walk away so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I give a dispirited shrug. \u201cMaybe we can. I mean, we\u2019ve gone twenty-seven years without knowing each other... \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to make it another twenty-seven?\u201d Jim looks at me, suddenly stern. \u201cHere\u2019s the two of you. Neither of you has a sister. You could be good friends to one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault... \u201d I begin defensively, then tail off as I remember my little speech last night. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not all my fault... \u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say it was,\u201d says Jim.

Local environmental protest meeting. Everyone\u2019ll be there.\u201d His eyes twinkle. \u201cWhy not come along?\u201d</p><p>FAX MESSAGE</p><p>TO: LUKE BRANDON</p><p>APHRODITE TEMPLE HOTEL</p><p>CYPRUS</p><p>FROM: SUSAN CLEATH \u2014 STUART</p> <p>6 JUNE 2003</p><p>URGENT \u2014 EMERGENCY</p><p>Luke</p><p>Becky isn\u2019t at the flat. No one has seen her anywhere. I still can\u2019t get through on her phone.</p><p>I\u2019m really getting worried.</p><p>Suze</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>OK. THIS IS my chance to impress Jess. This is my chance to show her I\u2019m not shallow and spoiled. I must not fuck this one up.</p><p>The first crucial thing is my outfit. With a frown I survey all my clothes, which I\u2019ve strewn over the bed in the B&amp;B room. What is the perfect environmental protest group meeting outfit? Not the leather trousers... not the glittery top... My eyes suddenly alight on a pair of combat trousers, and I pluck them from the pile.</p><p>Excellent. They\u2019re pink, but I can\u2019t help that. And... yes. I\u2019ll team them with a T-shirt with a slogan. Genius!</p><p>I haul out a T-shirt that has the word HOT on it and goes really well with the combats. It\u2019s not very protest-y, though, is it? I think for a minute, then get a red pen out of my bag and carefully add the word BAN. BAN HOT doesn\u2019t exactly make sense... but it\u2019s the thought that counts, surely. Plus I won\u2019t wear any makeup, except a bit of eyeliner and some mascara and a translucent lip gloss.</p><p>I put it all on, and tie my hair into plaits, then admire myself in the mirror. I actually look pretty militant! I raise my hand experimentally in a power salute, and shake my fist at the mirror.</p><p>\u201cUp with the workers,\u201d I say in a deep voice. \u201cBrothers unite.\u201d</p><p>God, yes. I think I could be really good at this!</p><p>The protest meeting is being held in the village hall, and as I arrive I see people milling about, and posters up everywhere, with slogans like DON\u2019T SPOIL OUR COUNTRYSIDE. I head to a table with cups of coffee and biscuits on it.</p><p>\u201cCup of coffee, love?\u201d says an elderly man in a waxed jacket.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cEr, I mean... thanks, brother. Right on.\u201d I give him the power salute. \u201cUp the strike!\u201d</p><p>The man looks a bit confused, and I suddenly remember they\u2019re not striking. I keep getting this mixed up with Billy Elliot. But it\u2019s the same thing, isn\u2019t it? Solidarity and fighting together for a good cause. I wander into the center of the hall, holding my cup, and catch the eye of a youngish guy with spiky red hair and a denim jacket covered in badges. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d he says, breaking away from the group he\u2019s in and extending his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Robin.

That only came out because I was thinking that his hair looks just like a hedgehog\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhen they get squashed by cars,\u201d I improvise. \u201cIt\u2019s a real danger in today\u2019s society.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d Robin frowns thoughtfully. \u201cSo, are you in an action group specifically looking at the plight of hedgehogs?\u201d</p><p>Right. Change the subject, Becky.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cI am. It\u2019s called... Prickle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrickle!\u201d He smiles. \u201cGreat name!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cIt stands for Protect... Really... Innocent... er...\u201d</p><p>OK. Maybe I should have chosen a word with an H in it.</p> <p>\u201cCreatures...\u201d I\u2019m floundering. \u201c... of all Kinds... including hedgehogs...\u201d</p><p>I break off in relief as I see Jim approaching, together with a thin, wiry woman dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt. This must be Jim\u2019s wife!</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Jim,\u201d says Robin with a friendly smile. \u201cGlad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Jim!\u201d I say, and turn to the woman with him. \u201cYou must be Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be the famous Becky!\u201d She clasps my hand. \u201cOur Kelly can\u2019t talk about anything but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s really sweet! We had such fun today doing makeovers...\u201d I suddenly catch Jim\u2019s frown. \u201cAnd... er... revisions for her exams,\u201d I hastily add. \u201cLots of algebra and French vocab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jess here?\u201d Jim asks, looking around the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, feeling the usual apprehension at the mention of her name. \u201cI haven\u2019t spotted her yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d Elizabeth clicks her tongue. \u201cJim\u2019s told me all about it. Two sisters, not speaking to each other. And you\u2019re so young! You\u2019ve got your whole lives ahead to be friends, you know. A sister is a blessing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make up,\u201d Jim says easily. \u201cAh. Here she is!\u201d</p><p>I swivel round and sure enough, there\u2019s Jess, striding toward us, looking totally gobsmacked to see me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d she says to Jim.</p><p>\u201cThis is a new member of our group, Jess,\u201d says Robin, coming forward with a smile. \u201cMeet Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Jess!\u201d I say with a nervous smile. \u201cI thought I\u2019d get into the environment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2019s special interest is hedgehogs,\u201d adds Robin.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jess takes a few seconds to absorb this news, then starts to shake her head. \u201cNo. No. She\u2019s not a member of the group. And she\u2019s not coming to the meeting. She has to go. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d asks Robin, trying to put all this together. Jess looks away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sisters,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t get on,\u201d says Jim, in a stage whisper.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jess,\u201d says Robin earnestly. \u201cYou know our group ethos. We put our personal differences aside at the door. Everyone\u2019s welcome. Everyone\u2019s a friend!\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cBecky\u2019s already volunteered for some outreach work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jess clasps her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Becky,\u201d says Robin, ignoring Jess. \u201cI\u2019ll find you a chair.\u201d</p><p>Gradually the chatter abates and everyone sits down on chairs arranged in the shape of a horseshoe. As I look around the row of faces I spot Edie and Lorna, and several more people I recognize as customers from Jim\u2019s shop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome, everyone,\u201d says Robin, taking up a position in the center of the horseshoe. \u201cBefore we start, I have a few announcements. Tomorrow, as you know, is the sponsored endurance hike up Scully Pike. Can we have numbers, please?\u201d</p><p>About half the people there put up their hands, including Jess. I\u2019m half tempted to put mine up too, only there\u2019s something about the word endurance that puts me off, not to mention hike.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Robin looks around, pleased. \u201cThose of you attempting it, please remember all your gear. I\u2019m afraid the weather forecast is not good. Mist, and possibly rain.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a unified rueful groan, mixed with laughs.</p> <p>\u201cBut be assured, a welcoming party will be waiting at the end with hot drinks,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd good luck to all participants. Now.\u201d He smiles around the room. \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce a new member to the group. Becky comes to us with a specialist knowledge of hedgehogs and...\u201d He looks over at me. \u201cIs it other small endangered creatures, or just hedgehogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I clear my throat, aware of Jess\u2019s eyes on me like daggers. \u201cEr... mainly just the hedgehogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a warm welcome to Becky from all of us. OK. The serious business.\u201d He reaches for a leather satchel and pulls out a sheaf of papers. \u201cThe proposed Piper\u2019s Hill Shopping Center.\u201d</p><p>He pauses as though for effect, and there are murmurs of hostility around the room.</p><p>\u201cThe council is still playing ignorant. However\u201d\u2014he flips through the sheaf with a flourish\u2014\u201cby hook or by crook, I have managed to get hold of a copy of the plans.\u201d Robin hands the papers to a man on the end of the row, who starts passing them along. \u201cObviously we have a lot of major objections. If you could all study the material for a few minutes...\u201d</p> <p>I obediently read the plans along with everyone else, and look at all the drawings. As I glance around, people are shaking their heads in anger and disappointment, which, frankly, doesn\u2019t surprise me.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He looks around and his eyes alight on me. \u201cBecky. Maybe we could hear from you first. As an outsider, what\u2019s your initial reaction?\u201d</p><p>Everyone turns to look at me, and I feel my cheeks grow hot.</p><p>\u201cEr... well, I can see the problems straightaway,\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Robin says with satisfaction. \u201cThis proves our point. The problems are obvious at first glance, to someone who doesn\u2019t even know the area. Carry on, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I study the plans for a second, then continue. \u201cFor a start, the opening hours are quite restricted. I\u2019d have it open till ten every night. I mean, people have to work during the day! They don\u2019t want to have to rush their shopping!\u201d</p> <p>As I look around, everyone seems a bit stunned. They probably weren\u2019t expecting me to hit the nail on the head like that. Encouraged, I tap the list of shops. \u201cAnd these are rubbish shops. You should have Space.NK... Joseph... and definitely an L.K. Bennett!\u201d</p><p>No one has moved a muscle.</p><p>Except Jess, who has buried her head in her hands.</p><p>Robin appears dumbstruck, but makes a valiant attempt to smile.</p><p>\u201cBecky... slight confusion here. We\u2019re not protesting about any of the features of the shopping center. We\u2019re protesting about its very existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I peer at him, uncomprehending.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to build it,\u201d says Jess in extra-slow, sarcastic tones. \u201cThey\u2019re planning to ruin an area of natural beauty. That\u2019s what the protest is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My cheeks flame. \u201cOh. I see. Absolutely. The natural beauty. I was... actually... er... just about to mention that.\u201d Flustered, I start riffling through the plans again. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be quite a danger to hedgehogs, too,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed several hedgehog hazard points. Or HHPs, as we call them.\u201d</p> <p>I can see Jess rolling her eyes. Maybe I\u2019d better stop now.</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d says Robin, his smile now a little strained. \u201cSo... Becky has shared some valuable hedgehog safety concerns. Any other views?\u201d</p><p>As a white-haired man starts to speak abut the desecration of the countryside, I sink back down into my chair, my heart thumping. I\u2019m kind of glad I didn\u2019t mention my other major concern about the shopping center now. Which was that it isn\u2019t big enough.</p><p>\u201cMy worry is the local economy,\u201d a smartly dressed woman is declaiming. \u201cOut-of-town shopping centers ruin rural life. If they build this, it\u2019ll put the village shop out of business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a crime,\u201d booms Lorna. \u201cVillage shops are the hub of the community.

I can see all the customers of Jim\u2019s shop nodding at each other.</p><p>\u201cHow can Jim compete with the big chains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to keep these small shops alive!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s to blame... \u201d</p><p>I know I wasn\u2019t going to speak again, but I just can\u2019t keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I venture, raising my hand. \u201cIf you all want the village shop to stay alive, why don\u2019t you buy bread at full price?\u201d</p><p>I look around the room, to see Jess glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cThat is just typical,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything comes down to spending money, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a shop!\u201d I say, bewildered. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point! You spend money! If you all spent a bit more money, the shop would start booming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone in the world is addicted to shopping, OK, Becky?\u201d snaps Jess.</p><p>\u201cWish they were,\u201d Jim puts in with a wry smile. \u201cMy revenue\u2019s trebled since Becky came to town.\u201d</p><p>Jess stares at him, her mouth tight. Oh God. She looks really pissed off.</p><p>\u201cIt was just... an idea,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I shrink down in my seat again, trying to look unobtrusive.</p><p>The discussion starts up again, but I keep my head down and leaf through the shopping center plans again. And I have to say, I was right in the first place. The shops are rubbish. Not a single good place for handbags... not a single place you can get your nails done... I mean, I can really see their point. What is the point of ruining some lovely field with a crappy shopping center full of shops no one wants to visit?</p> <p>\u201cSo we on the committee have decided on immediate, preemptive action,\u201d Robin is saying as I raise my head again. \u201cWe\u2019re holding a rally, to be held in a week\u2019s time. We need as much support as possible. And obviously as much publicity as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d says one woman with a sigh. \u201cNo one\u2019s interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgar is writing an article for his parish magazine,\u201d says Robin, consulting a piece of paper. \u201cAnd I know some of you have already drafted letters to the council...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m itching to speak.</p><p>I open my mouth, catch Jess\u2019s eyes on me like daggers, and close it again. But \u2014 oh God \u2014 I can\u2019t keep quiet. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re producing a very informative leaflet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do something bigger!\u201d My voice cuts across Robin\u2019s, and everyone turns in my direction.</p><p>\u201cBecky, shut up,\u201d Jess says furiously. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to discuss this sensibly!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo am I!\u201d I\u2019m hot under all these eyes, but I press on. \u201cI think you should have a huge marketing campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be expensive?\u201d says the white-haired man, with a frown.</p><p>\u201cIn business, if you want to make money, you have to spend money. And it\u2019s the same here. If you want to have a result, you have to make the investment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney again!\u201d exclaims Jess in exasperation. \u201cSpending again! You\u2019re obsessed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get a sponsorship deal!\u201d I retort. \u201cThere must be local businesses who don\u2019t want the shopping center either. You should get a local radio station involved... put together a press pack... \u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, love,\u201d a guy sitting near to Jess interrupts sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at talking. But what do you actually know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nothing,\u201d I admit. \u201cExcept I used to work as a journalist. So I know about press releases and marketing campaigns.\u201d I look around, sensing interest on a few faces. \u201cAnd for two years I worked at Barneys, the department store in New York. We used to run loads of events, like parties, and special sale weekends, and promotional evenings... In fact, that\u2019s an idea!\u201d I turn to Jim in sudden inspiration. \u201cIf you want to boost the village shop, you should celebrate it! Do something positive! You should have a shopping festival. Or a party! It would be such fun! You could have special offers, and free gifts... tie it in to the protest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I stop, startled, to see Jess on her feet, white with anger. \u201cJust shut up for once, Becky! Why does everything have to be a party? Why do you have to trivialize everything? Shopkeepers like Jim aren\u2019t interested in parties! They\u2019re interested in solid, well-thought-out action.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might be interested in a party,\u201d Jim says mildly, but Jess doesn\u2019t seem to hear him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about the environment!

Come on, love. Be a bit more welcoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre these two sisters?\u201d says the white-haired man in surprise. An interested murmuring grows throughout the room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my sister.\u201d Jess has folded her arms tight. She\u2019s refusing even to look at me, and suddenly I feel a swell of angry hurt.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want me to be your sister, Jess,\u201d I say, standing up to face her. \u201cBut I am! And there\u2019s nothing you can do about that! We have the same blood! We have the same genes! We have the same\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t believe we do, OK?\u201d Jess\u2019s voice reverberates in the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard her correctly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we share the same blood,\u201d she says in calmer tones.</p><p>\u201cBut... but we know we do!\u201d I say in confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jess sighs and rubs her face. When she looks up, there\u2019s only a trace of animosity left.</p><p>\u201cLook at us, Becky,\u201d she says, almost kindly. She gestures to me and then to herself. \u201cWe have nothing in common. Not one thing. We can\u2019t be from the same family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but my dad\u2019s your father!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d says Jess, almost to herself. \u201cLook, Becky, I wasn\u2019t going to bring this up till later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring up what?\u201d I feel a dreadful foreboding. \u201cBring up what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Here\u2019s the thing.\u201d Jess exhales sharply. \u201cOriginally I was given the name of your dad as my father. But... it just doesn\u2019t seem to be making sense. So last night I had a long talk about it with my aunty Florence. She admitted my mum was a bit... wild. There might have been other men.\u201d Jess hesitates. \u201cShe thought there probably had been other men, although she didn\u2019t have any names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... you had a test!\u201d I say, bewildered. \u201cA DNA test! So that proves...\u201d I trail off as Jess shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNo. We never did. We were going to. But I had your dad\u2019s name, the dates made sense, and... we all just assumed.\u201d She looks down at the ground. \u201cI think we assumed wrong.\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning. They never did a DNA test? They just assumed?</p><p>The entire room is silent. I don\u2019t think anyone is breathing. I catch sight of Jim\u2019s anxious, kind face, and quickly look away.</p><p>\u201cSo... this has all been a big mistake,\u201d I say at last. Suddenly there\u2019s a huge lump in my throat.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was a mistake,\u201d agrees Jess. She looks up and sees my stricken face. \u201cCome on, Becky. If you looked at us as an outsider... would you say we were sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I suppose not,\u201d I manage.</p><p>I\u2019m reeling with shock and disappointment, but at the same time, deep down, a tiny voice is telling me that this makes sense. I feel like for the last few weeks I\u2019ve been trying to force my foot into a wrong-size shoe. I\u2019ve been ramming and ramming, chafing the skin... and at last I\u2019m admitting it doesn\u2019t fit.</p><p>She\u2019s not my sister. She\u2019s not my flesh and blood. She\u2019s just... a girl.</p><p>I\u2019m standing here staring at a girl I barely know, who doesn\u2019t even like me.</p><p>I really don\u2019t want to be here anymore.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to compose myself. \u201cWell... I think I\u2019ll go. Bye, everybody. Good luck with the protest.\u201d</p><p>Nobody says anything. Everyone looks too thunderstruck. With trembling hands I pick up my bag, then push back my chair. As I make my way past everyone to the door I catch the odd sympathetic look. I pause when I reach Jim, who looks almost as disappointed as I feel.</p><p>\u201cThanks for everything, Jim,\u201d I say, trying to smile.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, love.\u201d He clasps my hand warmly. \u201cIt was good to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too. Say goodbye to Kelly for me.\u201d</p><p>I reach the door and turn to face Jess.</p><p>\u201cBye, then.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cHave a nice life and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Becky,\u201d she says, and for the first time there\u2019s a flicker of something like compassion in her eyes. \u201cI hope you patch it up with Luke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I nod, not quite sure what else to say.

After all that.</p><p>I\u2019ve been sitting on the bed in my room at the guesthouse for about an hour, just gazing out the window at the distant hills. It\u2019s all over. My stupid dream of having a sisterly soul mate to chat and giggle with and go shopping with and eat peppermint creams with... is over for good. Not that Jess would ever have gone shopping or eaten peppermint creams with me. Or giggled, come to that. But she might have chatted. We might have got to know each other better. We might have told each other secrets and asked each other\u2019s advice. I hug my knees tight to my chest. This never happened in Long-Lost Sisters: The Love They Never Knew They Had.</p> <p>Actually, it happened once. With these two sisters who were going to have a kidney transplant and then they did the DNA test and realized they weren\u2019t sisters after all. But the point was, they went ahead with the kidney transplant anyway, and afterwards they said they would always be sisters in the heart. The point was, they liked each other.</p><p>I feel a single tear roll down my cheek and brush it away crossly. There\u2019s no point getting upset. I\u2019ve been an only child all my life... and now I am again. I only had a sister for a few weeks. It\u2019s not like I got used to it. It\u2019s not like we got attached or anything.</p><p>In fact... in fact, I\u2019m glad this has happened. Who would want Jess for a sister? Not me. No way. I mean, she\u2019s right. We have absolutely nothing in common. We don\u2019t understand one thing about each other. We should have realized it was a mistake right from the word go.</p><p>Abruptly I get to my feet, open my suitcases, and start throwing in my clothes. I\u2019ll spend the night here, then head back to London first thing in the morning. I can\u2019t waste any more time. I\u2019ve got a life to get back to. I\u2019ve got a husband.</p><p>At least... I think I\u2019ve got a husband.</p> <p>As my mind flashes back to the last time I saw Luke I feel a hollow dread in my stomach. He\u2019s probably still furious with me. He\u2019s probably having a terrible time in Cyprus and cursing me every moment. I hesitate halfway through folding up a jumper. Just the thought of going back and facing him makes me feel a bit sick. But then my chin stiffens and I throw the jumper into the case. So what if things with Luke are shaky? I don\u2019t need some crummy sister to help me save my marriage. I\u2019ll sort it out myself. Maybe I\u2019ll buy a book. There must be one called How to Save Your Year-Old Marriage.</p><p>I cram in all the souvenirs I bought at Jim\u2019s shop, sit on the lid of my lime green case, and snap it shut. That\u2019s it. The end.</p><p>Just then there\u2019s a knock. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Edie puts her head round the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a visitor,\u201d she says. \u201cDownstairs.\u201d</p><p>I feel an immediate flicker of hope.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I scramble to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m just coming!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take this opportunity to remind you of the rules.\u201d Edie\u2019s booming voice follows me as I run down the stairs. \u201cNo visitors after eleven o\u2019clock. If there\u2019s any carousing I\u2019ll have to call the authorities.\u201d</p><p>I jump down the last few steps and hurry into the little sitting room. \u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>I stop dead in my tracks. It\u2019s not Jess. It\u2019s Robin. And Jim. And a couple of other people from the meeting. I can see a few glances flying about.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky,\u201d says Robin, taking a step toward me. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. I\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. This is a pity visit. Maybe they\u2019re worried I\u2019m going to slash my wrists or something. As Robin takes breath to speak again, I cut in.</p><p>\u201cReally. Everybody. You don\u2019t need to worry about me. It\u2019s very sweet of you to be concerned. But I\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m just going to go to bed, and catch the train home tomorrow, and... just take it from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here,\u201d says Robin, ruffling his hair awkwardly. \u201cWe wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wondered... all of us... if you\u2019d help us with the protest.\u201d He looks about as though for support, and everyone nods.</p><p>\u201cHelp you?\u201d I stare back, bewildered. \u201cBut... I don\u2019t know anything about it. Jess was right.\u201d Even the memory is painful. \u201cI was making it all up. I don\u2019t even know about hedgehogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Robin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got loads of ideas, and that\u2019s what we need. You\u2019re right. We should think big. And Jim likes the idea of the party. Don\u2019t you, Jim?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf it gets folk into the shop before four o\u2019clock, it can\u2019t be bad,\u201d says Jim.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got experience with these kind of events,\u201d chimes in the white-haired man who challenged me at the meeting. \u201cYou know how to go about it. We don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you left the meeting we had a quick straw poll,\u201d says Robin. \u201cAnd it was practically unanimous. We\u2019d like to invite you onto the action committee. Everyone\u2019s waiting back at the hall, to hear.\u201d</p><p>All their faces are so warm and friendly, I feel tears pricking at my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I look away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t. There\u2019s no need for me to be in Scully anymore. I\u2019ve got to get back to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that, then?\u201d says Jim.</p><p>\u201cI have... things to do,\u201d I say. \u201cCommitments. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat commitments would they be?\u201d Jim says mildly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a job. Your husband\u2019s abroad. Your flat\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>This is why you shouldn\u2019t pour out your entire sob story to people you\u2019ve just met. I gaze at Edie\u2019s pink and purple swirly carpet, trying to get my thoughts straight. Then I raise my head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does Jess think about all this?\u201d</p><p>I look around the group, but no one replies. Robin won\u2019t quite meet my eyes. The white-haired man is gazing at the ceiling. Jim just has that same sad expression he had at the village hall.</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019s the only one who voted against me, isn\u2019t she?\u201d I try to smile, but my voice wobbles.</p><p>\u201cJess has... certain opinions,\u201d begins Robin. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t have to come into it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does! Of course she does! She\u2019s the whole reason I\u2019m here! Look, I\u2019m sorry. But I can\u2019t come on your committee. I hope your protest goes really well... but I can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>I can see Robin drawing breath to speak again.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I look directly at Jim. \u201cYou have to understand. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And I can see it in his eyes. He does understand.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he says at last. \u201cIt was worth a try.\u201d He nods at the others as though to say \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>They awkwardly murmur goodbyes and good lucks and file out of the little room. The front door bangs shut and I\u2019m left alone, feeling flatter than ever.</p><p>When I wake up the next morning the sky is dark and swollen with gray clouds. Edie serves me a full English breakfast complete with black pudding, but I manage only a cup of tea. I pay her with the rest of my cash, then head upstairs to get ready to leave. Out the window I can just see the hills in the distance, stretching into the mist.</p><p>I\u2019ll probably never see those hills again. Which is fine by me, I think defiantly. I hate the country. I never wanted to be here in the first place.</p><p>I put the last of my things in my red case, then decide to change into my turquoise kitten heels with diamant\u00e9 straps. They always make me feel cheerful. As I step into them I feel something small and nubby under my toes and reach down, puzzled. I pull out a small wrapped object and look at it in sudden realization.</p><p>It\u2019s the bean. It\u2019s the silver Tiffany bean necklace that I was going to give Jess, still in its little blue bag.</p> <p>God, that seems a lifetime ago.</p><p>I shove it into my pocket, then pick up my cases and stripy hatbox and head downstairs, passing the pay phone in the hall.</p><p>Maybe I should call Luke... But then, what\u2019s the point?</p><p>Edie\u2019s nowhere to be seen, so I just pull the door of the bed-and-breakfast closed behind me and trundle my cases across the green to the shop. I want to say goodbye to Jim before I leave.</p><p>As I push open the door with its familiar tinkle, Jim looks up from pricing cans of beans. He sees my suitcases and gives a resigned nod.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d Kelly says mournfully from behind the counter, where she has Julius Caesar propped up behind 100 Hot Hair Styles.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d I put my cases down. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got some more Stila stuff for you. A goodbye present.\u201d</p><p>As I hand her a selection of lip glosses and eye glazes, her face lights up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a present for you too, Becky,\u201d she says abruptly. She pulls a friendship bracelet off her wrist and hands it to me. \u201cSo you won\u2019t forget me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unable to speak. The simple plaited band in my hand is just like the bracelets Luke and I were given in the Masai Mara ceremony. Luke took his off when he went back to corporate life.</p><p>I\u2019ve still got mine on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s... fab.\u201d I rouse myself and smile. \u201cI\u2019ll always wear it.\u201d I slip it onto my wrist and give Kelly a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t going.\u201d Kelly\u2019s bottom lip sticks out. \u201cWill you ever come back to Scully?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But listen, if you ever come to London, give me a call. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Kelly brightens. \u201cCan we go to Topshop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I start saving now?\u201d Jim says ruefully, and we both start giggling.</p><p>A tinkle at the door interrupts us and we all look up to see Edie walking into the shop in her green head scarf, together with Lorna and the well-dressed lady from the night before. They\u2019re all looking exceedingly self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cEdie!\u201d says Jim, glancing at his watch in surprise. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Jim,\u201d says Edie, avoiding his eye. \u201cI\u2019d like some bread, please. A wholemeal and a bloomer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBread?\u201d says Jim, looking dumbfounded. \u201cBut Edie... it\u2019s ten o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the time, thank you,\u201d she retorts stiffly.</p><p>\u201cBut... it\u2019s full price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like some bread,\u201d she snaps. \u201cIs that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf... course not!\u201d says Jim, still looking dazed. He gets down the loaves and wraps them in paper. \u201cThat\u2019ll be... one pound ninety-six.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, and I can hear Edie breathe in sharply. Then she rummages in her bag for her purse and unclips it.</p> <p>\u201cTwo pounds,\u201d she says, handing over the coins. \u201cMuch obliged.\u201d</p><p>I do not believe it. Kelly and I just sit there, goggling in silence, as the other two women buy three loaves of bread and a bag of sandwich rolls between them. Lorna even throws in a couple of Chelsea buns at the last moment.</p><p>As the door closes behind them, Jim sinks down onto his stool.</p><p>\u201cWell. Who would have thought it?\u201d He shakes his head in wonder, then points at me. \u201cThat\u2019s you, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d I say, flushing a little. \u201cThey probably just needed bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you!\u201d says Kelly. \u201cIt was what you said! Mum told me all about the meeting,\u201d she adds. \u201cShe said you seemed a nice girl, even if you were a bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly,\u201d Jim puts in quickly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make Becky a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s OK. I\u2019m going.\u201d I hesitate, then reach into my pocket and pull out the little Tiffany bag. \u201cJim, I wanted to ask you a favor. Could you give this to Jess? It\u2019s something I bought for her a while ago. I know everything\u2019s different now... but still.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m heading up to her house just now, to take a delivery,\u201d says Jim. \u201cWhy not leave it there yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I shrink back. \u201cNo. I... I don\u2019t want to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be there. They\u2019ve all gone off for the endurance hike. I\u2019ve got a key to her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I hesitate.</p><p>\u201cI could do with the company,\u201d Jim adds with a shrug, and picks up a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I put the Tiffany bag back in my pocket. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>The clouds are growing thicker as we walk along the empty streets, and I can feel spots of rain on my face. I\u2019m aware of Jim shooting me the odd concerned glance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, back in London?\u201d he says eventually.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jim pauses, and transfers his potatoes to the other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says easily. \u201cHow did a nice girl like you end up with a marriage in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my own fault. I did some... stupid things. And my husband got really angry. He said... he said he wished I were more like Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Jim looks a bit taken aback. \u201cI mean, Jess is a fine lass,\u201d he hastily amends. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have... anyway, that\u2019s not here or there.\u201d He coughs and rubs his nose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I came up here. To learn from her. But it was a stupid idea.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve reached the end of Jess\u2019s street, and Jim pauses for a rest before climbing the steep incline. The gray stone houses are glistening in the drizzle, stark against the distant misty hills. I can just see a flock of sheep grazing high up, like dots of cotton wool on the green. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo bad about you and Jess,\u201d says Jim, and he does sound genuinely sorry. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d I try to keep the disappointment out of my voice. \u201cI should have known all along. We\u2019re so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different, all right.\u201d His face crinkles in amusement.</p><p>\u201cShe just seems so... cold.\u201d I hunch my shoulders, feeling a familiar resentment rising. \u201cYou know, I made every effort. I really did. But she never showed any pleasure... or feelings, even. She doesn\u2019t seem to care about anything! She doesn\u2019t seem to have any passions!\u201d</p> <p>Jim seems surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh... Jess has got passions,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s got passions, all right. When we get to the house, I\u2019ll show you something.\u201d</p><p>He picks up the sack of potatoes and we resume walking up the hill. As we get nearer Jess\u2019s house, I start to feel tiny prickles of curiosity. Not that she\u2019s anything to do with me anymore, but still.</p><p>As we reach the door, Jim roots in his pocket for a large key ring, selects a Yale key, and unlocks it. I walk into the hall and look around. But the place doesn\u2019t give much away. It\u2019s a bit like Jess herself. Two tidy sofas in the sitting room. A plain white kitchen. A couple of well-tended potted plants.</p><p>I head upstairs and cautiously push open the door to her bedroom. It\u2019s immaculate. Plain cotton duvet cover, plain cotton curtains, a couple of boring prints.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d Jim is behind me. \u201cYou want to see Jess\u2019s real passion? Take a look at this.\u201d</p><p>He heads over to a door set into the wall of the landing, then turns the key and beckons me over.</p><p>\u201cHere are the famous rocks,\u201d he says, swinging the door open. \u201cShe had this cupboard made especially to house them. Designed it herself down to the last detail, lights and all. Makes an impressive sight, don\u2019t you think...\u201d He trails off in surprise at my face. \u201cBecky? Are you OK, love?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>It\u2019s my shoe cupboard.</p><p>It\u2019s my shoe cupboard, exactly. The same doors. The same shelves. The same lights. Except instead of shoes displayed on the shelves, there are rocks. Rows and rows of carefully labeled rocks.</p> <p>And... they\u2019re beautiful. Some are gray, some crystal, some smooth, some iridescent and sparkling. There are fossils... amethysts... chunks of jet, all shiny under the lights...</p><p>\u201cI had no idea... They\u2019re stunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about passion?\u201d Jim laughs. \u201cThis is a true passion. An obsession, you might say.\u201d He picks up a speckled gray rock and turns it over in his fingers. \u201cYou know how she got that leg injury of hers? Clambering after some blasted rock on a mountain somewhere. She was that determined to get it, she\u2019d risk her own safety.\u201d Jim grins at my expression. \u201cThen there was the time she was arrested at Customs, for smuggling some precious crystal in under her jumper... \u201d</p><p>I gape at him.</p><p>\u201cJess? Arrested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey let her off.\u201d He waves a hand. \u201cBut I know she\u2019d do it again. If there\u2019s a particular kind of rock that girl wants, she has to have it.\u201d He wrinkles his brow in amusement. \u201cShe gets a compulsion. It\u2019s like a mania! Nothing\u2019ll stop her!\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning. I\u2019m staring at a row of rocks, all different shades of red. Just like my row of red shoes.</p><p>\u201cShe keeps all this pretty quiet.\u201d Jim puts down the speckled rock. \u201cI guess she thinks people wouldn\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d I cut him off in a shaky voice. \u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trembling all over. She\u2019s my sister.</p><p>Jess is my sister. I know it more certainly than I\u2019ve ever known anything.</p><p>I have to find her. I have to tell her. Now.</p><p>\u201cJim...\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI need to find Jess. Right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing the sponsored endurance hike,\u201d Jim reminds me. \u201cStarts in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have to go,\u201d I say in agitation. \u201cI have to see her. How do I get there? Can I walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fair way away,\u201d Jim says, and cocks his head quizzically. \u201cDo you want a lift?\u201d</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>I KNEW WE were sisters. I knew it. I knew it.</p><p>And we\u2019re not just sisters \u2014 we\u2019re kindred spirits! After all those false starts. After all those misunderstandings. After I thought I would never have one single thing in common with her, ever.</p><p>She\u2019s the same as me. I understand her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I understand Jess!</p><p>Everything Jim said chimed a chord. Everything! How many times have I smuggled pairs of shoes in from America? How many times have I risked my own safety at the sales? I even got a leg injury, just like her! It was when I saw someone heading for the last reduced Orla Kiely purse in Selfridges, and I leapt off the escalator from about eight steps up.</p><p>God, if I\u2019d just seen her rock cupboard earlier. If I\u2019d known. Everything would have been different! Why didn\u2019t she tell me? Why didn\u2019t she explain?</p><p>Abruptly I have a memory of Jess talking about rocks on our first-ever meeting... and again at the flat. And I feel ashamed. She did try. I just didn\u2019t listen, did I? I didn\u2019t believe her when she said they were interesting. I said rocks were... stupid. And boring. Just like her.</p> <p>\u201cCan we go any faster?\u201d I say to Jim. We\u2019re rattling along in his ancient Land Rover, past grassy slopes and drystone walls, heading higher and higher into the hills.</p><p>\u201cGoing as fast as we can,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in time, easy.\u201d</p><p>Sheep are scattering off the road as we thunder along, and small stones are hitting the windscreen. I glance out the window \u2014 and quickly look away. Not that I\u2019m afraid of heights or anything, but we seem to be approximately three inches away from a steep drop.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d says Jim, pulling into a small parking area, with a crunch of gravel. \u201cThis is where they\u2019re starting. And that\u2019s where they\u2019re climbing.\u201d He points to the steep mountain looming above us. \u201cThe famous Scully Pike.\u201d His phone rings, and he reaches for it. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Thanks!\u201d I say, and wrench open the door. I get out and look around \u2014 and just for a moment I\u2019m floored by the scenery.</p> <p>Craggy rocks and peaks are all around, interspersed with patches of grass and crevasses, and all are overshadowed by the mountain \u2014 a stark, jagged outline against the gray sky. As I peer across the valley, I feel a sudden swooping, a bit like vertigo, I suppose. I honestly hadn\u2019t realized quite how high up we are. There\u2019s a little cluster of houses visible far below, which I guess is Scully, but apart from that, we could be in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Well, come to think of it, we are in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>I hurry across the gravel to a small level patch where a table has been set up, with a banner reading SCULLY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP ENDURANCE HIKE, REGISTRATION. Behind the table two yellow flags mark the foot of a path leading up the mountain. A man I don\u2019t recognize is sitting at the table in an anorak and flat cap. But apart from that, the place is empty.</p><p>Where is everybody? God, no wonder they don\u2019t have any money, if no one turns up for the sponsored walks.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say to the man in the anorak. \u201cDo you know where Jess Bertram is? She\u2019s one of the walkers. I really need to speak to her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m totally wound up with anticipation. I cannot wait to tell her! I cannot wait to see her face!</p> <p>\u201cToo late, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d the man says, and gestures up the mountain. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. They\u2019ve all gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready? But... the hike starts at eleven. It\u2019s only five to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started at half past ten,\u201d corrects the man. \u201cWe brought it forward because of the poor weather. You\u2019ll have to wait. It\u2019ll only be a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I subside in disappointment and turn away. \u201cAll right. Thanks.\u201d It\u2019ll be OK. I can wait. I can be patient. It\u2019s not that long, really, a few hours.</p><p>Yes, it is. A few hours is ages. I want to tell her now. I gaze up at the mountain in frustration, only to spot a couple in matching red anoraks, a few hundred yards up. They\u2019ve got bibs with SCULLY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP on them. They\u2019re part of the hike. And look, a little beyond them, there\u2019s a man in blue.</p><p>My mind is working quickly. They haven\u2019t got that far. Which means Jess hasn\u2019t got that far either. Which means... I could catch up with her. Yes!</p><p>This kind of news can\u2019t wait a few hours. I mean, we\u2019re sisters. We\u2019re real, genuine sisters! I have to tell her immediately.</p><p>I hoist my Angel bag firmly on my shoulder, hurry to the start of the steep mountain path, and look up at it. I can climb this. Easy. There are rocks to hold on to and everything. I take a few tentative steps \u2014 and it\u2019s not hard at all.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d The man in the anorak stands up in agitation. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joining the hike. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll sponsor myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t join the hike! What about your shoes!\u201d He points at my turquoise kitten heels in horror. \u201cDo you have a cagoule?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA cagoule?\u201d I pull a face. \u201cDo I look like someone who would have a cagoule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a stick,\u201d I explain. \u201cI\u2019m not old.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. It\u2019s only walking up a hill. What\u2019s the fuss?</p> <p>Just to prove it to him, I start clambering up the path in earnest. The ground is a bit slimy with drizzle, but I stick my kitten heels into the mud as hard as I can and grab on to the rocks lining the path \u2014 and in about two minutes I\u2019m already past the first bend.</p><p>I\u2019m already breathing hard, and my calves are hurting, but apart from that, I\u2019m doing great! God, it just shows, climbing really isn\u2019t that hard. I reach another bend, and look back in satisfaction. I\u2019m practically halfway up the mountain already!</p><p>This is so easy. I always knew people who went hiking were showing off about nothing.</p><p>Down below, I can faintly hear Jim yelling, \u201cBecky! Come back!\u201d But I close my ears and resolutely keep on, one foot after another. I need to hurry if I\u2019m going to catch up with Jess.</p><p>Except she must be a pretty speedy walker. Because after about an hour of steady climbing, I still haven\u2019t caught up with her. In fact, I haven\u2019t caught up with any of them. I kept the red couple in sight for a while, but somehow they seem to have disappeared. The man in blue has vanished too. And I haven\u2019t even clapped eyes on Jess.</p> <p>Which is probably because she\u2019s run the whole way up, I think a bit disconsolately. She\u2019s probably doing twenty one-handed press-ups at the top, because climbing a mountain isn\u2019t strenuous enough. God, it isn\u2019t fair. You\u2019d think I might have got some of the superfit genes too.</p><p>I take a few more steps forward and stop for a breather, wincing at the sight of my mud-spattered legs. My face is hot and I\u2019m panting, so I get out my Evian facial spray and spritz myself. It\u2019s getting fairly steep up here. Not that it\u2019s hard or anything. In fact, I\u2019m really enjoying myself. Apart from the blister on my right foot, which is getting a bit painful. Maybe that guy had a point \u2014 these aren\u2019t the best shoes in the world for climbing. Although, on the plus side, the heels are really good for slippery bits.</p><p>I look around the empty, rugged mountainside. About three feet away is a rocky ledge, and beyond that a sheer drop down into a valley. Which I\u2019m not going to look at. Or think about.</p><p>I put the Evian spritzer away and look around, a bit uncertainly. I have no idea how much farther there is to go. I\u2019d kind of counted on catching up with the other walkers and finding out from them. I squint ahead, trying to spot a brightly colored anorak, but the air is hazy with mist.</p><p>Oh God. Maybe it\u2019s going to rain. And I don\u2019t even have a cardigan.</p><p>Suddenly I feel a bit stupid. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have rushed up here. Maybe I should go down. Cautiously I take a step backwards... but the ground is more slippery than I expected.</p> <p>\u201cShiiit!\u201d I grab on to a sharp rock to stop myself slithering toward the rocky ledge. There\u2019s a blinding pain in my arm \u2014 I must have wrenched a muscle \u2014 but somehow I haul myself back up.</p><p>OK, I\u2019m not going back down now. Anyway, it\u2019s probably farther to go back down than carry on. I\u2019ll keep on following the path. It\u2019ll be fine. If I just speed up a bit I\u2019m bound to reach Jess. It\u2019ll be worth it just to see her face. She won\u2019t believe her eyes. Then I\u2019ll tell her \u2014 and she won\u2019t believe her ears! She\u2019ll be totally, utterly gobsmacked! I hug the thought to myself happily for a few moments, then, with a fresh surge of energy, keep on climbing.</p><p>I\u2019m knackered. I can\u2019t keep going any longer.</p><p>My knees ache, my hands are sore, and my feet are covered in blisters. I\u2019ve been trudging for what seems like hours, but this bloody mountain goes on forever. Every time I think I must have got to the top, I see another peak rising up in front of me.</p><p>Where\u2019s Jess? Where is everybody? They can\u2019t all be quicker than me.</p><p>I stop for a few moments to catch my breath, holding on to a large boulder for balance. The view over the valley is as stunning as ever, with purple and gray clouds rolling across the sky, and a single bird soaring high above me. Maybe it\u2019s an eagle or something. To be honest, I don\u2019t care. I just want to sit down with a cup of tea. That\u2019s all I want in the world.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. I have to continue. Come on. This is what they mean by endurance.</p><p>With a huge effort I let go of the boulder and start climbing again. Left, right. Left, right. Maybe I\u2019ll try singing, like the Von Trapps. Yes. That\u2019ll cheer me on.</p> <p>\u201c \u2018High on a hill...\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. Forget the singing.</p><p>Oh God.

My legs are covered in mud, my shoes are unidentifiable, I\u2019ve gashed my knee and torn my skirt, and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m supposed to go next.</p><p>I stumble over a cluster of rocks and grab on to a bush for support, wincing as it pricks me. OK. I\u2019ve got to stop for a rest. I sit down on a flat stone and fumble for the Evian facial mister.</p> <p>I\u2019m desperate for a drink. I spray the very last drops of Evian into my mouth, until it\u2019s all gone. I wipe my face with a tissue from my bag and look around the empty mountainside. There is no one in sight. No one.</p><p>What am I going to do?</p><p>Deep down I feel a spasm of fear, which I ignore. It\u2019ll be fine. The important thing is to think positive. I\u2019ll just keep climbing. I can do it!</p><p>No, I can\u2019t, comes a small voice inside.</p><p>Stop it. Think positive. I can do anything I set my mind to.</p> <p>My legs are all shaky, but somehow I force myself to my feet, wincing in pain as my shoes dig into my blisters again. Right. Just keep going. I\u2019ll get to the top \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s where the welcoming party is. And those hot drinks they were talking about. Yes. It\u2019ll be fine\u2014</p><p>Suddenly there\u2019s a distant rumble of thunder. Oh God. Please, no. I look up, and the sky has darkened to a menacing gray.</p><p>A raindrop hits me in the eye. Then another.</p><p>I swallow, trying to stay calm. But inside I\u2019m a mush of panic. What do I do now? Do I keep going up? Do I go down?</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I call out. \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d My voice echoes round the rocks, but there\u2019s no reply.</p><p>More raindrops land on my head.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have anything waterproof. I look around the stark landscape, hollow with fear. What if I can\u2019t get down? What if I\u2019m stuck up here in a storm? I was so desperate to tell Jess we were sisters. Now I just feel like a fool. I should have waited. Luke\u2019s right. Why can\u2019t I wait for anything in life? It\u2019s all my own fault.</p><p>There\u2019s another distant rumble of thunder, and I flinch in fright. What if I get struck by lightning? I don\u2019t even know what the rules are for being outside in a storm. It\u2019s something like Stand under a tree. Or maybe Don\u2019t stand under a tree. But which? What if I get it wrong?</p><p>Suddenly, through my agitation, I\u2019m aware of a kind of chirping noise. Is it... an animal?</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Oh my God. It\u2019s my mobile. There\u2019s a signal up here! There\u2019s a bloody signal!</p><p>With shaking fingers I unzip my Angel bag and grab my flashing mobile. Weak with relief, I see the word luke on the little display. I jab frantically at the green button.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky? Is anyone there?\u201d The line is crackling, and he sounds all fuzzy and distant.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I shout, as raindrops start falling harder on my head. \u201cLuke, it\u2019s me! I\u2019m lost! I need help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d comes his puzzled voice again. \u201cCan anyone hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I can hear you! I\u2019m here!\u201d With no warning, tears start streaming down my face. \u201cI\u2019m stuck on this awful mountain and I don\u2019t know what to do.

I have to find some kind of shelter.</p><p>About six feet above me is a kind of ledge sticking out, with a cluster of rocks on top. One of them has an overhanging bit which maybe I can crouch under.

Mrs Brandon (n\u00e9e Bloomwood) disappeared on Thursday from the luxury flat she shares with husband Luke Brandon and has not been seen or heard from since. The alarm was raised by Mrs Brandon\u2019s friend Susan Cleath-Stuart, who arrived in London for a surprise visit.</p> <p>SHOPPING</p><p>CCTV footage shows Mrs Brandon in local shop Anna\u2019s Delicatessen, shortly before her disappearance, apparently agitated. \u201cShe just dropped her shopping and left,\u201d said shop assistant Marie Fuller. \u201cShe didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201d</p><p>CHAOS</p><p>There were scenes of chaos aboard the Mind Body Spirit cruise ship currently touring the Mediterranean as Mrs Brandon\u2019s parents, Graham and Jane Bloomwood, insisted the boat be turned around. \u201cYou can stuff bloody tranquility!\u201d a hysterical Mrs Bloomwood was reported as shouting. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s missing!\u201d</p><p>STORMS</p><p>Meanwhile, storms have prevented Mrs Brandon\u2019s husband, Luke Brandon, from leaving Cyprus, where he has been working. He was said yesterday to be \u201cdesperately worried\u201d and in close contact with police. His business associate, Nathan Temple, has issued a reward for information leading to the recovery of Mrs Brandon. He commented yesterday, \u201cIf anyone harms a hair of that young lady\u2019s head I will personally break all their bones. Twice.\u201d Mr Temple was convicted in 1984 for grievous bodily harm.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>OW.</p><p>Ouuuch.</p><p>God, my head is in agony. Oww.

I\u2019m on the ground. I... think. To be honest, I can\u2019t quite work out where I am. I peer at the bright blue background, but it still makes zero sense.

Now, that is just so clever. Why don\u2019t I take a tent everywhere? I\u2019ll start tomorrow. Yes. A little tiny tent that I could keep in my handbag.</p><p>The only thing is, it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable here on the ground. Maybe I\u2019ll get up and stretch my legs.

She produces a length of bandage-type stuff and starts winding it expertly round my ankle. \u201cBecky, what the hell were you doing up there, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... I came to find you.\u201d Bits of the jigsaw are reappearing in my brain. \u201cI was doing the sponsored endurance hike.\u201d</p><p>Jess looks gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cBut this wasn\u2019t the hike route! I went off the trail. The hike route was much lower. Didn\u2019t you follow the markers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarkers?\u201d I look at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cGod, you have no bloody idea about hiking, do you?\u201d she says in agitation. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been up there! It\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why were you there?\u201d I retort, wincing as she bandages me more and more tightly. \u201cWhat you were doing looked pretty dangerous to me.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s face closes up.</p><p>Eventually she says, \u201cLast time I climbed the Pike I saw some ammonite specimens. I wanted to collect one. It\u2019s a bit foolhardy, but I don\u2019t expect you to understand\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! I do understand!\u201d I interrupt, and struggle onto my elbows. I have to tell her.</p><p>\u201cJess, I understand. I\u2019ve seen your rocks. They\u2019re fantastic. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d she says, looking worried. \u201cTake it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take it easy! Jess, listen. We\u2019re sisters. We\u2019re honestly and truly sisters. That\u2019s why I came up the mountain. I had to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Jess frowns. \u201cBecky, you\u2019ve had a bump on the head... you\u2019ve probably got a concussion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that!\u201d The louder my voice rises the more my head throbs, but I can\u2019t stop myself. \u201cI know we have the same blood. I know it! I went to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Jess looks appalled. \u201cWho let you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim. I saw your rock cupboard. It\u2019s identical to my shoe cupboard in London. Identical. The lights... the shelves... everything!\u201d</p><p>For the first time ever, I see Jess\u2019s composure slip a little.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d she says in brusque tones.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re the same!\u201d I sit up eagerly, ignoring the swirling in front of my eyes. \u201cJess, you know the way you feel about a really amazing rock? That\u2019s the way I feel about a great pair of shoes! Or a dress. I have to have it. Nothing else matters. And I know you feel the same way about your rock collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she says, turning away.</p><p>\u201cYou do! I know you do!\u201d I clutch her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re just as obsessed as me! You just hide it better! Oh God, my head. Ow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I collapse back down, my head pounding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a painkiller,\u201d Jess says distractedly \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t move. She\u2019s just standing there, lost in her own thoughts.</p><p>I can see I\u2019ve got to her.</p><p>\u201cYou came up a mountain in a storm just to tell me this?\u201d Jess says at last.</p> <p>\u201cYes! Of course!\u201d</p><p>She turns her head to look at me. Her face is paler than ever and kind of wary, as though someone\u2019s trying to trick her.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... because it\u2019s important! It matters to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever done anything like that for me before,\u201d she says, and immediately looks away, fiddling in the tin again. \u201cThose cuts need antiseptic on them.\u201d</p> <p>She starts dabbing my legs with a cotton-wool pad, and I try not to flinch as the antiseptic stings my raw flesh.</p><p>\u201cSo... do you believe me?\u201d I say. \u201cDo you believe we\u2019re sisters?\u201d</p><p>For a few moments Jess just focuses on her feet, which are encased in thick socks and brown hiking boots. She raises her head and surveys my turquoise diamant\u00e9 kitten heels, all scraped and covered in mud. My Marc Jacobs skirt. My ruined glittery T-shirt. Then she lifts her eyes to my bruised, battered face, and we just look at each other.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>Three extra-strong painkillers later, and I\u2019m really feeling quite a lot better. In fact, I can\u2019t stop gabbling.</p><p>\u201cI knew we were sisters,\u201d I\u2019m saying, as Jess puts a plaster on my gashed knee. \u201cI knew it! I think I\u2019m a bit psychic, actually. I felt your presence on the mountain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d says Jess, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other thing is, I\u2019m getting quite similar to you. Like I was thinking I might crop my hair short. It would really suit me. And I\u2019ve started taking a real interest in rocks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d interrupts Jess. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look at her uncertainly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re sisters.\u201d She sits back on her heels. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we both have to have cropped hair. Or like rocks.\u201d She reaches for another plaster and rips it open.</p><p>\u201cOr potatoes,\u201d I add before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cOr potatoes,\u201d agrees Jess. She pauses. \u201cOr... overpriced designer lipsticks that go out of fashion in three weeks.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a little glint in her eyes as she looks at me, and I gape in astonishment. Jess is teasing me?</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d I say, trying to stay nonchalant. \u201cJust because we\u2019re biologically related, it doesn\u2019t mean we both have to like boring workouts with water bottles instead of cool weights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Or... mindless magazines full of ridiculous ads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr drinking coffee out of a horrible old flask.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s mouth is twitching.</p><p>\u201cOr stupid rip-off cappuccinos.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a clap of thunder, and we both jump in fright. Rain is beating on the tent like drumsticks. Jess puts a final plaster on my legs and shuts the little tin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you brought anything to eat?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cEr... no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some, but it isn\u2019t much.\u201d Her brow wrinkles. \u201cNot if we\u2019re stuck here for hours. We won\u2019t be able to move, even when the storm\u2019s died down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you forage on the mountainside for roots and berries?\u201d I say hopefully.</p><p>Jess gives me a look.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m not Tarzan.\u201d She hunches her shoulders and wraps her arms round her legs. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to sit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... you don\u2019t take a mobile when you go climbing?\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t usually need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t usually have a stupid injured sister with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot normally, no.\u201d She shifts on the groundsheet and reaches behind her. \u201cI picked up some of your stuff, by the way. It got scattered when you fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, taking the handful of things from her. A mini hairspray. My manicure set. A compact.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find your bag, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d adds Jess. \u201cGod knows where it went.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops.</p><p>My Angel bag.</p><p>My two-thousand-euro movie-star bag. The bag that everyone in the world is clamoring for. After all that, it\u2019s gone. Lost on a mountain in the middle of nowhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Somehow I force myself to smile. \u201cThese things happen.\u201d</p><p>With sore, stiff fingers I open my compact \u2014 and amazingly, the mirror\u2019s still intact. Cautiously I take a look at myself and recoil. I look like a beaten-up scarecrow. My hair is everywhere, and both my cheeks are grazed, and there\u2019s a huge lump on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I snap the compact shut.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stay here until the storm dies down,\u201d says Jess.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I mean... what shall we do? While we wait in the tent.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s expression is unreadable.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could watch When Harry Met Sally and eat popcorn,\u201d she says.</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling. Jess does actually have a sense of humor. Underneath it all.</p><p>\u201cShall I do your nails?\u201d I suggest. \u201cI\u2019ve got my stuff here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo my nails?\u201d says Jess. \u201cBecky... you realize we\u2019re on a mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point! It\u2019s extra-tough lacquer that lasts whatever you do. Look at this!\u201d I show her the bottle of nail polish. \u201cThe model\u2019s actually climbing a mountain in the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d says Jess, taking the bottle from me and peering at it. \u201cAnd people fall for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on! What else are we going to do?\u201d I pause innocently. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got anything fun to do, like our accounts... \u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s eyes flash at me.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she says. \u201cYou win. Do my nails.\u201d</p> <p>While the storm rages around us, we paint each other\u2019s nails a bright sparkly pink.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I say in admiration as Jess finishes my left hand. \u201cYou could be a manicurist!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says dryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve made my day.\u201d</p><p>I wave my fingers in the torchlight, then get out my compact to admire my reflection.</p><p>\u201cYou need to learn to put one finger thoughtfully to your mouth,\u201d I explain, demonstrating. \u201cIt\u2019s the same when you get a new ring or bracelet. Just to let people see.\u201d I offer her the mirror, but she turns away, her face closing up.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I put away the compact, thinking hard. I want to ask her why she hates mirrors. But I have to put it tactfully.</p><p>\u201cJess...\u201d I say at last.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you hate mirrors?\u201d</p><p>The only sound is the whistling of the wind. At last Jess lifts her head.</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose because every time I looked into a mirror when I was young, my dad told me not to be vain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVain?\u201d I look at her, wide-eyed. \u201cWhat, every time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time.\u201d She shrugs, then sees my face. \u201cWhy? What did yours say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents used to say...\u201d Now I\u2019m a bit embarrassed. \u201cThey used to say I was the most beautiful little angel who had ever fallen down from heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Jess hunches her shoulders as though to say \u201cGo figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re right,\u201d I say suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ve been spoiled. My parents have always given me everything. I\u2019ve never had to stand on my own two feet. Ever. I\u2019ve always had people there for me. Mum and Dad... then Suze... then Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to stand on my feet right from the word go,\u201d says Jess. Her face is in the torch\u2019s shadow, and I can\u2019t make out her expression.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds quite... tough, your dad,\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cDad never really expressed emotion,\u201d she says at last. \u201cNever really told you when he was proud. He felt it,\u201d she adds vehemently. \u201cBut in our family we don\u2019t go blabbing about everything, the way you do.\u201d</p><p>A sudden gust of wind loosens up a corner of the tent, blowing in a flurry of rain. Jess grabs the flap and reaches for a metal pin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the same,\u201d she says, banging the metal pin into the ground with a rock. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t say things doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel them.\u201d She looks round and meets my eyes with a visible effort. \u201cBecky, when I came to visit your flat, I didn\u2019t mean to be unfriendly. Or... cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have called you that,\u201d I say in a flood of remorse. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jess interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I could have made more effort. I could have joined in.\u201d She puts the rock down on the ground and gazes at it for a few seconds. \u201cTo be honest, I was a bit... unnerved by you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuke said you might find me overwhelming,\u201d I say ruefully, and rub my head, which has started to throb again.</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep,\u201d Jess says, watching me. \u201cIt\u2019s the best healer. And the best painkiller. Here\u2019s a blanket.\u201d She gives me a sheet of something that looks like tinfoil.</p><p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d I say doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>I put my head down in the least uncomfortable place I can find, and close my eyes.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t sleep.

And my neck\u2019s all cricked... and there\u2019s a stone in my back...</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you OK?\u201d says Jess.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I admit, my voice all thick and wobbly. \u201cI can\u2019t get to sleep.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no reply, and I think Jess can\u2019t have heard, or doesn\u2019t have anything to say. But a moment later I feel something next to me. I turn round, and she\u2019s offering me a small white slab.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not peppermint creams,\u201d she says flatly.</p><p>\u201cWh-What is it?\u201d I falter.</p><p>\u201cKendal Mint Cake. Traditional climbing food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, and take a bite. It has a weird, sweet taste, and I\u2019m not that keen, but I take a second bite, to show willingness. Then, to my horror, I feel tears starting up again.</p> <p>Jess sighs, and takes a bite of Kendal Mint Cake herself. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke will never love me again,\u201d I sob.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d My nose is running and I wipe it with my hand. \u201cEver since we got back from our trip, it\u2019s been a disaster. And it\u2019s all my fault, I\u2019ve ruined everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all your fault,\u201d interrupts Jess.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gape at her.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was all your fault,\u201d she says calmly. \u201cIt takes two.\u201d She folds up the Kendal Mint Cake wrapper, then unzips her backpack and slips it in. \u201cI mean, talk about obsessed. Luke\u2019s totally obsessed by work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he is. But I thought he\u2019d changed. On our honeymoon he was totally laid-back. Everything was perfect. I was so happy.\u201d</p> <p>Into my mind slips a memory of Luke and me, all brown and carefree. Holding hands. Doing yoga together. Sitting on the terrace in Sri Lanka, planning our surprise return. I had such high hopes. And nothing worked out the way I thought it would.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be on honeymoon forever,\u201d points out Jess. \u201cIt was bound to be a bit of a crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was so looking forward to being married,\u201d I say with a gulp. \u201cI had this image: we were all going to be sitting round the big wooden table in candlelight. Me, Luke, Suze... Tarquin... everyone happy and laughing... \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d Jess gives me a shrewd look. \u201cWhat happened to Suze? Your mum told me she was your best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. But while I was away she... found someone else.\u201d I focus on the flapping blue canvas, feeling a lump in my throat. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got new friends and new jobs and they\u2019re not interested anymore. I... haven\u2019t got any friends.\u201d</p><p>Jess zips up her backpack and pulls the drawstring tight. Then she looks up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even like me,\u201d I say dolefully.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m your sister,\u201d says Jess. \u201cI\u2019ve got to put up with you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I raise my head, and there\u2019s a glimmer of humor in her eyes. And warmth. A warmth I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen before.</p><p>After a pause, I say, \u201cYou know, Luke wants me to be just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! He wants me to be thrifty and frugal.\u201d I put the rest of my Kendal Mint Cake down behind a rock, hoping Jess won\u2019t notice. \u201cWill you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach you. To be frugal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Please.\u201d</p><p>Jess rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor a start, if you\u2019re going to be frugal, you won\u2019t throw away a perfectly good piece of Kendal Mint Cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d A bit shamefaced, I pick it up and take a bite. \u201cEr... yummy!\u201d</p><p>The wind is whistling with even more force, and the tent is flapping faster and faster. I pull Jess\u2019s tinfoil blanket around me tighter, wishing for the millionth time I\u2019d brought a cardigan. Or even a cagoule. Then all of a sudden I remember something. I reach into the pocket of my skirt \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe it. The little lump is still there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJess... this is for you,\u201d I say, pulling it out. \u201cI came to your house to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>I hand Jess the little blue bag.

You know, Jess\u2014\u201d</p><p>But whatever I was about to say is drowned out by the howling wind, as, with no warning, the gale whips up one entire side of the tent.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I shriek, as drenching rain lands in my face. \u201cOh my God! The tent! Get it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Jess is hauling the flapping canvas down again and desperately trying to anchor it, but with another huge gust it blows right out of her grasp. It billows like a sailing ship, then disappears down the mountainside.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d I have to shout just to be heard above the noise.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d She rubs rain off her face. \u201cOK. We have to find shelter. Can you get up?\u201d</p><p>She helps me to my feet, and I can\u2019t help crying out. My ankle is total agony.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make for those rocks,\u201d Jess says, gesturing through the rain. \u201cLean on me.\u201d</p><p>The pair of us start half limping, half shuffling up the muddy slope, gradually getting into an odd kind of rhythm. I\u2019m gritting my teeth against the pain, willing myself not to make a fuss.</p><p>\u201cWill anyone come to rescue us?\u201d I manage between steps.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely. We haven\u2019t been out long enough.\u201d Jess pauses. \u201cOK. You need to get up this steep bit. Hold on to me.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I make it up the rocky incline, aware of Jess\u2019s strong grip holding me up. God, she\u2019s in good condition. She could easily have climbed down out of the rain, it occurs to me. She could be safe and warm at home now.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for helping me,\u201d I say gruffly, as we start on our shuffle again. \u201cThanks for staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019S OK,\u201d she says, without missing a beat.</p><p>The rain is billowing into my face, almost choking me. My head is starting to whirl again, and my ankle is excruciating. But I have to keep going. I can\u2019t let Jess down.</p><p>Suddenly I hear a noise through the rain. But I must be imagining it. Or it\u2019s the wind. It can\u2019t be real...</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Jess stiffens. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>We both listen. It is. It\u2019s real.</p><p>The real chopper-chopper sound of a helicopter.</p><p>I look up \u2014 and lights are dimly approaching through the sleeting rain.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d I scream, and wave my arms frantically. \u201cHere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Jess yells, and thrusts her torch beam up, moving it about in the gloom. \u201cWe\u2019re here! Help!\u201d</p><p>The helicopter hovers above us for a few moments, then, to my dismay, it moves on.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t... they see us?\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jess looks taut and anxious. \u201cHard to tell. They wouldn\u2019t land here anyway. They\u2019d land on the ridge at the top and come down by foot.\u201d</p><p>We both stand motionless for a moment, but the helicopter doesn\u2019t return.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Jess at last. \u201cLet\u2019s keep going. At least the rocks will shelter us from the wind.\u201d</p><p>We start moving again, as before. But this time all my drive seems to have gone. I just feel exhausted. I\u2019m drenched, and cold, and I have absolutely no reserves of energy left. We\u2019re inching up the slope with a painful slowness, heads together, arms locked around each other, both panting and gasping as rain hits us in the face.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I stop still. \u201cI can hear something.\u201d I clutch Jess, craning my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off as a dim light flashes through the rain.

That sounded just like\u2014</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d comes the voice again. \u201cBex, where are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuze?\u201d</p><p>As I stare upward, a figure appears at the edge of the ridge, wearing an ancient Barbour. Her hair is plastered down on her head with the rain, and she\u2019s flashing a torch about, shielding her eyes and looking around, her brow creased in anxiety.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d she screams. \u201cBex! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>I have to be hallucinating. It\u2019s like a mirage. I\u2019m looking at a tree waving in the wind, and thinking it\u2019s Suze.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Her eyes have lighted on us. \u201cOh my God! Bex!\u201d She shouts over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ve found her! Over here!\u201d She starts scrambling down the ridge toward us, sending rocks flying. \u201cBex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her?\u201d says Jess, looking bewildered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Suze.\u201d I swallow. \u201cIt\u2019s... my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Something hard is blocking my throat. Suze came to find me. She came all this way to find me.</p> <p>\u201cBex! Thank God!\u201d Suze arrives in a final flurry of stones and earth, her face all mud-stained, her blue eyes huge with concern. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019re hurt. I knew it. I knew it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d I manage. \u201cExcept my ankle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here, but she\u2019s injured!\u201d she says into her mobile, and listens for a moment. \u201cTarkie\u2019s coming down with a stretcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarquin?\u201d My head is too dazed to take this all in. \u201cTarquin\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his friend from the RAF. The stupid mountain rescue team said it was too early. But I knew you were in trouble. I knew we had to come. I was so worried.\u201d Suze\u2019s face suddenly crumples. \u201cOh God. I was so worried. No one knew where you were... You just disappeared. We all thought... We didn\u2019t know what to think... We were trying to track your mobile signal, but there wasn\u2019t one... then suddenly it appeared... And now here you are, all... all beaten up.\u201d She looks on the verge of tears. \u201cBex, I\u2019m so sorry I never called back. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She flings her arms tightly round me. And for a few moments we just stand there, clinging to each other, the rain lashing down on us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say at last, gulping. \u201cReally. I fell down the mountain. But I was with my sister. She took care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister.\u201d Suze loosens her grip and slowly turns to Jess, who\u2019s standing, watching awkwardly, her hands stuffed in her pockets.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jess,\u201d I say. \u201cJess... this is Suze.\u201d</p><p>The two look at each other through the driving rain. I can\u2019t tell what each of them is thinking.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky\u2019s sister,\u201d Suze says at last, and holds out her hand.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky\u2019s best friend,\u201d Jess replies, and takes it.</p><p>There\u2019s a crashing sound, and we all look up to see Tarquin making his way toward us down the slope, in some amazingly cool-looking army gear, including a hat with a headlamp on it.</p><p>\u201cTarquin,\u201d I say. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy\u2019s coming down with the fold-up stretcher,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cNasty fright you gave us all, Becky.\u201d Into his mobile phone he says, \u201cLuke? We\u2019ve found her.\u201d</p><p>The mountain seems to wobble. Suze quickly sticks out an arm for me to lean on.</p><p>Luke?</p><p>\u201cHow come...\u201d My lips are suddenly trembling so much I can hardly form the words. \u201cHow come Luke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stuck in Cyprus because of bad weather,\u201d says Suze, \u201cbut he\u2019s been on the other end of the line the whole time. God, he\u2019s been in a state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you are, Becky,\u201d Tarquin says, holding out the phone to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I almost can\u2019t take it.

He\u2019s not angry with you.\u201d</p> <p>I lift the phone up to my ear, wincing slightly as it presses on my bruised face.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Becky. Thank Christ.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s all distant and crackly and I can hardly make him out. But as soon as I hear his familiar voice, it\u2019s like the whole of the last few days comes to a head. Something is welling up inside me. My eyes are hot and my throat feels choked.</p><p>I want him. I want him, and I want to go home.</p> <p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re safe.\u201d Luke sounds more overwrought than I\u2019ve ever heard him. \u201cI was out of my mind... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say with a gulp. \u201cI\u2019m sorry... \u201d Tears are spilling over onto my cheeks. I can barely speak. \u201cLuke, I\u2019m really sorry for everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Jesus.

I\u2019ll be out as soon as the storm passes. Nathan\u2019s offered me his private jet. He\u2019s been absolutely tremendous... \u201d To my dismay, his voice is descending into a hissing crackle.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c... hotel...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s breaking up. Nothing is making any sense.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I call hopelessly as the phone goes dead. I look up to see all the others watching with compassion. Tarquin pats my shoulder kindly with a dripping hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Becky. We\u2019d better get you into the helicopter.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>THE HOSPITAL IS all a bit of a blur. There\u2019s lots of light and noise and being asked questions and wheeled around on a trolley, and eventually it turns out I\u2019ve broken my ankle in two places and they\u2019ve got to set my leg \u2014 plus give me stitches where I cut my forehead and check I haven\u2019t got tetanus or mad cow disease or anything. While they\u2019re doing all that, they give me an injection of some stuff that makes me feel a bit dopey, and when everything\u2019s done I flop back on my pillows, suddenly exhausted. God, it\u2019s nice to be somewhere clean and warm and white.</p><p>In the distance I can hear someone reassuring Jess that she didn\u2019t do any damage by moving me, and then telling Suze several times that a full body scan won\u2019t be needed in this case, and no, they\u2019re not being cavalier with my health. And as it happens, he is the top man in the county.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d I look up in a daze, to see Tarquin advancing toward my bed, holding out a mobile phone. \u201cLuke again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I say into the receiver. \u201cHi! Guess what? I\u2019ve got a broken leg!\u201d I look admiringly at my plaster cast, which is propped up on a support. I have always wanted a plaster cast.</p><p>\u201cI heard. My poor darling. Are they looking after you OK? Do you have everything you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... I think so. You know...\u201d With no warning I give a huge yawn. \u201cActually... I\u2019m pretty tired. I might go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was there.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is gentle and loving. \u201cBecky... just tell me one thing. Why did you go running off to the North without telling anyone?\u201d</p><p>I blink at the phone. He doesn\u2019t know why?</p><p>\u201cBecause I needed help, of course,\u201d I say matter-of-factly. By now, I\u2019ve almost come to terms with the situation. \u201cOur marriage was in tatters. Jess was the only person I could turn to.\u201d</p><p>Luke seems to be struck dumb.</p><p>\u201cOur marriage was in what?\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cTatters!\u201d My voice wobbles. \u201cYou know it was! It was awful! You didn\u2019t even kiss me goodbye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I was pissed off. We had a row! That doesn\u2019t mean our marriage is in tatters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I thought it was. I thought it was all over. I thought you wouldn\u2019t care where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice has gone all strange, like he\u2019s trying not to laugh. Or possibly cry. \u201cDo you have any idea what I\u2019ve been going through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I bite my lip, hot with shame. \u201cLuke, I\u2019m really sorry. I... I didn\u2019t think... I never realized\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re safe. That\u2019s all that matters now.

Just leave stupid Nathan Temple and his horrible hotel. Find some excuse. You can blame me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a bit of a pause.</p><p>\u201cYesss,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to say about that. I think that quite possibly\u2014\u201d He breaks off again. \u201cYou were right. And I was... wrong.\u201d</p> <p>What? Did I hear that properly?</p><p>\u201cI was prejudiced,\u201d Luke says. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve gotten to know Nathan, he\u2019s a very bright guy. Great commercial mind. We\u2019re getting on well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting on well? But... what about him having a conviction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Luke, sounding sheepish. \u201cNathan explained about that. He was defending one of his motel staff from a drunken guest when it happened. He \u2018went a little far,\u2019 as he put it. He says it was a mistake. And I believe him.\u201d</p><p>My head is throbbing. I can\u2019t quite take all this in.</p> <p>\u201cIn a lot of ways he\u2019s a guy after my own heart,\u201d Luke continues. \u201cHe told me the other night why he set up his motel chain. It was after he was refused entry to a smart hotel because he wasn\u2019t wearing a tie. He went straight to a pub and sketched out a business plan for Value Motels. Had twenty up and running in a year. You have to admire that drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d I say, rubbing my forehead in a daze. \u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like him.\u201d Luke pauses. \u201cAnd... he\u2019s been tremendous over this whole affair. Couldn\u2019t have been kinder. He stayed up all night with me, listening for news.\u201d</p><p>I wince in guilt as I imagine the two of them in dressing gowns, waiting by the phone.</p><p>God, I am never, ever going to disappear again.</p><p>I mean, not that I was planning to. But, you know.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the hotel?\u201d I ask. \u201cIs it tacky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotel is supremely tacky,\u201d Luke says, sounding cheerful. \u201cBut you were right. It\u2019s top-quality tack.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help a little giggle, which turns into an enormous yawn. I can really feel the drugs kicking in now.</p><p>\u201cSo... I was right all along,\u201d I say, my voice bleary. \u201cIt was a brilliant networking coup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a brilliant networking coup,\u201d agrees Luke. \u201cBecky... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He suddenly sounds more serious. \u201cFor that and... a lot of things.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cI realize you\u2019ve had it hard these last few weeks. I got too obsessed with the Arcodas deal. I haven\u2019t supported you. And I didn\u2019t appreciate what a crash it was for you, coming back to Britain.\u201d</p><p>As his words filter into my brain they sound weirdly familiar.</p><p>Has he been talking to Jess?</p><p>Has Jess been... sticking up for me?</p> <p>Suddenly I realize Luke is still talking.</p><p>\u201cAnd another thing,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cI finally read through your pink folder on the plane. And I liked your idea. We should approach David Neville and see if he wants to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really liked my idea?\u201d Through my stupor I feel a glow of delight.</p><p>\u201cI really did. Although I have no idea where you\u2019ve picked up all this specialist knowledge on business expansion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Barneys! I told you!\u201d I sink contentedly into my pillows. \u201cDavid\u2019ll want to sell \u2014 I know he will. He\u2019s really regretting having gone on his own. And they want another baby... \u201d I can hardly get the words out, I\u2019m so tired. \u201cAnd Judy says she just wants him to have a normal sara... salary...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, we\u2019ll talk about it another time. You should rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d My eyelids are getting really heavy now and it\u2019s a struggle to keep them open.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start over,\u201d Luke says softly. \u201cWhen I get back. No more tatters. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d a tart voice interrupts. It\u2019s the head nurse, approaching. \u201cMobile phones are not allowed on the wards. And you need some sleep, young lady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I quickly say into the phone. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>The nurse removes the phone from my fingers and my eyes crash shut.</p><p>When I open them again, everything is different. The room is dim. The chatter has gone. It must be nighttime.</p><p>I\u2019m absolutely parched, and my lips are painfully dry. I remember there was a jug of water on my nightstand, and I\u2019m trying to sit up and get it when I knock something onto the floor with a clatter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBex?

Then suddenly I notice the time on Suze\u2019s wristwatch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two o\u2019clock!\u201d I look up in consternation. \u201cSuze, why are you here? You should be in bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d hisses a voice from the other side of my curtain. \u201cKeep the noise down!\u201d</p> <p>Suze and I look at each other in surprise \u2014 and suddenly I can feel the laughter rising. Suze sticks out her tongue at the curtain, and I give a helpless snuffle.</p><p>\u201cHave some more water,\u201d says Suze in a lower voice. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep your skin hydrated.\u201d She pours another glassful and perches on the side of my bed. For a while neither of us speaks. I take a few more sips of water, which is lukewarm and tastes of plastic.</p><p>\u201cThis reminds me of when Ernie was born,\u201d says Suze. \u201cDo you remember? You stayed with me all night then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d I have a sudden memory of a teeny, tiny Ernie in Suze\u2019s arms, all pink and wrapped in a blanket. \u201cThat was some night.\u201d I meet her eyes and she smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when the twins were born... it didn\u2019t feel quite right, you not being there.\u201d Suze is still smiling, but her eyes are sheeny. \u201cI know that sounds really stupid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d I look down at the white hospital sheet, pleating it hard between my fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, Suze.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d Her voice is a little husky. \u201cAnd I... I need to say something. I\u2019m sorry for the way I behaved when you got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say at once. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I overreacted. You had to make other friends while I was gone. Of course you did. I was... stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t stupid.\u201d Suze won\u2019t meet my eye. \u201cIt was me. I was envious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnvious?\u201d I\u2019m utterly dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cThere you were, all tanned and glamorous, with your Angel bag.\u201d Her voice trembles a little. \u201cAnd there I was, stuck in the country with three kids. You came swanning in with all these stories about your amazing round-the-world honeymoon, and I felt really... drab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, you could never be drab!\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cNever in a million years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking.\u201d She looks at me, her face determined. \u201cWhen you\u2019re better, let\u2019s go to Milan for the weekend. Just you and me. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the babies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. Tarkie\u2019ll look after them. It can be my late birthday treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the spa?\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cWasn\u2019t that your treat?\u201d</p><p>For a moment Suze contemplates the floor.</p><p>\u201cThe spa was OK,\u201d she says at last. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the same as with you. No one\u2019s like you, Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you hate Lulu now?\u201d I ask hopefully.</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d Suze gives a shocked giggle. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate her. But...\u201d She breaks off. \u201cAs I said, no one\u2019s like you, Bex.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t quite find a reply, so I reach for my water glass again \u2014 and find myself looking at a small packet on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cJess left you that,\u201d says Suze, looking a bit puzzled. \u201cShe said we might want to eat it.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling. It\u2019s Kendal Mint Cake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of... a private joke,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s expecting me to eat it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s quiet for a while, apart from the noise of a trolley being wheeled along in the distance, and the thwump of double doors opening and closing.</p><p>\u201cSo... you really have got a sister,\u201d says Suze at last. I can hear the wistfulness in her voice. For a few moments I look through the dimness at her familiar, anxious, lovely face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuze... you\u2019ll always be my sister,\u201d I say at last. And I hug her tight.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>IT\u2019S INCREDIBLE, THE number of things I was convinced I didn\u2019t like... and now it turns out I love them!</p><p>For example:</p> <p>1. Jess</p><p>2. Black pudding (If you put lots of tomato ketchup on it, it\u2019s actually quite yummy!)</p><p>3. Being a skinflint</p><p>Honestly. I\u2019m not joking. Being frugal is totally fantastic. It\u2019s so satisfying! How come I never realized this before? Like, yesterday I sent Janice and Martin a postcard to thank them for their lovely flowers... and instead of buying one, I cut it out of a cereal box! It had Kellogg\u2019s on the front! How cool is that?</p><p>Jess gave me that tip. She is teaching me so much. I\u2019ve been staying with her ever since I got out of the hospital, and she\u2019s been just brilliant. She gave me her bedroom because there are fewer stairs up to it than to the guest room, and she helps me get in and out of the bath with my plaster cast, and she makes vegetable soup every day for lunch. She\u2019s even going to teach me how to make it, because if you do it with lentils and... and something else, which I can\u2019t remember... it\u2019s a fully balanced meal in itself and it only costs 30p a portion. And then, with the extra money you save, you can buy something really nice like one of Elizabeth\u2019s homemade fruit pies! (That was the tip I gave to Jess. You see, we\u2019re helping each other!)</p> <p>Now I hobble over to the sink, carefully empty half the coffee grounds out of the cafetiere into the bin, sprinkle on some new ones, and switch on the kettle. The rule in this house is that you reuse coffee grounds, and, like Jess says, it does make total sense. The coffee only tastes a little bit tinny \u2014 and you save loads!</p><p>I have so changed. Finally, I am a frugal and sensible person. Luke will not believe it when he sees me again.</p><p>Jess is chopping an onion, and I helpfully pick up the mesh bag it came in, to throw away.</p><p>Jess looks up. \u201cDon\u2019t! We can use that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn onion bag?\u201d Wow. I\u2019m learning new things all the time! \u201cSo... how can you use an onion bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can turn it into a scourer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod intelligently, even though I\u2019m not entirely sure what a scourer is.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d Jess gives me a look. \u201cScouring. Like exfoliating, but for kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d I say, and beam at her. \u201cCool!\u201d</p><p>I get out my Thrifty Household Tips notebook and write it down. There\u2019s just so much to take in. Like, did you know you can make a garden sprinkler out of an old milk carton?</p><p>Not that I need a garden sprinkler... but still!</p><p>I make my way into the sitting room, one hand resting on my crutch, the other holding the cafetiere.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Suze looks up from where she\u2019s sitting on the floor. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She lifts up the banner she\u2019s been painting. It reads LEAVE OUR LANDSCAPE ALONE in vibrant red and blue with an amazing leafy, grassy border.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I gaze at it in admiration. \u201cSuze, that\u2019s fantastic! You\u2019re such an amazing artist.\u201d I look at the pile of banners, which Suze has been steadily painting over the last few days, draped on the sofa. \u201cGod, the campaign\u2019s lucky to have you.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been so fantastic having Suze here, just like old times. She and Tarquin have been staying in Edie\u2019s guesthouse for the last few days and Tarquin has pretty much taken charge of the babies, except when Suze needs to feed them in the mornings and evenings.</p><p>And it\u2019s been so great. We\u2019ve spent loads of time together, chilling, and eating, and talking about everything under the sun. Sometimes just me and Suze \u2014 and sometimes with Jess too. Like last night, the three of us made margaritas and watched Footloose... which I think Jess enjoyed. Even though she didn\u2019t know every song by heart, like we did.</p><p>Then one night, when Suze went to visit some relation of hers who lives twenty miles away, Jess and I spent the evening together. She showed me all her rocks and told me all about them \u2014 and in return, I told her about my shoes and drew pictures. I think we both learned a lot.</p><p>\u201cThe campaign\u2019s lucky to have you,\u201d retorts Suze, lifting her eyebrows. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Bex. If it weren\u2019t for you, this protest would be three people and a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know.\u201d I shrug, trying to look modest. But I am secretly pretty pleased with the way things are going. I\u2019ve been in charge of the protest publicity ever since I got out of the hospital, and we have gotten so much coverage! The rally is this afternoon, and at least four local radio stations ran news stories this morning. It\u2019s been in all the local papers, and a TV crew is even talking about coming out! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s all due to a brilliant combination of factors. It turns out the head of news at Radio Cumbria is Guy Wroxley, who I used to know in London when I was a financial journalist. He gave me the phone numbers of everyone locally who might be interested, and ran a huge feature piece yesterday afternoon on Cumbria Watch. But the best thing is our fabulous human interest story! The first thing I did when I took control was call a meeting of the environmental group. Everyone had to tell me every little thing they knew about the site, even if it didn\u2019t seem important. And it turns out that twenty years ago, Jim proposed to Elizabeth in the very field which is going to be wrecked by the shopping center!</p><p>So we set up a photo shoot in the field, with Jim kneeling down just like he did then (except, apparently, he didn\u2019t kneel \u2014 but I told him not to mention that), looking all mournful. The Scully and Coggenthwaite Herald printed it on their front page yesterday morning under the headline MASSACRE OF OUR LOVING MEMORIES, and the protest hotline (Robin\u2019s mobile) has been ringing with support ever since!</p><p>\u201cHow long have we got?\u201d asks Suze, sitting back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cThree hours. Here you are.\u201d I hand her a cup of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Suze gives a slight grimace. \u201cIs this your thrifty coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I eye her defensively. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s delicious!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a ring at the doorbell and I hear Jess striding down the passage to answer it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s another bunch of flowers,\u201d says Suze with a giggle. \u201cFrom your admirer.\u201d</p><p>I have been bombarded with bouquets ever since the accident. About half of them are from Nathan Temple, saying things like In hugest gratitude and In appreciation of your supportive gesture.</p> <p>Well. So he should be grateful. There was Luke, all set to fly home, and it was me who said he should stay in Cyprus and finish the job and I\u2019d be fine staying with Jess for a few days. So he did, and he\u2019s on his way home today. The plane should be landing any minute.</p><p>I just know things are going to work out well between me and Luke. We\u2019ve had the ups and downs... we\u2019ve had the tempests... but from now on it\u2019s going to be smooth, easy waters. For a start, I\u2019m a different person now. I\u2019ve become a grown-up, prudent woman. And I\u2019m going to have a grown-up relationship with Luke. I\u2019m going to discuss everything with him. I\u2019m going to tell him everything. No more stupid situations where we end up at loggerheads. We\u2019re a team!</p><p>\u201cYou know, I honestly think Luke won\u2019t know me,\u201d I say, taking a pensive sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think he will,\u201d says Suze, studying me. \u201cYou don\u2019t look that bad. I mean, the stitches are pretty awful, but that huge bruise is looking a bit better... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean in appearance!\u201d I say. \u201cI mean in personality. I\u2019ve totally changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d says Suze, looking puzzled.</p> <p>She\u2019s my best friend. Hasn\u2019t she noticed anything?</p><p>\u201cYes! Look at me! Making thrifty coffee and organizing a protest march and eating soup and... everything!\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t even told Luke about organizing the protest. He\u2019ll be so gobsmacked when he sees his wife has become an activist. He\u2019ll be so impressed!</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Jess\u2019s voice interrupts us and we both look up to see her standing at the door, an odd expression on her face. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you. Some walkers have just come back from Scully Pike, and... they found this.\u201d From behind her back she produces a handpainted calfskin bag adorned with diamant\u00e9.</p><p>My Angel bag.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d never ever see it again.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I hear Suze breathe.</p><p>I\u2019m speechless. It\u2019s a bit battered and there\u2019s a tiny scratch near the handle \u2014 but apart from that it looks just the way it did. The angel is the same. The sparkling Dante is the same.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems fine,\u201d Jess is saying, turning it over in her hands. \u201cIt must have gotten a bit wet and thrown about, but apart from that, no harm done. Here you are.\u201d She holds it out.</p><p>But I don\u2019t move. I can\u2019t take it from her.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Jess looks perplexed. \u201cHere!\u201d She thrusts it toward me and I flinch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d I look away. \u201cThis bag nearly ruined my marriage. From the moment I bought it, everything started going wrong. I think it\u2019s cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCursed?\u201d says Jess, exchanging looks with Suze.</p><p>\u201cBex, it\u2019s not cursed,\u201d Suze says patiently. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally fab bag! Everyone wants an Angel bag!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot me. Not anymore. It\u2019s only brought me trouble.\u201d I look from face to face, feeling suddenly rather sage. \u201cYou know, the last few days have really taught me a lot. I\u2019ve got a lot of things in perspective. And if it\u2019s a choice between my marriage or a totally fab bag\u201d\u2014I spread my arms\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll take the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou have changed. Sorry,\u201d she adds sheepishly, as she sees my face.</p><p>Honestly, what is she like? I would always have taken the marriage.</p><p>I\u2019m... pretty sure I would have.</p> <p>\u201cSo what will you do with it?\u201d asks Jess. \u201cSell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could donate it to a museum!\u201d Suze says excitedly. \u201cIt could be \u2018From the collection of Rebecca Brandon.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea,\u201d I say. \u201cIt can be star prize of the raffle this afternoon.\u201d I grin at them. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll rig it so Kelly wins.\u201d</p><p>By one o\u2019clock the house is full of people. Everyone has gathered here for a final pep talk, and the atmosphere is just amazing. Jess and I are handing out bowls of vegetable soup, and Suze is showing all her painted banners to Robin, and everywhere there\u2019s a buzz of conversation and laughter.</p><p>God, why have I never been on a protest before? It\u2019s just the best thing ever!</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it exciting!\u201d says Kelly, coming up with a bowl of soup in her hand. She\u2019s wearing camouflage combat pants and a T-shirt with hands off our land written on it in marker pen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great!\u201d I beam at her. \u201cSo... have you bought a raffle ticket for later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course! I\u2019ve bought ten!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave this one too,\u201d I say casually, handing her number 501. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good feeling about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d She tucks the ticket into her pants pocket. \u201cThanks, Becky!\u201d</p><p>I smile and sip my soup. \u201cHow\u2019s the shop looking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic!\u201d Her eyes shine. \u201cWe\u2019ve got helium balloons everywhere, and ribbons, and sparkling wine, and loads of free gifts all ready... \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a wonderful party. Don\u2019t you think, Jess?\u201d I add, as she walks by with a saucepan of soup. \u201cThe party in Jim\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d She gives a grudging, almost disapproving shrug, and ladles more soup into Kelly\u2019s bowl.</p><p>Like she\u2019s really fooling me with that act.</p><p>I mean, come on. I\u2019m her sister.</p><p>\u201cSo... it\u2019s amazing that we got a donation to fund the party,\u201d I remark to Kelly. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible!\u201d says Kelly. \u201cA thousand pounds out of nowhere! We couldn\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d says Jess with a small frown.</p> <p>\u201cFunny that the donor wants to stay anonymous,\u201d I add, taking a spoonful of soup. \u201cRobin said they were quite firm about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The back of Jess\u2019s neck is reddening a little. \u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d want some credit,\u201d says Kelly, wide-eyed. \u201cYou know, for being so generous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. You\u2019d think they would.\u201d I pause, then add innocently, \u201cWhat do you think, Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she replies, roughly stacking bowls on a tray. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d I hide a smile. \u201cGreat soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone!\u201d Jim bangs on a table and the hubbub dies down. \u201cJust to remind you. Our Village Shop party begins at five, right after the protest. Everyone\u2019s welcome to come along and spend as much as they can. Hear that, Edie?\u201d</p><p>Edie brandishes her purse back at him, and the room erupts in laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnyone spends more than twenty pounds gets a free gift,\u201d adds Jim. \u201cAnd everyone gets a free drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking!\u201d shouts the gray-haired man, and there\u2019s another huge laugh.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d comes Suze\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cPhone for you. It\u2019s Luke.\u201d</p><p>I hurry into the kitchen, still elated, and seize the receiver.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I say. \u201cHi! Where are you? At the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m already in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I cannot wait to see him. \u201cHow soon can you be here? There\u2019s loads going on! I\u2019ll give you directions to exactly where we\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>His voice cuts me off. \u201cBecky... I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a hitch.

I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I feel a pang. \u201cI\u2019ve so missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not just that.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Gary... and we\u2019re both agreed. We\u2019d love your input on this. We could do with a few bright ideas. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the phone, transfixed with longing. This is exactly what I always wanted! Husband and wife helping each other. Brainstorming together. A real, proper partnership.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t let Jess down. Not now.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I can\u2019t come.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI really want to, but I\u2019ve got something planned for today. I promised Jess. And... some others. I can\u2019t just abandon them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d says Luke, sounding rueful. \u201cMy fault for not hiring you when I had the chance. Well... I\u2019ll see you this evening.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what time I\u2019ll be finished, but I\u2019ll call when I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d I say sympathetically. \u201cI hope it all goes well. I\u2019ll be there in spirit. Where will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s about the one positive thing. I\u2019ll be up in the North. Fairly near where you are, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, with interest. \u201cSo... what\u2019s the crisis? Another fat-cat businessman cooking the books?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorse,\u201d Luke says grimly. \u201cSome environmental bloody protest group which has sprung up out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn environmental group?\u201d I say in amazement. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding! That is such a coincidence, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Abruptly I stop. My face suddenly feels hot and prickly.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be...</p><p>No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. There must be millions of protests every day, all over the country\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s taken control is clearly pretty media savvy,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThere\u2019s a rally this afternoon; they\u2019ve had press coverage; TV news is interested... \u201d He laughs. \u201cGet this, Becky. They\u2019re protesting against a shopping center.\u201d</p><p>The room seems to swim. I clutch the phone, trying to stay calm.</p><p>It can\u2019t be the same thing. It can\u2019t. We\u2019re not protesting against the Arcodas Group. I know we\u2019re not. We\u2019re protesting against Maybell Shopping Centers.</p> <p>Luke interrupts my thoughts. \u201cSweetheart, I have to go. Gary\u2019s on the other line, waiting to brief me. But I\u2019ll see you later. Oh, and have fun doing whatever you\u2019re doing with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll... try,\u201d I manage.</p><p>As I walk back into the sitting room, my heart is beating rather fast. Everyone is sitting in an attentive semicircle watching Robin, who\u2019s holding up a big diagram of two stick figures, labeled RESISTING POLICE ARREST.</p><p>\u201cThe groin area is particularly useful in this respect... \u201d he\u2019s saying as I walk in. \u201cEverything OK, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, my voice two notches higher than usual. \u201cJust one quick question. We are protesting against Maybell Shopping Centers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this has nothing to do with the Arcodas Group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yeah.\u201d He looks at me in surprise. \u201cMaybell\u2019s owned by the Arcodas Group. You knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth, but I can\u2019t quite produce a reply. In fact, I\u2019m feeling a bit faint. I have just orchestrated a huge media campaign against Luke\u2019s newest, most important client. Me. His wife.</p><p>\u201cEvil bastards.\u201d Robin looks around the room. \u201cGuess what I heard today! They\u2019re getting in their PR company to \u2018deal\u2019 with us. Some big-shot firm from London. They\u2019re flying the chief guy back from holiday especially, I heard.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I cannot cope. What am I going to do? What?</p><p>I have to pull out. Yes. I have to tell everyone right now that I\u2019m pulling out and disassociate myself from the whole thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey think we\u2019re small fry.\u201d Robin\u2019s eyes are shining intensely. \u201cThey think we have no resources.

This is hard.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d comes a trembling voice behind me, and I look round in surprise, to see Jess advancing toward me. \u201cBefore you speak... I\u2019d like to say something.\u201d</p><p>As she comes and stands beside me, the room falls silent in expectation. Jess lifts her chin and faces the crowd squarely.</p><p>\u201cA lot of you heard me the other night, telling Becky that we weren\u2019t sisters. A lot of you heard me... disown her. Well, it turns out we are sisters.\u201d She pauses and the color rises in her cheeks. \u201cBut even if we weren\u2019t... even if we weren\u2019t\u201d\u2014she looks round the room, a little fiercely\u2014\u201dI would be honored to know Becky and to count her as a friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHear, hear!\u201d Jim cries hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cAnd going on this march today... with all of you... and my sister...\u201d Jess puts an arm through mine. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the proudest moments of my life.\u201d</p><p>The room is utterly silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Becky.\u201d Jess turns to me. \u201cWhat did you want to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... um... well,\u201d I say weakly. \u201cI was just going to say... let\u2019s smash \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p> <p>\u201cLEAVE OUR LAND alone!\u201d yells Robin through his loudspeaker.</p><p>\u201cOut, out, out!\u201d we all yell back, and I give Jess an exhilarated thumbs-up. If ever I had any doubts about whether I was doing the right thing, they\u2019ve totally vanished. You just have to look around. You just have to see what would be ruined. We\u2019re standing on Piper\u2019s Hill, and it\u2019s the most stunningly beautiful place I\u2019ve ever been. There\u2019s a wood at the top, and wildflowers nestling in the grass, and I\u2019ve already seen about six butterflies. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re Luke\u2019s clients or not. How could they build a shopping center on this? Especially a rubbish one with no Space.NK!</p><p>\u201cLeave our land alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut, out, out!\u201d I yell at the top of my voice. Protesting is just the coolest thing I have done, ever! I\u2019m at the top of the hill with Robin, Jim, and Jess, and the sight before us is just amazing. About three hundred people have turned up! They\u2019re marching up the lane toward the proposed site, waving placards, blowing whistles, and banging drums, with two local TV crews and a bunch of journalists in tow.</p><p>I keep peering at the crowd, but there\u2019s no sign of anyone from the Arcodas Group \u2014 or Luke. Which I\u2019m a tad relieved about. I mean, not that I\u2019m ashamed of being here. Quite the opposite. I am someone who will stand up for her beliefs and fight for the oppressed, no matter what others think. But having said that, if Luke does turn up, I\u2019m thinking I might put on a balaclava and quickly hide behind someone. He\u2019ll never spot me among all these people. It\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>\u201cLeave our land alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut, out, out!\u201d</p><p>Jess is waving her WILDLIFE MURDERERS placard energetically, and blowing on her whistle. Edie and Lorna are wearing fluorescent pink wigs and holding up a huge sign which says KILLING OUR LAND, KILLING OUR COMMUNITY. Suze is in a white T-shirt and army combat trousers, which she pinched from Tarquin, and holding up one of her own banners. And I\u2019m wearing one of Jess\u2019s World Wildlife Fund Tshirts over my D&amp;G cropped jeans. Finally, we\u2019ve swapped clothes like sisters should! (I lent her a black Karen Millen vest top, which she\u2019s wearing under that gray STOP THE CONSUMPTION T-shirt.) The sun is shining, and everyone\u2019s in fantastic spirits.</p> <p>\u201cLeave our land alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut, out, out!\u201d</p><p>The crowd is thickening now, and at a little nod from me, Robin puts down his placards and climbs the stepladder we\u2019ve rigged up. There\u2019s a microphone in front of it, and the view of blue sky and unspoiled countryside behind him is breathtaking. The photographer I hired for the occasion kneels down and starts taking photos, and is soon joined by the TV crews and local newspaper photographers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The crowd gradually quiets down, and everyone turns expectantly toward Robin.</p><p>\u201cFriends, supporters, lovers of the countryside,\u201d he begins, his voice echoing in the clear afternoon air. \u201cI ask you all to take a moment and look around at what we have. We have beauty. We have wildlife. We have all we need.\u201d</p><p>He pauses for effect, just like I coached him, letting the message sink in. The wind is ruffling his hair, and his face is flushed with animation.</p><p>\u201cDo we need a shopping center?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d we all yell back at the tops of our voices.</p><p>\u201cDo we need pollution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need any more pointless consumerist rubbish? Does anyone need any more\u201d\u2014he casts around derisively\u2014\u201ccushions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I begin with everyone else \u2014 then stop myself. I could actually do with some nice cushions for our bed. In fact, I saw some really nice cashmere ones in a magazine only yesterday.</p> <p>But... that\u2019s OK. Everyone knows activists sometimes disagree on minor technical points. And I agree with everything else Robin is saying. Just not about the cushions.</p><p>\u201cDo we want an eyesore on our land?\u201d shouts Robin, spreading his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d I yell back happily. Jess blows her whistle, and I look at it a bit enviously. Next time I go on a protest, I\u2019m definitely taking a whistle.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s hear from another of our activists!\u201d yells Robin, \u201cBecky! Get up here!\u201d</p><p>My head jerks up.</p><p>What? This wasn\u2019t in the plan.</p> <p>\u201cThe girl who\u2019s held this campaign together!\u201d he says. \u201cThe girl whose ideas and spirit have made this happen! Let\u2019s hear it for Becky!\u201d</p><p>Everyone is turning toward me with admiring faces. Robin starts applauding, and everyone gradually joins in.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Becky,\u201d says Jess, over the noise. \u201cThey really want you!\u201d</p><p>I do a quick scan around. There\u2019s no sign of Luke.</p><p>Oh, come on. I have to show my support.</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to walk with my plaster cast, but somehow I hobble through the crowd to the stepladder and carefully climb to the top with Robin\u2019s help. Below me is a sea of excited faces, all looking up in the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cHello, Piper\u2019s Hill!\u201d I yell into the microphone, and an almighty cheer comes back from the crowd, complete with hoots and whistles and frantically beating drums.</p><p>God, this is fantastic! It\u2019s like being a pop star!</p> <p>\u201cThis is our country!\u201d I shout, gesturing at the rippling green grass around us. \u201cThis is our land! We won\u2019t give it up!\u201d</p><p>Another delighted cheer erupts.</p><p>\u201cAnd to anyone who wants us to give it up...\u201d I shout, waving my arms around. \u201cTo anyone who thinks they can come and take it away from us... I say this! I say, Go home!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a third uproarious cheer. I\u2019m totally elated. This seems to come naturally! Maybe I should be a politician!</p><p>\u201cI say, give up now!\u201d I yell. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to fight! On the beaches! And on the\u2014\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a slight kerfuffle going on in the crowd, and I break off, trying to see what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d I can hear people shouting.</p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d The whole crowd is hissing and jeering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d cries Robin, from the grass below. \u201cBastards! Let \u2019em have it!\u201d</p><p>And suddenly I freeze. Five men in dark suits are making their way swiftly to the front of the crowd.</p><p>One of them is Luke.</p><p>OK, I think, I need to get down off this ladder. At once.</p><p>Except it\u2019s not as easy as that, when one leg is in bloody plaster. I can barely move.</p><p>\u201cEr... Robin, I\u2019d like to get down now!\u201d I call.</p><p>\u201cYou stay there!\u201d shouts Robin. \u201cCarry on with your speech! It\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>I frantically grasp my crutch and am trying to maneuver myself off the top, when Luke looks up and sees me.</p><p>I have never seen him so shell-shocked. He stops dead and just stares at me. I can feel my face burning.</p><p>Something tells me organizing a protest against your husband\u2019s client has got to be even worse than selling his Tiffany clocks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards intimidate you, Becky!\u201d Robin hisses urgently from below. \u201cIgnore them! Keep speaking! Go on!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stuck. There\u2019s nothing else I can do. I clear my throat and focus on Kelly\u2019s enthusiastic face.</p><p>\u201cUm... we\u2019re going to fight!\u201d I call out, my voice cracking a bit. \u201cI say... er... go home!\u201d</p><p>By now the five men are standing in a row, arms folded, looking up at me.

His brow is furrowed and he looks furious.</p><p>But there\u2019s a twitch at his mouth, too. Almost like he wants to laugh. Our eyes lock, and I have this awful feeling I\u2019m about to start giggling hysterically.</p> <p>\u201cGive up!\u201d I yell. \u201cBecause you won\u2019t win!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and speak to the ringleader,\u201d Luke says gravely to one of the men I don\u2019t recognize. \u201cSee what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Calmly he walks across the grass to the stepladder and climbs up three steps until he\u2019s level with me. We\u2019re only inches apart. The breeze is carrying the scent of his aftershave. And now he\u2019s so close, I\u2019m longing to throw my arms around him. I want to tell him how much I missed him. How scared I was on the mountain. How much I love him.</p><p>On the other hand, he may not be in the mood for a hug right now.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says Luke at last.</p> <p>\u201cOh!

I\u2019m really frugal. And I care about the countryside.

That actually has the ring of truth.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite take this in. They\u2019re not planning to build a shopping center here after all. We\u2019re all here, shouting and yelling... for no reason.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Luke folds his arms. \u201cDespite your extremely convincing publicity campaign, the Arcodas Group are not in fact villains.

Everyone\u2019s cheering and hugging each other, whistles are blowing, and drums are being beaten to death.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d I hear Jim yelling above the clamor.</p><p>\u201cWe showed them!\u201d shrieks Kelly.</p><p>Jess is cheering along with everyone else, although she keeps darting looks of suspicion toward me and Luke. I\u2019ll have to fill her in later on.</p><p>\u201cI would also like to draw your attention to the huge number of environmental initiatives which the Arcodas Group sponsors,\u201d Luke says smoothly into the microphone. \u201cLeaflets are currently being handed out. And press packs. Enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>Hang on a minute. He\u2019s totally turning this into a positive PR event. He\u2019s hijacked it!</p><p>\u201cYou snake!\u201d I say furiously, putting my hand over the microphone. \u201cYou completely misled them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe field is saved.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThe rest is details, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s not the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your crew had done their research in the first place, we wouldn\u2019t be here and I wouldn\u2019t have to be saving the situation.\u201d He leans down and calls to Gary, who\u2019s been handing out literature to the crowd. \u201cGary, see the Arcodas folk into their car, will you? Tell them I\u2019m staying on for some further negotiating work.\u201d</p><p>Gary nods, and gives me a cheery wave, which I choose to ignore. I\u2019m still outraged with them both.</p> <p>\u201cSo... where is the shopping center being built?\u201d I demand as I watch the rejoicing crowd. Kelly and Jess are hugging each other, Jim is clapping Robin on the back, and Edie and Lorna are waving their pink wigs in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go and protest outside it. Maybe I should start following the Arcodas Group around and making trouble! Keep you on your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should,\u201d says Luke with a wry smile. \u201cBecky, look, I\u2019m sorry. But I have to do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I suppose. But... I thought I was making a difference. I really thought I\u2019d achieved something.\u201d I heave a morose sigh. \u201cAnd it was all for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor nothing?\u201d says Luke, incredulous. \u201cBecky... just take a look at what you\u2019ve done.\u201d He gestures at the throng. \u201cLook at all these people. I\u2019ve heard how you transformed the campaign. Not to mention the village... and this party you\u2019re throwing... You should be proud of yourself. Hurricane Becky, they\u2019re calling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, I leave a trail of devastation everywhere?\u201d</p><p>Luke looks at me, suddenly serious, his eyes warm and dark. \u201cYou blow people away. Everyone you meet.\u201d He picks up my hand and looks at it for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t be like Jess. Be like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you said...\u201d I begin, then stop myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I was going to be all grown-up and dignified and not mention this. But I just can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI overheard you talking to Jess,\u201d I mumble. \u201cWhen she was staying with us. I heard you say... it was difficult to live with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is difficult to live with you,\u201d says Luke matter-of-factly.</p><p>I blink at him, my throat a little tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also enriching. It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s the only thing I want to do. If it were easy... it would be boring.\u201d He touches my cheek. \u201cLife with you is an adventure, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d calls Suze from below. \u201cThe party\u2019s starting! Hi, Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Luke says, and kisses me. Over his shoulder I see Edie nudging Lorna and pointing to us, agog. God, I\u2019m going to have to put them all straight. Otherwise they\u2019ll think I\u2019ve been unfaithful to my husband with the evil Arcodas man.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you off this ladder.\u201d Luke\u2019s strong fingers weave round mine, and I squeeze them back.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, what did you mean just now when you said you were frugal?\u201d he asks as he helps me edge down the steps. \u201cWas it a joke?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!

Also, you should always write a birthday card in pencil so the person can rub out your message and use it again. It saves ninety pence!\u201d</p><p>Luke looks at me wordlessly for a few moments.</p> <p>\u201cI think I need to get you back to London,\u201d he says at last, then helps me down the stepladder, holding my crutch under his arm. \u201cDanny called, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny called?\u201d In my excitement I miss the last step of the ladder. As I land on the grass, everything goes a little swirly.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d I clutch on to Luke. \u201cI\u2019m all dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d says Luke in alarm. \u201cIs it the concussion? You shouldn\u2019t have been climbing ladders... \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I say, a little breathless. \u201cI\u2019ll sit down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, I always used to get like that!\u201d says Suze, passing by. \u201cWhen I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Everything seems to empty from my mind.</p><p>I dart a startled glance at Luke.
