Well, that is to say, naturally she knew Harry Pye was a man. She wasn\u2019t under the delusion that he was a lion or an elephant or a whale, or indeed any other member of the animal kingdom\u2014if one could call a whale an animal and not just a very big fish. What she meant was that his maleness had suddenly become very evident.</p> <p>George knit her brow as she stood in the desolate high road leading to East Riding in Yorkshire. Around them, the gorse-covered hills rolled away into the gray horizon. Dark was rapidly falling, brought on early by the rainstorm. They could\u2019ve been standing at the ends of the earth.</p><p>\u201cDo you consider a whale to be an animal or a very big fish, Mr. Pye?\u201d she shouted into the wind.</p><p>Harry Pye\u2019s shoulders bunched. They were covered only by a wet lawn shirt that clung to him in an aesthetically pleasing way. He\u2019d previously discarded his coat and waistcoat to help John Coachman unhitch the horses from the overturned carriage.</p><p>\u201cAn animal, my lady.\u201d Mr. Pye\u2019s voice was, as always, even and deep with a sort of gravelly tone toward the bottom.</p><p>George had never heard him raise his voice or show passion in any way. Not when she\u2019d insisted on accompanying him to her Yorkshire estate; not when the rain had started, slowing their travel to a crawl; not when the carriage had overturned twenty minutes ago.</p> <p>How very irritating. \u201cDo you think you will be able to right the carriage?\u201d She pulled her soaked cloak up over her chin as she contemplated the remains of her vehicle. The door hung from one hinge, banging in the wind, two wheels were smashed, and the back axle had settled at an odd angle. It was a thoroughly idiotic question.</p><p>Mr. Pye didn\u2019t indicate by action or word that he was aware of the silliness of her query. \u201cNo, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George sighed.</p><p>Really, it was something of a miracle that they and the coachman hadn\u2019t been hurt or killed. The rain had made the roads slippery with mud, and as they had rounded the last curve, the carriage had started to slide. From inside, she and Mr. Pye had heard the coachman shouting as he tried to steady the vehicle. Harry Pye had leapt from his seat to hers, rather like a large cat. He\u2019d braced himself against her before she could even utter a word. His warmth had surrounded her, and her nose, buried intimately in his shirt, had inhaled the scent of clean linen and male skin. By that time, the carriage had tilted, and it was obvious they were falling into the ditch.</p><p>Slowly, awfully, the contraption had tipped over with a grinding crash. The horses had whinnied from the front, and the carriage had moaned as if protesting its fate. She\u2019d clutched Mr. Pye\u2019s coat as her world upended, and Mr. Pye grunted in pain. Then they were still again. The vehicle had rested on its side, and Mr. Pye rested on her like a great warm blanket. Except Harry Pye was much firmer than any blanket she\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>He\u2019d apologized most correctly, disentangled himself from her, and climbed up the seat to wrest open the door above them. He\u2019d crawled through and then bodily pulled her out. George rubbed the wrist he\u2019d gripped. He was disconcertingly strong\u2014one would never know it to look at him. At one point, almost her entire weight had hung from his arm and she wasn\u2019t a petite woman.</p> <p>The coachman gave a shout, which was snatched away by the wind, but it was enough to bring her back to the present. The mare he\u2019d been unhitching was free.</p><p>\u201cRide her to the next town, Mr. Coachman, if you will,\u201d Harry Pye directed. \u201cSee if there is another carriage to send back. I\u2019ll remain here with her ladyship.\u201d</p><p>The coachman mounted the horse and waved before disappearing into the downpour.</p><p>\u201cHow far is the next town?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cTen or fifteen miles.\u201d He pulled a strap loose on one of the horses.</p><p>She studied him as he worked. Aside from the wet, Harry Pye didn\u2019t look any different than he had when they\u2019d started out this morning from an inn in Lincoln. He was still a man of average height. Rather lean. His hair was brown\u2014-neither chestnut nor auburn, merely brown. He tied it back in a simple queue, not bothering to dress it with pomades or powder. And he wore brown: breeches, waistcoat, and coat, as if to camouflage himself. Only his eyes, a dark emerald green that sometimes flickered with what might be emotion, gave him any color.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m rather cold,\u201d George muttered.</p><p>Mr. Pye looked up swiftly. His gaze darted to her hands, trembling at her throat, and then shifted to the hills behind her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I should have noticed your chill earlier.\u201d He turned back to the frightened gelding he was trying to liberate. His hands must have been as numb as her own, but he labored steadily. \u201cThere\u2019s a shepherd\u2019s cottage not far from here. We can ride this horse and that one.\u201d He nodded at the horse next to the gelding. \u201cThe other is lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How can you tell?\u201d She hadn\u2019t noticed the animal was hurt. All three of the remaining carriage horses shivered and rolled their eyes at the whistling of the wind. The horse he had indicated didn\u2019t look any more ragged than the rest.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s favoring her right foreleg.\u201d Mr. Pye grunted, and suddenly all three horses were free of the carriage, although they were still hitched together. \u201cWhoa, there, sweetheart.\u201d He caught the lead horse and stroked it, his tanned right hand moving tenderly over the animal\u2019s neck. The two joints on his ring finger were missing.</p><p>She turned her head away to look at the hills. Servants\u2014and really a land steward was just a superior sort of servant\u2014should have no gender. Of course, one knew they were people with their own lives and all that, but it made things so much easier if one saw them as sexless. Like a chair. One wanted a chair to sit in when one was tired. No one ever thought about chairs much otherwise, and that was how it should be. How uncomfortable to go about wondering if the chair had noticed that one\u2019s nose was running, wishing to know what it was thinking, or seeing that the chair had rather beautiful eyes. Not that chairs had eyes, beautiful or otherwise, but men did.</p><p>And Harry Pye did.</p><p>George faced him again. \u201cWhat will we do with the third horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the rain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady.\u201d Harry Pye\u2019s shoulders bunched again, a reaction that George found oddly fascinating. She wished she could make him do it more often.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should take her with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>The shoulders tensed and Mr. Pye slowly turned his head. In the flash of lightning that lit up the road in that instant, she saw his green eyes gleam and a thrill ran up her spine. Then the following thunder crashed like the heralding of the apocalypse.</p><p>George flinched.</p><p>Harry Pye straightened.</p><p>And the horses bolted.</p><p>\u201cOH, DEAR,\u201d SAID LADY GEORGINA, rain dripping from her narrow nose. \u201cWe seem to be in something of a fix.\u201d</p><p>Something of a fix indeed. More like well and truly buggered. Harry squinted up the road where the horses had disappeared, running as if the Devil himself were chasing them. There was no sign of the daft beasts. At the rate they\u2019d been galloping, they wouldn\u2019t stop for half a mile or more. No use going after them in this downpour. He switched his gaze to his employer of less than six months. Lady Georgina\u2019s aristocratic lips were blue, and the fur trimming the hood of her cloak had turned into a sopping mess. She looked more like an urchin in tattered finery than the daughter of an earl.</p><p>What was she doing here?</p><p>If not for Lady Georgina, he would\u2019ve ridden a horse from London to her estates in Yorkshire. He would\u2019ve arrived a day ago at Woldsly Manor. Right now he would be enjoying a hot meal in front of the fire in his own cottage. Not freezing his baubles off, standing in the middle of the high road in the rain with the light fading fast. But on his last trip to London to report on her holdings, Lady Georgina had decided to travel with him back to Woldsly Manor. Which had meant taking the carriage, now lying in a heap of broken wood in the ditch.</p><p>Harry swallowed a sigh. \u201cCan you walk, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina widened eyes that were as blue as a thrush\u2019s egg. \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ve been doing it since I was eleven months old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Harry shrugged on his waistcoat and coat, not bothering to button either. They were soaked through like the rest of him. He scrambled down the bank to retrieve the rugs from inside the carriage. Thankfully they were still dry. He rolled them together and snagged the still-lit carriage lantern; then he gripped Lady Georgina\u2019s elbow, just in case she was wrong and fell on her aristocratic little arse, and started trudging up the gorse-covered hill.</p><p>At first, he\u2019d thought her urge to travel to Yorkshire a childish fancy. The lark of a woman who never worried where the meat on her table or the jewels at her throat came from. To his mind, those who didn\u2019t labor to make their living often had flighty ideas. But the more time he spent in her company, the more he began to doubt that she was such a woman. She said gormless things, true, but he\u2019d seen almost at once that she did it for her own amusement. She was smarter than most society ladies. He had a feeling that Lady Georgina had a good reason for traveling with him to Yorkshire.</p><p>\u201cIs it much farther?\u201d The lady was panting, and her normally pale face sported two spots of red.</p><p>Harry scanned the sodden hills, looking for a landmark in the gloom. Was that twisted oak growing against an outcropping familiar? \u201cNot far.\u201d</p><p>At least he hoped not. It had been years since he\u2019d last ridden these hills, and he might\u2019ve mistaken where the cottage lay. Or it might have tumbled down since he last saw it.</p><p>\u201cI trust you are skilled at starting fires, Mr. P-pye.\u201d His name chattered on her lips.</p><p>She needed to get warm. If they didn\u2019t find the cottage soon, he\u2019d have to make a shelter from the carriage robes. \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ve been doing it since I was four, my lady.\u201d</p><p>That earned him a cheeky grin. Their eyes met, and he wished\u2014A sudden bolt of lightning interrupted his half-formed thought, and he saw a stone wall in the flash.</p><p>\u201cThere it is.\u201d Thank God.</p><p>The tiny cottage still stood at least. Four stone walls with a thatched roof black from age and the rain. He put his shoulder to the slick door, and after one or two shoves, it gave. Harry stumbled in and held the lantern high to illuminate the interior. Small shapes scurried into the shadows. He checked a shudder.</p><p>\u201cGah! It does smell.\u201d Lady Georgina walked in and waved her hand in front of her pink nose as if to shoo the stink of mildew.</p><p>He banged the door closed behind her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me to shut my mouth and be glad I\u2019m out of the rain?\u201d She smiled and pulled back her hood.</p><p>\u201cI think not.\u201d Harry walked to the fireplace and found some half-burned logs. They were covered with cobwebs.</p><p>\u201cOh, come, Mr. Pye. You know you wish t-t-to.\u201d Her teeth still chattered.</p><p>Four rickety wooden chairs stood around a lopsided table. Harry placed the lantern on the table and picked up a chair. He swung it hard against the stone fireplace. It shattered, the back coming off and the seat splintering.</p><p>Behind him, Lady Georgina squeaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, my lady,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He knelt and began placing small splinters of the chair against the charred logs.</p><p>\u201cVery well. I suppose I must be nice, then.\u201d Harry heard her draw up a chair. \u201cThat looks very efficient, what you\u2019re doing there.\u201d</p><p>He touched the lantern flame to the slivers of wood. They lit and he added larger pieces of the chair, careful not to smother the flame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMmm. It feels good.\u201d Her voice was throaty behind him.</p><p>For a moment Harry froze, thinking of what her words and tone might imply in a different context. Then he banished the thoughts and turned.</p><p>Lady Georgina held out her hands to the blaze. Her ginger hair was drying into fine curls around her forehead, and her white skin glowed in the firelight. She was still shivering.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI believe you should remove your wet gown and wrap the rugs about yourself.\u201d He strode over to the door where he\u2019d dumped the carriage robes.</p> <p>From behind him, he heard a breathless laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I have ever heard such an improper suggestion made so properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be improper, my lady.\u201d He handed her the robes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended.\u201d Briefly his eyes met hers, so blue and laughing; then he turned his back.</p><p>Behind him was a rustling. He tried to discipline his thoughts. He would not imagine her pale, naked shoulders above\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t improper, as well you know, Mr. Pye. Indeed, I\u2019m beginning to think it would be impossible for you to be so.\u201d</p><p>If she only knew. He cleared his throat but made no comment. He forced himself to gaze around the little cottage. There was no kitchen dresser, only the table and chairs. A pity. His belly was empty.</p> <p>The rustling by the fire ceased. \u201cYou may turn around now.\u201d</p><p>He braced himself before looking, but Lady Georgina was covered in furs. He was glad to see her lips were pinker.</p><p>She freed a naked arm from the bundle to point at a robe on the other side of the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019ve left one for you. I\u2019m too comfortable to move, but I\u2019ll close my eyes and promise not to peek if you wish to disrobe as well.\u201d</p><p>Harry dragged his gaze away from the arm and met her clever blue eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The arm disappeared. Lady Georgina smiled, and her eyelids fell.</p><p>For a moment Harry simply watched her. The reddish arcs of her eyelashes fluttered against her pale skin, and a smile hovered on her crooked mouth. Her nose was thin and overlong, the angles of her face a bit too sharp. When she stood, she almost equaled his own height. She wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman, but he found himself having to control his gaze when he was around her. Something about the twitching of her lips when she was about to taunt him. Or the way her eyebrows winged up her forehead when she smiled. His eyes were drawn to her face like iron filings near a lodestone.</p> <p>He shucked his upper garments and drew the last robe around himself. \u201cYou may open your eyes now, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open. \u201cGood. And now we both look like Russians swathed for the Siberian winter. A pity we don\u2019t have a sleigh with bells as well.\u201d She smoothed the fur on her lap.</p><p>He nodded. The fire crackled in the silence as he tried to think of how else he could look after her. There was no food in the cottage; nothing to do but wait for dawn. How did the upper crust behave when they were in their palatial sitting rooms all alone?</p><p>Lady Georgina was plucking at her robe, but she suddenly clasped her hands together as if to still them. \u201cDo you know any stories, Mr. Pye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStories, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Stories. Fairy tales, actually. I collect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Harry was at a loss. The aristocracy\u2019s way of thinking was truly amazing sometimes. \u201cHow, may I ask, do you go about collecting them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy inquiring.\u201d Was she having fun with him? \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at the stories people remember from their youth. Of course, old nursemaids and the like are the best sources. I believe I\u2019ve asked every one of my acquaintances to introduce me to their old nurse. Is yours still alive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a nursemaid, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her cheeks reddened. \u201cBut someone\u2014your mother?\u2014must\u2019ve told you fairy tales growing up.\u201d</p><p>He shifted to put another piece of the broken chair on the fire. \u201cThe only fairy tale I can remember is Jack and the Beanstalk.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina gave him a pitying look. \u201cCan\u2019t you do better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d The other tales he knew weren\u2019t exactly fit for a lady\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cWell, I heard a rather interesting one recently. From my cook\u2019s aunt when she came to visit Cook in London. Would you like me to tell it to you?\u201d</p><p>No. The last thing he needed was to become any more intimate with his employer than the situation had already forced him to be. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a great king and he had an enchanted leopard to serve him.\u201d She wiggled her rump on the chair. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but that\u2019s not how it goes.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The king dies right away, so he\u2019s not the hero.\u201d She looked expectantly at him.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.</p><p>It seemed to do.</p><p>Lady Georgina nodded. \u201cThe leopard wore a sort of gold chain around its neck. It was enslaved, you see, but I don\u2019t know how that came about. Cook\u2019s aunt didn\u2019t say. Anyway, when the king was dying, he made the leopard promise to serve the next king, his son.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t seem very fair, somehow, does it? I mean, usually they free the faithful servant at that point.\u201d She shifted again on the wooden chair.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps you would be more comfortable on the floor. Your cloak is drier. I could make a pallet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled blindingly at him. \u201cWhat a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He spread out the cloak and rolled his own clothes to form a pillow.</p><p>Lady Georgina shuffled over in her robes and plopped down on the crude bed. \u201cThat\u2019s better. You might as well come lie down as well; we\u2019ll be here until morning, most likely.\u201d</p><p>Christ. \u201cI don\u2019t think it advisable.\u201d</p><p>She looked down her narrow nose at him. \u201cMr. Pye, those chairs are hard. Please come lie on the rugs at least. I promise not to bite.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, but he really had no choice. It was a veiled order. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Harry gingerly sat beside her\u2014he\u2019d be damned if he would lie down next to this woman, order or no\u2014and left a space between their bodies. He wrapped his arms around his bent knees and tried not to notice her scent.</p><p>\u201cYou are stubborn, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>She yawned. \u201cWhere was I? Oh, yes. So the first thing the young king does is to see a painting of a beautiful princess and fall in love with her. A courtier or a messenger or some such shows it to him, but that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She yawned again, squeaking this time, and for some reason his prick responded to the sound. Or perhaps it was her scent, which reached his nose whether he wished it to or not. It reminded him of spices and exotic flowers.</p><p>\u201cThe princess has skin as white as snow, lips as red as rubies, hair as black as, oh, pitch or the like, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d Lady Georgina paused and stared into the fire.</p><p>He wondered if she was done and his torment over.</p><p>Then she sighed. \u201cHave you ever noticed that these fairy-tale princes fall in love with beautiful princesses without knowing a thing about them? Ruby lips are all very well, but what if she laughs oddly or clicks her teeth when she eats?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOf course, men in our times are just as apt to fall in love with glossy black curls, so I suppose I shouldn\u2019t quibble.\u201d Her eyes widened suddenly, and she turned her head to look at him. \u201cNo offense meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d Harry said gravely.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She seemed doubtful. \u201cAnyway, he falls in love with this picture, and someone tells him that the princess\u2019s father is giving her to the man who can bring him the Golden Horse, which was presently in the possession of a terrible ogre. So\u201d\u2014Lady Georgina turned to face the fire and cradled her cheek in her hand\u2014\u201che sends for the Leopard Prince and tells him to go out quick and fetch him the Golden Horse, and what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe leopard turned into a man.\u201d She closed her eyes and murmured, \u201cImagine that. He was a man all along....\u201d</p><p>Harry waited, but this time there was no more story. After a while he heard a soft snore.</p><p>He drew the robes up over her neck and tucked them around her face. His fingers brushed against her cheek, and he paused, studying the contrast of their skin tones. His hand was dark against her skin, his fingers rough where she was soft and smooth. Slowly he stroked his thumb across the corner of her mouth. So warm. He almost recognized her scent, as if he\u2019d inhaled it in another life or long ago. It made him ache.</p><p>If she were a different woman, if this were a different place, if he were a different man... Harry cut short the whisper in his mind and drew back his hand. He stretched out next to Lady Georgina, careful not to touch her. He stared at the ceiling and drove out all thought, all feeling. Then he closed his eyes, even though he knew it would be a long while before he slept.</p><p>HER NOSE TICKLED. GEORGE SWIPED at it and felt fur. Beside her, something rustled and then was still. She turned her head. Green eyes met her own, irritatingly alert for so early in the day.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Her words came out a frog\u2019s croak. She cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d Mr. Pye\u2019s voice was smooth and dark, like hot chocolate. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>He rose. The robe he clutched slid off one shoulder, revealing tanned skin before he righted it. Walking silently, he slipped out the door.</p><p>George scrunched her nose. Did nothing faze the man?</p><p>It suddenly occurred to her what he must be doing outside. Her bladder sent up an alarm. Hastily she struggled upright and pulled on her rumpled, still-damp dress, catching as many of the fastenings as she could. She couldn\u2019t reach all the hooks, and it must be gaping around her waist, but at least the garment wouldn\u2019t fall off. George put on her cloak to hide her back and then followed Mr. Pye outside. Black clouds hovered in the sky, threatening rain. Harry Pye was nowhere in sight. Looking around, she chose a dilapidated shed behind which to relieve herself and tramped around it.</p><p>When she came back from the shed, Mr. Pye was standing in front of the cottage buttoning his coat. He had retied his queue, but his clothes were wrinkled and his hair not as neat as usual. Thinking about what she must look like herself, George felt an uncharitable smirk of amusement. Even Harry Pye couldn\u2019t spend the night on the floor of a hut and not show the effects the next morning.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are ready, my lady,\u201d he said, \u201cI suggest we return to the highway. The coachman may be waiting for us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>They retraced their steps of the night before. In light and downhill, George was surprised to find it not such a great distance. Soon they topped the last hill and could see the road. It was empty, save for the carriage wreckage, even more pitiful in the light of day.</p><p>She heaved a sigh. \u201cWell. I guess we\u2019ll just have to start walking, Mr. Pye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>They trudged up the road in silence. A nasty, damp mist hovered off the ground, smelling faintly of rot. It seeped beneath her gown and crept up her legs. George shuddered. She dearly wished for a cup of hot tea and perhaps a scone with honey and butter dripping off the sides. She almost moaned at the thought and then realized there was a rumbling coming from behind them.</p><p>Mr. Pye raised his arm to hail a farmer\u2019s wagon rounding the curve. \u201cHi! Stop! You there, we need a ride.\u201d</p><p>The farmer pulled his horse to a standstill. He tipped the brim of his hat back and stared. \u201cMr. Harry Pye, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pye stiffened. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. From the Woldsly estate.\u201d</p><p>The farmer spat into the road, narrowly missing Mr. Pye\u2019s boots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLady Georgina Maitland needs a ride to Woldsly.\u201d Harry Pye\u2019s face did not change, but his voice had grown as chill as death. \u201cIt was her carriage you saw back there.\u201d</p><p>The farmer switched his gaze to George as if noticing her for the first time. \u201cAye, ma\u2019am, I hope you weren\u2019t hurt in the wreck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled winningly. \u201cBut we do need a ride, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to help. There be room in the back.\u201d The farmer aimed a dirty thumb over his shoulder at the wagon bed.</p> <p>She thanked him and walked around the wagon. She hesitated as she eyed the height of the boards. They came to her collarbone.</p><p>Mr. Pye halted beside her. \u201cWith your permission.\u201d He hardly waited for her nod before grasping her about the waist and lifting her in.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d George said breathlessly.</p><p>She watched as he placed his palms flat on the bed and vaulted in with catlike ease. The wagon jolted forward just as he cleared the boards, and he was thrown against the side.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She held out a hand.</p> <p>Mr. Pye disregarded it and sat up. \u201cFine.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>He said no more. George settled back and watched the countryside roll by. Gray-green fields with low stone walls emerged and then were hidden again by the eerie mist. After last night, she should\u2019ve been glad for the ride, bumpy though it might be. But something about the farmer\u2019s hostility to Mr. Pye bothered her. It seemed personal.</p><p>They cleared a rise, and George idly watched a flock of sheep grazing on a nearby hillside. They stood like little statues, perhaps frozen by the mist. Only their heads moved as they cropped the gorse. A few were lying down. She frowned. The ones on the ground were very still. She leaned forward to see better and heard Harry Pye curse softly beside her.</p><p>The wagon jerked to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with those sheep?\u201d George asked Mr. Pye.</p><p>But it was the farmer who answered, his voice grim. \u201cThey\u2019re dead.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cGeorge!\u201d Lady Violet Maitland ran out Woldsly Manor\u2019s massive oak doors, ignoring the disapproving mutter of her companion, Miss Euphemia Hope.</p><p>Violet only just refrained from rolling her eyes. Euphie was an old pet, a short, apple-round woman with gray hair and mild eyes, but nearly everything Violet did made her mutter.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been? We expected you days ago and...\u201d She skidded to a stop on the gravel courtyard to stare at the man helping her sister from the strange carriage.</p><p>Mr. Pye looked up at her approach and nodded, his face as usual set in an expressionless mask. What was he doing traveling with George?</p><p>Violet narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cHullo, Euphie,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady, we\u2019re so happy you\u2019ve arrived,\u201d the companion gasped. \u201cThe weather has not been all one could wish for, and we have been quite apprehensive as to your safety.\u201d</p> <p>George smiled in reply and wrapped her arms around Violet. \u201cHullo, darling.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s marmalade hair, several shades lighter than Violet\u2019s own exuberantly flaming head, smelled of jasmine and tea, the most comforting scents in the world. Violet felt tears prickle her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were worried, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m so very late.\u201d George bussed her cheek and stepped away to look at her.</p><p>Violet turned hurriedly to inspect the carriage, a rather dilapidated old thing that didn\u2019t look a speck like George\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing traveling about in that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there lies a story.\u201d George pulled off her hood. Her coiffure was incredibly bad, even for George. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you over tea. I\u2019m just famished. We had only a few buns at the inn where we got the carriage.\u201d She looked at the steward and asked rather diffidently, \u201cWould you like to join us, Mr. Pye?\u201d</p><p>Violet held her breath. Say no. Say no. Say no.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, my lady.\u201d Mr. Pye bowed in a sinister fashion. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, there are some estate matters I should see to.\u201d</p><p>Violet expelled her breath in a whoosh of relief.</p><p>To her horror, George persisted. \u201cSurely they can wait another half hour or so?\u201d She smiled in her wonderful, wide-mouthed way.</p><p>Violet stared at her sister. What was she thinking?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Mr. Pye replied.</p><p>\u201cOh, very well. I suppose it is why I employ you, after all.\u201d George sounded like a prig, but at least Mr. Pye was no longer coming to tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d He bowed again, this time a little stiffly, and walked away.</p><p>Violet almost felt sorry for him\u2014almost, but not quite. She hooked her arm through her sister\u2019s as they turned back toward Woldsly. The manor was hundreds of years old and sat in the landscape as if it had grown there, a natural feature of the surrounding hills. Green ivy scrambled up the four-story redbrick fa\u00e7ade. The vines were trimmed back from around tall, mullioned windows. A multitude of chimneys climbed the manor\u2019s gabled roofs like so many hikers on a mountain. It was a welcoming house, perfectly suited to her sister\u2019s personality.</p><p>\u201cCook baked lemon curd tarts just this morning,\u201d Violet said as they climbed the wide front steps. \u201cEuphie has been mooning over them ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, my lady,\u201d the companion exclaimed behind them. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I have really. Not over lemon tarts, anyway. When it comes to mince pie, I do admit a certain fondness, not altogether genteel, I fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the very epitome of gentility, Euphie. We all strive to follow your example,\u201d George said.</p><p>The older woman preened like a gray bantam hen.</p><p>Violet felt a twinge of guilt for always being so exasperated with the silly dear. She made a solemn vow to try and be more kind to her in the future.</p><p>They entered the manor\u2019s huge double oak doors, where George nodded to Greaves, the butler. Light streamed in from the crescent window above the doors, illuminating the coffee-and-cream walls and the entry\u2019s old parquet floor.</p><p>\u201cHave you found something to amuse yourself with at Woldsly?\u201d George asked as they continued down the hall. \u201cI confess, I was surprised when you said you wanted to rusticate here with just Euphie. It\u2019s a bit of a backwater for a fifteen-year-old. Although, of course, you are always welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sketching,\u201d Violet replied, keeping her voice carefully light. \u201cThe views here are a change from Leicestershire. And M\u2019man was becoming quite tiresome at home. She claims to have found a new tumor in her right leg and has brought in a Belgian quack who is dosing her on some awful stuff that smells like cooked cabbage.\u201d Violet exchanged a glance with George. \u201cYou know how she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d George patted her arm.</p><p>Violet looked away, relieved she didn\u2019t have to explain further. Their mother had been predicting her own death since before Violet was born. Mostly the countess kept to her bed, attended by a patient maid. Every once in a while, however, M\u2019man would become hysterical about some new symptom. When that happened, she nearly drove Violet mad.</p><p>They entered the rose morning room, and George pulled off her gloves. \u201cNow, then, what was the purpose of that letter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHist!\u201d Violet jerked her head toward Euphie, who was busy instructing the maid to bring tea.</p><p>George raised her brows but caught on quick enough, thank goodness. She pressed her lips together and threw the gloves on a table.</p><p>Violet said clearly, \u201cYou were going to tell us why you changed carriages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d George wrinkled her nose. \u201cMy carriage slid off the road last night. Quite sensational, actually. And then what do you think?\u201d She sat down on one of the saffron settees, propped an elbow on the back, and rested her head in her palm. \u201cThe horses ran away. Left Mr. Pye and me quite high and dry\u2014only, we were sopping wet, of course. And in the middle of who knows where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood G\u2014\u201d Violet caught Euphie\u2019s censorious eye and changed her exclamation midbreath. \u201cGracious! Whatever did you do?\u201d</p><p>Several maids with laden tea trays trooped in at that moment, and George held up a hand, indicating to Violet that she\u2019d continue after they laid the tea out. A moment later, Euphie poured her a dish of tea.</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d George sighed contentedly over her cup. \u201cI think tea would cure the worst of mental ills if only applied in sufficient quantities.\u201d</p><p>Violet bounced impatiently in her seat until her sister took the hint.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, fortunately Mr. Pye knew of a nearby cottage.\u201d George shrugged. \u201cSo we spent the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady! All alone and Mr. Pye not even married.\u201d The revelation that George had spent an entire night with a man appeared to shock Euphie more than the carriage accident itself. \u201cI do not think, no, I do not think it could\u2019ve been comfortable for you.\u201d She sat back and fanned her face, causing the puce ribbons on her cap to flutter.</p><p>Violet rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s only the land steward, Euphie. It isn\u2019t as if he\u2019s a gentleman from a good family. Besides,\u201d she said practically, \u201cGeorge is eight and twenty. She\u2019s too old to cause a scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear.\u201d George sounded rather dry.</p><p>\u201cA scandal!\u201d Euphie clutched her dish of tea. \u201cI know you will have your little games, Lady Violet, but I do not think we should bandy the word scandal about so carelessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d George murmured soothingly while Violet barely refrained from rolling her eyes\u2014again.</p><p>\u201cAll this excitement has wearied me, I fear.\u201d Euphie got to her feet. \u201cWill it put you out terribly if I have a small lie-down, Lady Violet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Violet suppressed a grin. Every day after tea, regular as clockwork, Euphie found an excuse to have a small lie-down. She had counted on her companion\u2019s routine today as she had in the past.</p><p>The door shut behind Euphie, and George looked at Violet. \u201cWell? Your letter was incredibly histrionic, dear. I believe you used the word diabolical twice, which seems improbable considering you summoned me to Yorkshire, usually a most undiabolical place. I do hope it\u2019s important. I had to refuse five invitations, including the Oswalt autumn masquerade, which had promised to be full of scandal this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is important.\u201d Violet leaned forward and whispered, \u201cSomeone is poisoning the sheep on Lord Granville\u2019s land!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d George raised her brows and took a bite from a tart.</p><p>Violet blew out an exasperated breath. \u201cYes! And the poisoner is from your estate. Maybe from Woldsly Manor itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did see some dead sheep by the road this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you concerned?\u201d Violet jumped to her feet and paced in front of her sister. \u201cThe servants talk of nothing else. The local farmers are whispering about a witch, and Lord Granville has said you\u2019ll be liable if the poisoner is from this estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d George popped the rest of the tart into her mouth. \u201cHow does he know the sheep have been deliberately poisoned? Couldn\u2019t they just have eaten something bad for them? Or more likely died from disease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheep died suddenly, all at once\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisease, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cut poisonous plants were found by the bodies!\u201d</p><p>George sat forward to pour herself a cup of tea. She looked a little amused. \u201cBut if no one knows who the poisoner is\u2014they don\u2019t, do they?\u201d</p><p>Violet shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen how do they know he is from the Woldsly estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootprints!\u201d Violet stopped, arms akimbo in front of her sister.</p><p>George quirked an eyebrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Violet leaned forward impatiently. \u201cBefore I wrote you, they found ten dead sheep on a Granville tenant farmer\u2019s field just over the stream dividing the estates. There were muddy footprints leading from the corpses to the bank of the stream\u2014footprints that continued on the far side of the stream on your land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d George selected another tart. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too damning. I mean, what\u2019s to keep someone from Lord Granville\u2019s land tramping into the stream and back again to make it look like he\u2019s coming from Woldsly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeor-rge.\u201d Violet sat down next to her sister. \u201cNo one on the Granville estate has a reason to poison the sheep. But someone from Woldsly does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Who?\u201d George lifted the tart to her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHarry Pye.\u201d</p><p>George froze with the tart still hovering near her lips. Violet smiled triumphantly. At last she\u2019d gotten her sister\u2019s full attention.</p><p>George carefully set the tart back on her plate. \u201cWhat possible motive could my steward have for killing Lord Granville\u2019s sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge.\u201d Violet nodded at George\u2019s incredulous look. \u201cMr. Pye bears a grudge for something that Lord Granville did in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Violet slumped on the settee. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNo one will tell me.\u201d</p><p>George started to laugh.</p><p>Violet crossed her arms. \u201cBut it must have been something terrible, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked over George\u2019s chortles. \u201cFor him to come back years later and enact his diabolical revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d George gasped. \u201cThe servants or whoever has been telling you these tales are bamming you. Can you really imagine Mr. Pye skulking around trying to feed sheep poisonous weeds?\u201d She went off again into gales of laughter.</p><p>Violet poked the remaining lemon tart sulkily. Truly, the principal problem with older siblings was that they never took one seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M SORRY I WASN\u2019T WITH YOU, my lady, when you had the accident,\u201d Tiggle puffed behind George the next morning. The lady\u2019s maid was fastening an interminable row of hooks on the sapphire sack dress George had chosen to wear.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019d have done, except end up in the ditch with us,\u201d George addressed Tiggle over her shoulder. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure you enjoyed the visit with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I did, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George smiled. Tiggle had deserved an extra day off to spend with her family. And since her father was the proprietor of the Lincoln inn they\u2019d stopped at on the way to Woldsly, it had seemed an opportune time to travel on and leave Tiggle to catch up in a day. But because of the accident, Tiggle hadn\u2019t arrived that much later than they had. Which was good, because George would\u2019ve made a mare\u2019s nest out of dressing her own hair. Tiggle had the hands of an artist when it came to taming George\u2019s messy locks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like to think of you alone with that Mr. Pye, my lady.\u201d Tiggle\u2019s voice was muffled.</p><p>\u201cWhyever not? He was a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so!\u201d Tiggle sounded outraged. \u201cStill. He\u2019s a bit of a cold fish, isn\u2019t he?\u201d She gave a final tug and stepped back. \u201cThere. That\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d George smoothed the front of her gown.</p><p>Tiggle had served her since before George had come out, so many years ago now. She had laced and unlaced what must be a thousand gowns and had lamented with George over the frizziness of her orangey-red hair. Tiggle\u2019s own hair was a smooth golden blond, the preferred color of all those fairy tales. Her eyes were blue, and her lips the requisite ruby red. Indeed, she was a very lovely woman. Were her life a fairy tale, George should be the goose girl and Tiggle the fairy princess.</p> <p>She walked to her vanity table. \u201cWhy do you think Mr. Pye is a cold fish?\u201d She opened her jewel box and began rummaging for the pearl drops.</p><p>\u201cHe never smiles, does he?\u201d In the mirror, she could see Tiggle gathering her nightclothes. \u201cAnd the way he watches a body. Makes me feel like I\u2019m a cow he\u2019s sizing up, trying to reckon if I will calf well another season or if he should send me to the slaughterhouse.\u201d She held out the dress George had worn during the accident and examined it critically. \u201cStill, there\u2019re plenty of lasses hereabouts who find him fetching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d George\u2019s voice came out a squeak. She stuck out her tongue to herself in the mirror.</p><p>Tiggle didn\u2019t look up as she frowned over a hole she\u2019d found near the gown\u2019s hem. \u201cAye. The maids in the kitchen talk about his fine eyes and pretty bum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiggle!\u201d George dropped her pearl earring. It rolled across the vanity\u2019s lacquered surface and came to a stop in a pile of ribbons.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Tiggle\u2019s hand flew to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I don\u2019t know what came over me to say that.\u201d</p><p>George couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cIs that what they talk about in the kitchen? Gentlemen\u2019s bottoms?\u201d</p><p>Tiggle\u2019s face reddened, but her eyes twinkled. \u201cToo much of the time, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should visit the kitchen more often.\u201d George leaned forward to peer into the mirror as she put on an earring. \u201cSeveral people, including Lady Violet, say they\u2019ve heard rumors about Mr. Pye.\u201d She stepped back and turned her head from side to side to study the earrings. \u201cHave you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumors, my lady?\u201d Tiggle slowly folded the gown. \u201cI haven\u2019t been down to the kitchens yet this stay. But I did hear something while at my pa\u2019s. There was a farmer traveling through who lived on Granville land. Said as how the Woldsly steward was doing mischief. Hurting animals and playing pranks at the Granville stables.\u201d Tiggle met George\u2019s eyes in the mirror. \u201cIs that what you mean, my lady?\u201d</p><p>George took a breath and let it out slowly. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u201d</p><p>THAT AFTERNOON, HARRY HUNCHED OVER his saddle in the relentless drizzle. He\u2019d expected to be summoned to the manor almost from the moment they\u2019d driven onto the Woldsly estate. Surprisingly, it had taken a full day and night for Lady Georgina to send for him. He nudged his mare into a trot up the long, winding drive to Woldsly Manor. Perhaps it was because she was a lady.</p><p>When he\u2019d first learned that the owner of the multiple estates he would be managing was a woman, he\u2019d been taken aback. A woman didn\u2019t usually own land by herself. Normally, if she did have an estate, there was a man\u2014a son or husband or brother\u2014in the background, the real power in how the lands were run. But although Lady Georgina had three brothers, it was the lady herself who was in control. And what was more, she\u2019d come by the lands through inheritance, not marriage. Lady Georgina had never wed. An aunt had left everything to her and apparently stipulated in the will that Lady Georgina would have the reins of her holdings and their income.</p><p>Harry snorted. Plainly the old woman hadn\u2019t had much use for men. Gravel crunched beneath the bay mare\u2019s hooves as he entered the vast courtyard before Woldsly Manor. He crossed to the stable yard, swung down from his horse, and tossed the reins to a boy.</p><p>They dropped to the cobblestones.</p><p>The mare stepped back nervously, the reins trailing. Harry stilled and raised his gaze to meet the eyes of the stripling boy. The lad stared at him, chin up, shoulders back. He looked like a young St. Stephan readying himself for the arrows. When had his reputation gotten this bad?</p><p>\u201cPick them up,\u201d Harry said softly.</p><p>The boy wavered. The arrows were looking sharper than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Harry whispered. He turned on his heel, not bothering to see if the lad followed his order, and strode to the manor, leaping the steps two at a time to the front doors.</p><p>\u201cInform Lady Georgina Maitland that I am here,\u201d he said to Greaves. He thrust his tricorn into the hands of a footman and entered the library without waiting to be shown in.</p><p>Tall windows draped in moss-green velvet lined the far side of the room. Had the day been sunny, the windows would have bathed the library in light. But it wasn\u2019t sunny. The sun hadn\u2019t shone in this patch of Yorkshire for weeks.</p><p>Harry walked over and stared out the window. Rolling fields and pastures stretched as far as the eye could see, a patchwork quilt in green and brown. The drystone walls dividing the fields had stood for centuries before he was born and would stand for centuries after his bones had crumbled to dust. It was a beautiful landscape to his mind, one that made his heart tighten every time he saw it, but something was wrong. The fields should have been full of reapers and wagons, harvesting the hay and wheat. But the grain was too wet to harvest. If the rain didn\u2019t let up soon... He shook his head. The wheat would either rot in the field or they\u2019d have to reap it damp. In which case it would rot in the barns.</p><p>He clenched his fist on the window frame. Did she even care what his dismissal would mean to this land?</p><p>Behind him, the door opened. \u201cMr. Pye, I think you must be one of those odious early risers.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his fingers and turned around.</p><p>Lady Georgina strolled toward him in a dress a shade deeper than her blue eyes. \u201cWhen I sent for you at nine this morning, Greaves looked at me like I was noddycock and informed me you would have left your cottage hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Harry bowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have inconvenienced you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well you should be.\u201d Lady Georgina sat on a black and green settee, leaning back casually, her blue skirts spread around her. \u201cGreaves has a knack of making one feel like a babbling infant in leading strings.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI can\u2019t think how horrible it must be working as a footman under him. Aren\u2019t you going to sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish, my lady.\u201d He chose an armchair. What was she about?</p><p>\u201cI do wish.\u201d Behind her, the door opened again, and two maids entered bearing laden trays. \u201cNot only that, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to insist upon you taking tea as well.\u201d</p><p>The maids arranged the teapot, cups, plates, and all the other confusing stuff of an aristocratic tea on a low table between them and left.</p><p>Lady Georgina lifted the silver teapot and poured. \u201cNow, you will have to bear with me and try not to glower so menacingly.\u201d She waved aside his attempted apology. \u201cDo you take sugar and cream?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Plenty of both, then, for I\u2019m sure you have a secret sweet tooth. And two slices of shortbread. You\u2019ll just have to shoulder it like a soldier.\u201d She offered the plate to him.</p><p>He met her eyes, oddly challenging. He hesitated a moment before taking the plate. For a fraction of a second, his fingers brushed hers, so soft and warm, and then he sat back. The shortbread was tender and flaky. He ate the first piece in two bites.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d She sighed and sank into the cushions with her own plate. \u201cNow I know how Hannibal felt after having conquered the Alps.\u201d</p><p>He felt his mouth twitch as he watched her over the rim of his cup. The Alps would have sat up and begged had Lady Georgina marched toward them with an army of elephants. Her ginger hair was a halo around her face. She might\u2019ve looked angelic if her eyes hadn\u2019t been so mischievous. She bit into a slice of shortbread, and it fell apart. She picked up a crumb from her plate and sucked it off her finger in a very unladylike way.</p><p>His balls tightened. No. Not for this woman.</p><p>He set down his teacup carefully. \u201cWhy did you wish to speak to me, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is rather awkward.\u201d She put her own cup down. \u201cI\u2019m afraid people have been telling tales about you.\u201d She held up one hand and began ticking off her fingers. \u201cOne of the footmen, the bootblack boy, four\u2014no five\u2014of the maids, my sister, Tiggle, and even Greaves. Would you believe it? I was a bit surprised. I never thought he\u2019d unbend enough to gossip.\u201d She looked at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry looked back impassively.</p><p>\u201cAnd everyone since only yesterday afternoon when we arrived.\u201d She\u2019d run out of fingers and let her hand drop.</p><p>Harry said nothing. He felt a twisting in his chest, but that was bootless. Why should she be any different from everyone else?</p><p>\u201cThey all seem to be under the impression that you\u2019ve been poisoning the neighbor\u2019s sheep with some kind of weed. Although\u201d\u2014her brow puckered\u2014\u201cwhy everyone should fly up into the boughs about sheep, even murdered sheep, I\u2019m not quite sure.\u201d</p> <p>Harry stared. Surely she jested? But then again, she was from the city. \u201cSheep are the backbone of this country, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the farmers all raise them hereabouts.\u201d She peered at the cake tray, hand hovering above it, apparently choosing a sweet. \u201cI\u2019m sure people become quite fond of their livestock\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t pets.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at his sharp tone, and her eyebrows drew together.</p><p>He was impertinent, he knew, but damn it, she needed to know. \u201cThey\u2019re life. Sheep are a man\u2019s meat and his clothes. The income to pay the landowner his due. The thing that keeps his family alive.\u201d</p> <p>She stilled, her blue eyes solemn. He felt something light and frail connect himself and this woman, who was so far above his station. \u201cThe loss of an animal might mean no new dress for a man\u2019s wife. Maybe a shortage of sugar in the pantry. A couple of dead sheep could keep his children from winter shoes. For a farmer living lean\u201d\u2014he shrugged\u2014\u201che might not make the rent, might have to kill the rest of his herd to feed his family.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cThat way lies ruin.\u201d Harry gripped the settee arm, trying to explain, trying to make her understand. \u201cThat way lies the poorhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So the thing is more serious than I knew.\u201d She sat back with a sigh. \u201cIt would appear I must act.\u201d She looked at him, it seemed, regretfully.</p><p>Here it was, finally. He braced himself.</p><p>The front doors slammed.</p> <p>Lady Georgina cocked her head. \u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>Something crashed in the hall, and Harry leaped to his feet. Arguing voices and a scuffle were coming nearer. He placed himself between the door and Lady Georgina. His left hand drifted down to the top of his boot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see her now, damn your eyes!\u201d The door flew open, and a ruddy-faced man stormed in.</p><p>Greaves followed, panting, his wig crooked. \u201cMy lady, I am so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Lady Georgina said. \u201cYou may leave us.\u201d</p><p>The butler looked like he wanted to protest, but he caught Harry\u2019s eye. \u201cMy lady.\u201d He bowed and shut the door.</p><p>The man wheeled and looked past Harry to Lady Georgina. \u201cThis cannot go on, ma\u2019am! I have had enough. If you cannot control that bastard you employ, I will take matters into my own hands and have great pleasure in doing so.\u201d</p><p>He started forward, his heavy face flushed red against his white powdered wig, his hands balled threateningly at his sides. He looked almost exactly the same as he had that morning eighteen years ago. The heavy-lidded brown eyes were handsome even in age. He had the shoulders and arms of a strong man\u2014thick, like a bull. The years had brought closer the gap in their heights, but Harry was still half a head shorter. And the sneer on the thick lips\u2014yes, that was certainly unchanged. Harry would carry the memory of that sneer to his grave.</p> <p>The man was abreast of him now, paying no attention to him, his gaze focused solely on Lady Georgina. Harry shot out his right hand, his arm a solid bar across the other man\u2019s path. The intruder made to barrel through the barrier, but Harry held firm.</p><p>\u201cWhat th\u2014\u201d The man cut himself off and stared down at Harry\u2019s hand. His right hand.</p><p>The one with the missing finger.</p><p>Slowly, the other man raised his head and met Harry\u2019s eyes. Recognition flamed in his gaze.</p><p>Harry bared his teeth in a grin, though he had never felt less amused in his life. \u201cSilas Granville.\u201d Deliberately he left off the title.</p><p>Silas stiffened. \u201cGoddamn you to hell, Harry Pye.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>No wonder Harry Pye never smiled. The expression on his face at that moment was enough to scare little children into fits. George felt her heart sink. She\u2019d rather hoped that all the gossip about Mr. Pye and Lord Granville was just that: stories made up to entertain bored country folk. But judging from the filthy looks the two men were exchanging, not only did they know each other, but they did indeed have a nasty past.</p><p>She sighed. This complicated matters.</p><p>\u201cYou cur! You dare show your face to me after the -criminal damage you\u2019ve done on my land?\u201d Lord Granville shouted directly in Mr. Pye\u2019s face, spittle flying.</p><p>Harry Pye did not reply, but he had an incredibly irritating smirk on his lips. George winced. She could almost sympathize with Lord Granville.</p><p>\u201cFirst the tricks in my stable\u2014the cut halters, the ruined feed, the vandalized carriages.\u201d Lord Granville addressed George but never took his eyes from Mr. Pye. \u201cThen sheep killing! My farmers have lost over fifteen good animals in the last fortnight alone. Twenty, before that. And all of it began when he returned to this district, employed by you, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had excellent references,\u201d George muttered.</p><p>Lord Granville swung in her direction. She recoiled, but Mr. Pye moved smoothly with the larger man, keeping his shoulder always between them. His show of protectiveness only enraged Lord Granville further.</p><p>\u201cEnough, I say. I demand you dismiss this... this scoundrel!\u201d Lord Granville spat the word. \u201cBlood always shows. Like his father before him, he\u2019s the lowest form of criminal.\u201d</p><p>George inhaled.</p><p>Mr. Pye didn\u2019t speak, but a soft noise came from between his drawn-back lips.</p><p>Good Lord, it sounded like a snarl. Hastily, she broke into speech. \u201cNow, Lord Granville, I think you\u2019re being rather rash in your condemnation of Mr. Pye. After all, have you any reason to suppose it is my steward instead of someone else doing the damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReason?\u201d Lord Granville hissed the word. \u201cReason? Aye, I\u2019ve got reason. Twenty years ago this man\u2019s father attacked me. Nearly killed me, he was so insane.\u201d</p><p>George lifted her eyebrows. She darted a look at Mr. Pye, but he\u2019d controlled his face into its customary impassivity. \u201cI don\u2019t see why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe assaulted me as well.\u201d Lord Granville speared a finger at the land steward\u2019s chest. \u201cJoined his father in trying to murder a peer of the realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014she looked from one man to the other, the first the very embodiment of rage, the other showing no expression at all\u2014\u201cbut he could hardly have been full grown twenty years ago. Wouldn\u2019t he be a boy of... of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d Mr. Pye spoke for the first time since he\u2019d uttered the other man\u2019s name. His voice was quiet, almost a whisper. \u201cAnd it was eighteen years ago. Exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve is plenty old enough to murder a man.\u201d Lord Granville batted aside the objection with the flat of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the common rabble mature early\u2014the better to breed more vermin. At twelve, he was as much a man as he is now.\u201d</p><p>George blinked at this outrageous statement, said with a perfectly straight face and apparently believed as fact by Lord Granville. She glanced again at Mr. Pye, but if anything, he appeared bored. Obviously, he\u2019d heard this sentiment or ones very like it before. She wondered briefly how often he\u2019d listened to such drivel in his childhood.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBe that as it may, my lord, it does not sound as if you have concrete evidence of Mr. Pye\u2019s culpability now. And I really do feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lord Granville threw something down at her feet. \u201cI have evidence.\u201d His smile was quite odious.</p><p>George frowned and looked at the thing by her embroidered shoe tip. It was a little wooden figure. She bent to pick it up, a small, treacle-colored figurine, no larger than the ball of her thumb. Its features were partially obscured by dried mud. She turned it over, rubbing the dirt off. A hedgehog carved in exquisite detail emerged. The artist had cleverly taken advantage of a dark spot in the wood to highlight the bristles on the tiny animal\u2019s back. How sweet! George smiled in delight.</p><p>Then she became aware of the silence in the room. She looked up and saw the dreadful stillness with which Mr. Pye stared at the carving in her hand. Dear Lord, surely he hadn\u2019t really\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat, I think, is evidence enough,\u201d Lord Granville said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him.\u201d Granville gestured at the hedgehog, and George instinctively closed her fingers as if to protect it. \u201cGo on, ask him who made that.\u201d</p><p>She met Mr. Pye\u2019s eyes. Was there a flicker of regret in them?</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said.</p><p>George cradled the carving in her two hands and brought them to her breast. Her next question was inevitable. \u201cAnd what does Mr. Pye\u2019s hedgehog have to do with your dead sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was found next to the body of a ram on my land.\u201d Lord Granville\u2019s eyes bore the unholy light of triumph. \u201cJust this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you must dismiss Pye at the very least. I\u2019ll have the charges written up and a warrant for his arrest drawn. In the meantime, I\u2019ll take him into my custody. I am, after all, the magistrate in this area.\u201d Lord Granville was almost jovial in his victory. \u201cPerhaps you can lend me a brace of strong footmen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d George shook her head thoughtfully. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid that just won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind, woman? I offer to solve the problem for you\u2014\u201d Lord Granville cut himself off impatiently. He marched to the door, waving his hand. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll just ride back to my estate and bring my own men to arrest the fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think not,\u201d George said. \u201cMr. Pye is still in my employ. You must let me handle this matter as I see fit.\u201d</p><p>Lord Granville stopped and turned. \u201cYou\u2019re insane. I\u2019ll have this man by sundown. You have no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have every right,\u201d George interrupted him. \u201cThis is my steward, my house, my land. And you are not welcome upon it.\u201d Striding swiftly, she took both men by surprise, moving past them before they could object. She threw open the door and continued into the hall. \u201cGreaves!\u201d</p><p>The butler must have been hovering nearby because he appeared with amazing speed. He was accompanied by the two biggest footmen in her service.</p><p>\u201cLord Granville will be leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Greaves, a perfect example of his kind, showed no satisfaction as he hurried forward to offer Lord Granville his hat and gloves, but his step was bouncier than usual.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret this.\u201d Lord Granville shook his head slowly, heavily, like an enraged bull. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pye was suddenly at George\u2019s side. She fancied she could feel his warmth even though he touched her not at all.</p><p>\u201cThe door is this way, my lord,\u201d Greaves said, and the footmen moved to flank Lord Granville.</p><p>She held her breath until the big oak doors banged shut. Then she blew it out. \u201cWell. At least he is out of the manor.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pye brushed past her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t finished talking to you,\u201d George said, irritated. The man could at least thank her before leaving. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some questions that need answering, my lady.\u201d He bowed briefly. \u201cI promise to present myself to you by tomorrow morning. Anything you have to say to me can be said then.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>George slowly unclasped her fist and looked again at the elfin hedgehog. \u201cAnd what if what I have to say can\u2019t wait until tomorrow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>GODDAMN HARRY PYE and that haughty bitch as well! Silas Granville kicked his black gelding into a gallop as he left the Woldsly Manor gates. The animal tried to shy at the sting of the spurs, but Silas was having none of it. He yanked viciously on the reins, driving the bit into the soft sides of the horse\u2019s mouth until the animal tasted the copper of its own blood. The gelding subsided.</p><p>To what end did Lady Georgina protect Harry Pye? It wouldn\u2019t be long before Silas returned, and when he did, he\u2019d be sure to bring a small army. She wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent him from dragging Pye away.</p><p>The gelding hesitated at the ford in the stream that divided Granville land from the Woldsly estate. The stream was wide and shallow here. Silas spurred the horse, and it splashed into the water. Bright drops of blood swirled and mixed with the current and were swept away downstream. The hills rolled up from the stream, hiding the approach to Granville House. A man on foot, carrying baskets on a yoke across his shoulders, was in the lane. He scrambled to the side at the sound of the gelding\u2019s hoofbeats. As Silas rode by, the man doffed his cap. Silas didn\u2019t bother acknowledging him.</p><p>His family had held these lands since the time of the Tudors. Granvilles had married, begot, and died here. Some had been weak and some had been intemperate in drink or women, but that didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was the land. For the land was the foundation of their wealth and of their power\u2014the foundation of Silas\u2019s power. No one\u2014especially not a baseborn land steward\u2014was going to endanger that foundation. Not while the blood still beat in his veins. The loss of monies from the dead sheep on his lands was minimal, but the loss of pride\u2014of honor\u2014was too great to bear. Silas would never forget the sheer insolence on Pye\u2019s young face nearly twenty years ago. Even as his finger was being cut off, the boy had stared him in the eye and sneered. Pye had never behaved as a peasant should. It was important that Silas make a show of punishing Harry Pye for his criminal affront.</p> <p>The gelding turned in at the great stone gates, and Silas nudged the horse into another gallop. He topped a rise and Granville House appeared. Gray granite, four stories high, with wings that formed a square around an inner courtyard, Granville House loomed over the surrounding countryside. The building was imposing and stern, meant to signal here is authority to any who saw it.</p><p>Silas cantered to the front door. He pursed his lips in distaste as he saw the figure in crimson and silver on the steps.</p><p>\u201cThomas. You look like a sodomite in that rig.\u201d He dismounted and threw the reins to a stable hand. \u201cHow much did that garment set me back at the tailor\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHullo, Father.\u201d His eldest son\u2019s face blotched red. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t all that dear.\u201d Thomas stared at the blood on the gelding\u2019s heaving sides. He licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cGad, you\u2019re blushing like a lass.\u201d Silas brushed past the boy. \u201cCome and sup with me, Miss Nellie.\u201d</p> <p>He smirked as his son hesitated behind him. The boy didn\u2019t have much choice, did he? Not unless he\u2019d grown a set of bollocks overnight. Silas stomped into his dining room, perversely pleased to see that the table wasn\u2019t set.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell\u2019s my dinner?\u201d</p><p>Footmen jumped, maids scurried, and the butler babbled out apologies. Too soon the table was ready and they sat down to dine.</p><p>\u201cEat some of that.\u201d Silas pointed with a fork at the rare meat, lying in a pool of blood on his son\u2019s plate. \u201cMayhap you\u2019ll grow hair on your chest. Or elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Thomas hazarded a half smile at Silas\u2019s baiting and shrugged one shoulder nervously.</p><p>Jesus! How had he ever thought this boy\u2019s mother would make a good breeder? His offspring, the fruit of his loins\u2014which he never doubted, because his late wife hadn\u2019t the spirit to cuckold him\u2014sat across from him and poked at his meat. His son had inherited Silas\u2019s height and brown eyes but that was all. His overlong nose, lipless mouth, and puling nature were all his mother\u2019s. Silas snorted in disgust.</p> <p>\u201cWere you able to see Lady Georgina?\u201d Thomas had taken a bite of the beef and was chewing it as if he held dung in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I saw the arrogant bitch. Saw her in the library at Woldsly. And Harry Pye, damn his green eyes.\u201d He reached for a roll.</p><p>Thomas stopped chewing. \u201cHarry Pye? The same Harry Pye who used to live here? Not a different man with the same name? Her steward, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye her steward.\u201d Silas\u2019s voice rose on the last word to a mincing falsetto. His son flushed again. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m apt to forget those green eyes any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p><p>Silas looked hard at his son, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have him arrested?\u201d Thomas spoke quickly, one shoulder up.</p><p>\u201cAs to that, I\u2019ve run into a slight problem.\u201d Silas curled his upper lip. \u201cSeems Lady Georgina doesn\u2019t want her steward arrested, stupid wench.\u201d He took another swig of ale. \u201cDoesn\u2019t think the evidence is damning enough. Probably doesn\u2019t care one way or the other about dead livestock\u2014my dead livestock\u2014seeing as she\u2019s from London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe carved figurine didn\u2019t convince her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it did not.\u201d Silas picked a bit of gristle from between his front teeth. \u201cRidiculous to let a woman have that much land, anyway. What\u2019s she want it for? Probably cares more for gloves and the latest dance in London than she does for her estate. The old woman should have left it to a man. Or made her get married so she\u2019d have a husband to run it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps...\u201d Thomas hesitated. \u201cPerhaps I could talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Silas flung back his head and laughed until he began to choke. Tears appeared in his eyes, and he had to take a drink.</p><p>Thomas was silent on the other side of the table.</p><p>Silas wiped his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you have a way with the ladies, now, is it, Tommy, my boy? Not like your brother, Bennet. That lad had his first cream jug while still in the schoolroom.\u201d</p><p>Thomas\u2019s head was bowed. His shoulders twitched up and down.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever even bedded a wench?\u201d Silas asked softly. Slyly. \u201cEver felt soft, fat titties? Ever smelled the fishy odor of eager twat?\u201d He leaned back, balancing his chair on two legs, and watched his son. \u201cEver plunged your pud into a willing woman and fucked her until she screamed?\u201d</p><p>Thomas jerked. His fork slid off the table and rattled onto the floor.</p><p>Silas sat forward. The front legs of his chair came down with a thump. \u201cI thought not.\u201d</p><p>Thomas stood so suddenly his chair crashed over. \u201cBennet isn\u2019t here, is he? And not likely to be here anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Silas pursed his lips at that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your oldest son. This will be my land someday. Let me try to talk to Lady Georgina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Silas cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cYou can go there and take Pye by force,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t likely to endear her to us. And while she\u2019s our neighbor, it behooves us to remain on good terms. He\u2019s only her steward. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d start a feud over the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, I don\u2019t suppose you can make it any worse.\u201d Silas drained his ale and banged down his cup. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a couple of days to try and talk sense into the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Father.\u201d</p><p>Silas ignored his son\u2019s gratitude. \u201cAnd when you fail, I\u2019ll break down the doors of Woldsly if I have to and drag Harry Pye out by his neck.\u201d</p><p>HARRY SHIVERED AS HE GUIDED the bay mare up the track leading to his cottage. In his rush to question the Granville farmers this morning, he hadn\u2019t bothered to take a cloak. Now it was well after sundown, and the fall nights were chilly. Overhead, the leaves in the trees rattled in the wind.</p><p>He should\u2019ve waited and let Lady Georgina say whatever she was going to say this morning. But the realization that someone was actively trying to implicate him in the sheep killings had spurred him from the room. What was happening? There had been vicious rumors for weeks that he was the killer. Gossip that had started almost from the moment the first dead sheep had been found a month ago. But Harry had brushed aside talk. A man couldn\u2019t be arrested for talk. Evidence was a different matter.</p><p>His cottage stood off the main drive to Woldsly Manor, built, God only knew why, in a little copse. Across the drive was the gatekeeper\u2019s cottage, a much bigger building. He could have turned the gatekeeper out and taken possession of the larger house when he had first came to Woldsly. A steward, after all, was higher in status than a mere gatekeeper. But the man had a wife and family, and, the smaller cottage was farther back from the drive and hidden in the trees. It had more privacy. And he was a man who treasured his privacy.</p><p>He swung down from the mare and led her to the tiny lean-to against the back of the cottage. Harry lit the lantern hanging inside the door and took off the horse\u2019s saddle and bridle. Weariness of body and spirit dragged at his limbs. But he carefully rubbed down the mare, watered her, and gave her an extra scoop of oats. His father had drummed into him at an early age the importance of taking care of one\u2019s animals.</p><p>With a final pat for the already dozing mare, he picked up the lantern and left the stable. He walked around the cottage on the well-worn path toward the door. As he neared the front door, his step faltered. A light flickered through his cottage window.</p><p>Harry put out his lantern. He backed into the underbrush beside the path and hunkered down to think. From the size of the light, it looked to be a single candle. It didn\u2019t move, so it probably stood on a table inside. Maybe Mrs. Burns had left the candle burning for him. The gatekeeper\u2019s wife sometimes came to clean and leave him a meal. But Mrs. Burns was a thrifty woman, and Harry doubted she would waste a candle\u2014even a tallow candle like the ones he used\u2014on an empty cottage.</p><p>Someone waited for him inside.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t that be a surprise after arguing with Granville this morning? If they meant to jump him, surely they would\u2019ve taken care to wait in darkness? After all, he hadn\u2019t suspected anything until he\u2019d seen the light. Had his cottage been dark, he\u2019d have gamboled up, as trusting as a newborn lamb. Harry gave a soft snort. So. They\u2014whoever they were\u2014were very assured, waiting for him in his own home. They figured that even with the light showing so plainly from his windows, he\u2019d be stupid or brash enough to walk right in.</p><p>And maybe they were right.</p><p>Harry set the lantern down, took the knife from his boot, and rose silently from his crouch. He stole to the cottage wall. His left hand held the knife by his thigh. Quietly he skimmed along the stone wall until he was at the door. He grasped the door handle and pressed the latch slowly. He took a breath and flung open the door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye, I had begun to think you would never come home.\u201d Lady Georgina knelt by his fireplace, looking quite unperturbed by his sudden entrance. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m hopeless at lighting fires, otherwise I would\u2019ve made some tea.\u201d She rose and dusted off her knees.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d He bent and brushed his left hand over the top of his boot, sheathing the knife. \u201cNaturally I\u2019m honored to have your company, but I\u2019m also surprised. What are you doing in my cottage?\u201d He shut the door behind him and walked to the fireplace, picking up the burning candle on the way.</p><p>She stepped aside as he crouched by the hearth. \u201cI fear I detect some sarcasm in your tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. And I am at a loss to understand why. After all, it was you who walked away from me this morning.\u201d</p><p>The lady was peeved.</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips curved as he lit the already laid fire. \u201cI apologize most humbly, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. A less humble man I have yet to meet.\u201d From the sound of her voice, she was wandering the room behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What did she see? What did this little cottage look like to her? In his mind\u2019s eye, he reviewed the inside of his cottage: a wooden table and chairs, well made but hardly the cushioned luxury of the manor\u2019s sitting rooms. A desk where he kept the record books and ledgers of his job. A set of shelves with some coarse pottery dishes\u2014two plates, two cups, a bowl, a teapot, forks and spoons, and an iron cooking pot. A door off to one side that was no doubt open, so she could see his narrow bed, the hooks that held his clothes, and the dresser with the earthenware washbasin and pitcher.</p><p>He stood and turned.</p><p>Lady Georgina was peering into his bedroom.</p><p>He sighed silently and walked to the table. On it sat a crock covered with a plate. He lifted the plate and looked inside the pot. Mutton stew left by Mrs. Burns, cold now, but welcome nonetheless.</p> <p>He went back to the hearth to fill the iron kettle with water and swing it over the fire. \u201cDo you mind if I eat, my lady? I haven\u2019t had my supper yet.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stared at him as though her mind has been elsewhere. \u201cPlease. Do go ahead. I wouldn\u2019t want you to accuse me of withholding food.\u201d</p><p>Harry sat at the table and spooned some of the stew onto a plate. Lady Georgina came and looked curiously at his supper and then moved to the fireplace.</p><p>He watched her as he ate.</p><p>She examined the animal carvings lining his mantel. \u201cDid you make all these?\u201d She gestured to a squirrel with a nut between its paws and glanced back at him.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how Lord Granville knew you\u2019d made the hedgehog. He\u2019d seen your work before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he hadn\u2019t seen you, at least not for a very long time.\u201d She pivoted fully to look at him.</p><p>A lifetime. Harry served himself some more stew. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he hadn\u2019t seen your figurines for a very long time, either? In fact, not since you were a boy.\u201d She frowned, fingering the squirrel. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t care what Lord Granville says, twelve years old is still just a boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The kettle started steaming. Harry got up, took down the brown teapot from his cupboard, and put in four spoonfuls of tea. He grabbed a cloth to lift the kettle from the fire. Lady Georgina moved aside and watched as he poured the boiling water.</p><p>\u201cMaybe what?\u201d She knit her brow. \u201cWhich question were you really answering?\u201d</p><p>Harry set the teapot on the table and looked over his shoulder at her. \u201cWhich were you really asking?\u201d He sat down again. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and seemed to consider. Then she replaced the squirrel and crossed to the shelves. She picked up the two cups and a packet of sugar and brought them back to the table. She sat down across from him and poured the tea.</p><p>Harry stilled.</p><p>Lady Georgina was fixing him his tea, in his own house, at his own table, just like a country woman would, tending to her man after he\u2019d had a hard day of work. It didn\u2019t feel at all like this morning in her sitting room. Right now it felt wifely. Which was a daft thought because she was the daughter of an earl. Only she didn\u2019t look like a lady at the moment. Not when she was adding sugar to his cup and stirring it in for him. All she looked like was a woman\u2014a very desirable woman.</p><p>Damn. Harry tried to will his cock back down, but that part of his body had never listened to reason. He tasted the tea and grimaced. Did other men get cockstands over a cup of tea?</p><p>\u201cToo much sugar?\u201d She looked worriedly at his cup.</p> <p>The tea was rather sweet for his taste, but he wasn\u2019t about to say that. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, my lady. Thank you for pouring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She took a sip of her own tea. \u201cNow, as to what I\u2019m really asking. How exactly did you know Lord Granville in the past?\u201d</p><p>Harry closed his eyes. He was too weary for this. \u201cDoes it matter, my lady? You\u2019ll be letting me go soon enough, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever gave you that idea?\u201d Lady Georgina frowned. Then she caught his look. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that I believe you murdered those sheep, do you?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>She put her cup back on the table with a sharp click. Some of the tea sloshed over the edge. \u201cI know that I don\u2019t always seem very serious, but please acquit me of being a complete nincompoop.\u201d She scowled at him as she stood, arms akimbo like a red-haired Boadicea. All she needed was a sword and chariot.</p><p>\u201cHarry Pye, you no more poisoned those sheep than I did!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>As grand gestures went, it rather flopped.</p><p>Mr. Pye quirked a single eyebrow upward. \u201cSince it boggles the mind,\u201d he said in that awful, dry tone, \u201cthat you, my lady, would ever poison livestock, I must be innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Gathering her dignity about her, George marched to the fireplace and pretended interest in the figurines again. \u201cYou haven\u2019t yet answered my question. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>Normally this would be the point where she\u2019d say something flippant and silly, but somehow she just couldn\u2019t with him. It was hard to put away the mask, but she didn\u2019t want to play the ninny with him. She wanted him to think better of her.</p><p>He looked so tired; the lines around his mouth had deepened and his hair was windblown. What had he been doing all afternoon to make him so exhausted? She hadn\u2019t missed the way he\u2019d entered the cottage, suddenly and in a crouch, his green eyes defiant. He\u2019d reminded her of a cornered feral cat. But then he\u2019d straightened and shoved something in his boot and was once again her phlegmatic steward. She might have imagined the violence she\u2019d seen in his eyes, but she didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Harry Pye sighed and pushed away his plate. \u201cMy father\u2019s name was John Pye. He was Silas Granville\u2019s gamekeeper when I was a boy. We lived on Granville land, and I grew up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d George turned to him. \u201cHow did you go from being a gamekeeper\u2019s son to a land steward?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cYou have my references, my lady. I assure you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d She shook her head impatiently. \u201cI wasn\u2019t maligning your credentials. I\u2019m just curious. You must admit it\u2019s a bit of a leap. How did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard work, my lady.\u201d His shoulders were still bunched.</p><p>George raised her eyebrows and waited.</p><p>\u201cI got work as a gamekeeper on a big estate when I was sixteen. The land steward there discovered I could read and write and do sums. He took me on as sort of an apprentice. When a position on a smaller, neighboring estate became open, he recommended me.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cFrom there I worked my way up.\u201d</p><p>She tapped her fingers against the mantelpiece. There had to be more to the story than that. Few men of Mr. Pye\u2019s age managed estates as large as hers, and how had he gotten an education, anyway? But that matter could wait until later. She had more pressing questions at the moment. She picked up a rabbit and rubbed its smooth back.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you were twelve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father had a falling out with Granville,\u201d Mr. Pye said.</p><p>\u201cA falling out?\u201d George replaced the rabbit and chose an otter. Dozens of the little wood carvings crowded the mantelpiece, each in exquisite detail. Most were of wild animals, although she spied a shepherd\u2019s dog. They fascinated her. What kind of a man would carve such things? \u201cLord Granville said your father tried to kill him. That sounds like much more than a falling out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa struck him. Merely that.\u201d He spoke slowly, as if choosing his words with care. \u201cI sincerely doubt he meant to kill Granville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She placed the otter next to the rabbit and made a little circle with a turtle and a shrew. \u201cWhy did he attack his employer and lord?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>George waited, but he didn\u2019t answer. She touched a stag, standing on three legs, the fourth lifted as if to flee. \u201cAnd you? Did you mean to kill Lord Granville at the age of twelve?\u201d</p><p>The silence stretched again, but finally Harry Pye spoke. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She let her breath out slowly. A commoner, child or not, could be hung for trying to kill a peer. \u201cWhat did Lord Granville do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had my father and me horsewhipped.\u201d</p><p>The words fell into the stillness like pebbles into a pond. Emotionless. Simple. They belied the violence a horsewhipping would do to a young boy\u2019s body. To his soul.</p><p>George closed her eyes. Oh, dear Lord. Don\u2019t think of it. It\u2019s in the past. Deal with the present. \u201cSo you do have a motive for killing the sheep on Lord Granville\u2019s land.\u201d She opened her eyes and focused on a badger.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is this story common knowledge in the district? Do others know you\u2019ve such enmity for my neighbor?\u201d She placed the badger in alliance with the stag. The little creature\u2019s head was lifted, teeth bared. It made a formidable foe.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hide my past and who I was when I returned as the Woldsly steward.\u201d Mr. Pye rose and took the teapot to the door. He opened it and tossed the dregs into the bushes. \u201cThere are some who remember what happened eighteen years ago. It was a scandal at the time.\u201d The dry tone was back.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you return to this neighborhood?\u201d she asked. Was he looking for revenge in some way? \u201cIt does seem a bit of a coincidence that you should be working on the estate neighboring the one you grew up on.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated with the teapot dangling from one hand. \u201cNo coincidence, my lady.\u201d He walked deliberately to the cupboard, his back to her. \u201cI pursued this position as soon as it opened. As you said, I grew up here. It\u2019s my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had nothing to do with Lord Granville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u201d\u2014Mr. Pye looked at her over his shoulder, a devilish gleam in his green eyes\u2014\u201cit didn\u2019t hurt that Granville would be irked to see me here.\u201d</p><p>George felt her lips lift. \u201cDoes everyone know about your carvings?\u201d She waved a hand at the menagerie.</p><p>He\u2019d brought out a dishpan and soap, but he paused to glance at the animals lining the mantelpiece.</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I\u2019d only made a few carvings when I was a boy here.\u201d He shrugged and began washing the tea things. \u201cDa was known for his whittling. He taught me.\u201d</p><p>She took a cloth from the shelf, picked up a teacup Mr. Pye had rinsed, and began drying it. He glanced sideways at her, and she thought she detected surprise. Good.</p><p>\u201cThen whoever put the hedgehog by the dead sheep either knew you before or had been in this cottage since your residence.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe only visitors I\u2019ve had are Mr. Burns and his wife. I pay her a bit to tidy for me and make me a meal once in a while.\u201d He pointed his chin at the empty crock that had held his dinner.</p><p>George felt a rush of satisfaction. He\u2019d not brought a woman here. But then she frowned. \u201cPerhaps you confided in a woman you\u2019ve been walking out with?\u201d</p><p>She winced. Not the most subtle of inquiries. Good Lord, he must think her a widgeon. Blindly, she put out her hand for another teacup and collided with Harry Pye\u2019s hand, warm and slippery with soap. She looked up and met his emerald eyes.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t walked out with a lass. Not since entering your employ, my lady.\u201d He picked up the crock to wash it.</p><p>\u201cAh. Well. Good. That narrows it down a bit.\u201d Could she sound any more a ninny if she tried? \u201cThen do you know who could have stolen the hedgehog? I presume it was taken from above your fireplace?\u201d</p><p>He rinsed the crock and picked up the basin. Carrying it to the door, he threw out the washing water. He caught the open door. \u201cAnyone could have taken it, my lady.\u201d He pointed to the door handle.</p><p>There was no lock.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d George muttered. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t narrow it down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, my lady.\u201d He sauntered back to the table, the firelight illuminating one side of his face and throwing the other half into darkness. His lips curved. Did he think her funny?</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go this morning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI went to question the farmers who found the dead sheep and my carving.\u201d He stopped only a foot away from her.</p><p>She could feel the warmth of his chest not quite touching hers. Was he staring at her mouth?</p> <p>He was. \u201cI wondered if one of them had left the hedgehog. But they were men I didn\u2019t know, and they seemed honest enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her throat was dry. She swallowed. He was her steward, for goodness sake. What she was feeling wasn\u2019t at all proper. \u201cWell.\u201d George folded the towel and put it away on the shelf. \u201cWe shall just have to do some more research tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I shall accompany you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this morning Lord Granville threatened you.\u201d Harry Pye wasn\u2019t looking at her mouth anymore. In fact, he was frowning into her eyes.</p> <p>George felt a twinge of disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019ll need my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no need of your help, my lady. You shouldn\u2019t be gadding about the countryside while...\u201d He trailed off as a thought struck him. \u201cHow did you come to my cottage?\u201d</p><p>Oops. \u201cI walked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... It\u2019s over a mile from here to Woldsly!\u201d Mr. Pye stopped and breathed heavily in that way some men do when a female says something particularly foolish.</p><p>\u201cWalking is good exercise,\u201d George explained kindly. \u201cBesides, I was on my own land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, would you please promise me not to go strolling about on your own, my lady?\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cUntil this is over with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well, I promise to not go out alone.\u201d George smiled. \u201cAnd in return, you can promise to take me on your investigations.\u201d</p><p>Harry Pye\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>George drew herself up straight. \u201cAfter all, I am your employer, Mr. Pye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, my lady. I\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d</p><p>Not the most gracious acquiescence, but it would do.</p><p>\u201cGood. We can start in the morning.\u201d George swung her cloak around her shoulders. \u201cAbout nine, I think? We\u2019ll take my gig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d Mr. Pye advanced ahead of her to the cottage door. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back to Woldsly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I asked that the carriage be brought round at nine. It should be here by now.\u201d</p> <p>And indeed, when Mr. Pye swung wide the door, a footman was waiting discreetly by the path. Her steward eyed the man. He must have approved, for he nodded. \u201cGood night, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow morning.\u201d George drew the hood up over her hair. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the footman and then glanced over her shoulder. Harry Pye stood in his doorway, silhouetted by the firelight behind him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read his expression.</p><p>\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING up so early?\u201d Violet stared at her sister, already dressed and hurrying down the stairs at\u2014she stepped backward into her room to check the clock\u2014eight in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOh, hullo, dear.\u201d George did a little half-whirl on the stairs, peering up at her. \u201cI\u2019m just, uh, going for a drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing for a drive,\u201d Violet repeated. \u201cBy yourself? At eight in the morning?\u201d</p><p>George tilted her chin, but her cheeks were turning pink. \u201cMr. Pye will accompany me. He wishes to show me some things around the estate. Tenants and walls and crops and such, I suppose. Terribly boring, but necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye! But, George, you can\u2019t go out alone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He is my land steward, after all. It\u2019s his job to keep me informed about estate matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really must go, dear. The man is apt to take off without me if I\u2019m late.\u201d And with that, George all but ran down the stairs.</p><p>Violet followed more slowly, her brow knit in thought. What was George about? She couldn\u2019t still trust the land steward, could she? Not after the accusations she\u2019d heard, not after Lord Granville had stormed the manor yesterday? Perhaps her sister was trying to find out more about Mr. Pye on her own. But in that case, why had she blushed?</p><p>Violet nodded to the footmen as she entered the morning room where breakfast was served. She had the gold and pale blue room to herself\u2014Euphie never rose before nine in the morning, even in the country. She went to the sideboard and helped herself to a bun and a slice of gammon, and then sat down at the pretty gilt table. Only then did she notice the letter by her plate. The handwriting was distinctively slanted backward.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this arrive?\u201d She took a too-quick sip of tea and burned her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis morning, my lady,\u201d one of the footmen murmured.</p><p>It was a silly question, and she wouldn\u2019t have asked it, but she\u2019d been stalling before opening the letter. She picked it up and turned it over to pry up the seal with a butter knife. She took a deep breath before unfolding the paper and then had trouble releasing it. It was important she not show her emotions before the servants, but it was difficult. Her worst fears had been realized. She\u2019d had two months of respite, but now that was over.</p><p>He\u2019d found her.</p><p>ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH WOMEN\u2014and there are many\u2014is they think nothing of messing about in a man\u2019s business. Harry Pye remembered Da\u2019s words when he saw Lady Georgina\u2019s carriage the next morning at eight-thirty.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t taking any chances, his lady. She\u2019d driven the old gig to the part of Woldsly drive that intersected the cutoff to his cottage. There was no way he could escape the estate without her seeing him. And she was a half hour earlier than their agreed-upon meeting time of nine o\u2019clock. It was almost as if she\u2019d feared he would try to leave without her. And since he\u2019d planned exactly that, her appearance was all the more annoying.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Lady Georgina waved happily.</p><p>She was wearing some sort of red-and-white-patterned frock that should have jarred with her ginger hair but didn\u2019t. On her head was a wide-brimmed hat tilted rakishly down in front and up in back where her hair was massed. Red ribbons on the crown of the hat fluttered in the breeze. She looked dainty and aristocratic, like she was out for a picnic in the country.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had Cook pack a luncheon,\u201d she called as he neared, confirming his worst fears.</p><p>Harry stopped himself in time from casting his eyes heavenward. God help me. \u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d</p><p>It was another dreary, gray day. No doubt they would be rained on before the morning was out.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to drive?\u201d She scooted across the seat to make room for him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, my lady.\u201d He climbed in, making the gig rock on its oversized wheels.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d He could feel her gaze as he gathered the reins. \u201cI can drive, naturally; it\u2019s how I arrived here this morning, after all. But I find it\u2019s much nicer to watch the scenery without worrying about the horses and the road and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina sat forward, her cheeks flushed with the wind. Her lips were slightly parted like a child looking forward to a treat. He felt a smile form on his own lips.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we be going today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He brought his eyes back to the road. \u201cI want to visit another of the farmers whose sheep were killed. I need to find out what exactly killed the animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it a poisonous weed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut no one I\u2019ve talked to seems to know what kind, and it could be several. Wolfsbane is poisonous, though rare in these parts. Some folk grow belladonna and foxglove in their gardens\u2014both can kill sheep and people as well. And there are common plants, such as tansy, that grow wild in pastures and will kill sheep if they eat enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea there are so many poisons growing in the countryside. It quite makes one shiver. What did the Medicis use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Medicis?\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina wriggled her little rump on the carriage seat. \u201cYou know, those deliciously horrible Italians with the poison rings that went about killing anyone who looked at them askance. What d\u2019you suppose they used?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, my lady.\u201d The way her mind worked.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sounded disappointed. \u201cWhat about arsenic? That\u2019s very poisonous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s poisonous, but arsenic isn\u2019t a plant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Then what is it?\u201d</p><p>He had no idea. \u201cA sort of seashell that is ground into a powder, my lady.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause while she thought that one over.</p><p>Harry held his breath.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her squint at him. \u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bit about arsenic being a sort of seashell.\u201d She lowered her voice on the last words to mimic him.</p><p>\u201cI assure you\u201d\u2014Harry kept his tone bland\u2014\u201cit\u2019s a pinkish seashell found only in the Adriatic Sea. The local villagers harvest the shells with long rakes and sieves. There is a yearly festival to celebrate the catch.\u201d He fought to prevent his lips from twitching. \u201cThe Annual Adriatic Arsenic Assail.\u201d</p><p>Silence\u2014and, he was fairly certain\u2014stunned silence at that. Harry felt a surge of pride. It wasn\u2019t just any man who could make Lady Georgina lose her power of speech.</p><p>Not that it lasted long.</p><p>\u201cI shall have to watch you, Mr. Pye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are evil.\u201d But her words shook as if she barely held in the laughter.</p><p>He smiled. He hadn\u2019t felt so light in a very, very long time. He slowed the horse as they came to the stream that separated her estate from Granville\u2019s land. He scanned the horizon. Theirs was the only vehicle on the road.</p><p>\u201cSurely Lord Granville wouldn\u2019t be so rash as to attack us here.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, brows raised.</p><p>She frowned impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching the hills since we neared the stream.\u201d</p><p>Ah. She\u2019d been aware. He reminded himself not to underestimate her, even when she played the aristocratic ninny. \u201cGranville would be insane to try an attack.\u201d Which didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Reapers harvested barley to their right. Usually reapers sang as they worked, but these labored in silence.</p><p>\u201cLord Granville has his workers out on a misty day,\u201d Lady Georgina said.</p><p>He pressed his lips together to forestall a comment on Granville\u2019s agricultural practices.</p><p>A sudden thought occurred to her. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed anyone in my fields since I\u2019ve arrived at Woldsly. Are you worried they might get the ague?\u201d</p><p>Harry stared at her. She didn\u2019t know. \u201cThe grain is still too damp to store. Only a fool would order the reapers out on a morning like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014she knitted her brows\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t you need to harvest it before frost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But if the grain is wet, it\u2019s worse than useless to harvest it. It would merely spoil in the storage bins.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThose workers are wasting their strength on grain that will rot, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She seemed to think about that for a minute. \u201cWhat will you do with the Woldsly harvest, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do, my lady, except pray for a break in the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if the harvest is ruined...\u201d</p><p>He straightened a bit in the seat. \u201cYour revenue will be considerably lessened from the estate this year, I\u2019m afraid, my lady. If the weather clears, we might still get most of the crop in, maybe all of it. But every day that goes by lessens that chance. The tenants on your land need those crops to feed their families as well as pay you your share. The farmers won\u2019t have much left over\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean that!\u201d Now she was frowning at him, looking insulted. \u201cDo you think me such a... a fribble that I\u2019d care for my income over a tenant\u2019s ability to feed his children?\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. All the landowners in his experience did indeed have more concern for their income than the well-being of the people who worked their land.</p><p>She continued, \u201cWe will, of course, waive the rent monies due me for this year if the harvest fails. And I will make available loans to any farmer who might need one to see him through the winter.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked, startled by a sudden lightness in his heart. Her offer was more than generous. She\u2019d removed a burden from his shoulders. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down at her gloved hands. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d she said gruffly. \u201cI should have realized. And I\u2019m sorry for being cross with you. I was embarrassed to know so little about my own estate. You must think me an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied softly, \u201conly a lady who is city bred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Pye.\u201d She smiled, and his chest seemed to warm. \u201cEver the diplomat.\u201d</p><p>They crested a rise, and Harry slowed the gig to turn into a rutted lane. He hoped they wouldn\u2019t lose a wheel in the potholes. The lane led to a crofter\u2019s cottage, long and low, with a thatched roof. Harry pulled the horse to a halt and jumped from the gig.</p><p>\u201cWho lives here?\u201d Lady Georgina asked when he went to her side to help her down.</p> <p>\u201cSam Oldson.\u201d</p><p>A shaggy terrier ran out from around the building and began barking at them.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cYou there, Sam! Are you home?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to go nearer the cottage with that dog growling so seriously. It was a smallish dog, true, but the small ones were more apt to bite.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d A burly man wearing a reaper\u2019s straw hat came from the shed. \u201cShuddup, dog!\u201d He roared to the still-barking terrier. \u201cGet on with you!\u201d</p><p>The dog tucked its tail under its rear and sat.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Lady Georgina spoke brightly from beside Harry.</p><p>Sam Oldson snatched the hat from his head, baring a wild nest of black hair. \u201cMa\u2019am. I didn\u2019t see you there at first.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, making it stand up even more, and looked helplessly at the cottage. \u201cMy woman\u2019s not home. Visiting her mum she is, otherwise she\u2019d be out here offering you a drink and a bite to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right, Mr. Oldson. We did arrive unexpectedly, I know.\u201d She smiled at the man.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cThis is Lady Georgina Maitland from Woldsly.\u201d He thought it best not to introduce himself, though Sam was no fool. Already he was beginning to scowl. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to ask you about the sheep you lost. The ones that were poisoned. Did you find them yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Sam spat into the dust at his feet, and the terrier cringed at his tone. \u201cA little over a fortnight ago, it were. I\u2019d sent my lad to bring them in and he come running back quick. Said I\u2019d better come see myself. There they were, three of my best ewes, rolled on their sides with tongues sticking out and bits of green leaves still in their mouths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what they\u2019d eaten?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cFalse parsley.\u201d Sam\u2019s face turned purple. \u201cSome son of a bitch had cut down false parsley and fed it to my sheep. And I says to my lad, I says, when I get my hands on the villain that\u2019s killed my sheep, he\u2019ll wish he\u2019d never been born, he will.\u201d</p><p>Time to go. Harry grabbed Lady Georgina around the waist and threw her up onto the carriage seat. She squealed.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He walked swiftly around the front of the carriage, keeping an eye on Sam Oldson. The dog had begun to growl again.</p><p>\u201cHere now, why\u2019re you asking questions?\u201d Sam started toward them.</p><p>The dog lunged and Harry bound into the carriage and caught up the reins. \u201cGood day, Sam.\u201d</p><p>He turned the horse\u2019s head and slapped it into a trot down the track. Behind them, Sam made a reply not fit for a lady\u2019s ears. Harry winced and glanced at Lady Georgina, but she was looking thoughtful rather than outraged. Maybe she hadn\u2019t understood the words?</p><p>\u201cWhat is false parsley?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a weed that grows in wet places, my lady. About the height of a man with little white flowers at the top. It looks something like parsley or wild carrots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it before.\u201d Lady Georgina\u2019s brows were knit.</p><p>\u201cYou probably know it by its other name,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHemlock.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cDo you know that when I first met you I didn\u2019t like you?\u201d Lady Georgina asked idly as the old gig jolted over a hole in the road.</p><p>They were driving slowly down a track on the way to Tom Harding\u2019s cottage. Harding had lost two sheep last week. Harry only hoped he wasn\u2019t pushing their luck, staying on Granville land so long. He tore his mind away from thoughts of hemlock and dead sheep and stared at her. How was he supposed to answer a question like that?</p><p>\u201cYou were so stiff, so correct.\u201d She twirled her parasol. \u201cAnd I had the distinct feeling you were looking down your nose at me as if you didn\u2019t particularly like me, either.\u201d</p><p>He remembered the interview many months before in her London town house. She\u2019d kept him waiting in a pretty pink sitting room for over an hour. Then suddenly she\u2019d blown in, chattering at him as if they\u2019d already met. Had he glowered at her? He didn\u2019t know, but it was likely. Back then she\u2019d conformed to all his expectations of an aristocratic lady.</p><p>Funny how his estimation of her had changed since.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why Violet so dislikes you,\u201d she said now.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019d lost the thread of her conversation. Again.</p><p>She waved a hand. \u201cThe sternness, the correctness that you display. I think that\u2019s why Violet doesn\u2019t care for you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you needn\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our father\u2019s.\u201d She glanced at him and must have read the puzzlement on his face. \u201cFather was stern and terribly correct as well. You probably remind Violet of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said I reminded her of your father? An earl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I doubt she consciously has noticed the superficial resemblance.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cI\u2019m flattered to be compared to your father, my lady, superficially or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, and now you\u2019re using that terribly dry tone.\u201d</p><p>He shot a startled look at her.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI never know if I should throw myself from a cliff when I hear it or simply slink into some corner and try and make myself invisible.\u201d</p><p>She could never make herself invisible. At least not to him. He\u2019d smell her exotic fragrance if nothing else. He straightened. \u201cI assure you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She cut him off with a wave. \u201cIf anyone should apologize, it should be me. My father was an awful man, and I had no business comparing the two of you.\u201d</p><p>How to reply to that? \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that we saw Father all that much, of course. Only once a week, sometimes less, when Nanny brought us down for inspection.\u201d</p><p>Inspection? He\u2019d never understand the rich.</p><p>\u201cIt really was the most terrifying thing. I never could eat beforehand, or I\u2019d be in danger of losing the meal on his boots, and wouldn\u2019t that be a horror.\u201d She shivered at the thought. \u201cWe\u2019d line up, my brothers and I, all in a row. Scrubbed, polished, and silent, we\u2019d wait for Father to give his approval. Quite, quite agonizing, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. Despite her words, Lady Georgina\u2019s face was bland, almost careless, but she wasn\u2019t quite as good at disguising her voice. He wouldn\u2019t have noticed it a week ago, but today he detected the strain. Her old man must\u2019ve been a right bastard.</p><p>She was looking down at her hands now, folded in her lap. \u201cAnd, you see, at least we had each other, my brothers and I, when we went for inspection. But Violet is the youngest. She had to do it all alone after the rest of us grew up and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did the earl die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years ago, now. He was on a foxhunt\u2014he was very proud of his kennel of foxhounds\u2014and his horse balked at a hedge. The horse stayed behind, but father went over and broke his neck. He was already dead when they brought him home. Mother had an hysterical fit and took to bed for the next year. She didn\u2019t even rise for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. Mostly for Violet\u2019s sake. Mother has always been delicate\u2014her words. She spends a great deal of her time inventing illnesses and then calling for the latest ridiculous cure.\u201d She stopped suddenly and inhaled.</p><p>He waited, handling the reins as the horse trotted around a bend.</p><p>Then she said softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You must think me terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady. I think that your sister is lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled then, that bright, open smile that made his balls tighten and his breath catch. \u201cThank you. Although I don\u2019t know if she would agree with you at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, exactly,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cBut something seems to be wrong. She\u2019s angry at me... no, it\u2019s not that plain. She\u2019s distant, as if she\u2019s keeping part of herself back from me.\u201d</p><p>He was out of his depth here, but he tried. \u201cPerhaps it is simply that she\u2019s growing out of the schoolroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But Violet has always been such a cheerful, open girl, and we\u2019ve been very close. With Mother the way she is, well, I\u2019ve had to step in. We\u2019re closer than most sisters.\u201d She smiled mischievously at him. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so sure of the reason she distrusts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt you\u2019re right about that.\u201d They\u2019d come to a gate, and he pulled the horse to a stop. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong on one other thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>He tied the reins and stood in preparation to swing down from the gig. \u201cI never disliked you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL alfresco picnic was in the packing. George peered into the wicker basket and hummed in approval. Squishy foods, like cream cakes, for instance, were bound to come to grief no matter how carefully the hamper was handled. She lifted out some smoked ham and placed it on a cutting board next to the cheese and crusty bread. If one forgot important utensils, one was likely to end up having to tear things apart with one\u2019s bare hands. She handed the corkscrew to Mr. Pye. It was also most imperative that the foods not spoil during the day. A pear tart followed. And the little details should not be forgotten in order to have a really splendid picnic. She took out a small jar of pickled gherkins and sighed in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI just adore picnics.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pye, wrestling with the cork in a bottle of white wine, looked up and smiled at her. \u201cSo I see, my lady.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, George felt lost in that smile, the first full one she\u2019d ever seen on his face.</p><p>The cork let go with a soft pop. Mr. Pye poured a glass of the translucent liquid and handed it to her. She took a sip, savoring the tart bite on her tongue, and then set the glass down on the throw where they sat. A white butterfly that had been resting on the throw took off.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d George gestured to the insect. \u201cI wonder what kind it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cabbage butterfly, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat an awful name for such a pretty thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d His tone was grave. Was he laughing at her?</p><p>The last farmer they\u2019d visited hadn\u2019t been home, and as they\u2019d driven away from the lonely cottage, she\u2019d insisted that they stop for luncheon. Mr. Pye had found a grassy hill beside the road. The view from the top of the hill was glorious. Even on a cloudy day like this one they could see for miles, maybe all the way into the next county.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know of this place?\u201d she asked as she fished for pickles with a fork.</p><p>\u201cI used to come here as a boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. I had a little pony as a lad, and I used to go wandering. Packed a picnic, not as grand as this one, of course, but enough to satisfy a boy for the day.\u201d</p><p>George listened with her pickle, speared on a fork, held in midair. \u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d He looked away.</p><p>She frowned at her pickle, and then popped it into her mouth. \u201cDid you go alone, or were there other boys in the area to accompany you?\u201d She squinted over his shoulder. Was that a horseman coming up the road?</p> <p>\u201cI usually had a mate.\u201d</p><p>Definitely a horseman. \u201cI wonder who that is.\u201d</p><p>He twisted to look behind him. His back stiffened. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d</p><p>The rider was nearing, and by the narrowness of his shoulders, it wasn\u2019t Lord Granville.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Mr. Pye still stared.</p> <p>The rider was now below the hill. He glanced up at them.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d Mr. Pye said.</p><p>George knew she should be shocked, but he didn\u2019t seem to realize that he\u2019d sworn\u2014twice\u2014in front of her. Slowly she put down the pickle jar.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d the man called. \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>She had a feeling Mr. Pye was about to reply in the negative to this friendly greeting, so she answered, \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>The man dismounted, tethered his horse, and began to climb the slope. George couldn\u2019t help but notice that, unlike when Mr. Pye had climbed the hill, the man was puffing by the time he reached them.</p><p>\u201cWhew! A bit of a climb, what?\u201d He brought out a handkerchief and wiped his sweating face.</p><p>George stared at him curiously. He dressed and spoke like a gentleman. Tall and long-boned, he had an ingratiating smile on thin lips, and his brown eyes were familiar.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, but I noticed the carriage and thought I\u2019d introduce myself.\u201d He bowed. \u201cThomas Granville at your service. And you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgina Maitland. This is\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Mr. Granville interrupted, \u201cAh, I thought so... or rather, I hoped so. May I?\u201d He gestured at the throw.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He lowered himself carefully. \u201cActually, I wanted to apologize for my father\u2019s behavior yesterday. He told me that he\u2019d visited you and that you\u2019d disagreed. And knowing my father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeighbors and all.\u201d Mr. Granville waved his hand vaguely. \u201cI thought there must be a way we can settle this peacefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Mr. Pye\u2019s one word dropped onto the conversation, flattening it.</p><p>George glanced sharply at him.</p><p>Mr. Granville turned to speak, looked Mr. Pye in the face, and coughed.</p><p>Mr. Pye handed him a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Mr. Granville gasped when he could draw breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was you until I saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow,\u201d Harry Pye inquired, \u201cdo you plan to settle the problem without bloodshed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to stop, of course\u2014the sheep poisoning, I mean. And the other mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlainly. But how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to leave, I\u2019m afraid, Harry.\u201d Mr. Granville shrugged one shoulder jerkily. \u201cEven if you repaid the cost of the livestock and the damage to Father\u2019s stable, he\u2019s not going to let it go. You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Granville\u2019s gaze dropped to Harry Pye\u2019s mutilated right hand resting on his knee. George followed his eyes and felt a cold wave wash over her body when she saw Harry flex the remaining fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t leave?\u201d Mr. Pye replied in a deadly calm voice, as if he were inquiring the time.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Mr. Granville looked to George, apparently for support.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>He turned back to Mr. Pye. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best, Harry. I can\u2019t answer for what will happen if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Harry Pye didn\u2019t reply. His green eyes had grown stony.</p><p>Nobody spoke for an uncomfortable period of time.</p><p>Mr. Granville suddenly slapped his hand on the throw. \u201cDisgusting things.\u201d He lifted his hand, and George saw that he\u2019d squashed the cabbage butterfly.</p><p>She must\u2019ve made a sound.</p><p>Both men looked at her, but it was Mr. Granville who spoke. \u201cThe butterfly. They come from worms that devour leafy crops. Nasty things. All farmers hate them.\u201d</p><p>She and Mr. Pye were silent.</p><p>Mr. Granville\u2019s face reddened. \u201cWell. I must be going. Thank you for the repast.\u201d He stood and clambered back down the hill to his horse.</p><p>Harry Pye watched him go, eyes narrowed.</p><p>George looked down at the pickle jar beside her hand. She hadn\u2019t the appetite for them anymore. She sighed mournfully. A perfect picnic ruined.</p><p>\u201cYOU DON\u2019T LIKE HIM.\u201d Lady Georgina frowned, looking down at the picnic blanket. She was trying to fold it, but it was turning into a tangled mess.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Harry took it from her and shook out the fabric, then handed her the corners on one end.</p><p>\u201cThomas Granville, of course.\u201d She held her end of the blanket limply as if she didn\u2019t know what to do. Hadn\u2019t she ever folded a sheet before? \u201cYou swore when you saw him, you weren\u2019t going to invite him to join us, and when he did, you were barely civil to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like Thomas Granville.\u201d He backed up to draw the fabric taut, then brought his corners together so that a rectangle hung between them. She caught on. They folded the blanket once more, and then he walked toward her to take her corners from her. He met her eyes.</p><p>They were narrowed. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with Mr. Granville?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s his father\u2019s son. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew you.\u201d Her head was cocked to the side, as if she were a curious thrush. \u201cYou knew each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, and he expected more questions, but she simply pressed her lips together again. Silently they packed away the rest of the picnic. He took the basket from her, and they climbed down to the waiting gig. He stowed the basket under the seat, and then turned to her, steeling his features. It was harder to keep his emotions in check around her these days.</p><p>She watched him with thoughtful blue eyes. \u201cWho do you think is poisoning the sheep?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands around her waist. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He felt the stiffness of her stays, and beneath that, warmth. He lifted her into the gig and let go before she could see the longing in his eyes. He jumped into the seat beside her and untied the reins.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Thomas Granville,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make it seem as if you were doing the crime? To enrage his father? Because he hates the smell of wet wool? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He could feel her gaze on him, but he kept his eyes straight ahead as he guided the horse back to the road. The gelding liked to play games if the driver wasn\u2019t paying attention. He thought about her words. Thomas? Why would Thomas\u2014</p><p>A sound like steam escaping from a lidded pot came from her lips. \u201cYou needn\u2019t blame me for his condescension, you know. I\u2019ve already told you I don\u2019t believe you killed the sheep.\u201d</p><p>She was scowling at him. What had he done now? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, try to think out loud. I don\u2019t handle charged silences well. They make me nervous.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>They rode another quarter mile in silence before she spoke again. \u201cWhat else did you do when you were a boy?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her.</p><p>She caught the look. \u201cSurely you can tell me that? All of your childhood can\u2019t be a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it isn\u2019t very interesting. I mostly helped my da.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cAnd...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe walked the land, checked traps, watched for poachers. That\u2019s what a gamekeeper does.\u201d A memory of his father\u2019s strong, leathery hands delicately setting a trap came to him. Strange how he could remember the hands but not the face.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you find any poachers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course.\u201d He was pleased that his voice was steady. \u201cThere are always poachers, and Granville had more\u2019n his fair share because he was so mean to his tenants. Many poached for food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your father do?\u201d Her hand, which had been lying on her lap, slipped, resting now alongside his thigh.</p><p>Harry kept his gaze ahead and shrugged. \u201cMostly he\u2019d turn a blind eye. If they took too much, he\u2019d tell them to do their hunting elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that would\u2019ve put him in conflict with his employer, wouldn\u2019t it? If Lord Granville found out he wasn\u2019t arresting every poacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve. If Granville found out. Turned out he didn\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d been more interested in other things, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve liked to have known your father,\u201d she mused. He could\u2019ve sworn he felt her fingers press against his leg.</p><p>He looked at her curiously. \u201cWould you? A gamekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What else did you do when you were a boy?\u201d</p><p>What did she want from him? Why all these questions, and why the hand against his leg? Her fingers felt as if they burned straight through his breeches to his skin beneath. \u201cThat\u2019s about it, my lady. Roaming the land, checking traps, looking for birds\u2019 eggs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirds\u2019 eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He glanced at her, then down at her hand. \u201cUsed to collect them as a boy.\u201d</p><p>She was frowning and didn\u2019t seem to notice his gaze. \u201cBut where would you find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the nest.\u201d She still looked puzzled, so he explained. \u201cYou watch the birds in spring. See where they go. Sooner or later, they all go back to their nests. Jackdaws in chimneys, plovers on the heath, pigeons in the crook of trees, and thrushes in a nest like a cup in the branches of hedges. You wait and you watch, and if you\u2019re patient, you see where the eggs are. Then you can take one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNever more than one, for my da said \u2019twas a sin to steal all the eggs from a nest. I\u2019d watch the bird and slowly, slowly creep close until I could take an egg. Most of the time I\u2019d have to wait until the bird left the nest. But sometimes if I was careful, I could reach right under the bird\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She laughed up at him, her blue eyes crinkled at the corners, and suddenly his heart seemed to contract. Maybe he didn\u2019t really care why she asked her questions\u2014just so long as she asked them. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He felt his lips curve. \u201cI\u2019d reach right under the bird, feel its little downy body beating and warm on my fingers, and steal an egg straight from the nest it was sitting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably bamming me again, Mr. Pye, but for some reason I believe you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut what did you do with the eggs after that? Eat them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEat them? Never!\u201d He widened his eyes in an exaggeratedly horrified look that seemed to amuse her. That pleased him and he was puzzled. This silly conversation was like no other he could remember. Men took him dead seriously. Women were a little in awe of him. No one giggled at his words or attempted\u2014</p><p>\u201cThen what do you do with the eggs?\u201d Her eyes were laughing up at him again.</p><p>He almost swore, he was so startled. Was Lady Georgina\u2014an earl\u2019s daughter for Christ\u2019s sake\u2014flirting with him?</p><p>He\u2019d gone insane. \u201cI\u2019d take a pin and poke a tiny hole in each end of the egg and let it dry. I had a shelf next to my bed with a whole row of eggs, brown and white and clear blue. Blue as...\u201d He trailed away. Blue as your eyes, he\u2019d meant to say, but he remembered suddenly that this woman was his employer and he her servant. How could he forget that fact? Irritated with himself, he faced forward again.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t seem to notice his pause. \u201cDo you have the eggs still? I\u2019d like to see them.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d rounded a bend in the road, and Harry saw that a tangle of branches blocked the way. A tree had fallen across the lane.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d He frowned. The lane was hardly wide enough for the gig as it was. It would be a devil\u2019s job to turn the carriage around. What\u2014?</p><p>Four men suddenly appeared from behind the tangled branches. They were big, they looked mean, and they each held a knife in their hand.</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>George screamed as Harry Pye made a heroic attempt to pull the horse around. The lane was too narrow, and the men were upon him in seconds. Mr. Pye kicked the first in the chest with a booted foot. The second and third overwhelmed and dragged him from the carriage. The fourth dealt him a horrendous blow to the jaw.</p><p>Oh, my sweet Lord! They were going to kill him. George felt a second scream clog her throat. The gig jolted as the horse half-reared. It was frightened and trying to run, stupid animal, even though it had nowhere to go. George frantically scrabbled for the reins on the floor of the gig, cursing under her breath and banging her head against the seat.</p><p>\u201cWatch it! He\u2019s got a knife!\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t Mr. Pye\u2019s voice. George chanced raising her head and saw to her relief that Harry Pye did indeed have a knife. He held a thin, gleaming blade in his left hand. Even from this distance it looked rather nasty. He was in a strangely graceful fighter\u2019s crouch in the road, both hands in front of him. He appeared to know what he was doing, too. One of the villains was bleeding from his cheek. But the other three were circling, trying to flank him, and the odds didn\u2019t look good.</p><p>The gig lurched again. She lost sight of the action as she fell and cracked her shoulder against the seat.</p> <p>\u201cWill you hold still, you silly beast?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>The reins were sliding toward the front, and if she lost them, she\u2019d never get control of the gig. Shouts and grunts came from the fighters, interspersed with the awful sound of fists hitting flesh. She daren\u2019t risk looking up again. She held on to the seat with one hand to steady herself and strained with the other toward the slithering reins. Almost. Her fingertips grazed the leather, but the horse jolted, sending her back against the seat. She just kept her footing. If the horse would only hold still.</p><p>One.</p><p>More.</p><p>Second.</p><p>She dived and triumphantly came up with the reins. Quickly she sawed them, little minding the horse\u2019s mouth, and tied them to the seat. She chanced a glance. Harry Pye was bleeding from his forehead. As she watched, an attacker lunged at him from his right. Mr. Pye whirled in a powerful move and kicked at the other man\u2019s legs. A second thug clawed at his left arm. Mr. Pye twisted and performed some sort of maneuver, too fast for her to see. The man screamed and staggered back with a bloody hand. But the first man took advantage of the distraction. He hit Mr. Pye again and again in the middle. Harry Pye grunted with each blow, doubling over, valiantly trying to swing his knife.</p><p>George set the carriage brake.</p><p>The third and fourth men advanced. The first man punched Mr. Pye once more, and he fell to his knees, retching.</p> <p>Mr. Pye was going to die.</p><p>Ohmygodohmygodohmygod! George scrambled under the seat and brought up a sackcloth-wrapped bundle. Shaking the cloth free, she clutched one of the dueling pistols in her right hand, raised it with a straight arm, aimed at the man standing over Mr. Pye, and fired.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The explosion nearly deafened her. She squinted through the smoke and saw the man reel away, clutching his side. Got the bastard! She felt a thrill of bloodthirsty glee. The remaining men, including Harry Pye, had turned in her direction with varying degrees of shock and horror. She raised the second pistol and took aim at another man.</p><p>The man flinched and ducked. \u201cGorblimey! She\u2019s got a pistol!\u201d</p><p>Apparently the thought that she might be dangerous had never crossed their minds.</p><p>Harry Pye rose, pivoted silently, and slashed at the man nearest him.</p><p>\u201cJaysus!\u201d the man screamed, holding a hand to his bloody face. \u201cLet\u2019s go, lads!\u201d The thugs turned and dashed back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>The lane was suddenly quiet.</p><p>George heard the blood rushing in her veins. She carefully set the pistols down on the seat.</p><p>Mr. Pye still looked in the direction the men had disappeared. He seemed to decide that they were gone, for he lowered the hand holding the knife. Bending, he slipped it inside his boot. Then he turned to her. The blood from the wound on his forehead had mixed with sweat and smeared down the side of his face. Stray hairs from his queue stuck to the gore. He breathed deeply, his nostrils flaring as he tried to catch his breath.</p><p>George felt strange, almost angry.</p><p>He walked toward her, his boots scraping against the rocks in the road. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019d brought pistols?\u201d His voice was raspy and deep. It demanded apology, concession, even submission.</p><p>George didn\u2019t feel like giving any.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d she began firmly, strongly, even haughtily.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a chance to finish because he was in front of her. He grabbed her about the waist and yanked her from the carriage. She half-fell against him. She put her hands on his shoulders to keep from toppling over. He pulled her against him until her breasts were quite squashed into his chest, which, strangely, felt very nice. She lifted her head to ask him what, exactly, he thought he was about\u2014</p><p>And he kissed her!</p><p>Luscious, firm lips that tasted of the wine they\u2019d drunk at luncheon. They moved over hers in an insistent rhythm. She could feel the prickle of his stubble and his tongue, running over the crease of her lips until she opened them and then... Ohm. Someone was moaning, and it might very well be her because she had never, never, never been kissed like this before in her whole life. His tongue was actually inside her mouth, stroking and teasing hers. She was about to melt\u2014maybe she already was melting, she felt absolutely drenched. And then he lured her tongue into his mouth and suckled it, and she lost all control and wrapped her arms about his neck and suckled him back.</p><p>The horse\u2014stupid, stupid animal\u2014chose that moment to whicker.</p><p>Mr. Pye jerked his head away. He glanced around. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I,\u201d George said. She tried to pull his head back down so he would do it again.</p><p>But suddenly he picked her up and deposited her on the carriage seat. While she was still blinking, he crossed to the other side and jumped in.</p><p>Mr. Pye placed the still-loaded pistol in her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous here. They may decide to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>All her life she\u2019d been warned that men were slaves to their desires, that they held their impulses in barely controlled check. A woman\u2014a lady\u2014must be very, very careful of her actions so she did not put spark to the gunpowder that was a man\u2019s libido. The consequences of a lady\u2019s carelessness were never fully explained, but the hints were dire indeed. George sighed. How deflating now to find Harry Pye was the exception to the rule of male instability.</p><p>He maneuvered the gig around, alternately cursing and cajoling the horse. Finally he got it turned back the way they\u2019d come and urged the gelding into a brisk trot. George watched him. His face was grimly set. There was no evidence of the passion with which he\u2019d kissed her only moments ago.</p><p>Well, if he could be sophisticated, then so could she. \u201cDo you think Lord Granville had those men attack us, Mr. Pye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey attacked only me. So, yes, it could be Lord Granville. He\u2019s the most likely.\u201d He looked thoughtful. \u201cBut Thomas Granville rode up the lane only minutes before we did. He could\u2019ve warned the toughs if they were in his pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he is in league with his father, despite his apology?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pye pulled a handkerchief out of an inside pocket and gently wiped her cheek with one hand. The handkerchief came away with blood on it. He must have rubbed his blood on her when they\u2019d kissed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sure of.\u201d</p><p>George cleared her throat. \u201cWhat is that, Mr. Pye?\u201d</p><p>He tucked away his handkerchief. \u201cYou can call me Harry now.\u201d</p><p>HARRY PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR to the Cock and Worm and was immediately smothered in smoke. West Dikey, the village closest to Woldsly Manor, was just large enough to boast two taverns. The first, the White Mare, was a half-timbered building with a few rooms and could be called an inn. Because of this, it offered meals and drew the more respectable business: passing travelers, local merchants, and even gentry.</p><p>The Cock and Worm was where everyone else went.</p><p>A series of dingy rooms with exposed beams that had caught more than one customer a nasty knock on the head, the Cock and Worm had windows permanently blackened from pipe smoke. A man could sit in peace here and not be recognized by his own brother.</p><p>Harry made his way through the crowd to the bar, passing a table of workmen and farmers. One of the men\u2014a farmer named Mallow\u2014looked up and nodded in greeting as he passed. Harry nodded back, surprised but pleased. Mallow had asked Harry for help back in June about an argument he was having over his neighbor\u2019s cow. The cow kept escaping its enclosure and had twice trampled the lettuce in the Mallow\u2019s kitchen garden. Harry had settled the difficulty by helping the elderly neighbor build a new wall for his cow. But Mallow was a taciturn man and had never thanked Harry for his trouble. Harry had assumed Mallow was ungrateful. Obviously, he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>The thought warmed him as he reached the bar. Janie was working tonight. She was sister to Dick Crumb, the owner of the Cock and Worm, and sometimes helped at the counter.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she mumbled. Janie spoke to the air over his right shoulder. Her fingernails drummed an uneven beat on the counter.</p><p>\u201cPint of bitter.\u201d</p><p>She set the ale down in front of him, and he slid a few coppers across the scarred counter.</p><p>\u201cDick in tonight?\u201d Harry asked quietly.</p><p>Janie was close enough to hear, but her face was blank. She\u2019d gone back to the drumming.</p><p>\u201cJanie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d She stared now at his left elbow.</p><p>\u201cIs Dick in?\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked into the back.</p><p>Harry sighed and found an empty table near a wall. With Janie it was hard to tell if she\u2019d gone to tell Dick he was here, went to fetch more ale, or simply tired of his question. In any case, he could wait.</p><p>He\u2019d gone stark, raving mad. Harry took a sip of his beer and wiped the foam from his mouth. It was the only explanation for kissing Lady Georgina this afternoon. He\u2019d walked toward her, his head bleeding and his gut aching from the beating. He hadn\u2019t been thinking of kissing her at all. Then somehow she was in his arms, and there was nothing in the world that was going to stop him from tasting her. Not the possibility of being attacked again. Not the pain in his limbs. Not even the fact that she was aristocracy, for pity\u2019s sake, and all that meant to him and his ghosts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lunacy. Plain and simple. Next he\u2019d be running through the high street, naked and waving his John Thomas. He took another glum sip. And what a fine sight that would be, the state his cock had been in lately.</p><p>He was a normal man. He\u2019d felt lust for a woman before. But at those times he\u2019d either bedded the woman, if she was free, or made do with his hand. Over and done with. He\u2019d never had this aching, restless feeling, a longing for something he knew damn well he couldn\u2019t have. Harry scowled into his mug. Maybe it was time for another ale.</p><p>\u201cHope that look isn\u2019t for me, lad.\u201d Two mugs were slammed down in front of him, foam sloshing over their tops. \u201cHave one on the house.\u201d</p><p>Dick Crumb slid his belly, covered in a stained apron, under the table and took a swig from his mug. Small, piggy eyes closed in ecstasy as the beer slid down his throat. He took out a flannel cloth and mopped his mouth, his face, and his bald pate. Dick was a large man, and he sweated all the time, the bare dome of his head shining greasy red. He sported a tiny gray pigtail, scraped together from the oily strands of hair still clinging to the sides and back of his head.</p> <p>\u201cJanie told me you were out here,\u201d Dick said. \u201cBeen a while since you stopped by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was set on by four men today. On Granville land. Do you know anything about it?\u201d Harry raised his mug and watched Dick over the rim. Something flickered in the piggy eyes. Relief?</p><p>\u201cFour men, you say?\u201d Dick traced a wet spot on the table. \u201cLucky you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Georgina had a pair of pistols.\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s eyebrows flew up to where his hairline should have been. \u201cThat so? You were with the lady, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Dick sat back and tipped his face to the ceiling. He took out the flannel and began wiping his head.</p><p>Harry was silent. Dick was thinking, and there was no point in hurrying him. He sipped his ale.</p><p>\u201cSee here.\u201d Dick sat forward. \u201cThe Timmons brothers usually stop in at night, Ben and Hubert. But tonight only Ben\u2019s been by, and he was limping a bit. Said he was kicked by a horse, but that don\u2019t seem likely, do it, seeing as how the Timmons haven\u2019t got a horse.\u201d He nodded triumphantly and upended his mug again.</p><p>\u201cWho do the Timmons work for, d\u2019you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe-ell.\u201d Dick stretched the word out as he scratched his head. \u201cThey\u2019re jacks-of-all-trades, see. But they mostly help out Hitchcock, who tenants for Granville.\u201d</p> <p>Harry nodded, unsurprised. \u201cGranville was behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Dick shrugged and raised his mug.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Harry said softly, \u201cwho do you think killed Granville\u2019s sheep?\u201d</p><p>Dick, caught as he swallowed, choked. Out came the flannel again. \u201cAs to that,\u201d he gasped when he could speak again, \u201cI figured like everyone else in these parts that it was you.\u201d</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade sense, what Granville did to you, did to your father.\u201d</p> <p>Harry was silent.</p><p>Which must\u2019ve made Dick uneasy. He patted the air. \u201cBut after I\u2019d mulled on it a bit, it didn\u2019t seem right. I knew your da, and John Pye wouldn\u2019t never hurt another man\u2019s bread and butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after Granville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour da was the salt of the earth, lad. He wouldn\u2019t have harmed a fly.\u201d Dick raised his mug as if in toast. \u201cThe salt of the earth.\u201d</p><p>Harry was silent as he watched the other man make his tribute. Then he stirred. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ruled me out, who do you think is poisoning the sheep?\u201d</p><p>Dick frowned into the bottom of his empty mug. \u201cGranville\u2019s a hard man, as well you know. Some say he\u2019s got the devil riding his back. It\u2019s as if he takes his joy in life from causing misery to others. There\u2019s more than your father that\u2019ve been blasted by him over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of men were thrown off land their families had farmed for decades. Granville don\u2019t make allowances for bad years when he collects his money,\u201d Dick said slowly. \u201cThen there was Sally Forthright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was Martha Burns\u2019s sister, as is the Woldsly gatekeeper\u2019s wife. Granville messed with her, it\u2019s said, and the lass ended her life in a well.\u201d Dick shook his head. \u201cWasn\u2019t more than fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are probably many like her in these parts\u201d\u2014Harry studied the depths of his own mug\u2014\u201cknowing Granville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Dick turned his face to the side and wiped it with the flannel. He sighed heavily. \u201cBad business. I don\u2019t like talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I, but someone\u2019s killing those sheep.\u201d</p><p>Dick suddenly leaned across the table. His ale-soaked breath washed over Harry as he whispered, \u201cThen maybe you should be looking a little closer to the Granville estate. They say Granville treats his firstborn son like a turd in his tea. The man must be your age, Harry. Can you imagine what that would do to your soul after thirty years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Harry nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep Thomas in mind.\u201d He drained his mug and set it down. \u201cIs that everyone you can think of?\u201d</p><p>Dick grabbed all three mugs in one fist and stood up. He hesitated. \u201cYou might try Annie Pollard\u2019s family. I don\u2019t know what went on there, but it was bad, and Granville was in the middle of it. And, Harry?\u201d</p><p>Harry had risen and put on his hat. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from aristo ladies.\u201d The piggy eyes were sad and old. \u201cThey won\u2019t do you any good, lad.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS WELL PAST MIDNIGHT, the moon hanging high and full like a swollen pale pumpkin, when Harry crossed through the Woldsly gates later that night. The first thing he saw was Lady Georgina\u2019s carriage standing in the drive. The horses hung their heads, asleep, and the coachman gave him a dirty look as Harry turned into the track leading to his cottage. The man had obviously been waiting a while.</p><p>Harry shook his head. What was she doing at his cottage, the second night in a row? Was she bent on plaguing him into an early grave? Or did she see him as something to amuse herself with here in the country? The last thought made him scowl as he stabled his mare. He was scowling still when he walked into his cottage. But the sight that met his eyes made him stop and sigh.</p><p>Lady Georgina was asleep in his high-backed chair.</p><p>The fire had died to glowing coals beside her. Had the coachman lit it for her, or had she managed on her own this time? Her head was tilted back, her long slim throat exposed trustingly. She\u2019d covered herself with a cloak, but it had slid down, pooling at her feet.</p><p>Harry sighed again and picked up her cloak, laying it gently over her. She never stirred. He took off his own cloak, hung it on a knob by the door, and advanced to stir the coals. On the mantelpiece above the hearth, the carved animals had been placed into pairs, facing each other as if they were dancing a reel. He stared at them a moment, wondering how long she\u2019d been waiting. He laid more wood on the fire and straightened. He wasn\u2019t sleepy, despite the hour and drinking two pints.</p><p>He went to the shelves, took down a box, and brought it to the table. Inside was a short, pearl-handled knife and a piece of cherrywood about half the size of his palm. He sat at the table and turned the wood over in his hands, rubbing the grain with a thumb. He\u2019d thought at first of making a fox from it\u2014the wood was the reddish-orange color of a fox\u2019s fur\u2014but now he wasn\u2019t sure. He picked up the knife and made the first cut.</p><p>The fire crackled and a log fell.</p><p>After a while he looked up. Lady Georgina was watching him, her cheek cradled in one palm. Their eyes met, and he looked back down at the carving.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you make all of them?\u201d Her voice was low, throaty from sleep.</p><p>Did she sound like that in the morning, lying in her silk sheets, her body warm and moist? He pushed the thought aside and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty knife.\u201d She shifted to face him, curling her feet on the chair. \u201cMuch nicer than the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nasty-looking one in your boot. I like this one better.\u201d</p><p>He made a shallow cut, and a curling strip of wood fell to the table.</p><p>\u201cDid your father give it to you?\u201d She spoke slowly, sleepily, and it made him hard.</p><p>He opened his fist and stared at the pearl handle, remembering. \u201cNo, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head a little at that. \u201cI thought I was to call you Harry and you could call me George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair.\u201d She was frowning.</p><p>\u201cLife seldom is, my lady.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders, trying to relieve the tightness. \u2019Course, the tightness was mostly in his balls, not his shoulders. And shrugging sure as hell wouldn\u2019t help that.</p><p>She stared at him a minute longer, and then turned to look into the fire.</p><p>He felt the moment her eyes left him.</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cDo you recall the fairy tale I told you, the one about the enchanted leopard that was really a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that he wore a golden chain around his neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on the chain there was a tiny emerald crown? Did I say that?\u201d She\u2019d turned back to him again.</p><p>He frowned at the cherrywood. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I forget the details.\u201d She yawned. \u201cWell, he was really a prince, and on his chain there was a tiny crown with an emerald in it, the exact green color of the Leopard Prince\u2019s eyes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in your story before, my lady,\u201d he cut in. \u201cThe color of his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did just tell you that sometimes I forget the details.\u201d She blinked at him innocently.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Harry started carving again.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the young king had sent the Leopard Prince to get the Golden Horse from the evil ogre. You do remember that part, don\u2019t you?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cSo the Leopard Prince changed into a man, and he held the emerald crown on his golden chain...\u201d</p><p>Harry looked up as she trailed off.</p><p>Lady Georgina was staring into the fire and tapping a finger against her lips. \u201cDo you suppose that was the only thing he was wearing?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, she was going to kill him. His cock, which had started subsiding, leaped up again.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if he was a leopard before, he couldn\u2019t very well have been wearing clothes, could he? And then when he changed into a man, well, I think he\u2019d have to be nude, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Harry shifted on his chair, glad the table hid his lap.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lady Georgina pondered a moment more, and then shook her head. \u201cSo he was standing there, evidently in the nude, grasping the crown, and he said, \u2018I wish for an impenetrable suit of armor and the strongest sword in the world.\u2019 And what do you suppose happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got the armor and sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Lady Georgina seemed put out that he\u2019d guessed what any three-year-old could\u2019ve. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t ordinary weapons. The armor was pure gold, and the sword was made of glass. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it doesn\u2019t sound very practical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet a woman made this story up.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows arched at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe sword would break the first time he swung it, and the armor would give to even a weak blow. Gold\u2019s a soft metal, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d She tapped her lips again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry returned to his whittling. Women.</p><p>\u201cThey must\u2019ve been enchanted, too.\u201d Lady Georgina waved away the problem of faulty equipment. \u201cSo he went and got the Golden Horse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Just like that?\u201d He stared at her, an odd sense of frustration filling his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there a grand fight, then?\u201d He gestured with the wood. \u201cA struggle to the death between this Leopard Prince and the evil ogre? The ogre must\u2019ve been a tough bird, others would\u2019ve tried to take his prize before. What made our fellow so special that he could defeat him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe armor and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the silly glass sword. Yes, all right, but others would\u2019ve had magical weapons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an enchanted leopard prince!\u201d Lady Georgina was angry now. \u201cHe\u2019s better, stronger, than all the others. He could\u2019ve defeated the evil ogre with a single blow, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Harry felt his face heat, and his words came too fast. \u201cIf he\u2019s as powerful as all that, my lady, then why doesn\u2019t he free himself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just walk away from spoiled kings and ridiculous chores? Why is he enslaved at all?\u201d He threw down his whittling. The knife skittered across the table and slid to the floor.</p><p>Lady Georgina bent to pick it up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry.\u201d She offered the knife to him on the palm of her outstretched hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I think you\u2019d better go back to your manor now, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She placed the knife on the table. \u201cIf your father didn\u2019t give you this, then who did?\u201d</p><p>She asked all the wrong questions. All the questions he wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014answer, either for himself or for her, and she never stopped. Why was she playing this game with him?</p> <p>Silently he picked up her cloak and held it out for her. She looked into his face, and then turned so he could drape it about her shoulders. The perfume in her hair reached his nostrils. He closed his eyes in something very like agony.</p><p>\u201cWill you kiss me again?\u201d she whispered. Her back was still toward him.</p><p>He snatched his hands away. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He strode past her and opened the door. He had to occupy his hands so that he wouldn\u2019t grab her and pull her body into his and kiss her until there was no tomorrow.</p><p>Her gaze met his, and her eyes were deep pools of blue. A man could dive in there and never care when he drowned. \u201cNot even if I want you to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She moved past him and out into the night. \u201cGood night, Harry Pye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, my lady.\u201d He shut the door and leaned against it, breathing in the lingering traces of her perfume.</p> <p>Then he straightened and walked away. Long ago he had railed against the order of things that deemed him inferior to men who had neither brains nor morals. It hadn\u2019t mattered.</p><p>He railed against fate no more.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cTiggle, why do you think gentlemen kiss ladies?\u201d George adjusted the gauze fichu tucked into the neckline of her dress.</p><p>Today she wore a lemon-colored gown patterned with turquoise and scarlet birds. Miniscule scarlet ruffles lined the square neck, and cascades of lace fell from the elbows. The whole thing was simply delicious, if she did say so herself.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one reason a man kisses a woman, my lady.\u201d Tiggle had several hairpins stuck between her lips as she arranged George\u2019s hair, and her words were a bit indistinct. \u201cHe wants to bed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d George wrinkled her nose at herself in the mirror. \u201cI mean, might he kiss a woman just to show, I don\u2019t know, friendship or something?\u201d</p><p>The lady\u2019s maid snorted and placed a hairpin in George\u2019s coiffure. \u201cNot likely. Not unless he thinks bedsport a part of friendship. No, mark my words, my lady, the better half of a man\u2019s mind is taken up with how to get a woman into bed. And the rest\u201d\u2014Tiggle stepped back to look critically at her creation\u2014\u201cis probably spent on gambling and horses and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d George was diverted by the thought of all the men she knew, butlers and coachmen and her brothers and vicars and tinkers and all manner of men, going about thinking primarily of bedsport. \u201cBut what about philosophers and men of letters? Obviously they\u2019re spending quite a lot of time thinking of something else?\u201d</p><p>Tiggle shook her head sagely. \u201cAny man not thinking about bedsport has something the matter with him, my lady, philosopher or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She began arranging the hairpins on the vanity top into a zigzag pattern. \u201cBut what if a man kisses a woman and then refuses to do so again? Even when encouraged?\u201d</p><p>There was silence behind her. She glanced up to meet Tiggle\u2019s gaze in the mirror.</p><p>The lady\u2019s maid had two lines between her brows that hadn\u2019t been there before. \u201cThen he must have a very good reason not to kiss her, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course, in my experience,\u201d Tiggle spoke carefully, \u201cmen can be persuaded into kissing and the like awful easy.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cTruly? Even if he\u2019s... reluctant?\u201d</p><p>The maid nodded once. \u201cEven against their own will. Well, they can\u2019t help it, can they, poor dears? It\u2019s just the way they\u2019re made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d George rose and impulsively hugged the other woman. \u201cYou have the most interesting knowledge, Tiggle. I can\u2019t tell you how helpful this conversation has been.\u201d</p><p>Tiggle looked alarmed. \u201cJust so you\u2019re careful, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will be.\u201d George sailed out of her bedroom.</p><p>She hurried down the mahogany staircase and entered the sunny morning room where breakfast was served. Violet was already drinking tea at the gilt table.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweetheart.\u201d George crossed to the sideboard and was pleased to see that Cook had made buttered kippers.</p><p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d Kippers started the morning so nicely. A day could never be all bad if it had kippers in it.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night? I was here, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d She sat down across from Violet and reached for her fork.</p><p>\u201cI meant before you came in. At one o\u2019clock in the morning, I might add.\u201d Violet\u2019s voice was a wee bit strident. \u201cWhere were you then?\u201d</p><p>George sighed and lowered her fork. Poor kippers. \u201cI was out on an errand.\u201d</p><p>Violet eyed her sister in a way that reminded George of a long-ago governess. That lady had been well past her fiftieth decade. How did a girl hardly out of the schoolroom manage so severe an expression?</p><p>\u201cAn errand at midnight?\u201d Violet asked. \u201cWhat could you possibly have been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was consulting Mr. Pye, if you must know, dear. About the sheep poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye?\u201d Violet squawked. \u201cMr. Pye is the one poisoning the sheep! What do you need to consult him about?\u201d</p><p>George stared, taken aback at her sister\u2019s vehemence. \u201cWell, we interviewed one of the farmers yesterday, and he told us that hemlock was the poison being used. And we were going to inquire of another farmer, but there was an incident on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn incident.\u201d</p><p>George winced. \u201cWe had a bit of trouble with some men attacking Mr. Pye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttacking Mr. Pye?\u201d Violet pounced on the words. \u201cWhile you were with him? You might have been hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye acquitted himself very well, and I\u2019d brought the pistols Aunt Clara left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, George,\u201d Violet sighed. \u201cCan\u2019t you see the trouble he\u2019s causing you? You must turn him over to Lord Granville so he can be properly punished. I heard how you sent Lord Granville away the other day when he came for Mr. Pye. You\u2019re just being contrary; you know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe he is the poisoner. I thought you understood that.\u201d</p><p>It was Violet\u2019s turn to stare. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>George got up to pour herself some more tea. \u201cI don\u2019t think a man of Mr. Pye\u2019s character would commit a crime like this.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the table to find her sister gawking, horrified. \u201cYou\u2019re not infatuated with Mr. Pye, are you? It\u2019s so awful when a lady of your age starts mooning over a man.\u201d</p><p>Mooning? George stiffened. \u201cContrary to your opinion, eight and twenty is not actually in one\u2019s dotage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s an age when a lady should know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have some sense of propriety by now. You should be more dignified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDignified!\u201d</p><p>Violet slapped the table, making the silverware rattle. \u201cYou don\u2019t care what others think about you. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d George asked, genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d Violet wailed. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. Just because Aunt Clara left you piles of money and land you think you can do anything you want. You never stop to consider those around you and how your actions might affect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d George set down her cup. \u201cI simply don\u2019t believe a tendre I may or may not have is any of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my business when what you do reflects on the family. On me.\u201d Violet stood up so abruptly her teacup overturned. An ugly brown stain started migrating across the tablecloth. \u201cYou know very well it isn\u2019t proper to be alone with a man like Mr. Pye, and yet you\u2019re having sordid assignations with him at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet! That\u2019s quite enough.\u201d George was startled at her own anger. She hardly ever raised her voice to her younger sister. Quickly she held out a hand in appeasement, but it was too late.</p><p>Violet was beet red and had tears in her eyes. \u201cFine!\u201d she shouted. \u201cMake a fool of yourself over some baseborn yokel! He\u2019s probably only interested in your money, anyway!\u201d The last words hung horribly in the air.</p><p>Violet looked stricken for a moment; then she spun violently and ran out the door.</p><p>George pushed her plate aside and laid her head in her arms. It wasn\u2019t a day for kippers after all.</p><p>VIOLET POUNDED UP THE STAIRS, her vision blurred. Why, oh why must things change? Why couldn\u2019t everything stay the same? At the top, she turned right, striding as fast as possible in her voluminous skirts. A door ahead of her opened. She tried to duck away but wasn\u2019t quick enough.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite flushed, dear. Is something amiss?\u201d Euphie looked at her worriedly, blocking Violet from her own room farther down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cI... I have a slight headache. I was just going to lie down.\u201d Violet tried a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow horrible headaches are,\u201d Euphie exclaimed. \u201cI shall send up a maid with a basin of cool water for your brow. Make sure to lay a damp cloth on your forehead and change it every ten minutes. Now, where did I put my powder? It\u2019s very useful for headaches.\u201d</p><p>Violet felt like screaming as Euphie went into a dither that looked like it might last for hours.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I think I\u2019ll be all right if I just lie down.\u201d Violet leaned forward and whispered, \u201cMy woman\u2019s flow, you know.\u201d</p><p>If anything was likely to stop Euphie, it was mention of women\u2019s matters. She turned bright red and averted her eyes as if Violet was wearing a sign proclaiming her condition.</p><p>\u201cOh, I comprehend, dear. Well, then, you just go lie down. And I\u2019ll see if I can find my powder.\u201d She half-covered her mouth with her hand and hissed, \u201cIt\u2019s good for that as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Violet sighed, realizing there was no way she could get away without accepting Euphie\u2019s help. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you. Perhaps you can give it to my maid when you find it?\u201d</p><p>Euphie nodded, and after further detailed instructions on how to deal with that, Violet was mercifully able to escape. In her room, she closed and locked the door, and then crossed to sit on the window seat. Her room was one of the prettiest in Woldsly, although it was by no means the biggest. Faded yellow and blue striped silk hung on the walls, and the carpet was an ancient Persian in blues and reds. Normally, Violet adored the room. But now it had begun to rain again outside, the wind spitting drops against the window and rattling the panes. Had the sun shone at all since she\u2019d come to Yorkshire? She leaned her forehead against the glass and watched as her breath fogged the window. The fire had died on the grate, and her room was dim and cold, perfectly suiting her mood.</p><p>Her life was in utter shambles, and it was all her fault. Her eyes burned again, and she swiped at them angrily. She\u2019d cried enough in the last two months to float a fleet of ships, and it hadn\u2019t done a lick of good. Oh, if only one could go back and have a second chance to do things over. She\u2019d never do it again, not if she had a second chance. She\u2019d know that the feelings\u2014so desperate and urgent at the time\u2014would fade soon enough.</p><p>She hugged a blue silk cushion to her chest as the window blurred before her eyes. It hadn\u2019t helped to run away. She\u2019d thought that, surely, if she left Leicestershire, she\u2019d soon forget. But she hadn\u2019t, and now all her problems had followed her to Yorkshire. And George\u2014staid George, funny older sister so firmly on the shelf with her flyaway hair and love of fairy tales\u2014George was acting strange, hardly noticing Violet at all and spending all her time with that dreadful man. George was so na\u00efve, it probably never occurred to her that nasty Mr. Pye was after her fortune.</p> <p>Or worse.</p><p>Well, that at least she could do something about. Violet tumbled off the window seat and ran to her escritoire. She pulled out drawers and rummaged through them until she found a sheet of writing paper. Uncapping her ink bottle, she sat down. George would never listen to her, but there was one person she had to obey.</p><p>She dipped her quill in the ink and began to write.</p><p>\u201cWHY HAVE YOU NEVER MARRIED, Mr. Pye?\u201d Lady Georgina stressed his surname just to irritate him, Harry was sure.</p><p>Today, she wore a yellow dress printed with birds like none he\u2019d ever seen\u2014some of them had three wings. She did look fetching in it, he had to admit. She had one of those scarf things that women wore tucked into her bodice. It was almost transparent, giving him a teasing hint of her titties. That irritated him as well. And the fact that she was beside him in the gig again, despite his strong objections, pretty much put a cap on things. At least the relentless rain had let up for a bit today, although the sky was an ominous gray. He hoped they could reach the first cottage before they were soaked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Harry spoke curtly, a tone he would never have taken with her a week ago. The horse seemed to sense his mood and jogged sideways, jolting the gig. Harry tightened the reins to bring the nag back on the track. \u201cI haven\u2019t met the right woman yet, likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would be the right woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have some idea,\u201d she stated with aristocratic certainty. \u201cDo you fancy a golden-haired girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr do you prefer black-haired maidens? I once knew a man who would only dance with short, black-haired ladies, not that any of them wanted to dance with him, mind you, but that never seemed to occur to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not particular as to hair,\u201d he muttered when she paused to take a breath. Lady Georgina opened her mouth again, but he\u2019d had enough. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you married, my lady?\u201d</p><p>There. Let her stew on that a bit.</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cIt is rather hard to find a promising gentleman. I sometimes think it would be easier to find a goose that really did lay golden eggs. So many of the gentlemen in society haven\u2019t a thought to their head, truly. They consider being knowledgeable about hunting or hounds sufficient and don\u2019t worry with anything else. And one must make conversation about something at the breakfast table. Wouldn\u2019t it be awful to be in a marriage with a lot of awkward pauses?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never thought about it. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Nothing but the clicking of the silverware against the china and the slurping of tea. Horrible. Then there are the ones who wear corsets and use rouge and patches.\u201d She scrunched up her nose. \u201cHave you any idea how unappetizing it is to kiss a man wearing rouge on his lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry frowned. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I have it on good authority that it\u2019s not an experience one would want to repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d That was about the only thing he could think to say, but it seemed to do.</p> <p>\u201cI was engaged once.\u201d She gazed idly at a herd of cows they were passing.</p><p>Harry straightened. \u201cReally? What happened?\u201d Had some lordling jilted her?</p><p>\u201cI was only nineteen, which, in my opinion, is a rather dangerous age. One is old enough to know quite a bit but not wise enough to realize there are many things that one doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Lady Georgina paused and looked around. \u201cWhere, exactly, are we going today?\u201d</p><p>They had crossed into Granville land.</p><p>\u201cTo the Pollard cottage,\u201d he said. What had happened with her engagement? \u201cYou were talking about when you were nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found myself engaged to Paul Fitzsimmons; that was his name, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that part,\u201d he nearly growled. \u201cBut how did you get engaged, and how did it end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a trifle fuzzy about how I got engaged.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, brows raised.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true.\u201d She sounded defensive now. \u201cOne moment I was strolling on the terrace with Paul at a dance, discussing Mr. Huelly\u2019s wig\u2014it was pink, can you imagine?\u2014and then suddenly, boom! I was engaged.\u201d She looked at him as if this made perfect sense.</p><p>He sighed. That was probably the best he would get out of her. \u201cAnd it fell through how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long afterward, I discovered that my bosom beau, Nora Smyth-Fielding, was in love with Paul. And when I saw that, it was a short step to realizing that he was in love with her. Although\u201d\u2014Lady Georgina frowned\u2014\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why he asked me to marry him when he so obviously doted on Nora. Perhaps he was confused, poor man.\u201d</p><p>Poor man, my arse. This Fitzsimmons sounded like a half-wit. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI broke the engagement off, of course.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Too bad he hadn\u2019t been around to show the bastard proper manners. The fellow sounded like he could do with a bloody nose. Harry grunted. \u201cMakes sense that you\u2019d have trouble trusting a man after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it like that. But you know, I think it\u2019s Aunt Clara\u2019s inheritance that is the bigger barrier to finding a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could an inheritance be a barrier?\u201d he asked. \u201cI would have thought it would bring the men flocking like crows to a carcass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a delightful simile, Mr. Pye.\u201d Lady Georgina had narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>He winced. \u201cWhat I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant was that due to Aunt Clara\u2019s inheritance, I don\u2019t ever have to marry because of financial reasons. Thus, it becomes much less pressing to think about gentlemen in terms of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t stop me from thinking of gentlemen in other terms.\u201d</p><p>Other terms? He looked at her.</p><p>She was blushing. \u201cThan marriage, that is.\u201d</p><p>He tried to work out that convoluted statement, but he had already turned the gig into a rutted lane. Now he pulled the horse to a stop beside a wretched cottage. Had he not been told otherwise, he would never have guessed anyone lived here. Built in the same shape as the Oldson cottage, this one was much different. The thatched roof was black and rotten, and one part had fallen in. Weeds grew along the walk, and the door hung at an angle.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should stay here, my lady,\u201d he tried. But she was already climbing down from the gig without his help.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and held out his arm pointedly. She took it without protest, wrapping her fingers around him. He could feel her warmth through his coat, and it soothed him somehow. They walked to the door. Harry knocked on it, hoping he wouldn\u2019t bring the whole place down.</p><p>Sounds of movement came from within, and then stopped. No one answered the door. Harry banged on the door again and waited. He was raising his arm to try a third time, when the old wood creaked open. A boy of about eight stood mutely in the doorway. His hair, greasy and overlong, hung in his brown eyes. He was barefoot and wore clothes gray with age.</p><p>\u201cIs your mother at home?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cWho is it, lad?\u201d The voice was harsh, but it held no malice.</p><p>\u201cGentry, Gran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A woman appeared behind the boy. She was nearly as tall as a man, rawboned and strong-looking despite her age, but her eyes were bewildered and fearful, as though angels had come calling at her doorstep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve some questions to ask you. About Annie Pollard,\u201d Harry said. The woman simply continued to stare. He might\u2019ve been speaking French. \u201cThis is the Pollard cottage, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like to talk about Annie.\u201d The woman looked down at the boy, who hadn\u2019t taken his gaze away from Harry\u2019s face. Abruptly, she cuffed him across the back of the head. \u201cGo on! Go find something to do.\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t even blink, just walked past them and around the corner of the cottage. Maybe that was how his grandmother always spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Annie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that she was involved with Lord Granville,\u201d he started cautiously.</p><p>\u201cInvolved? Aye, that\u2019s a pretty word for what it was.\u201d The woman curled her lip to reveal dark gaps where her front teeth had been. Her pink tongue poked through. \u201cWhy do you want to know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s killing sheep,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Annie or perhaps someone close to her might have a reason for doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about those sheep.\u201d She started to close the door.</p><p>Harry stuck his boot in the crack. \u201cDoes Annie?\u201d</p><p>She shook.</p><p>Harry thought at first that he might have driven her to tears, then she raised her head, and he saw her face was split by a grotesque smile.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she does, does Annie,\u201d she wheezed. \u201cIf they know about the doings of the living in the fires of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s dead?\u201d Lady Georgina spoke for the first time.</p><p>Her crisp accent seemed to sober the woman. \u201cEither that or might as well be.\u201d She leaned tiredly against the door. \u201cHer name was Annie Baker, you know. She was married. At least she was until he came sniffing after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Granville?\u201d Lady Georgina murmured.</p><p>\u201cAye. The devil hisself.\u201d The woman sucked in her upper lip. \u201cAnnie threw over Baker. She was Granville\u2019s whore for as long as he wanted her, which wasn\u2019t long. Came back here with her belly big and stayed just long enough to whelp. Then she took off again. Last I heard she was spreading her legs for a cup of gin.\u201d She looked suddenly wistful. \u201cA lass don\u2019t last long as a gin slut, do she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said quietly.</p><p>Lady Georgina looked stunned, and he was sorry he hadn\u2019t been able to talk her into staying behind at Woldsly Manor. He\u2019d dragged her into a cesspit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for telling us about Annie, Mrs. Pollard,\u201d Harry spoke gently to the old woman. Despite her hardened manner, it must have pained her to talk about ancient hurts. \u201cI\u2019ve only one more question, and then we\u2019ll bother you no more. Do you know what happened to Mr. Baker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him.\u201d Mrs. Pollard waved a hand as if flicking away a fly. \u201cBaker took up with another lass. I\u2019ve heard he even married her, though it can\u2019t be right in the church, him already married to Annie. Not that Annie cares. Not anymore.\u201d She closed the door.</p><p>Harry frowned, then decided he\u2019d questioned the old woman enough. \u201cCome, my lady.\u201d He took Lady Georgina\u2019s elbow and escorted her back up the path. As he was helping her into the gig, he glanced back.</p><p>The boy leaned on the corner of the cottage, head down, one bare foot on top of the other. He\u2019d probably heard every word his grandmother had said about his mother. There weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to solve all the problems of this world. Da had said that often enough when Harry had been growing up.</p> <p>\u201cWait a moment, my lady.\u201d Harry strode the short distance to the boy.</p><p>He looked up warily as Harry approached but didn\u2019t move otherwise.</p><p>Harry looked down at him. \u201cIf she dies, or you find yourself without, come to me. My name is Harry Pye. Repeat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Pye,\u201d the boy whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood. Here, see if she\u2019ll get you some clothes.\u201d</p> <p>He placed a shilling in the boy\u2019s hand and returned to the gig without waiting for thanks. It had been a sentimental gesture and one that was probably useless. The old woman was as likely to use the shilling for gin as to buy the boy new clothes. He climbed in the gig, ignoring Lady Georgina\u2019s smile, and took up the reins. When he glanced again at the boy, he was staring at the coin in his hand. They pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat an awful story.\u201d Her smile had died.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry looked sideways at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you heard it.\u201d He urged the horse into a trot. Best to be off Granville land as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in that family could be poisoning the sheep. The woman is too old and afraid, the boy too young, and it sounds like Annie\u2019s husband has got on with his life. Unless Annie came back?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf she\u2019s been at the gin stalls all this time, she\u2019s no threat to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Sheep grazed on either side of the road, a peaceful scene, in spite of the lowering clouds and rising wind. Harry watched the surrounding area narrowly. After yesterday, he was wary of an attack.</p> <p>\u201cHave you another farmer to visit today?\u201d Lady Georgina held her hat to her head with one hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady. I\u2014\u201d They topped a rise, and Harry caught sight of what lay on the other side. Abruptly he pulled on the reins. \u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><p>The gig rolled to a stop. Harry stared at three lumps of wool lying just inside the dry stone wall bordering the road.</p><p>\u201cAre they dead?\u201d Lady Georgina whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry tied off the reins, set the brake, and leaped from the gig.</p><p>They weren\u2019t the first to make the discovery. A sleek chestnut was tethered to the wall, shaking its head nervously. The owner, a man, had his back toward them, bent over one of the prone sheep. The man straightened, revealing his height. His hair was brown. The cut of his coat, flapping in the wind, was that of a gentleman. Just his luck Thomas would find the poisoned sheep first.</p><p>The man turned, and Harry\u2019s thoughts scattered. For a moment he couldn\u2019t think at all.</p><p>The man\u2019s shoulders were broader than Thomas\u2019s, his hair a shade lighter, curling around his ears. His face was broad and handsome, laugh lines framed his sensual lips, and his eyes had heavy lids. It couldn\u2019t be.</p> <p>The man approached and vaulted the stone wall easily. As he got nearer, his green eyes glowed like phosphorus. Harry felt Lady Georgina come alongside him. He realized absently that he\u2019d forgotten to help her from the gig.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d he heard her say, \u201cyou never told me you had a brother.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>It had always been her downfall: failing to think sufficiently before speaking. This was brought home to George rather emphatically when both men swung to look at her in shock. How was she to know it was some sort of dark secret? She\u2019d never seen eyes as green as Harry\u2019s, and yet here they were, the same green eyes, staring at her from another man\u2019s face. True, the other man was taller, and his features were of a different cast. But who, looking at their eyes, could draw any other conclusion than that they were brothers? She really couldn\u2019t be blamed.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d The stranger started forward. \u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Bennet Granville, my lady.\u201d Harry had recovered quicker than the other man and was now expressionless. \u201cGranville, Lady Georgina Maitland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Mr. Granville bowed correctly. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied and muttered the proper words by rote.</p><p>\u201cAnd Harry.\u201d For a moment, emotion flashed behind Mr. Granville\u2019s emerald eyes; then he controlled himself. \u201cIt\u2019s... been a while.\u201d</p><p>George nearly snorted. In another year or so, he\u2019d be as adept as Harry at hiding his thoughts. \u201cHow long, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mr. Granville seemed startled.</p><p>\u201cEighteen years.\u201d Harry turned and glanced at the sheep, obviously avoiding the subject. \u201cPoisoned?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Granville blinked, but caught on quickly enough. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Would you like to take a look?\u201d He turned and scrambled back over the wall.</p><p>Oh, for goodness sake! George rolled her eyes heaven-ward. Apparently both men were going to ignore her faux pas and the fact that they hadn\u2019t seen each other for eighteen years.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Harry was holding out his hand, presumably to help her over the wall.</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her oddly. When she placed her hand in his, instead of merely grasping it, he pulled her closer and then lifted her to sit on the wall. George suppressed a squeal. His thumbs were just under her breasts, and her nipples were suddenly sensitive. He gave her a warning look.</p><p>What was he about? She felt herself flush.</p><p>He vaulted the wall and walked to Mr. Granville. George, left to her own devices, swung her legs over and jumped down on the pasture side of the wall. The men were looking at a pile of wilted weeds.</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t very old.\u201d Harry toed a sodden stem. \u201cProbably placed here during the night. Hemlock again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Mr. Granville, squatting next to the plants, looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s been going on for weeks now. Weren\u2019t you told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived from London. I haven\u2019t even been to Granville House yet. Who is doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father thinks it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Why would he\u2014?\u201d Mr. Granville cut himself off, then laughed softly. \u201cHe\u2019s finally paying for his sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>What was going on? George looked from one man to the other, trying to decipher the undercurrents.</p><p>Mr. Granville nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him. See if I can get his mind off you and onto whoever\u2019s really doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he listen to you?\u201d Harry\u2019s lips twisted cynically.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The two men exchanged a look. Despite their differing heights and features, their expressions were strikingly similar. They radiated grimness.</p><p>\u201cDo try to get your father to listen, Mr. Granville,\u201d George said. \u201cHe\u2019s already threatened to arrest Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry scowled at George, but Mr. Granville grinned charmingly. \u201cI shall do my best, my lady, for Harry.\u201d</p><p>George realized she had been calling Mr. Pye, quite improperly, by his given name. Oh, pish. She tilted her nose into the air and felt a raindrop hit it.</p><p>Mr. Granville bowed again. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have met you, Lady Georgina. I hope that we can meet again under more amenable circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Harry moved closer to George\u2019s side, placing a hand at the small of her back. She had the feeling he was scowling at Mr. Granville now.</p><p>She smiled all the brighter at her neighbor. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Harry,\u201d Mr. Granville said.</p><p>Harry merely nodded.</p><p>The young man hesitated, then turned swiftly and leapt the wall. He mounted and wheeled his horse in a half circle to wave good-bye before cantering away.</p><p>\u201cShow-off,\u201d Harry muttered.</p><p>George blew out a breath and turned on him. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got to say after seeing your brother for the first time in eighteen years?\u201d</p><p>He arched his eyebrows at her, silent.</p><p>She threw up her arms in disgust and stomped over to the stone wall, then stood dithering when she couldn\u2019t find a toehold for her shoe. Strong hands grabbed her from behind, again just under her breasts. This time she did shriek.</p><p>Harry lifted her up and held her against his chest. \u201cHe\u2019s not my brother,\u201d he growled in her ear, sending all sorts of interesting thrills down her neck and elsewhere. Who knew the nerves in one\u2019s neck were connected to\u2014</p><p>He set her rather firmly on the wall.</p><p>She scrambled over it and marched to the gig. \u201cThen what is his relationship to you?\u201d</p><p>Instead of handing her into the carriage, Harry grasped her about the middle again. She might become accustomed to this.</p><p>\u201cHe was a boyhood playmate, my lady.\u201d He placed her on the seat.</p><p>George mourned the loss of his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou played with Thomas and Bennet Granville when you were little?\u201d She craned her neck to follow him as he circled the gig.</p><p>More drops of rain began to fall.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He climbed in and took up the reins. \u201cI grew up on the estate, remember. Thomas is about my age and Bennet a few years younger.\u201d He guided the horse onto the lane and set him to a trot.</p><p>\u201cYet you had not seen them since you left the Granville estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was\u2014am\u2014the gamekeeper\u2019s son.\u201d A muscle bunched in his jaw. \u201cThere was no reason we should see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She mulled over that. \u201cWere you great friends? I mean, did you like Bennet and Thomas?\u201d</p><p>The rain increased. George hugged her cloak about her and hoped her frock wouldn\u2019t be ruined.</p><p>Harry looked at her as if she\u2019d asked something extremely silly. \u201cWe were boys growing up together. It didn\u2019t much matter if we liked each other.\u201d He watched the horse for a bit, then said almost grudgingly, \u201cI daresay I got on better with Bennet even though Thomas was closer to my age. Thomas always seemed such a milksop. He didn\u2019t like fishing or exploring or other things boys like to do for fear of getting his clothes dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you don\u2019t trust Thomas now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was a milksop when he was a boy? No, my lady. Give me more credit than that. He was always trying to get his father\u2019s favor as a lad. I doubt he\u2019s changed much, just because he\u2019s a man now. And since Granville hates me...\u201d He let his sentence trail away and shrugged.</p><p>His father\u2019s favor. A firstborn son usually had that without question. How strange that Thomas Granville did not. But she was more curious about something else. \u201cSo you spent a lot of time in Bennet\u2019s company when you two were boys?\u201d</p><p>Rain was dripping off the brim of Harry\u2019s tricorn. \u201cWe played and I sat in on his lessons if the tutor was in a good mood that day\u2014and if Granville wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIf Lord Granville wasn\u2019t around?\u201d</p><p>He nodded grimly. \u201cThe man hated me, even then. Said I had too much pride for a gamekeeper\u2019s son. But the tutor disliked his employer as well. I think he got some small revenge in teaching me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you learned to read and write.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cBennet was better at letters than I, even though he was younger, but I best him at numbers. So, yes, I spent quite a bit of time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cHis father whipped my father when I was twelve and he ten.\u201d</p> <p>George thought about what it would be like if she\u2019d lost someone close to her when she was twelve. Someone she saw every day. Someone she fought and played with. Someone she took it for granted would always be there. It would be like having a limb cut off.</p><p>How far would one go to correct such a wrong?</p><p>She shivered and looked up. They were at the river that divided the Granville land from her own. Harry slowed the horse to a walk as it splashed into the ford. The rain was coming down hard now, making the muddy water jump. George looked downstream where the water deepened and swirled in a whirlpool. A shape floated there.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d She touched his arm and pointed.</p><p>He swore.</p> <p>The horse waded from the stream, and he pulled the gig over, tying the reins off quickly. He helped her down from the gig before walking to the bank ahead of her. George\u2019s shoes sank into the mud as she followed. When she reached him, Harry was very still. Then she saw why. The body of a sheep twisted slowly in the water; the rain pelting the fleece gave it a strange, lifelike movement.</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it float away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tethered.\u201d Harry nodded grimly to a branch hanging over the water.</p><p>She saw that a rope was tied around the branch and disappeared into the water. Presumably, the other end attached to some part of the sheep. \u201cBut why would anyone do such a thing?\u201d She felt a frisson run down her spine. \u201cIt\u2019s mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to foul the stream.\u201d He sat and began to pull off his boots.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cut it loose.\u201d He unbuttoned his coat. \u201cIt\u2019ll fetch up on a bank farther downstream and a farmer will pull it out. At least it won\u2019t spoil the whole stream.\u201d</p><p>By now he was in shirtsleeves, soaked through by the rain. He pulled his knife out of his boot and slid down the bank into the stream. The water came to midthigh, but as he waded slowly out, the water quickly rose to chest level. The rain had made the normally placid stream boil.</p><p>\u201cDo be careful,\u201d George called. If he lost his footing, he might be swept downstream. Did he know how to swim?</p><p>He didn\u2019t acknowledge her call and kept wading. When he reached the rope, he grabbed it where it stretched above the water and started to saw. The strands unraveled rapidly, and suddenly the sheep spun away downstream. Harry turned and began to wade back, the water whirling angrily about him. He slipped and his head disappeared beneath the water without a sound.</p><p>Oh, God. George\u2019s heart leaped painfully in her chest. She started for the bank without knowing what she could do. But then he was upright again, his soaked hair plastered to his cheeks. He emerged and wrung out the front of his shirt, transparent now from the water. George could see his nipples and the swirl of dark hair where the shirt stuck against his chest.</p><p>\u201cSomeday I\u2019d like to see a man nude,\u201d she said.</p><p>Harry froze.</p><p>Slowly he straightened from pulling on his boots. His green eyes met hers, and she could have sworn a fire burned there. \u201cIs that an order, my lady?\u201d he asked, his voice so deep it was almost a dark purr.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Oh, goodness gracious, yes! A part of George desperately wanted to see Harry Pye take off that shirt. To see what his shoulders and belly looked like naked. To find out if there really were curls of hair on his chest. And after that, if he removed his breeches... She really couldn\u2019t help it. Her eyes dropped to that part of a man\u2019s anatomy that a lady never, ever, under any circumstances let her gaze wander to. The water had done an exquisite job of molding Harry\u2019s breeches to his lower limbs.</p><p>George drew a breath. Opened her mouth.</p><p>And Harry cursed and turned away. A cart and pony were coming up the lane.</p><p>Well, damn.</p><p>\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T REALLY THINK Harry Pye is poisoning your sheep.\u201d Bennet\u2019s words were phrased as a question but said as a statement.</p><p>Not two minutes back and the lad was already setting himself against him. But then the boy had always taken Pye\u2019s part. Silas snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t think. I know Pye is doing the killing.\u201d</p><p>Bennet frowned and poured himself a tumbler of whiskey. He held the decanter up in question.</p><p>Silas shook his head and leaned back in the leather-covered chair behind his study desk. The room was his favorite, all male in its feel. Mounted antlers circled the study, just below the ceiling. A deep, black fireplace took up the entire wall at the room\u2019s far end. Over it was a classical painting: The Rape of the Sabine Women. Swarthy men tearing the clothes from fair-skinned, screaming wenches. He sometimes got prick-proud just looking at the thing.</p><p>\u201cBut poison?\u201d Bennet threw himself into a chair and started tapping his fingers on the arm.</p><p>His younger son aggravated him; but even now, Silas could not help feeling proud of him. This one should have been his heir. Thomas would never have the balls to confront his father. Silas had known it the moment he\u2019d first seen Bennet, bawling and red-faced, in his mother\u2019s arms. He\u2019d looked into the infant\u2019s face and a voice inside him had whispered, this one\u2014this one out of all his other get\u2014would be the son he, Silas, would be proud of. So he\u2019d taken the babe from that whore\u2019s arms and brought him home. His wife had pouted and wept, but Silas had soon let her know he wouldn\u2019t change his mind and she\u2019d had to relent. Some might still remember that Bennet wasn\u2019t legally born, that he\u2019d come from the loins of the gatekeeper\u2019s wife, but they wouldn\u2019t dare speak that knowledge aloud.</p><p>Not while Silas Granville ruled this land.</p><p>Bennet shook his head. \u201cPoison isn\u2019t the method Harry would use if he wanted revenge on you. He loves the land and the people who farm it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoves the land?\u201d Silas scoffed. \u201cHow can he? He doesn\u2019t own any land. He\u2019s naught but a paid custodian. The land he tends and works on belongs to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the farmers still come to him, don\u2019t they?\u201d Bennet asked softly, his eyes narrowed. \u201cThey ask him his opinion; they follow his guidance. Even many of your own tenants go to Harry when they have a problem\u2014or at least they did before all this started. They wouldn\u2019t dare come to you.\u201d</p><p>A line of pain shot along Silas\u2019s left temple. \u201cWhy should they? I\u2019m not the tavern keep, someone for the farmers to bawl their troubles to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not interested in other people\u2019s troubles, are you?\u201d Bennet drawled. \u201cBut their respect, their allegiance\u2014that\u2019s a different matter.\u201d</p><p>He had the allegiance of the local people. Didn\u2019t they fear him? Stupid, dirty peasants, to seek the council of one of their own just because he\u2019d risen a little from their ranks. Silas felt sweat drip down his neck. \u201cPye\u2019s envious of his betters. He wishes he was an aristocrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he was envious, he wouldn\u2019t use this method to get back at his betters, as you term it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMethod?\u201d Silas slammed the flat of his hand on his desk. \u201cYou talk as if he were a Machiavellian prince instead of a common land steward. He\u2019s the son of a whore and a thief. What type of method do you think he\u2019d use other than sneaking around poisoning animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whore.\u201d Bennet\u2019s lips thinned as he poured himself another finger of whiskey. Probably how he spent all his time in London\u2014on drink and women. \u201cIf Harry\u2019s mother\u2014my mother\u2014was a whore, who do you think made her so?\u201d</p><p>Silas scowled. \u201cWhat do you mean, talking to me in that tone? I\u2019m your father, boy. Don\u2019t you ever forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m likely to forget that you sired me.\u201d Bennet gave a bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou should be proud\u2014\u201d Silas began.</p><p>His son sneered and emptied his glass.</p><p>Silas surged to his feet. \u201cI saved you, boy! If it weren\u2019t for me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bennet flung his tumbler into the grate. The glass exploded, flinging sparkling shards onto the carpet. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, I would\u2019ve had a mother, not your frozen bitch of a wife who was too proud to show affection for me!\u201d</p><p>Silas swept the papers from his desk with his arm. \u201cIs that what you want, boy? A mother\u2019s tit to suckle?\u201d</p><p>Bennet turned white. \u201cYou\u2019ve never understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood? What\u2019s there to understand between a life lived in the muck and one in a manor? Between a starving bastard and an aristocrat who can afford all that\u2019s good in life? I gave you that. I gave you everything.\u201d</p><p>Bennet shook his head and stalked to the door. \u201cLeave Harry alone.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door behind him.</p><p>Silas raised his arm to swipe at the only thing still on his desk, the inkstand, but he paused when he saw his hand. It was shaking. Bennet. He sank into his chair.</p><p>Bennet.</p><p>He\u2019d brought him up strong, made sure he could ride like a demon and fight like a man. He\u2019d always favored the boy and made no bones about it. Why should he? Couldn\u2019t anyone see that this was the son a man could be proud of? In return he\u2019d expected... what? Not like or love, but respect, certainly. Yet, his second son treated him like a pile of dung. Came to Granville House only for money. And now took the side of a baseborn servant against his own sire. Silas pushed away from his desk. He needed to deal with Harry Pye before he became any more of a threat. He couldn\u2019t let Pye drive a wedge between himself and Bennet.</p><p>The door opened a crack, and Thomas peeked around it like a timid girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Silas was too tired to yell.</p><p>\u201cI saw Bennet rush by. He\u2019s back, eh?\u201d Thomas eased into the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he\u2019s back. And that\u2019s why you invited yourself into my study? To exchange the news that your brother has returned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard some of the words you had with him.\u201d Thomas crept another few steps forward as if approaching a wild boar. \u201cAnd I wanted to offer my support. About seeing Harry Pye punished, I mean. He\u2019s quite obviously the one doing this, anyone can understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d Silas eyed his eldest with a curled lip. \u201cAnd what, exactly, can you help me with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Lady Georgina the other day. I tried to tell you.\u201d The muscle under Thomas\u2019s right eye had started to twitch.</p><p>\u201cAnd she told you she would hand over Pye, tied with a pretty bow, at our convenience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, she seemed charmed by him.\u201d Thomas shrugged. \u201cShe is a woman, after all. But perhaps if there was further evidence, if we had men guarding the sheep...\u201d</p><p>Silas chuckled hoarsely. \u201cAs if there are enough men in the county to watch all the sheep on my land every night. Don\u2019t be more of a fool than you can help.\u201d He crossed to the whiskey decanter.</p><p>\u201cBut if there was evidence linking him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t accept anything but a signed confession from Pye. We have evidence\u2014Pye\u2019s carving, found right by the dead sheep\u2014and she still thinks him innocent. It\u2019d be different if instead of a sheep, a man, or\u2014\u201d Silas stopped midsentence, staring sightlessly at his newly filled whiskey glass. Then he threw back his head and began to laugh, great, bellowing guffaws that shook his frame and spilled the whiskey in his glass.</p><p>Thomas looked at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>Silas slapped the boy on the back, nearly bowling him over. \u201cAye, we\u2019ll give her evidence, boy. Evidence that not even she can ignore.\u201d</p><p>Thomas smiled tremulously, the pretty boy. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t any evidence, Father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Tommy, my lad.\u201d Silas took a gulp of the whiskey and winked. \u201cWho says evidence can\u2019t be made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHAT WILL BE ALL. You may have the rest of the night off.\u201d George smiled in what she hoped was a casual manner. As if she always dismissed Tiggle before supper.</p><p>Apparently it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cAll, my lady?\u201d The maid straightened from putting away a stack of linens. \u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019ll be undressing later, surely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She felt her face heat. \u201cBut I thought I\u2019d manage it myself tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tiggle stared.</p><p>George nodded confidently. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able. So you may go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, my lady?\u201d Tiggle placed her hands on her hips.</p><p>This was the problem with having the same servants for years on end. One didn\u2019t inspire the proper awe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having a guest to dinner.\u201d She waved a hand airily. \u201cI just thought you wouldn\u2019t want to wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to wait for you,\u201d Tiggle said suspiciously. \u201cHas Lady Violet\u2019s maid had the night off as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u201d\u2014George ran a fingertip along her dresser\u2014\u201cit\u2019s a very private dinner. Violet won\u2019t be attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>The maid\u2019s exclamation was interrupted by a knock on the door. Darn! She\u2019d hoped to have Tiggle out of the way by now.</p><p>George opened the door. \u201cIn my sitting room, please,\u201d she told the footmen outside.</p> <p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Tiggle hissed as George passed her on the way to the connecting door.</p><p>George ignored her and opened the door. In the sitting room, the footmen were busy rearranging the furniture and setting up the table they\u2019d had to bring in. A fire was flickering in the grate.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d Tiggle dogged George into the sitting room but immediately quieted in the presence of the other servants.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you want it, my lady?\u201d one of the footmen asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that will do nicely. Now, be sure and alert Cook when Mr. Pye arrives. We\u2019ll want supper promptly.\u201d</p><p>The footmen bowed out, which, unfortunately, freed the lady\u2019s maid from her self-imposed silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having Mr. Pye to dinner?\u201d Tiggle sounded scandalized. \u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>George tilted her chin in the air. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my Lord, why didn\u2019t you tell me, my lady?\u201d Tiggle abruptly turned and ran back into the bedroom.</p><p>George stared after her.</p><p>The maid\u2019s head popped around the door frame, and she beckoned urgently. \u201cHurry, my lady! There\u2019s not much time.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like she\u2019d been goosed, George followed her into the bedroom.</p><p>Tiggle was already at the vanity table, rummaging through bottles. She held up a small glass vial as George neared. \u201cThis\u2019ll do. Exotic, but not overwhelming.\u201d She snatched the fichu from around her mistress\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d George raised her hands to her suddenly bare d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>The maid batted her hands away. She removed the bottle\u2019s glass stopper and stroked it down George\u2019s neck and between her breasts. The scent of sandalwood and jasmine hovered in the air.</p><p>Tiggle recapped the bottle and stepped back to look at her assessingly. \u201cI think the garnet drops instead.\u201d</p><p>George obediently searched through her jewelry box.</p><p>From behind her Tiggle sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity I haven\u2019t time to redo your hair, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine a moment ago.\u201d George squinted into the mirror as she replaced her earrings.</p><p>\u201cA moment ago I didn\u2019t know you were meeting a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>George straightened and turned.</p><p>Tiggle knit her brows as she inspected her.</p><p>George ran a hand self-consciously across her green velvet gown. A row of black bows marched down the bodice, echoed at the elbows. \u201cWill I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tiggle nodded firmly. \u201cYes, my lady, I think you\u2019ll do.\u201d She walked swiftly to the door.</p><p>\u201cTiggle,\u201d George called.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tiggle actually blushed. \u201cGood luck, my lady.\u201d She grinned and disappeared.</p><p>George strolled back into the sitting room and shut the door to her bedroom. She sat down in one of the armchairs by the fire and immediately jumped up; then she crossed to the mantel and inspected the clock sitting upon it. Five minutes after seven o\u2019clock. Perhaps he didn\u2019t have a timepiece? Or maybe he was just a habitually late man? Or perhaps he didn\u2019t intend to come\u2014</p><p>Someone knocked at the door.</p><p>George froze and stared at it. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Harry Pye opened the door. He hesitated, watching her with the door still ajar behind him.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>He walked in but left the door open. \u201cGood evening, my lady.\u201d He was at his most indecipherable.</p><p>George started babbling. \u201cI thought we might have a quiet dinner to discuss the poisoning and the attack and what we might want to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>Footmen appeared at the door\u2014thank goodness!\u2014and started laying the table. Behind came more servants, bearing covered dishes and wine. There was a flurry of activity. She and Harry watched silently as the servants arranged the meal. Finally, most of the servants departed, leaving only one footman to serve dinner. That correct gentleman held the chairs, first for George and then for Harry. They sat and he began ladling the soup.</p><p>The room was deathly silent.</p><p>George looked from the footman to Harry. \u201cI think we\u2019ll manage, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The footman bowed and left.</p><p>And they were alone. George peeked at Harry, who was frowning down at his soup. He didn\u2019t care for consomm\u00e9?</p><p>She broke her roll, a thunderclap in the quiet. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t catch a chill from the stream this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Harry lifted his spoon. \u201cNo, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the stream looked extremely cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fine, my lady. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Well... that\u2019s good.\u201d George chewed and furiously tried to think of something to say. Her mind was a complete blank.</p><p>Harry suddenly set his spoon down. \u201cWhy did you call me here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk about the poisoning and the attack, yes, I know.\u201d Harry rose from the table. \u201cBut your breasts are all but naked, and you\u2019ve sent the servants away. The other servants. Why do you really want me here?\u201d He stood almost menacingly, his jaw bunched, his hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d George\u2019s heart quickened. Her nipples had tightened the moment he said breasts.</p><p>His eyes flickered down, and she wondered if he knew.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not what you think I am,\u201d Harry said evenly as he advanced around the table toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not a servant to jump to your bidding and then lie down when you\u2019ve done with me.\u201d His voice was deepening. \u201cI\u2019m not someone you can dismiss like those footmen, like everyone else in this manor. I\u2019m a man with blood in his veins. If you start something with me, don\u2019t expect me to turn into a lapdog, panting at your call.\u201d Harry seized her upper arms and drew her against his hard body. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to be your servant.\u201d</p><p>George blinked. The idea of confusing this man, who fairly crackled with danger, with a lapdog was absurd.</p><p>He drew a finger slowly across the edge of her bodice, watching her reaction. \u201cWhat do you want with me, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Her breasts seemed to swell. \u201cI...\u201d She couldn\u2019t think while he touched her; she didn\u2019t know what to say. What did he need to hear? George looked around the room for help but saw only the piles of food and dishes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, really. I don\u2019t have any experience in this.\u201d</p><p>He dipped two fingers below her bodice and brushed her nipple. She shuddered. Oh, my. Harry pinched the nipple, sending sparks all the way to her most private places. George closed her eyes.</p><p>She felt his breath caress her cheek. \u201cWhen you figure it out, my lady, let me know.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door quietly behind him.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Bennet walked into the Cock and Worm at just after midnight that evening. The tavern was crowded and loud at that hour, the smoke from innumerable pipes hovering in a cloud near the ceiling. Harry sat in a dark corner and watched young Mr. Granville move with the overly cautious gait of a man who was already the worse for drink. Walking into a disreputable place like the Cock and Worm with one\u2019s senses impaired wasn\u2019t a particularly bright thing to do, but that wasn\u2019t Harry\u2019s worry. An aristocrat gambling with his own safety wasn\u2019t his business\u2014now or ever.</p><p>Harry took a pull from his mug and switched his gaze to the two local harlots drumming up trade. The younger of the wenches, a blonde, sat on a ruddy-faced man\u2019s lap. Her titties were right under his chin\u2014as if she was worried he was near-sighted. The man\u2019s eyes were glazed, and the harlot made stealthy movements at the front of his trousers. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the two came to an understanding.</p><p>The second harlot, a red-haired wench, caught his gaze and tossed her head. She\u2019d already tried her charms with him, and he\u2019d sent her away. Of course, if he flashed a purse now, she\u2019d be smiling soon enough. The more ale he drank, the more he began to rethink turning the redhead down. He\u2019d been randy for days now, and the object of his bone-on, despite her offer, wasn\u2019t likely to help him now, was she?</p><p>Harry scowled into his ale. What had she been after, his Lady Georgina, when she invited him to her private rooms? Not what he\u2019d wanted to think, that\u2019s for sure. The lady was a virgin, and the first rule of aristocratic maidens was Guard well thy virginity. Don\u2019t, whatever you do, go handing it out to the hired help. The lady had been looking for the thrill of a stolen kiss or two. He was forbidden fruit to her. Good thing he\u2019d resisted her blandishments. Few men he knew could\u2019ve done so. He nodded and drank to his own wisdom.</p><p>But then he remembered how she\u2019d looked earlier that night. Her eyes had been so blue and so unwary, belying the temptation of her low neckline. Her breasts had seemed to glow in the firelight. The thought of her even now made his too-alert prick come to attention. He frowned, disgusted at his own weakness. Actually, none of the men he knew\u2014</p><p>Crash!</p><p>Harry jerked around.</p><p>Young Mr. Granville slid across a table, headfirst, knocking ale-filled glasses to the floor. Each glass detonated with a small, wet explosion upon impact with the floor.</p><p>Harry took another swig from his mug. This wasn\u2019t his worry.</p><p>The men at the table weren\u2019t pleased. One fellow with hands the size of hams hauled Bennet upright by his shirtfront. Bennet flailed at the other man, catching him a blow to the side of the head.</p><p>Not his worry.</p><p>Two other men grabbed Bennet\u2019s wrists, jerking them behind him. The man in front buried his fist in Bennet\u2019s belly. Bennet doubled over. He tried to kick, but he was heaving bile from the blow to the stomach. His feet missed his attacker by miles. Behind them, a tall woman threw back her head and laughed drunkenly. She looked familiar, wasn\u2019t she...? The big man drew back his fist again in preparation.</p><p>Not his worry. Not his... oh, the hell with it.</p><p>Harry stood and drew the knife from his boot in one movement. No one was paying any attention to him and he was on the man about to hit Bennet before anyone noticed him. From this angle, a quick stab to the side followed by a twist of the wrist would kill the man before he even fell. But death wasn\u2019t what Harry was after. He sliced the man\u2019s face open instead. Blood gushed, blinding the man. He bellowed and dropped Bennet. Harry slashed one of the men holding Bennet\u2019s wrists, then waved his blade in front of the second man\u2019s eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That one raised his hands. \u201cHold on! Hold on! We was only teaching him his manners!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Harry whispered.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes flickered.</p><p>Harry ducked\u2014in time to protect his head but not his shoulder\u2014as a chair smashed across his side. He turned and stabbed. The man behind him howled, clutching a bleeding thigh. Another crash and the thwack of flesh hitting flesh. Harry realized that Bennet was standing back-to-back with him. The aristo wasn\u2019t as pie-eyed as he\u2019d thought. He was able to fight, at least.</p> <p>Three men charged at once.</p><p>Harry leaned to the side, helping a man pass him with a punch and a shove. A yellow-haired man with a knife came at him. This man had some experience with knife fighting. He gripped a cloak in his free hand and tried to foil Harry\u2019s dagger with it. But the yellow-haired man hadn\u2019t fought in the places Harry had.</p><p>Or ever fought for his life.</p><p>Harry grabbed the cloak and yanked the man hard. The man stumbled, tried to recover his balance, and found that Harry had him by the hair. Harry pulled the man back, arching his neck, and pointed his knife tip at the man\u2019s eye. Balls and eyes. Those were the two things men feared losing most. Threaten either, and you had a man\u2019s full attention.</p><p>\u201cDrop it,\u201d Harry hissed.</p> <p>Sweat and piss assaulted his nostrils. The yellow-haired man had lost control of his bladder. He\u2019d also dropped his knife, and Harry kicked it. It skittered across the floor, sliding under a table. The tavern was quiet. The only sound was Bennet\u2019s labored breathing and the sobbing of one of the sluts.</p><p>\u201cLet him go.\u201d Dick Crumb came out from the back.</p><p>\u201cTell them to back off.\u201d Harry pointed with his chin at the three men still standing.</p><p>\u201cGo on. You don\u2019t want to be messing with Harry when he\u2019s in a mood.\u201d</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>Dick raised his voice. \u201cGo on! There\u2019ll be more ale for them that wants it.\u201d</p> <p>The mention of ale was magic. The men grumbled but turned away. Harry let his hand drop. The yellow-haired man fell to his knees, whimpering.</p><p>\u201cBetter get Granville out of here,\u201d Dick muttered as he passed with mugs.</p><p>Harry took Bennet\u2019s arm and shoved him toward the door. The younger man wobbled, but at least he kept upright. Outside, the air was chill and Bennet gasped. He put out a hand to steady himself against the tavern wall, and for a moment Harry thought the man would be sick. But then he straightened.</p><p>Harry\u2019s bay mare stood beside a larger chestnut gelding. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cBest to be away before they finish their drinks.\u201d</p><p>They mounted and started off. It had begun to drizzle again.</p><p>\u201cGuess I should thank you,\u201d Bennet spoke suddenly. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d come to the aid of a Granville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always start brawls without anyone at your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Bennet hiccupped. \u201cThis was a spur-of-the-moment thing.\u201d</p> <p>They rode in silence. Harry wondered if Bennet had fallen asleep. The horses splashed through puddles in the road.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you could fight like that.\u201d Bennet\u2019s slurred voice cut across the patter of the rain.</p><p>Harry grunted. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poorhouse.\u201d</p><p>Harry thought he\u2019d shut the other man up with his stark statement, but then Bennet chuckled. \u201cMy father\u2019s a right sod, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>There was no need to reply to that. They crested a rise and came to the river.</p><p>\u201cBetter not come any farther. You aren\u2019t safe on Granville land.\u201d Bennet peered at him in the dark. \u201cHe wants to kill you, did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry turned the mare\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cWill you never call me by my name again?\u201d Bennet sounded wistful. Perhaps he\u2019d entered the maudlin stage of drink.</p><p>Harry nudged his horse down the track.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Harry.\u201d Bennet\u2019s voice floated on the night air behind him and melted away like a ghost.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>OUTSIDE THE COCK AND WORM, Silas peeled himself away from the shadows and watched bitterly as his beloved son rode away with the man he hated most in the world.</p><p>\u201cYour boy be dead but for the Woldsly s-steward,\u201d a drunken voice slurred nearby.</p><p>Silas whirled and peered into the dark alley between the Cock and Worm and the neighboring building. \u201cWho are you? How dare you speak to me thus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m juss a little bird.\u201d A harsh feminine giggle.</p><p>Silas felt pressure building in his temple. \u201cCome out of there or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d the voice sneered. A face appeared, ghostly in the shadows. It was lined and worn and belonged to an old woman Silas couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing before. \u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d she repeated, cackling like a demon. \u201cHe\u2019s been killing your sheep for weeks and you\u2019ve done naught. You\u2019re juss an old man. Ol\u2019 man Granville, lord of nothing! How\u2019s it feel to be under the spur of the new cock?\u201d</p><p>She turned and started staggering down the road, one hand held out to balance herself against the wall.</p><p>Silas was on her in two steps.</p><p>\u201cMY, THE SOFT-BOILED EGGS are good this morning.\u201d George mentally rolled her eyes at her own inanity.</p><p>She, Violet, and Euphie sat at the breakfast table. As per usual for the last several days, her sister refused to make any but the most desultory conversation, reducing George to commenting on the eggs.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Violet shrugged one shoulder.</p><p>At least she was still alive. What had happened to her vivacious younger sister? The one who was constitutionally unable to refrain from exclaiming about every little thing?</p><p>\u201cI do like soft-boiled eggs,\u201d Euphie fluted from the other end of the table. \u201cOf course, it is very important that they still be moist and not at all dried out.\u201d</p><p>George frowned as she took a sip of tea. Hadn\u2019t Euphie noticed the almost deathly quiet of her charge?</p><p>\u201cKidneys are nice as well,\u201d Euphie continued. \u201cIf they\u2019ve been prepared in butter. But I can\u2019t abide gammon in the morning. I don\u2019t know how anyone can, really.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was time to find a younger companion for Violet. Euphie was a dear but a tad absentminded at times.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go riding today?\u201d George asked. Maybe Violet just needed fresh air. \u201cI saw a lovely vista the other day, and I thought if you brought your pencils, you could sketch it. Tony says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Violet leaped from her seat. \u201cI... I can\u2019t go today.\u201d</p><p>She ran from the room.</p><p>\u201cYoung people are so abrupt, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Euphie looked puzzled. \u201cWhen I was a girl, I\u2019m sure my mother told me a hundred times, \u2018Euphemia, do not rush about. The true mark of a lady is her ability to be sedate.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cVery enlightening, I\u2019m sure,\u201d George said. \u201cDo you know what is bothering Violet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBothering her, my lady?\u201d Euphie cocked her head like a bird. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she is actually bothered. I think any little change from her normal behavior might be blamed on her youth and certain monthly happenings.\u201d She blushed and hurriedly took a drink of tea.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d George studied the older woman thoughtfully. Perhaps she would be better employed as M\u2019man\u2019s companion. Her absentmindedness would certainly do no harm there. \u201cWell, I thank you for your insight. And now if you will excuse me?\u201d George stood and walked out of the breakfast room as Euphie was still murmuring her consent.</p><p>She hurried up the stairs to Violet\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cViolet, dear?\u201d George knocked at her door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Her sister\u2019s voice sounded suspiciously stuffy.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk with you, if I may?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away. I don\u2019t want to see anyone. You never understand.\u201d The key turned in the lock.</p><p>Violet had locked her out.</p><p>George stared at the door. Fine, then. She was certainly not going to engage in an argument through solid wood. She stomped down the hallway. Euphie was in her own little world, Violet was sulking, and Harry... George opened the door to her bedroom so forcefully it banged against the wall. Harry wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found. She\u2019d had her gig at his cottage at seven this morning, and he\u2019d already left. Coward! And men thought women faint of heart. He was probably out doing male things in the delusion that work needed being done, when in reality, he was simply avoiding her. Ha! Well, two could play at that game. She struggled out of her day dress and yanked on a riding costume. She turned in a complete circle, trying to fasten the hooks in the back before she conceded defeat and rang for Tiggle.</p><p>The maid arrived wearing the same half-mournful, half-consoling expression she\u2019d worn since the previous disastrous night.</p><p>George nearly lost control at the sight. \u201cHelp me do this up, please.\u201d She presented her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going riding, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this weather?\u201d Tiggle looked doubtfully at the window. A wet tree branch lashed against it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d George frowned at the tree branch. At least there was no lightning.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Tiggle bent behind her to reach the hooks at her waist. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity about last night\u2014that Mr. Pye turned down your invitation.\u201d</p><p>George stiffened. Did all the servants feel sorry for her now? \u201cHe didn\u2019t turn me down. Well, not precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>George could feel the heat stealing up her face. Drat pale complexions. \u201cHe asked me what I wanted from him.\u201d</p><p>Tiggle, who was picking up the discarded day dress, stopped and stared at her. \u201cAnd what did you answer, my lady? If you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d</p><p>George threw up her hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say. I mumbled something about never having done this before and he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tiggle frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want me to say?\u201d George paced to the window. \u201c \u2018I want you naked, Harry Pye?\u2019 Surely it\u2019s usually done with more finesse than that? And why demand my intentions? I can\u2019t imagine most affairs de coeur begin on such a lawyerly note. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t ask for them in writing: \u2018I, Lady Georgina Maitland, do request Mr. Harry Pye to make very fine love to me.\u2019 Really!\u201d</p><p>There was silence behind her. George winced. Now she\u2019d shocked Tiggle. Could this day get any\u2014</p><p>The maid started laughing.</p><p>George turned.</p><p>Her maid was doubled over, trying to catch her breath. \u201cOh, my lady!\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Tiggle bit her lip, plainly struggling. \u201cIt\u2019s just, \u2018I want you naked, Ha-Ha-Harry Pye.\u2019 \u201d She went off again.</p><p>George plopped on the side of the bed. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d Tiggle sat beside her, the dress still in her arms. \u201cIs that what you want from Mr. Pye? An affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d George wrinkled her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If I\u2019d met him at a ball, I wouldn\u2019t have asked him for an affair.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve danced with him, then flirted and exchanged witty banter. He would\u2019ve sent flowers the next morning and maybe asked her to drive in the park. He would\u2019ve courted her.</p><p>\u201cBut a land steward wouldn\u2019t be invited to the balls you attend, my lady,\u201d Tiggle said soberly.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d For some reason this simple fact had George blinking back tears.</p><p>\u201cWell, then\u201d\u2014Tiggle sighed and rose\u2014\u201csince there isn\u2019t any other choice, maybe you should just tell him what you\u2019ve told me.\u201d She smiled without meeting George\u2019s eyes and left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George flopped back on her bed. I wish... She sighed. If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride.</p><p>HARRY CLOSED THE DOOR TO his cottage and leaned his head against it. He could still hear the rain beating on the wood. The grain was rotting in the fields, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. Despite Lady Georgina\u2019s kind offer of loans for the tenants, they would lose a great deal of money, a great deal of food, if the harvest failed. Not only that, but more dead sheep had been found on Granville land today. The poisoner was growing bold. In the last week, he\u2019d struck three times, killing more than a dozen sheep. Even the most loyal of the Woldsly cottagers looked at him with suspicion now. And why not? To many he was a stranger here.</p><p>He pushed away from the door and set the lantern on the table beside a letter he\u2019d opened this morning. Mrs. Burns had left his supper, but he didn\u2019t touch it. Instead, he lit the fire and put a kettle of water on to heat.</p><p>He\u2019d ridden out before dawn and had worked ever since, inspecting crops. He couldn\u2019t stand the stink of his own body anymore. He swiftly stripped to the waist and poured the heated water into a basin. It was barely tepid, but he used it to wash under his arms, his chest, and his back. Finally, he poured clean water into the basin and dunked his head and face in. The cool water ran down his face, dripping off his chin. It seemed to wash away not only the filth of the day, but all the mental ills as well\u2014the frustration and anger and helplessness. Harry caught up a cloth and toweled his face.</p> <p>There was a knock at the door.</p><p>He froze, the cloth still in his hand. Had Granville\u2019s men finally come for him? He put out the lantern, drew his knife, and stole to the door. Standing to one side, he flung it wide.</p><p>Lady Georgina stood outside, the rain dripping from her hood. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d Her gaze lowered and caught at his bare chest. Her blue eyes widened.</p><p>Harry felt his cock harden at her reaction. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you waited on my permission to enter, my lady.\u201d He turned back to the table to put on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cSarcasm doesn\u2019t become you.\u201d She walked in and shut the door.</p> <p>He uncovered his supper\u2014bean soup\u2014and sat to eat it.</p><p>Lady Georgina dropped her cloak untidily on a chair. He felt her glance at him before she wandered to the fireplace. She touched each of the animal carvings with a fingertip and then came back toward him.</p><p>He spooned up some of the soup. It was cold now but still tasty.</p><p>She trailed her fingers across the table, stopping at the letter. She picked it up. \u201cYou know the Earl of Swartingham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe frequent the same coffeehouse in London.\u201d He poured himself a mug of ale. \u201cSometimes he writes me about agricultural matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d She started reading the letter. \u201cBut he sounds like he considers you a friend. His language is certainly casual.\u201d</p> <p>Harry choked and snatched the letter from her hand, startling her. Lord Swartingham\u2019s writing could be colorful at times\u2014not fit for a lady. \u201cHow can I help you, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina drifted away from the table. Her manner seemed off, and it took him a minute to place it.</p><p>She was nervous.</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. He\u2019d never seen her flustered before.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let me finish my tale last time,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout the Leopard Prince.\u201d She halted by the fire and turned a curiously vulnerable face to him.</p><p>With one cold word, he could send her flying, this woman whose station so far outranked his. Had he ever had that much power over an aristocrat? He doubted it. The problem was that sometime in the last week she\u2019d stopped being merely a member of the aristocracy and had become... a woman. Lady Georgina.</p><p>His lady.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your story, my lady.\u201d Harry ate some more of Mrs. Burns\u2019s soup, chewing on a piece of mutton.</p> <p>She seemed to relax and turned back to the mantel, playing with the whittled animals as she spoke. \u201cThe Leopard Prince defeated the ogre and brought back the Golden Horse. Did I tell you that part?\u201d She glanced at him.</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, now...\u201d She scrunched her nose in thought. \u201cThe young king, do you remember him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the young king took the Golden Horse from the Leopard Prince, probably without even a \u2018thank you very much,\u2019 and carted it off to the princess\u201d\u2014she waved a hand\u2014\u201cor rather to her father, the other king. Because the princess doesn\u2019t have any say-so, does she?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. It was her fairy tale; he\u2019d no idea.</p><p>\u201cThey very rarely do. Princesses, I mean. They get sold off to old dragons and giants and such all the time.\u201d Lady Georgina was frowning at a badger. \u201cWhere\u2019s the stag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stag.\u201d She pointed at the mantel. \u201cIt\u2019s not here. You didn\u2019t knock it into the fire, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I might\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to find another place for them. It\u2019s too dangerous here.\u201d She began lining the carved animals at the back of the mantel.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Lady Georgina continued, \u201cthe young king brought the Golden Horse to the father king and said, \u2018Here you are, and how about your beautiful daughter, then?\u2019 But what the young king didn\u2019t know was that the Golden Horse could speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a talking metal horse?\u201d</p><p>She appeared not to hear him. \u201cThe minute the young king left the room, the Golden Horse turned to the other king, the father king\u2014are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His mouth was full.</p><p>\u201cGood. All these kings are very confusing.\u201d She heaved a sigh. \u201cAnd the Golden Horse said, \u2018That\u2019s not the man who freed me. You\u2019ve been tricked, Your Majesty.\u2019 And didn\u2019t that make the father king mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry drank some ale. \u201cThe father king had possession of the Golden Horse. Why would he care one way or the other who actually stole it?\u201d</p><p>She set her hands on her hips. \u201cBecause stealing the Golden Horse is a test. He wants only the man who can do that to marry his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The whole thing sounded silly. Wouldn\u2019t a noble father be more interested in the richer man rather than the stronger? \u201cSo, then, he didn\u2019t really want the Golden Horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably wanted the Golden Horse as well, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is important\u201d\u2014Lady Georgina glared at him\u2014\u201cis that the father king marched straight back to the young king and said, \u2018See here, the Golden Horse is all very well, but what I really want is the Golden Swan that belongs to a very nasty witch. So if you want the princess, off you go to get it.\u2019 What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for Harry to realize that the last was said to him. He swallowed. \u201cThere seem to be a lot of golden animals in this fairy tale, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es,\u201d Lady Georgina said. \u201cThat did occur to me, too. But they can\u2019t very well be anything else, can they? I mean, it wouldn\u2019t do to have a copper horse or a lead swan.\u201d She frowned and switched a mole with a sparrow.</p><p>He watched her thoughtfully. \u201cIs that all, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She didn\u2019t look up from the little animals. \u201cNo, there\u2019s lots more.\u201d But she didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>He pushed the remains of his supper away. \u201cAre you going to tell me the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not right now, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He got up from the table and took a step closer. He didn\u2019t want to frighten her. He felt as if he had his own golden swan within reach. \u201cThen, will you tell me why you\u2019ve really come, my lady?\u201d he asked. He could smell the perfume in her hair, an exotic scent like spices from distant lands.</p><p>She set a thrush next to a cat. The bird toppled over, and he waited while she carefully righted it. \u201cI need to tell you something. Besides the fairy tale.\u201d Her face was half turned away, and he could see the glistening trail of a tear on her cheek.</p><p>A kind man\u2014an honorable man\u2014would leave her alone. He would pretend he didn\u2019t see the tears and would turn away. He would not trespass upon her fears and desires. But long ago Harry had lost what little honor he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>And he had never been kind.</p><p>He touched her hair with a fingertip, feeling the soft strands. \u201cWhat do you need to tell me?\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him, and her eyes were bright in the firelight, uncertain and hopeful and as alluring as Eve herself. \u201cI know now what I want from you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Harry stood so near, his breath caressed her face. \u201cAnd what is it you want from me, my lady?\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s heart beat in her throat. This was so much harder than she\u2019d imagined back in her room at Woldsly. She felt like she was laying her soul before him. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>He bent closer, and she thought she felt his tongue touch her ear. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. This was what drove her on, despite her embarrassment, despite her fear: desire for this man.</p><p>\u201cYes. I... I want you to kiss me like you did before. I want to see you naked. I want to be naked for you. I want...\u201d</p><p>But her thoughts scattered because this time she was sure of it\u2014he was tracing the rim of her ear with his tongue. And while the idea of such a caress might seem rather odd, in reality it was divine. She shivered.</p><p>Harry\u2019s chuckle puffed against her wet ear. \u201cYou want many things, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d George swallowed as another thought occurred to her. \u201cAnd I want you to stop calling me my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you order me about so masterfully.\u201d His teeth closed on her earlobe.</p><p>George had to press her knees together to contain her own excitement. \u201cE-even so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call you George, as your sister does.\u201d He trailed a line of kisses up to her temple.</p><p>She frowned as she tried to concentrate on his words. It wasn\u2019t very easy. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see you in the same way as your sister. George is such a mannish name.\u201d His hand wandered to her breast. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t find you mannish at all.\u201d One thumb brushed her nipple.</p><p>She almost stopped breathing.</p><p>He circled the tip through the fabric of her dress. Oh, dear Lord. She didn\u2019t know it was possible to feel so much from such a little touch.</p><p>\u201cI could call you Georgina, but it\u2019s long.\u201d He watched his hand, his eyes dark.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cAnd then there is Gina, a pet name, but it\u2019s too common for you.\u201d He squeezed her nipple, and she felt the jolt all the way to the center of her being.</p><p>She moaned helplessly.</p><p>Harry\u2019s gaze flicked up to hers. He no longer smiled. \u201cSo, you see, I think I\u2019ll have to continue calling you my lady.\u201d</p><p>His head dipped. His mouth was on hers before she could even think. Biting, licking, sucking. His kiss\u2014if such a ravenous devouring could be called a kiss\u2014overwhelmed her senses. She tunneled her fingers through his hair and hung on for dear life. Oh, thank the Lord! She\u2019d begun to think she would never taste him again. She suckled his tongue, murmuring her enjoyment.</p><p>He made a sound\u2014a growl?\u2014and placed a hand frankly on her bottom and pulled her roughly against himself. She would\u2019ve bet her life that the hard rod she felt poking into her lower belly was his manhood. Just to be sure, she rubbed against it, and his rod now had almost all of her attention. He rewarded her daring by shoving a knee between her legs. The effect was so exciting that she almost forgot about the rod. He\u2019d somehow found that spot, that little place that could bring her so much pleasure. He rubbed that spot with his leg while thrusting his tongue repeatedly into her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nearly whimpered at the sensation. Did he know? Did all men have a secret understanding of that part of a woman\u2019s anatomy? George pulled at his hair until Harry\u2019s lips broke away from hers. His knee continued its maddening motion. She looked into his eyes, heavy-lidded and burning green, and saw devastating knowledge. Harry knew exactly what he was doing to her. It wasn\u2019t fair! He would have her lying in a puddle of want before she could even discover him.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>The word came out more a gasp than a command, but Harry stilled at once. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I wanted to see you.\u201d George dismounted his knee. That really was the only word for it.</p> <p>Harry spread his arms wide. \u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, there was a trace of unease in his face. \u201cAs my lady wishes.\u201d But he made no move.</p><p>She saw it in his eyes; she\u2019d have to undress him herself. She bit her lip, excited and uncertain at the same time. \u201cSit there.\u201d She pointed to the armchair by the fire.</p><p>He obeyed, lounging back, his legs sprawled.</p> <p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours to do with as you wish, my lady,\u201d he said. The words came out a purr, as if a great cat had granted her leave to pet it.</p><p>If she balked now, she\u2019d never find out. She knelt and carefully undid the buttons on his shirt. His hands were draped casually over the chair\u2019s arms, and he made no move to help. She reached the last button and spread the halves of his shirt wide, examining him. The lines of his neck tendons ran down into the hills of his shoulders, smooth and taut. Below, he had small brown nipples, puckered like her own. She touched one with a fingertip and then traced the bumpy ridge of the surrounding dark circle.</p><p>He made a sound.</p><p>Her gaze flicked to his. His eyes glowed under lowered lids, and his nostrils were flared; otherwise he was still. She looked back to his bare chest. In the center grew dark hairs, and she brushed over them to feel their texture. They were smooth, damp underneath with his sweat. She followed the trail of hair down to his belly where it encircled his navel. How strange. And the hair skimmed lower. It must meet up with... She searched the placket of his trousers for the buttons that closed it. His manhood stood up stiffly within the fabric. From the corner of her eye, she saw his hands grip the chair arms, but he let her have her way. She found the buttons. Her hands trembled and one button popped off. She undid the placket and slowly peeled it back while struggling to draw breath.</p><p>It stood up all by itself, larger than she\u2019d ever imagined, poking through his smallclothes. The statues lied. There was no way this could fit beneath those puny fig leaves. It was ruddier than the flesh of his belly, and she could see veins throbbing along the length. The head was bigger than the rest, shining and red. The hair at the base was damp, and when she leaned forward\u2014oh, dear Lord\u2014she could smell him. Male musk, heavy and intoxicating.</p> <p>George didn\u2019t know the etiquette of the situation, whether it was done or not, but she reached out. If she died tomorrow and had to make accounting for her eternal soul before the gates of heaven and St. Peter himself, she would not regret it: She touched Harry Pye\u2019s cock.</p><p>He groaned and lifted his hips.</p><p>But she was distracted by her discovery. The skin was soft, like the finest kid glove, and it moved separately from the muscle beneath. She skimmed her palm over the shaft up to the head and found liquid leaking from a slit. Was this the seed of life?</p><p>He groaned again. This time he grabbed her and lifted her to his lap, obscuring that most interesting part of his body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me, my lady.\u201d He worked at the hooks at the back of her gown. \u201cI promise on my father\u2019s grave that you may look at my naked body for hours, or as long as I can stand it, later. But right now\u201d\u2014her gown gaped forward, and he pulled it and her shift down\u2014\u201cI need to see your naked body.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, about to protest, but he had the entire bodice off now, and he bent his head and sucked on her nipple. She gazed down at his head, shocked; then the sensation caught up with the act and she inhaled. She knew men were fascinated with breasts, but she\u2019d no idea.</p><p>Oh, my, was this usual? Perhaps it didn\u2019t matter\u2014he tongued his way to her other breast and sucked on that one as well\u2014because it felt so erotic. So evocative. Now her hips moved, swiveling of their own accord. He chuckled and she felt the vibration through her nipple.</p><p>And then he bit gently.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d She was startled at the huskiness of her own voice. She didn\u2019t know for what she begged.</p><p>But Harry knew. He shifted and dragged her gown from off her body. He pulled off her slippers one at a time and let them drop to the floor. She lay across his lap like some odalisque, naked except for her stockings and garters, his cock pressed into her hip. She should have been embarrassed, she knew. If she were proper at all, she would\u2019ve run away, screaming. Which only proved what she\u2019d suspected for some time: She\u2019d lost all sense of propriety. For when Harry lifted his head and slowly, very slowly, perused her naked body, she actually arched her back as if to display herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His voice was guttural, deep and rasping. \u201cHere\u201d\u2014he touched her swollen nipples\u2014\u201cthey look like red berries in snow. Here\u201d\u2014he smoothed his hand on the curve of her belly\u2014\u201cso soft, like down. And here.\u201d His fingers combed into the auburn curls surrounding her womanhood. His hand tightened on her mound for a moment. His face was carnal in the firelight, the lines in sharp relief, his lips drawn back. He slid his long middle finger between her folds.</p><p>She shut her eyes as he touched her there.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it softly?\u201d His finger brushed over her. \u201cOr firmly?\u201d He stroked.</p><p>\u201cL-like that,\u201d she sighed. She spread her thighs a little more.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he whispered, and turned his head to brush feather kisses across her lips.</p><p>She moaned into his mouth. Her hands tangled in his hair and roamed over the warm skin of his shoulders. And all the while his finger stroked until the tension built to unbearable levels, and he thrust his tongue into her mouth. George arched, feeling her heart beat out of her chest and the warmth seeping, spreading, from her middle. She felt shaken, as if she\u2019d taken a journey from which there was no return.</p><p>He petted her, gentle and consoling.</p><p>When she began to drift, he lifted her, stood, and walked to his bedroom. He lay her down on his narrow bed and stepped back deliberately. Harry watched her\u2014for resistance?\u2014as he stripped out of his remaining clothes. She lay there limply, anticipating whatever he would do next. Then he climbed over her and poised for a moment on all fours, a hungry beast about to devour his prey.</p><p>His very willing prey.</p><p>\u201cIt may hurt.\u201d He searched her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She pulled his head down to hers.</p><p>He met her lips and nudged her legs apart with his own. She felt him at her entrance. He lifted his head and braced himself on one hand, then thrust himself into her. Or at least she thought he did. He drew back a little and thrust again, and more flesh entered her. Good Lord, would all of him...? Another thrust and she gasped. It hurt. It pinched. It burned. He glanced at her face, grit his teeth, and thrust powerfully. His pelvis met hers.</p><p>She whimpered. She felt full\u2014too full.</p><p>Above her, he was still. A bead of sweat dripped off the side of his face and fell on her collarbone. \u201cAll right?\u201d It was a grunt.</p><p>No. She nodded and hazarded a smile.</p><p>\u201cBrave girl,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He leaned down to kiss her and slowly moved his hips. He seemed to grind against her without actually shifting his manhood. That was quite nice. She explored his back, the bunched shoulder muscles, the valley of his spine, damp with sweat. She moved lower and felt his buttocks flex as he finally moved inside her. It wasn\u2019t painful, but it wasn\u2019t as nice as his finger had been before. She concentrated on teasing his tongue with her own. And pressing her fingers into the muscles of his bottom because they were oddly fascinating to her. She wished she could see his backside right now. She felt tender. He pumped. The feel of his manhood sliding in and out of her was rather interesting.</p><p>George idly wondered what they must look like.</p><p>Then all thought fled, for he had pressed his hand against her there. And somehow, the combination of his fingers and his thrusting cock was really altogether perfect. She gripped his hips and began to move her own. Utterly without rhythm, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. Almost... Oh, heavens! She actually saw stars. She broke their kiss to arch her head into the pillow in a bliss like none she\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>He was suddenly gone from her body, and she felt warmth splattering onto her belly. She opened her eyes in time to see Harry throw his head back and shout. The tendons in his neck stood out, and his upper body glistened with sweat.</p><p>He was the most magnificent thing she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>AMAZING, REALLY, HOW SIMPLE it was to kill.</p><p>Silas looked down at the woman lying in the gorse. He\u2019d had to drag her here after keeping her locked up for over a day. It\u2019d been important, after all, that she die in the proper way, and he\u2019d had to find and prepare the poisonous herbs. A rather tedious job. The woman had convulsed at the end, and the body was twisted. Before she died, she had vomited and lost control of her bowels, shitting quite disgustingly all over the place. He curled his lip. The whole process had taken too much of his time and had been foul to boot.</p><p>But it had been simple.</p><p>He\u2019d chosen a sheep pasture on his own land. Isolated at night but close enough to the road so she\u2019d be found before she rotted entirely away. It was important to associate this with the sheep poisonings. These farmers were a dull lot, and if the connections weren\u2019t made for them, they might not see the obvious.</p><p>He could have tried to get the woman to drink the brew he\u2019d made, but it\u2019d been quicker to simply force it down her throat. Then he\u2019d sat back and waited. The woman had sworn and cried at his treatment\u2014she had already been drunk when he\u2019d found her. Then, after a while, she\u2019d clutched her stomach. Vomited. Shat.</p><p>And finally died.</p><p>Silas sighed and stretched, his muscles cramped from sitting so long on a damp boulder. He stood up and pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket. He walked over to the stinking corpse and unwrapped the carved stag. Carefully he placed it a few steps from the woman. Close enough to be found but far enough away to have been dropped. He looked critically at the scene he\u2019d created and found it good.</p><p>He smiled to himself and walked away.</p><p>A WEIGHT LAY ON HIS CHEST. Harry opened his eyes but didn\u2019t move. He saw a cloud of ginger hair floating over his chest and right arm.</p><p>She\u2019d stayed the night.</p><p>He glanced at the window and cursed silently. It was dawn already. He should\u2019ve been up an hour past, and Lady Georgina should have left well before that. But lying here in a too-small bed with his lady was nice. He could feel the cushion of her breast against his side. Her breath puffed on his shoulder, and her arm was flung across his chest as if she had taken possession of him. And maybe she had. Perhaps he was like some enchanted prince in one of her tales and now she held the key to his heart.</p><p>The key to his very soul.</p><p>He closed his eyes again. He could smell her scent mingled with his. She stirred, her hand moving down over his belly, almost to his morning cockstand. He held his breath, but she stopped.</p><p>He needed to piss, and besides, she would be too sore this morning. He eased her arm off him. Harry sat up. Lady Georgina\u2019s hair was a tangle around her face. He gently pushed it back, and she scrunched her nose in her sleep. He smiled. She looked like a wild gypsy lass. He bent, kissed her bare tit, and rose. He stoked the fire, then pulled on his trousers to take a piss outside. When he returned, he put water on to boil and glanced into the little bedroom again. His lady still slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was taking down the teapot when someone started pounding on the cottage door. Quickly he shut the bedroom door. He palmed his knife and opened the cottage door a crack.</p><p>A gentleman stood outside. Tall, with reddish-brown hair. The stranger flicked a riding crop in one bony hand. A horse was tethered behind him.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Harry braced his right hand above his head. The other hand held the knife, hidden on his side of the doorjamb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Lady Georgina Maitland.\u201d The stranger\u2019s voice, clipped and upper crust, would have frozen most men.</p> <p>Harry raised one eyebrow. \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Earl of Maitland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He started to close the door.</p><p>Maitland wedged his crop in the doorway to prevent him. \u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d There was warning in his voice now.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry stared flatly at Maitland. \u201cShe\u2019ll be at the manor soon.\u201d</p> <p>Anger sparked in the other man\u2019s eyes. \u201cWithin the hour or I\u2019ll kick this bloody hovel down around your ears.\u201d</p><p>Harry closed the door.</p><p>When he turned, he saw Lady Georgina peeking from the bedroom. Her hair was loose around her shoulders, and she had used a bedsheet as a wrap.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Her voice was husky with sleep.</p><p>Harry wished he could pick her up and carry her back to his bed and make her forget about this day, but the world and everything in it waited.</p><p>He replaced the teapot on the shelf. \u201cYour brother.\u201d</p> <p>HER BROTHER HAD TO BE the one person in all the world a woman didn\u2019t want to meet directly after a night of ecstasy. George fiddled with the ribbon at her neck.</p><p>Tiggle batted her hand away and set a last pin in her hair. \u201cThere you are, my lady. As ready as you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d At least the maid was no longer sending her mournful looks.</p><p>Instead, she was now commiserating. Did everyone know what had happened last night? She really should\u2019ve been more discreet than to spend the night. George sighed and contemplated feigning a headache. But Tony was nothing if not stubborn. He might not drag her from her room to interview her, but he\u2019d be right outside the minute she tried to emerge. Best to get it over with.</p><p>She threw back her shoulders and marched downstairs like a Christian going to meet a particularly irate lion. Greaves sent her a sympathetic look as he held the breakfast room door for her.</p><p>Inside, Tony was standing by the mantelpiece, staring down his bony nose into the fire. He evidently hadn\u2019t touched the food on the sideboard. Tony was the spitting image of their late father, tall and angular with a face dominated by prominent cheekbones and heavy eyebrows. The only difference was the auburn hair he\u2019d inherited from their mother. That, and the fact that he was a much nicer man than Father had been.</p><p>Usually, anyway.</p><p>George noticed that Violet was conspicuously absent. She had a very good idea why, too. She\u2019d corner the minx later.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Tony.\u201d George strolled to the sideboard. Buttered kippers. Even Cook knew. She helped herself to a large serving. She was going to need her strength.</p> <p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d Tony greeted her coolly. He advanced swiftly to the door and flung it open. Two footmen looked at him, startled. \u201cWe won\u2019t be needing you. Make sure we\u2019re not disturbed.\u201d</p><p>The footmen bowed. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Tony closed the door and yanked down on his waistcoat to straighten it. George rolled her eyes. When had her brother become this stuffy? He must have been practicing in his room at nights.</p><p>\u201cAre you having breakfast?\u201d she asked as she sat down. \u201cCook has made some lovely kippers.\u201d</p><p>Tony ignored her pleasantry. \u201cWhat could you have been thinking?\u201d His tone was unbelievably dour.</p><p>\u201cWell, really, if you want to know the truth, I wasn\u2019t thinking at all.\u201d She took a sip of tea. \u201cI mean, not after the first kiss. He does kiss very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to know, why ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well what I mean. Don\u2019t play the flibbertigibbet with me.\u201d</p><p>George sighed and put down her fork. The kippers tasted like ashes in her mouth, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s no concern of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s my concern. You\u2019re my sister and you\u2019re unmarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I poke into your affairs? Do I ask about what ladies you see in London?\u201d</p><p>Tony crossed his arms and stared down his large nose at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d\u2014George poked a kipper\u2014\u201cbut it should be.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and took a chair opposite her. \u201cMaybe so. But that isn\u2019t how the world works. We don\u2019t deal with how society ought to be but rather how it is. And society will judge you rather harshly, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She felt her lips tremble.</p><p>\u201cCome back to London with me,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWe can forget about this. There are some fellows I can introduce you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like choosing a horse. I don\u2019t want to exchange a bay for a chestnut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Why not find a man from your own class? One who could marry you and give you children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d George said slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t want just any man. I want this one.\u201d</p><p>Tony slammed the flat of his hand down on the table, making her jump. He leaned over her. \u201cAnd the rest of the family can just go to hell? You\u2019re not like this. Think about the example you\u2019re setting for Violet. Would you want her doing what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I can\u2019t live my life as an example for my sister.\u201d</p><p>Tony pursed his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d George accused. \u201cCan you honestly say that with every action you take, you stop to think, \u2018Is this a good example for my brothers?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>They both looked up in surprise. Tony frowned. \u201cI thought I said to admit no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord. My lady.\u201d Harry closed the door on the two harassed footmen outside and advanced into the room.</p><p>Tony straightened away from the table. He was easily half a head taller than Harry, but the shorter man did not break stride.</p><p>\u201cAre you well, my lady?\u201d Harry spoke to George, but his eyes never left Tony.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, Harry.\u201d She\u2019d assured him back at the cottage that Tony would never hurt her, but he must have decided to see for himself. \u201cWould you like a kipper?\u201d</p><p>A corner of Harry\u2019s mouth twitched upward, but Tony forestalled his answer. \u201cWe have no need of you. You may go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d George gasped.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Harry inclined his head. His expression was once again carefully blank.</p><p>George\u2019s heart felt like it was breaking into tiny pieces. This isn\u2019t right. She started to rise, but Harry had already turned back to the door.</p><p>Her lover left the room, dismissed like a common servant by her brother.</p><p>NOTHING LEVELED A MAN QUITE like being unable to protect his woman. Harry jerked on his tricorn and cloak and strode to the stables, the heels of his boots kicking up gravel. But Lady Georgina wasn\u2019t really his, was she? She wasn\u2019t bound to him by law or society. She was a woman who\u2019d allowed him to make love to her. Once.</p><p>And maybe only that once.</p><p>It had been her first time, and inevitably, he\u2019d hurt her. He\u2019d given her pleasure before, but was it enough to make up for the pain afterward? Did she understand that only the first time was painful? Maybe she wouldn\u2019t let him prove that he could give her pleasure with his flesh inside hers.</p><p>Harry swore. The stable hand holding his mare\u2019s head eyed him warily. He scowled at the boy and took the reins. The fact that he wanted Lady Georgina didn\u2019t help his mood. Now. Under him or above him, it didn\u2019t matter; he just wanted to sink his flesh into hers and feel the world fall away again.</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye!\u201d</p><p>Harry looked over his shoulder. The Earl of Maitland was hailing him from Woldsly\u2019s steps. Jesus Christ, now what?</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye, if you\u2019ll wait while my horse is brought around, I\u2019d like to accompany you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have much of a choice, now, did he? \u201cVery well, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He watched the earl stroll up while stable hands ran to do his bidding. Even if the other man hadn\u2019t introduced himself at the cottage this morning, Harry would have known him. His eyes were his sister\u2019s\u2014clear, piercing blue.</p><p>A saddled horse was brought, and both men mounted. They rode out from the stable yard without saying a word. At least the earl was discreet.</p><p>Dark clouds glowered overhead, threatening yet more rain where none was wanted.</p><p>They were nearly to the gates when the earl spoke. \u201cIf it\u2019s money you\u2019re after, I can give you a pretty purse to speed you on your way.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at the earl\u2014Tony, Lady Georgina had called him. His face was stony, but his lips curled ever so slightly at the corners, giving away his distaste. Harry almost felt sorry for him. \u201cI\u2019m not after money, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take me for a fool.\u201d Tony\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the hut you\u2019re living in, and your attire doesn\u2019t bespeak even modest wealth. You\u2019re after my sister\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see no other reason for me to seek the company of Lady Georgina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you realize how close you are to insulting my lady,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>A flush spread over the other man\u2019s cheekbones. Harry remembered that the earl was Lady Georgina\u2019s younger brother. He couldn\u2019t be more than, what, five or six and twenty? His air of authority made him seem older.</p><p>\u201cIf you do not take my money and leave her alone, I\u2019ll see that you\u2019re dismissed without reference,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m employed by your sister, not you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you no pride, man?\u201d Tony pulled his horse up short. \u201cWhat kind of a cur preys on a lonely woman?\u201d</p><p>Harry halted his horse as well. \u201cDo you really think your sister wouldn\u2019t see straight through a man trying to take advantage of her?\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve put her in danger. Violet says our sister was attacked while in your company.\u201d</p><p>Harry sighed. \u201cDid Lady Violet also tell you that Lady Georgina fired a pistol at the attackers?\u201d The other man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOr that if I\u2019d had my way, she wouldn\u2019t have been in the gig with me in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Tony winced. \u201cRode roughshod over you, did she? She does have a persistent streak.\u201d</p><p>Harry raised one eyebrow.</p><p>Tony coughed and started his horse. \u201cBe that as it may, a gentleman doesn\u2019t continue to press his attentions on a lady who can\u2019t return them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, as I see it, you have two problems, my lord,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cOne, that the lady does, in fact, return my attentions, and two\u201d\u2014Harry turned to meet the earl\u2019s gaze\u2014\u201cI am no gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cViolet, open this door!\u201d George held her breath and applied her ear to the wood. Nothing. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there. I can hear you breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Her sister\u2019s voice came petulantly from inside.</p><p>Ha! \u201cViolet Elizabeth Sarah Maitland. Open this door at once or I shall have Greaves take the hinges off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. The hinges are inside.\u201d Violet sounded triumphant.</p><p>So they were, the little minx. George inhaled and gritted her teeth. \u201cThen I shall have him bash the door in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Violet\u2019s voice was closer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you should count on that.\u201d She crossed her arms and tapped one foot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There came a scraping from the other side; then the door cracked open. One tear-stained eye peeped out.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear.\u201d George pushed the door the rest of the way open and walked in, closing it behind her. \u201cTime to cut line. Whatever possessed you to write to Tony?\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s lower lip began to tremble. \u201cThat man has you in his clutches. He\u2019s beguiled you with his caresses and his carnal wiles.\u201d</p><p>Caresses and carnal wiles? George knit her brows. \u201cWhat do you know about carnal wiles?\u201d</p> <p>Violet\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said much too fast. \u201cWell, only what everybody hears.\u201d</p><p>George stared as her younger sister blushed. It always was a problem, trying to lie with fair skin. \u201cViolet,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cis there something you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Violet let out a squeaking wail and flung herself into George\u2019s arms. Oh, dear.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, sweet.\u201d She stumbled back\u2014Violet was an inch or two taller\u2014and sat in the cushioned window seat. \u201cIt can\u2019t be as bad as all that.\u201d</p><p>Violet tried to speak, choked, and cried some more. George rocked her, murmuring the inanities one whispers to a distressed child, and brushed the hair back from her sister\u2019s damp brow.</p> <p>Violet inhaled, shuddering. \u201cY-you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve done something really awful.\u201d She scrubbed her eyes with a hand. \u201cI... I\u2019ve sinned, George!\u201d</p><p>George couldn\u2019t help the twitch of her lips\u2014Violet was always so dramatic\u2014but she firmed her mouth at once. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2019ve lain with a man.\u201d The words were indistinct because Violet had buried her head, but George couldn\u2019t mistake them.</p><p>She immediately sobered, dread clutching at her throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d She pried Violet away from her breast. \u201cLook at me. What do you mean?\u201d Perhaps her sister had mistaken the matter somehow; confused an embrace for something more.</p><p>Violet raised a ravaged face. \u201cI gave my virginity away to a man. There was blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord.\u201d No, not Violet, not her baby sister. George felt tears prick at her own eyes, but she willed them away and framed her sister\u2019s face with her hands. \u201cDid he force you? Did he hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cN-no.\u201d Violet choked on a sob. \u201cIt\u2019s almost worse. I did it of my own free will. I\u2019m a wanton. A... a harlot.\u201d She broke down again and hid her face in George\u2019s skirts.</p><p>George stroked her sister\u2019s back and waited and thought. She had to handle this well the first time. When Violet had calmed again, George said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can go as far as saying that you\u2019re a harlot. I mean, you didn\u2019t take any money, did you?\u201d</p><p>Violet shook her head. \u201cOf course\u2014\u201d</p><p>George held up her hand. \u201cAnd as for being a wanton, well... it was only the one man. Am I correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d Violet\u2019s lower lip trembled.</p><p>\u201cThen, I think you will have to forgive my bias in saying that it is at least as much the gentleman\u2019s fault as yours. How old is he?\u201d</p><p>Violet looked a bit mutinous at having been demoted from wanton. \u201cFive and twenty.\u201d</p><p>Five and twenty! The seducing, lecherous... George inhaled. \u201cAnd do I know him?\u201d she asked calmly.</p> <p>Violet pushed away from her sister. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you! I\u2019ll not be made to marry him.\u201d</p><p>George stared, her heart stopping in her chest. \u201cAre you increasing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Violet\u2019s horror was unfeigned, thank goodness.</p><p>George blew out a relieved breath. \u201cThen why do you think I would make you marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not you, but Tony...\u201d Violet got up and paced around the room. \u201cHe\u2019s been writing me letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Violet turned to glare at her. \u201cHim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him.\u201d George frowned. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to marry him. He says he loves me. But, George\u201d\u2014Violet picked up a candlestick from the bedside table and gestured with it\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t love him anymore. I did. I mean, I thought I did. That\u2019s why I, well, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d George felt herself blushing.</p><p>\u201cBut then afterward I started noticing how far apart his eyes were and that he says ain\u2019t in such an affected way.\u201d Violet shrugged and set the candlestick down on the dresser. \u201cAnd then it was gone, the love or whatever. I don\u2019t hate him; I just don\u2019t love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you feel about Mr. Pye?\u201d Violet asked. \u201cAre you over him now?\u201d</p><p>George had a vision of Harry Pye, his head arched back, the tendons in his neck straining as he convulsed over her. A slow heat invaded her loins. She caught herself dropping her eyelids.</p><p>She snapped them open, sitting up straight at the same time. \u201cUh, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Violet looked forlorn. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s me, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, sweetheart. Maybe it\u2019s that you\u2019re only fifteen. Or,\u201d she added hastily when Violet stuck out her lip, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s that he\u2019s just not the right man for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, George!\u201d Violet flopped backward onto her bed. \u201cI\u2019ll never have another suitor. How would I explain that I\u2019ve lost my maidenhead? Perhaps I should marry him. No other man will ever have me.\u201d Violet stared at the canopy over her bed. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I can bear the way he takes snuff for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be torturous,\u201d George murmured, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to put my foot down and forbid you to marry him. So you\u2019re saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a peach.\u201d Violet smiled tremulously from the bed. \u201cBut he\u2019s said he will have to reveal all if I don\u2019t become his bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d If she ever got her hands on the blackmailing bastard... \u201cThen I think you will really have to tell me his name, sweetheart. I know\u201d\u2014she held up her hand as Violet started to protest\u2014\u201cbut it\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d her sister asked in a small voice.</p><p>George met her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to tell Tony who he is so Tony can convince him that you aren\u2019t interested in marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Tony, George?\u201d Violet flung her arms wide across the bed, unconsciously taking the position of a martyr. \u201cYou know the way he inspects one so coldly down his nose. It makes me feel like a worm. A squashed worm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, I am aware of his look,\u201d George said. \u201cI was the recipient of it just this morning, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d Violet looked contrite before reverting to her own dilemma. \u201cTony will make me marry him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re maligning Tony, now,\u201d George said. \u201cHe may have lost all sense of humor since he assumed the title, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll force a marriage on a sister, especially his fifteen-year-old sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though.\u201d George smiled. \u201cThink how useful Tony will be when he convinces this gentleman. Really, it is the only advantage I can think of to having an earl for a brother.\u201d</p><p>THAT NIGHT GEORGE SHIVERED and pulled the hood of her cloak tighter around her face. It was late, almost midnight, and Harry\u2019s cottage was dark. Perhaps he had already retired for the evening? At any other time, for any other reason, she would\u2019ve turned around. But this compulsion drove her on. She had to see him again. Except it wasn\u2019t to see him that she\u2019d come here so late in the evening, was it? She felt a blush start high on her cheekbones. She wanted to do more, much more, than see Harry Pye. And she didn\u2019t want to examine too closely the reasons behind that urge.</p><p>She knocked at his door.</p><p>It swung open almost immediately, as if he\u2019d been waiting for her. \u201cMy lady.\u201d His green eyes were heavy.</p><p>Harry\u2019s chest was bare, and her gaze was drawn to it. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she began vapidly, addressing his left nipple.</p><p>He reached out a long arm and drew her in. Slammed the door and pushed her up against it. Shoved back her hood and seized her lips. He tilted her head back and slanted his mouth over hers, thrusting his tongue between her lips. Oh, heavens, she needed this. Had she become so wanton after only one taste? His hands gripped the back of her head, and she felt the pins falling out. Her hair came undone down her back. Her hands roamed, kneading, stroking his back. She could taste ale on his tongue and smell his musk. Her nipples were already peaked and aching as if they recognized him and what he was.</p><p>He drew his lips down her neck, open-mouthed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>And while she was trying to remember to what he replied, he hooked his hand in her bodice. He pulled down savagely, tearing the fine fabric and exposing her naked breasts. George gasped and felt moisture between her legs. Then he had his mouth on her breast, nipping at it. She actually worried that he would bite her. He seemed animal, fundamental, male to her female. He reached her nipple and did bite, a sharp pinching.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but arch her head back and moan.</p><p>He had his hand under her skirts now, pushing and shoving them up as if he were impatient to find her center. She clutched at his shoulders when he reached his goal. He brushed his fingers over her, touching, feeling.</p><p>He lifted his head from her breast and chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re wet for me.\u201d His voice was dark. Sexual.</p><p>He brought both hands under her legs and lifted her, bracing her back against the door; all her weight was on him. She was helplessly spread as he moved between her thighs. She felt the brush of his trousers. And then the brush of him. Her eyes opened wide and met his, gleaming and green like a predator\u2019s.</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>He rocked his hips, just a little. She felt the intrusion. She imagined that wide head, splitting her lips down there, and she panted, eyes half closed. He rocked again, and his cock pushed in a little farther.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d His breath puffed over her lips.</p><p>With an effort, she opened her eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped. She felt drunken, dazed, as if she floated in a marvelous daydream.</p><p>\u201cI hope you do not mind\u201d\u2014he rocked\u2014\u201cmy boldness.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cNo. I, uh, don\u2019t mind.\u201d She could hardly get the words out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d He licked her nipple, the devil, and she jumped.</p><p>She was so sensitive, the feeling was almost painful. I\u2019m going to get him for this.</p><p>He rocked.</p><p>Some other time. \u201cVery sure,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>He grinned, but a bead of sweat ran down his temple. \u201cThen with your permission.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for her nod but slammed his entire length into her, shoving her up the door and hitting with exquisite accuracy that place. George wrapped her legs, her arms, and her heart around Harry. He withdrew with agonizing slowness and repeated the process, this time swiveling a bit when he crashed into her. The impact sent shards of ecstasy skittering through her.</p><p>She was going to die from pleasure.</p><p>He withdrew again, and she could feel every inch dragging against her sensitive flesh. She waited, suspended in time and air, for him to mate her once more. And he did, his cock thrusting into her and his pelvis rubbing her exposed center. Then he seemed to lose control. He began a rapid pistoning, his movements short and jerky. But just as effective, damn him. And it began for her, spreading in waves that seemed to have no end. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath, couldn\u2019t see or hear, could only moan in primitive abandon and open her mouth and fill it with his shoulder, salty and warm.</p><p>She bit Harry.</p><p>He came, withdrawing from her suddenly but keeping his arms around her as he shook and spasmed his release between them. He leaned into her, his weight keeping her pinned to the wall as they both drew deep, shuddering breaths. George felt heavy. Listless. Like she\u2019d never be able to move her limbs again. She stroked his shoulder, rubbing at the bite mark she\u2019d made. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry sighed against her hair. He let her legs fall to the floor as he steadied her. \u201cI wish I could carry you to my bed, but I fear you\u2019ve just drained me, my lady. That is\u201d\u2014he pulled away enough to look her in the eye\u2014\u201cif you mean to stay the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d George tested her legs. Wobbly but adequate. She made her way to the small bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll stay the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your brother?\u201d he asked from behind her.</p><p>\u201cMy brother does not control my life,\u201d George said loftily. \u201cBesides, I snuck out the servants\u2019 entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He had followed her into the bedroom, and she saw now that he carried a basin of water.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI should have done this last night.\u201d Was he embarrassed?</p><p>Harry set down the basin beside the bed and helped her remove her gown and chemise, then knelt to take off her shoes and stockings. \u201cLie down, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George lay back on the bed. For some reason she was shy now when she hadn\u2019t been before during their wild lovemaking. He took a cloth and dipped it in the basin, wringing it out; then he stroked it down her neck. She closed her eyes. The wet cloth left coolness and goose bumps in its wake. She heard him dip and wring out the cloth again, the trickle of the water somehow erotic in the room\u2019s stillness. He washed down her chest, over her breasts, and across her belly, leaving a trail of cold heat.</p><p>Her breath was coming faster now, anticipating what would come next.</p><p>But he started again at her feet, trailing the cloth up her calves. Gently, he spread her thighs and washed the inner curves. He wet the cloth, and she felt the coolness against her mons. He stroked the cloth deliberately between her folds and her breath caught. Then his weight left the bed.</p><p>George opened her eyes and watched Harry strip his breeches down. Nude, his eyes on hers, he took the cloth and rubbed it across his chest. Dip. Wring. He washed under his arms. Across his belly.</p><p>Her eyes dropped and she licked her lips.</p><p>His penis jumped. George looked up, and her gaze met his. Harry dipped the cloth in the water. He lifted his manhood to wash the heavy sac underneath. Another dip in the basin and he drew the wet cloth up his cock, pulling the cloth around, leaving the skin glistening. He scrubbed the rag in his pubic hair and then threw it to the floor. Harry advanced on the bed, his penis stiff. George couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him.</p><p>He placed one knee beside her, making the bed dip. The ropes holding the mattress creaked. \u201cAre you going to finish your fairy tale, my lady?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cFairy tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Leopard Prince, the young king.\u201d He brushed his lips over her collarbone. \u201cThe beautiful princess, the Golden Swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d She scrambled to think. Harry\u2019s mouth was wandering to the underside of her left breast. \u201cI think we\u2019d got to when the father king told the young king to get\u2014\u201d She squeaked.</p><p>He\u2019d reached the nipple. Her breast was already tender from their play before.</p><p>Harry lifted his head. \u201cThe Golden Swan held by the nasty witch.\u201d He blew cool air on the wet nipple.</p><p>George gasped. \u201cYes. Of course, the young king sent the Leopard Prince after it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Harry murmured to the other nipple.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Leopard Prince turned into... ahhh...\u201d</p> <p>He had sucked that nipple into his mouth.</p><p>He let it pop out. \u201cA man,\u201d he prompted, and blew.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d George went under for a few seconds. \u201cYes. And the Leopard Prince held his emerald crown in his hand...\u201d</p><p>He was trailing kisses down her abdomen.</p><p>\u201c... and wished for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Was he licking her belly button? \u201cA cloak to make him invisible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Harry propped his chin on her lower belly, his arms resting across her pelvic bones.</p><p>George craned her neck to see him. He was lying between her spread legs, his face only inches from her... And he was looking gravely interested in her story.</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d She let her head drop back on the pillow. \u201cAnd he put on the cloak and went and stole the Golden Swan without the nasty witch even knowing. And when he got back\u201d\u2014what was Harry doing down there?\u2014\u201che gave the Golden Swan to... Oh, my Lord!\u201d</p><p>Harry finished leisurely licking up through the flanges of her woman\u2019s place, then kissed that spot. He raised his head. \u201cIs that part of the fairy tale, my lady?\u201d he inquired politely.</p><p>George tunneled her fingers in his silky hair. \u201cNo. I\u2019m through telling the story for now.\u201d She pulled his head back down. \u201cDo. Not. Stop.\u201d</p><p>She thought he may have laughed, as she seemed to feel a vibration, but then Harry lowered his mouth, placed it over her nubbin, and sucked on it.</p><p>And, frankly, after that she no longer cared.</p><p>\u201cWHAT DO YOU DREAM ABOUT at night?\u201d Lady Georgina asked him a long time later.</p><p>\u201cMmph?\u201d Harry tried to focus his mind. His body was a dead loss. His limbs were leaden, almost liquid with fatigue, and he was struggling to stay awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you asleep?\u201d His lady obviously wasn\u2019t. He could feel her fingers stroking through the hair on his chest.</p><p>He made a heroic effort. \u201cNo.\u201d He opened his eyes. Wide. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you dream about at night?\u201d</p><p>Rats. He suppressed a shudder. \u201cNothing.\u201d He winced. That wasn\u2019t what a gently born lady wanted to hear. \u201cBesides you,\u201d he added hastily.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not fishing for a compliment. I want to know what you think about. What you want. What you care for.\u201d</p><p>What he cared for? At this time of night? After he\u2019d loved her, not once, but twice? \u201cAh.\u201d He felt his eyelids drifting shut and struggled to open them again. He was just too tired for this. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a simple man, my lady. I think mostly about the harvest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Her voice was intent.</p><p>What did she want from him? He stroked her hair as her head lay on his chest and tried to think, but it was too great an exertion. He let his eyes close and said whatever came to mind. \u201cWell, I worry about the rain, as you know. That it won\u2019t stop in time this year. That the crop will be ruined.\u201d He sighed, but she was quiet beneath his hand. \u201cI think about next year\u2019s planting, whether we should try hops this far north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He yawned gigantically. \u201cFor ale. But then we\u2019d have to find a market for the harvest. It would be a good cash crop, but would the farmers have enough of their own to keep them through the winter?\u201d She traced a circle on his breastbone, her touch almost tickling. He was waking up now as he thought about the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to introduce a new crop to the farmers. They\u2019re set in their ways, don\u2019t like innovations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you convince them, then?\u201d</p><p>He was silent a minute, considering, but she didn\u2019t interrupt. He had never told anyone of this idea. \u201cSometimes I think that a grammar school in West Dikey would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. If the farmers or their children could read, were educated even a little, innovation might be easier. And then each generation would be more learned, and they in turn would be more open to new thoughts and ways of doing things. It would be an improvement measured in decades, not years, and it would affect not only the landowner\u2019s income, but also the lives of the farmers themselves.\u201d Harry was wide awake now, but his lady was silent. Perhaps she thought educating farmers a foolish idea.</p><p>Then she spoke. \u201cWe\u2019d have to find a teacher. A gentleman who was patient with children.\u201d</p><p>Her we warmed him. \u201cYes. Someone who likes the country and understands the seasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe seasons?\u201d The hand on his chest had stilled.</p><p>He covered it with his own and rubbed the back of her hand with his thumb as he talked. \u201cSpring, cold and wet, when the farmers must get the seed into the ground, but not too soon or it\u2019ll frost, and the ewes are all lambing at once, or so it seems. Summer, long and hot, tending the sheep under the wide, blue skies and watching the grain grow. Fall, hoping for the sun to shine so the harvest will be good. If the sun shines, the people celebrate and there are festivals; if it doesn\u2019t, they go about with thin, fearful faces. And winter, long and dreary, the farmers and their families sitting by a little fire in the cottages, telling tales and waiting for spring.\u201d He stopped and squeezed her shoulder self-consciously. \u201cThe seasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know so much,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOnly what goes on in this part of Yorkshire. I\u2019m sure you could find many who would think that little enough.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her springy hair brushing against his shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019re aware. You know how the people around you think. What they\u2019re feeling. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He tried to see her face, but her head was tilted down against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI get caught up in silly things like the cut of a gown or a new pair of earrings, and I lose track of the people around me. I don\u2019t think about whether Tiggle is being courted by the new footman or how Tony is doing all by himself in London. You wouldn\u2019t know it to look at Tony, he seems so big and strong and in control, but he can get lonely. And Violet...\u201d She sighed. \u201cViolet was seduced this summer at our family home in Leicestershire and I didn\u2019t know. I never even suspected.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThen how did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe confessed just this morning.\u201d</p><p>Her face was still hidden, and he tried to brush the hair away from her eyes. \u201cIf it was a secret, if she didn\u2019t want to tell you before now, it would be hard to know. Children of that age are very mysterious sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cBut I\u2019m her sister. I\u2019m the closest one to her. I should have known.\u201d She sighed again, a small, sad sound that made him want to shield her from all the world\u2019s worries. \u201cHe\u2019s pressing her to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeonard Wentworth. He\u2019s a penniless nobody. He seduced her simply to get her to wed him.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his mouth over her forehead, unsure of what to say. Did she see how similar her sister\u2019s situation was to her own? Was she afraid that he, too, would demand marriage as a forfeit for their lovemaking?</p><p>\u201cOur mother...\u201d She hesitated, then began again. \u201cOur mother is not always well. M\u2019man has many illnesses and complaints, most imagined, I\u2019m afraid. She spends so much of her time looking inward for the next disease that she doesn\u2019t often notice those around her. I\u2019ve tried to be a mother to Violet in her stead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. That\u2019s not the point. Loving Violet isn\u2019t the problem.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always despised M\u2019man.\u201d She spoke so low, he stopped breathing so he could hear her. \u201cFor being so withdrawn, so uncaring, so very selfish. I never thought I was like her, but maybe I am.\u201d She finally looked at him, and he saw crystal tears in her eyes. \u201cMaybe I am.\u201d</p><p>Something in his chest twisted. Harry bent his head and licked the salt from her cheeks. He kissed her gently, softly, feeling the tremble beneath his mouth, wishing he knew the words to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to lay all my woes on your shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love your sister,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would bear your woes, my lady, whatever they might be.\u201d</p><p>He felt the brush of her lips against his collarbone. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He listened, but she said no more, and, after a while, her breath evened out into sleep. But Harry stayed awake long into the night, staring at the dark and holding his lady.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Lady Georgina\u2019s rump, smooth and soft, nestled against his morning bone-on. Harry opened his eyes. She\u2019d spent the night again. Her shoulder was a dim outline in front of him. His arm was draped over her hip, and he curved his hand, cupping her belly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, her soft breathing slow in sleep.</p><p>He tilted his head forward so that her hair tickled his nose. He could smell that exotic scent she wore, and his cock throbbed, like a trained dog sitting up at his master\u2019s signal. He searched through her hair until he found the back of her neck, warm and damp with sleep. He opened his mouth to taste her.</p><p>She mumbled and hunched her shoulder.</p><p>He smiled and inched his hand down, slowly, slyly, until he felt her bush tangling about his fingers. He touched her pearl. That bit of female flesh had been his greatest discovery as a young man. The revelation that women held such secrets in their bodies had been heady. He didn\u2019t even recall the face of his first lover, but he could remember his awe at the way women were made.</p><p>He flicked his lady\u2019s pearl now. Not hard, barely a feather touch, really. She didn\u2019t move, so he grew bolder and pressed down gently. Sort of petted. Her hips twitched. Harry licked the back of her neck and could almost taste what he\u2019d licked last night\u2014the place where his fingers played. She had liked that, his lady, when he\u2019d kissed and licked and sucked her there. She\u2019d arched her back and moaned so loudly he\u2019d wanted to laugh out loud. Now he slowly stroked, playing with her sleek, soft folds, and felt her wetness build. His cock was almost aching, as hard as he could ever remember it. He lifted her upper leg and draped it over his hip. Her breathing hitched, and he felt a smile break his face.</p><p>Harry took his prick in hand and guided it to that warm, wet place. He flexed his arse and slid in, so tight, so smooth, he wanted to groan in pain and in pleasure. He shoved again, gently but steadily, and slid farther in. One more time, and the hair around his cock met her bum. She was panting. He lowered her leg and finally had to groan aloud. So perfect. Harry reached around and found her pearl again. He pressed. Christ, he could feel her squeezing around him. Instead of thrusting, he ground against her, pressing that part of her until she squeezed again.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered, kissing the back of her neck.</p><p>She was pushing back against him. So impatient. He grinned and ground some more.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDearling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTup me, Harry.\u201d</p><p>And he thrust hard, in surprise and in pure lust. Good God, he never thought she\u2019d know that word, let alone say it.</p><p>\u201cOhhh, yes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He was humping now, nearly out of control, and her moans were so erotic. Each time was better than before, and he thought uneasily that it was possible he could never get enough of her. That he\u2019d always want her this much. But then he felt her spasm around him as he gripped her hips and that thought fled. It was so agonizingly good that he nearly forgot; he was almost too late. But in the end, he pulled his cock out of her in time and spent, shuddering, in the sheets next to her.</p><p>He stroked her hip and tried to calm his breathing. \u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She turned to face him. Her face was flushed and sleepy and satisfied. \u201cGood morning, Harry.\u201d Lady Georgina pulled his face to hers and kissed him.</p><p>It was a light, gentle touch, but it made something in his chest contract. Harry knew suddenly that he would do anything for her, his lady. Lie. Steal. Kill.</p><p>Relinquish his pride.</p><p>Was this how Da had felt? He sat up and grabbed his trousers.</p> <p>\u201cAre you always this active in the morning?\u201d she asked behind him. \u201cBecause I must tell you that some do not consider it a virtue.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and pulled on his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d He finally turned to face her.</p><p>She was propped on one elbow, the bed linens about her waist. Her orange hair cascaded around her white shoulders, tangled and wanton. Her nipples were pale rose-brown, darker pink at the tips. He\u2019d never seen a more beautiful woman in his life.</p><p>He turned away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly disappointed. More like tired,\u201d Lady Georgina said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you ever just lay around in bed in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He finished buttoning his shirt.</p><p>He started into the other room and heard a faint scrape. He stopped.</p><p>It came again.</p><p>He looked back at her. \u201cI thought your brother didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina looked as indignant as a naked woman could. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>Harry merely raised an eyebrow and closed the door to the bedroom. He crossed to the cottage door and opened it. On the step huddled a small bundle of rags. What...? The mop of hair raised its head, and Harry stared into the face of the boy he\u2019d seen at the Pollard cottage.</p><p>\u201cShe went drinking and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d The boy said it flatly, as if he\u2019d been expecting to be abandoned someday.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best come in,\u201d Harry replied.</p><p>The boy hesitated, then stood and ducked inside.</p><p>Lady Georgina poked her head around the corner of the bedroom door. \u201cWho is it, Harry?\u201d She caught sight of the small shape. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Boy and lady stared at each other.</p><p>Harry put the kettle on for tea.</p><p>She recovered first. \u201cI\u2019m Lady Georgina Maitland from the manor. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>The boy merely stared.</p><p>\u201cBest to nod when a lady talks to you, lad,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI hardly think that\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>But the boy tugged his forelock and dipped his head.</p><p>Lady Georgina sidled into the room. She\u2019d thrown a bed linen over her gown from the night before. Harry remembered he\u2019d torn the bodice. \u201cDo you know his name?\u201d she whispered in his ear.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWould you like tea? I don\u2019t have much else. Some bread and butter.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina brightened, whether at the offer of food or something to do he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cWe can make toast,\u201d she said.</p><p>Harry cocked an eyebrow, but she\u2019d already found the bread and butter, the knife, and a bent fork. She hacked at the bread and sawed off a shapeless lump.</p><p>All three of them stared at it.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI think cutting may be more of a man\u2019s job.\u201d She handed the knife to Harry. \u201cNow, don\u2019t make the slices too thick or they won\u2019t toast and they\u2019ll have that awful spongy bit in the center. And it\u2019s important they\u2019re not too thin or they\u2019ll burn, and I detest burnt toast, don\u2019t you?\u201d She turned to the boy, who nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll butter. And I suppose\u201d\u2014she looked critically at the boy\u2014\u201cyou can toast. You do know how to toast bread properly, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The lad nodded and took the fork as if it were the sword of King Arthur.</p><p>Soon there was a pile of crusty bread, dripping with butter, in the center of the table. Lady Georgina poured tea, and the three of them sat down to break their fast.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could just stay here,\u201d she said, licking butter from her fingers, \u201cbut I suppose I shall have to return to the manor at least to dress properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you leave word to have the carriage come for you?\u201d Harry asked. If she hadn\u2019t, he would lend her his horse.</p><p>\u201cI saw a carriage this morning,\u201d the boy piped up.</p><p>\u201cYou mean waiting on the drive?\u201d Lady Georgina asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The boy swallowed a huge mouthful. \u201cIt was going up the drive at a gallop, fair flew by, it did.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina and Harry looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cBlack with red trim?\u201d she asked. The color of Tony\u2019s carriage.</p><p>The boy reached for his fifth piece of toast and shook his head. \u201cBlue. All over blue.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina gave an exclamation and choked on her tea.</p><p>Harry and the boy stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOscar,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMy middle brother.\u201d</p><p>Harry set his teacup down. \u201cJust how many brothers do you have, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOUR LAND STEWARD, GEORGIE?\u201d Oscar picked up an iced bun from the tray Cook had prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the thing, darling. I mean\u201d\u2014he waved the bun\u2014\u201ceither one should choose someone from one\u2019s own class or go all the way and seduce a brawny young stable hand.\u201d</p><p>Oscar grinned at George, his treacle-brown eyes crinkling devilishly at the corners. His hair was darker than Tony\u2019s, almost black. Only when he stood in sunlight could you sometimes make out the red highlights.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t helping.\u201d Tony pinched the bridge of his nose between forefinger and thumb.</p><p>\u201cYes, Oscar,\u201d Ralph, the youngest Maitland brother, put in his two pence. Gangly and large-boned, his frame was just beginning to show the bulk of manhood. \u201cGeorgina couldn\u2019t seduce anyone. She\u2019s not married. He must have seduced her, the bounder.\u201d</p><p>Oscar and Tony stared at Ralph for a moment, apparently stunned into silence by his recitation of the obvious.</p><p>George sighed, and not for the first time since entering her library. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. At first sight of Oscar\u2019s carriage she should\u2019ve tucked her tail between her legs and made a run for the hills. They might not have found her for days; weeks, if she\u2019d been lucky. She could\u2019ve slept under the stars and lived on wild strawberries and dew\u2014never mind that strawberries didn\u2019t fruit in September. Instead, she\u2019d meekly dressed in her most demure gown and presented herself to her three younger brothers.</p><p>Who were all now glaring at her. \u201cActually, I believe it was a mutual seduction, if that\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Ralph looked puzzled, Tony groaned, and Oscar laughed, nearly choking on a mouthful of his bun.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not important,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhat is important\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that you break it off at once.\u201d Oscar finished for him. He started to shake a finger at George and realized he still held the bun. He looked around for a plate and set his bun down. \u201cNow, after you have married a suitable gentleman, then you may take up with whoever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not!\u201d Ralph jumped to his feet, an effective move, since he was the tallest. \u201cGeorgina isn\u2019t like the macaronis and libertines and whores you hang about with. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never, ever, in my entire life, consorted with macaronis.\u201d Oscar arched an awful eyebrow at his younger brother.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, please,\u201d Tony said. \u201cSave your teasing for later. George, what do you plan to do with your land steward? Do you want to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Tony!\u201d Both Oscar and Ralph started.</p><p>Tony held up a hand, silencing them. \u201cGeorge?\u201d</p><p>George blinked. What did she want from Harry? To be close to him, she knew, but beyond that, matters became complicated. Why, oh why, couldn\u2019t she muddle along as she always had?</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Tony said, \u201cmuch as I hate to admit it, Oscar and Ralph are right. You must either break it off or marry the fellow. You aren\u2019t the type of lady to engage in this kind of behavior.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. George\u2019s chest felt suddenly tight, as if someone had crept up behind her and yanked her corset strings taut. She always felt this sensation at the thought of marriage. What could she say? \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kills sheep. Violet says so in her letter.\u201d Ralph crossed his arms. \u201cGeorgina cannot marry a madman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No wonder Violet was hiding. She must\u2019ve sent letters to all three of their brothers. George narrowed her eyes. Her sister was probably in the hills at this very moment, trying to figure out exactly how one went about drinking dew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading my mail again.\u201d Oscar selected a tart from the tray, apparently having forgotten the bun, and shook it at Ralph. \u201cThat letter was to me. Yours said nothing about sheep.\u201d</p><p>Ralph opened his mouth and closed it a few times, like a mule unsure of the bit between its teeth. \u201cHow would you know that if you hadn\u2019t been reading my letters?\u201d</p><p>Oscar smirked in a loathsome way. One day someone was going to hit him. \u201cI\u2019m older than you. It\u2019s my duty to keep tabs on my impressionable young brother.\u201d</p> <p>Crash!</p><p>Everyone jerked around to the fireplace, where shards of glass lay on the hearth.</p><p>Tony leaned on the mantel and frowned sternly back. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t care for that crystal vase, George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no, not at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Tony clipped. \u201cNow, then. Edifying as this display of brotherly love is, I think we\u2019ve wandered from the main point.\u201d He held up a hand and ticked off his large-knuckled fingers. \u201cOne, do you think Harry Pye is a madman going about the countryside killing Granville\u2019s sheep?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d That might be the only thing she was sure of.</p><p>\u201cFine. Ah. Ah.\u201d Tony shook his head at Ralph, who\u2019d begun to protest. \u201cDo you both trust George\u2019s judgment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ralph said.</p><p>\u201cImplicitly,\u201d Oscar replied.</p><p>Tony nodded, then turned back to her. \u201cTwo, do you want to marry Harry Pye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Tony, a land steward!\u201d Oscar burst out. \u201cYou know he\u2019s only in it for...\u201d He stopped and looked flustered. \u201cSorry, Georgie.\u201d</p> <p>George tilted her chin away. She felt as if something fluttered in her throat, impeding the air.</p><p>Only Tony met the objection head-on. \u201cDo you think he wants your money, George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beastly, beastly brothers.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and stared pointedly at Oscar.</p><p>Oscar threw up his arms and pushed his open palms at Tony. \u201cFine!\u201d Oscar went to brood by the window, taking his plate of food with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to marry him?\u201d Tony persisted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d She couldn\u2019t breathe. When had it come to marriage? Marriage was like a fluffy coverlet that enveloped its occupants closer and closer, the air growing thin and stale, until they stifled to death and didn\u2019t even realize they were already dead.</p><p>Tony closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them. \u201cI know you\u2019ve avoided marriage thus far, and I can understand. We all can.\u201d</p> <p>At the window, Oscar shrugged one shoulder.</p><p>Ralph looked at his feet.</p><p>Tony just stared at her. \u201cIf you\u2019ve given yourself to this man, don\u2019t you think the choice has already been made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d George got to her feet. \u201cMaybe not. But in either case, I won\u2019t be pushed. Give me some time to think.\u201d</p><p>Oscar looked up from the window and exchanged glances with Tony.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you time,\u201d Tony said, and the sympathy in his eyes made her want to cry.</p><p>George bit her lip and turned to a nearby wall of books. She trailed a fingertip over the spines. Behind her she heard Ralph say, \u201cUp for a bit of a ride, Oscar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oscar sounded irritable\u2014and like his mouth was full again. \u201cAre you mad? It\u2019s begun to rain.\u201d</p><p>A sigh. \u201cCome with me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Oh. Ooh. Yes, of course.\u201d Her two younger brothers quietly exited the room.</p><p>George almost smiled. Oscar had always been the least perceptive of her siblings. She turned to look behind her. Tony was frowning into the fire. She winced. Oh, damn, she\u2019d forgotten to tell him yesterday.</p><p>Tony must have uncanny peripheral vision. He glanced up sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, you\u2019re not going to like this. I meant to tell you right away and then...\u201d She turned over a palm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s another sisterly problem you must deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet?\u201d</p><p>George sighed. \u201cViolet has gotten herself into a bit of a fix.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cShe was seduced this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, George,\u201d Tony said, his voice more sharp than if he\u2019d yelled. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me at once? Is she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s fine. And I\u2019m sorry, but I only got the story out of her yesterday.\u201d George blew out a breath. She was so weary, but it was best to get it over with. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to tell you; she thought you\u2019d make her marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the usual response to a lady of good family being compromised.\u201d Tony frowned at her, his eyebrows ferocious. \u201cIs the fellow suitable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d George pressed her lips together. \u201cHe has been threatening her. He says he\u2019ll expose her if she doesn\u2019t marry him.\u201d</p><p>He stood still for a moment before the fireplace, a big hand propped against the mantel. One forefinger tapped slowly on the marble. She held her breath. Tony could be unbelievably stuffy and conventional at times. It probably came from growing up the heir.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that,\u201d he said abruptly, and George let out her breath. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeonard Wentworth. It took me forever to get it out of her. She\u2019d only tell me when I promised that I wouldn\u2019t let you force her into marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019ve been cast as the choleric father in this drama,\u201d Tony muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Wentworth. What is he?\u201d</p><p>George shrugged. \u201cI had to think about it, but he must be one of the young men who came up with Ralph this summer. Remember when you had that hunting party in June?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded. \u201cThere were three or four friends with Ralph. Two of them I know, the Alexander brothers; they\u2019re from an old Leicestershire family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Freddy Barclay was there; he didn\u2019t bag any grouse, and the others teased him about it unmercifully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut one of the others shot ten birds,\u201d Tony said thoughtfully. \u201cHe was older than the rest of Ralph\u2019s party, nearer my own age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet says he\u2019s five and twenty.\u201d George grimaced. \u201cCan you imagine a man of that age seducing a girl not even out of the schoolroom? And he\u2019s pressing her for marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fortune hunter,\u201d Tony said. \u201cDamn it. I\u2019ll have to question Ralph about him and find out where to look for this scoundrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d George said. Nothing she did recently seemed to work out well.</p><p>Tony\u2019s wide mouth softened. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t get cross at you for this man\u2019s sins. Oscar, Ralph, and I will sort this out, never fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d George asked.</p><p>Tony frowned, his heavy brows drawn together. He looked just like Father. For a moment he didn\u2019t answer, and she thought perhaps he hadn\u2019t heard. Then he looked up, and she drew in her breath at the steel she saw in his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat will I do? Make him understand how very foolish it is to threaten a Maitland,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be bothering Violet again.\u201d</p><p>George opened her mouth to ask for details, then thought better of it. This was one time when it might be better to mind her own business. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my duties, after all, to look after the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. And between him and M\u2019man it\u2019s a wonder that we survived at all. But then that\u2019s part of the reason I vowed to do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have.\u201d If only she had done as well with her own responsibilities.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried.\u201d He smiled at her, his wide mouth curved boyishly, and she realized how rarely he smiled anymore. But then his smile died. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Violet\u2019s problem, but I can\u2019t do the same for you until you tell me which way I should start. You need to make a decision about Harry Pye, George, and you need to make it soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDOES SHE HAVE A GOLDEN cunt, Pye?\u201d</p><p>Harry stiffened and slowly turned to the speaker, his left hand flexed and loose by his side. He\u2019d taken the boy on his rounds this morning after Lady Georgina had left his cottage; then they\u2019d ridden to West Dikey. He\u2019d hoped to find a pair of shoes for the lad.</p><p>The oaf who\u2019d spoken was the big-fisted man from the brawl at the Cock and Worm. The knife wound that Harry had given him stood out a livid red on his face. It started at one side of his forehead, slashed across the bridge of his nose, and ended on the far cheek. He was flanked on either side by two big men. They\u2019d chosen a good place to confront him. A deserted lane, not much more than an alley. The stink of the open sewer running through the middle of the lane was powerful in the sun.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to put a poultice on that,\u201d Harry said, nodding at the crusted scar on the man\u2019s face. It was oozing pus.</p><p>The other man grinned, stretching the end of the scar on his cheek until it broke open and leaked blood. \u201cDoes she give you pretty things for your stud work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she dresses his pud with gold rings.\u201d One of the man\u2019s cronies giggled.</p><p>Beside him, Harry felt the boy tense. He laid his right hand on his shoulder. \u201cI can open that wound for you, if you like,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201cDrain the poison away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison. Aye, you\u2019d know about poison, wouldn\u2019t you, Pye?\u201d The scarred man sneered in amusement at his own wit. \u201cHear you\u2019ve turned your poisoning from animals to women now.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowned. What?</p><p>His opponent correctly interpreted his frown. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know, then?\u201d The man cocked his head. \u201cThey found her body on th\u2019 moor this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hanging offense, that is. Murder. There\u2019re those who say your neck should be stretched right away. But you\u2019ve been busy with your mistress, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The big man leaned forward, and Harry\u2019s left hand dropped to his boot.</p><p>\u201cDoes she tell you when to spend, Pye? Or maybe she doesn\u2019t let you spend at all. Would soil her fine, white body, wouldn\u2019t it? Having common spunk on her. Don\u2019t bother with that.\u201d He gestured to where Harry\u2019s hand hovered near his knife. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hurt a man-whore.\u201d</p><p>The three men walked off, laughing.</p><p>Harry froze. Whore. The name they\u2019d called his mother so long ago.</p><p>Whore.</p><p>The boy moved beneath his hand. Harry looked down and realized he was clutching his shoulder too tightly. The boy didn\u2019t complain, just shrugged a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d The boy looked up at him and wiped a hand across his nose. \u201cMy ma\u2019s a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Harry released Will\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo was mine.\u201d</p><p>GEORGE PACED THE LIBRARY THAT EVENING. The windows were black mirrors, reflecting the darkness outside. For a second she paused and studied her ghostly reflection. Her hair was perfect, a rarity, but Tiggle had redressed it after supper. She wore a lavender gown, one of her favorites, and her pearl drops. Perhaps she flattered herself, but she felt she looked well, almost handsome, in the frock.</p><p>If only she felt as confident inside.</p><p>She was beginning to think that the library was the wrong place for this meeting. But what other choice was there, really? With her brothers in residence at Woldsly, she couldn\u2019t ask Harry to her rooms, and the last two times she\u2019d gone to his cottage... George felt her face warm. They hadn\u2019t done much talking, had they? So there wasn\u2019t an alternative. But still. The library felt somehow wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of booted footsteps rang in the hall. George squared her shoulders and faced the door, a lonely offering waiting for the dragon. Or maybe the leopard.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, my lady.\u201d Harry prowled into the library.</p><p>Definitely the leopard. She felt the hairs stand on the back of her neck. Harry gave off a sort of volatile energy tonight.</p><p>\u201cGood evening. Won\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d She gestured to the settee.</p> <p>He flicked his eyes in the direction she indicated and back to her. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear. \u201cWell...\u201d George inhaled and tried to remember what she\u2019d planned to say to him. Her speech had made sense in her rooms. But now, with Harry staring at her, now it fell apart like wet paper tissue.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He cocked his head as though to better hear her thoughts. \u201cDo you want it on the settee or the floor?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chair?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cWhere do you want to make love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She felt a flush start on her cheeks. \u201cI haven\u2019t called you here for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His eyebrows raised. \u201cAre you sure? You must\u2019ve ordered me here for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t order you...\u201d She closed her eyes and shook her head and began again. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk.\u201d The word was flat. \u201cDo you want my resignation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Harry laughed, a nasty, hoarse sound.</p> <p>\u201cI may be merely your servarry laughed, a nasty, hoarse sound. \u201cI may be merely your servant, but credit me with some intelligence. You were closeted with your three aristocratic brothers all day, and then you summoned me to your library. What is this if not a dismissal?\u201d</p><p>She was losing control of the conversation. She spread her hands helplessly. \u201cI just need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish to talk about, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know.\u201d George squeezed her eyes shut, trying to think. He wasn\u2019t making this any easier for her. \u201cTony is pressing me to make a decision about us. And I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She drew a breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems simple enough to me, poor commoner that I am,\u201d Harry said. \u201cLet us continue as we have.\u201d</p><p>George looked down at her hands. \u201cBut that\u2019s just it. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>When she looked up again, Harry\u2019s expression was so blank she might\u2019ve been staring in the eyes of a dead man. Lord, how she\u2019d begun to hate that wooden face. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have my resignation by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wrung her hands. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I want at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d Harry seemed suddenly weary. His beautiful green eyes were dulled by something close to despair. \u201cYou can either be my lover or I will leave. I\u2019ll not stay as some convenience for you, like that gelding in your stable here. You ride him when at Woldsly and forget him the rest of the year. Do you even know his name?\u201d</p><p>Her mind went blank. The fact was, she didn\u2019t know the horse\u2019s name. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Pardon, but what is it like, my lady?\u201d Anger was breaking through Harry\u2019s wooden mask, painting scarlet flames across his cheekbones. \u201cAm I a stud for hire? Nice for a romp in bed, but after the tupping, not good enough to show your family?\u201d</p><p>George could feel a blush heat her own cheeks. \u201cWhy are you being so crude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Harry was suddenly in front of her, standing too close. \u201cYou must forgive me, my lady. That\u2019s what you get when you take a common lover: a crude man.\u201d His fingers framed her face, his thumbs hot against her temples. She felt her heart skitter in her chest at his touch. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you wanted when you chose me to take your maidenhead?\u201d</p><p>She could smell spirits on his breath. Was that the reason for this hostility? Was he drunk? If so, he showed no other signs. She inhaled deeply to steady her own emotions, to try to counter his terrible sorrow. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he would not let her speak. He whispered in a cruel, hard voice instead, \u201cA man so crude he takes you against a door? A man so crude he makes you scream when you come? A man so crude he doesn\u2019t have the grace to melt away when he\u2019s no longer wanted?\u201d</p><p>George shuddered at the awful words and scrambled to frame a reply. But it was too late. Harry claimed her mouth and sucked on her bottom lip. He pulled her to him roughly and ground his hips against hers. There it was again, that wild, desperate desire. He bunched her skirts in one hand, pulling them up. George heard a tear but couldn\u2019t bring herself to care.</p><p>He reached underneath and found her mound with ruthless accuracy. \u201cThis is what you get with a common lover.\u201d He speared two fingers into her sheath.</p><p>She gasped at the sudden intrusion, feeling him stretch her as he stroked with his fingers. She shouldn\u2019t feel anything, shouldn\u2019t respond when he\u2014</p><p>His thumb pushed down on her most sensitive spot. \u201cNo finesse, no pretty words. Just hard cock and hot cunny.\u201d His tongue trailed across her cheek. \u201cAnd your cunny is hot, my lady,\u201d he whispered into her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly dripping on my hand.\u201d</p><p>She moaned then. It was impossible for her not to respond to him, even when he touched her in anger. He covered her mouth with his own, swallowing her wail, ravishing her at will. Until she broke all at once and waves of pleasure rushed over her so fast she felt dizzy. George shook in the after-tremors, clinging to Harry as he bent her backward over his arm and fed on her mouth. His fingers left her to stroke over her hip soothingly.</p><p>His mouth gentled.</p><p>Then Harry broke away to hiss in her ear, \u201cI told you, decide what you want before coming to me. I\u2019m not a goddamned lapdog you can pick up and pet and then send away again. You can\u2019t get rid of me that easily.\u201d</p><p>George stumbled, both from his words and from the fact that he\u2019d let her go. She clutched at the back of a chair. \u201cHarry, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d already left the room.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Harry woke with the taste of stale ale in his mouth. He waited a moment before opening his eyes. Although it had been a very long time, he never quite forgot the painful torture of sunlight and a hangover. When he finally cracked open his dry eyes, he saw the room was too bright for early morning. He\u2019d overslept. Groaning, he lurched up and sat for a moment on the edge of his bed, head in hands, feeling uncommonly old.</p><p>God, what an idiot he\u2019d been to drink too much yesterday eve. He\u2019d been trying to track down the rumors about the woman poisoned on the moor, had gone first to the White Mare and then to the Cock and Worm, but Dick wasn\u2019t at his tavern, and no one else would speak to him. In every face he\u2019d seen suspicion and, in some, loathing. Meanwhile, what the scarred man had said to him in West Dikey had sounded in his skull like a chant. Man-whore. Man-whore. Man-whore. Perhaps he\u2019d been trying to drown the words when he\u2019d drunk multiple tankards of ale last night.</p><p>A clatter came from the cottage\u2019s main room.</p><p>Harry swiveled his head carefully in that direction and sighed. Will was probably hungry. He staggered to the door and stared.</p><p>The fire blazed and a steaming teapot sat on the table.</p><p>Will crouched on the floor, strangely still. \u201cI dropped the spoons. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. He hunched his body as if he was trying to make himself smaller, maybe disappear altogether.</p><p>Harry knew that posture. The boy expected to be hit.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His voice sounded like the scrape of a shovel on stony ground. He cleared his throat and sat down. \u201cMade tea, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Will stood up, poured a cup, and carefully handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cTa.\u201d Harry sipped and scalded his throat. He winced and waited, but his stomach felt better, so he took another mouthful.</p><p>\u201cI cut some bread for toast, too.\u201d Will brought a plate for his inspection. \u201cThey\u2019re not so nice as yours, though.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at the uneven slices with a jaundiced eye. He wasn\u2019t sure his belly could take solids at the moment, but the boy needed praise. \u201cBetter than Lady Georgina\u2019s try.\u201d</p><p>His painful smile died as he thought about what he\u2019d said and done to his lady last night. He gazed at the fire. He\u2019d have to go apologize sometime today. Assuming she would still talk to him, that is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll toast them.\u201d Will must be used to sudden, awkward silences. He went about skewering the bread on the crooked fork and finding a spot to hold it over the fire.</p><p>Harry watched him. Will had no father, thanks to Granville, nor mother, either. Just that old woman, his grandmother, and a less loving woman he\u2019d rarely seen. Yet here he was, competently tending to an adult sick from too much drink. Perhaps he\u2019d had to care for his grandmother after a night of swilling. The thought was bitter in Harry\u2019s mouth.</p><p>He took another sip of tea.</p><p>\u201cHere we are, then,\u201d Will said, sounding like an elderly woman. He set a pile of buttered toast on the table and bustled around to another chair.</p><p>Harry bit into a piece of toast and licked melting butter off his thumb. He noticed that Will was looking at him. He nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The boy smiled, revealing a gap in his upper teeth.</p><p>They ate companionably for a while.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a fight with her?\u201d Will swiped up a drip of butter and licked it off his finger. \u201cYour lady, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Harry poured himself more tea, stirring in a large spoonful of sugar this time.</p><p>\u201cMy gran said gentry was evil. Didn\u2019t care if regular folk lived or died, so long as they\u2019d gold plates to eat off of.\u201d Will traced a circle on the table with a greasy finger. \u201cBut your lady was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Lady Georgina\u2019s not like most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s pretty.\u201d Will nodded to himself and took another piece of toast.</p><p>Aye, pretty as well. Harry looked out the cottage window, a feeling of uneasiness beginning to build in him. Would she let him apologize?</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course, she\u2019s not much of a cook. Couldn\u2019t cut the bread straight. You\u2019ll have to help her with that.\u201d Will wrinkled his forehead in thought. \u201cDoes she eat off of gold plates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Will eyed him suspiciously, as if Harry might be withholding important information. Then his look turned to pity. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been invited to supper, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Well, there\u2019d been that dinner in her rooms, but he wasn\u2019t telling Will about that. \u201cI\u2019ve had tea with her, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have gold plates for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Why was he explaining himself?</p><p>Will nodded sagely. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go to supper before you know.\u201d He finished his toast. \u201cHave you brought her presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresents?\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s pitying look was back. \u201cAll girls like presents; that\u2019s what my gran said. And I think she must be right. I like presents.\u201d</p><p>Harry propped his chin in his hands and felt wire-stiff stubble. His head was feeling bad again, but Will seemed to think presents were important. And this was the most the boy had talked since he\u2019d shown up the day before.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of presents?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cPearls, gold boxes, sweetmeats.\u201d Will waved a piece of toast. \u201cThings like that. A horse would be good. Have you got any horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Will sounded disappointed in him. \u201cThen I suppose you can\u2019t give her that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry shook his head. \u201cAnd she has many more horses than my one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what can you give her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she wanted from him. Harry frowned into the dregs of his tea. What could a man like him give a lady like her? Not money or a house. She already had that. And the physical love he gave her\u2014any halfway competent man could do as well. What could he give her that she didn\u2019t already have? Maybe nothing. Maybe she would realize that soon enough, and especially after last night, choose never to see him again.</p> <p>Harry stood. \u201cMore important than a present, I need to speak to Lady Georgina today.\u201d He moved to the cupboard, took down his shaving things, and began stropping his razor.</p><p>Will looked at the dirty plates on the table. \u201cI can wash these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>Will must have refilled the kettle after making tea. It was already full and boiling. Harry divided the hot water between his basin and a big bowl the boy could wash the dishes in. The little mirror he used for shaving showed a ragged face. Harry frowned, then carefully started scraping the stubble from his cheeks. His razor was old but very sharp, and a nick on his chin wouldn\u2019t help his appearance. Behind him, he could hear Will swishing in the water.</p><p>By the time Will finished the dishes, Harry was as ready as he was ever going to be. He\u2019d washed, brushed his hair, and changed into a clean shirt. His head still pounded steadily, but the circles under his eyes had begun to fade.</p> <p>Will looked him over. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I to stay here?\u201d The lad\u2019s face was too stoic for his young age.</p><p>Harry hesitated. \u201cWould you like to see the Woldsly stables while I speak to my lady?\u201d</p><p>Will was immediately on his feet. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come on.\u201d Harry led the way out the door. The boy could ride behind him on the back of his horse.</p> <p>Outside, clouds gathered in the sky. But it hadn\u2019t yet rained today, and saddling the mare would take time. It was unreasonable, but he was anxious to see Lady Georgina.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk.\u201d</p><p>The boy followed at his heels, silent, but with suppressed excitement. They were almost to the Woldsly drive when Harry heard the rumbling of carriage wheels. He quickened his pace. The sound grew rapidly closer.</p><p>He broke into a run.</p><p>Just as he burst from the cover of the copse, a carriage passed, shaking the ground beneath his feet and sending up globs of mud. He glimpsed her ginger hair, then the carriage turned the corner and was gone, only the diminishing sound of wheels marking its passage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to talk to her today.\u201d</p><p>Harry had forgotten Will. He stared blindly down at the boy panting at his side. \u201cNo, not today.\u201d</p><p>A fat raindrop splattered on his shoulder, and then the clouds let go.</p> <p>TONY\u2019S CARRIAGE JOLTED AROUND the corner, and George swayed as she peered out the window. It had begun to rain again, soaking the already sodden pastures, dragging tree branches earthward, and turning everything into the same gray-brown color. Monotonous veils of dingy water fell, blurring the landscape and trickling down the window like tears. From inside the carriage it appeared that the whole world wept, overcome by a grief that would not fade.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cThe rain,\u201d George said. \u201cPerhaps it won\u2019t stop. Perhaps it will continue forever until the mud in the highway turns to a stream and rises up and becomes a sea and we float away.\u201d She traced a finger through the condensation on the inside of the window, making squiggly lines. \u201cDo you think your carriage is buoyant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t worry. The rain will stop sometime, even if it doesn\u2019t seem so at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She stared out the window. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t care if it goes on? Perhaps I wouldn\u2019t mind floating away. Or sinking.\u201d</p><p>She was doing the right thing, everyone assured her so. Leaving Harry was the only proper choice left to her. He was of a lower class, and he resented the difference in their ranks. Last night, he\u2019d been ugly in his resentment; and yet, she couldn\u2019t fault him. Harry Pye wasn\u2019t meant to be anyone\u2019s lapdog. She hadn\u2019t thought she was confining him, but he obviously felt demeaned. There was no future for them, an earl\u2019s daughter and a land steward. They knew that; everyone knew that. This was a natural conclusion to an affair that should never have been begun in the first place.</p><p>But, still, George couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was running away.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, Tony said, \u201cIt\u2019s the correct decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a coward,\u201d she mused, still looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a coward,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThis course wasn\u2019t easy for you, I know. Cowards are people who take the least difficult path, not the hardest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I\u2019ve abandoned Violet when she needs me most,\u201d George objected.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d Tony said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve turned her problem over to me. I\u2019ve sent Oscar and Ralph ahead of us to London. By the time we arrive, they should have learned where this cad lives. In the meantime, rusticating for another few weeks in the country won\u2019t hurt her, and she has Miss Hope to keep her company. That is what we pay her for, after all,\u201d he finished dryly.</p><p>But Euphie had failed Violet once already. George closed her eyes. And what about the poisoned sheep\u2014the reason she\u2019d traveled to Yorkshire in the first place? The attacks were growing more frequent. As she\u2019d left, George had overheard two footmen talking about a poisoned woman. She should\u2019ve stopped and found out if the dead woman was connected to the sheep, but instead she\u2019d let Tony hustle her out the door. Once she\u2019d made the decision to leave Woldsly, it was as if a strange lethargy had taken over her body. It was so hard to concentrate. So hard to know what to do. She felt wrong in her bones, but she couldn\u2019t seem to make things right.</p><p>\u201cYou must stop thinking about him,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>His tone made George glance at her brother, sitting in the blood-red leather seat across from hers. Tony looked sympathetic and worried. And sad, his shaggy eyebrows drawn down. Sudden tears clouded her eyes, and she turned to the window again, although she couldn\u2019t see a thing now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that he was so... good. He seemed to understand me in a way nobody has before, not even you or Aunt Clara. And I couldn\u2019t figure him out.\u201d She laughed under her breath. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what attracted me to him. He was like a puzzle that I could have spent the rest of my life studying and never grow tired of.\u201d They rumbled over a bridge. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever find that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>George laid her head back on the seat. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully kind for a brother. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been most lucky in my allotment of sisters.\u201d Tony smiled.</p><p>George tried to smile back but found she couldn\u2019t. She went back to looking out the carriage window instead. They passed a field of drenched sheep, poor miserable creatures. Could sheep swim? Maybe they\u2019d float if their pasture flooded, like tufts of down in a puddle.</p><p>They were already out of her lands, and in another day Yorkshire would be behind them altogether. By the end of the week she\u2019d be in London, resuming her life as if this trip had never happened. Three or four months from now, Harry, acting as her land steward, might write to ask if she wanted him to present his report on her lands in person. And she, having just returned from a soiree, might turn the letter over in her hand and muse, Harry Pye. Why, I once lay in his arms. I looked up into his illuminated face as he joined his flesh with mine, and I was alive. She might toss the letter on her desk and think, But that was so long ago now and in a different place. Perhaps it was only a dream.</p><p>She might think that.</p><p>George closed her eyes. Somehow she knew that there would never come a day when Harry Pye was not her first memory when she woke and her last thought as she drifted into sleep. She would remember him all the days of her life.</p><p>Remember and regret.</p><p>\u201cTOLD YOU NOT TO HAVE no truck with aristo ladies.\u201d Dick Crumb sat down across from Harry without invitation late that afternoon.</p><p>Wonderful. Now he was getting romantic advice from Dick. Harry studied the Cock and Worm\u2019s proprietor. Dick looked like he\u2019d been sampling too much of his own brew. His face was creased with sleeplessness, and his hair was thinner, if that was possible.</p><p>\u201cAristos ain\u2019t nothing but trouble. And here\u2019s you, sticking your meat where it don\u2019t belong.\u201d Dick wiped his face.</p><p>Harry glanced at Will sitting beside him. He\u2019d finally bought him new shoes this morning. The boy\u2019s eyes had been fixed on his feet, swinging under the table, the entire time they\u2019d been in the tavern. But now he was staring at Dick.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Harry dug a few coppers out of his pocket. \u201cGo see if the baker has any sweet buns left.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s attention was immediately caught by the coins. He grinned up at Harry, grabbed the money, and was out the door in a flash.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Will Pollard, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Dick asked.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHis gran abandoned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s living with you now?\u201d Dick\u2019s long forehead wrinkled in confusion, and he swiped his cloth over it. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have room. I\u2019ll have to find him a better home soon, but for now, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Don\u2019t he get under foot when she comes calling?\u201d The older man leaned forward and lowered his voice, but his whisper was loud enough to be heard clear across the room.</p><p>Harry sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s gone back to London. It won\u2019t come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dick took a giant gulp from the mug he\u2019d set down in front of him when he\u2019d joined Harry. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but it\u2019s for the best. Common folk and gentry ain\u2019t meant to mix. That\u2019s the way God intended it. They stay in their marble halls with their servants to wipe their arses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we do an honest day\u2019s work and go home to a hot meal. If we\u2019re lucky.\u201d Dick slammed down his mug to make his point. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Harry hoped to stem this sermon.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you do with the lady if she\u2019d have you?\u201d the older man plowed on. \u201cShe\u2019d have your dangly bits hanging by her bed for a bellpull afore a week was out. You\u2019d probably have to wear a pink wig and yellow hose, learn to do that tippy-toe dancing the gentry do and beg like a dog to have your own pin money. No\u201d\u2014he took another swallow of ale\u2014\u201cthat ain\u2019t no life for a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Harry cast about for a change of subject. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister? I haven\u2019t seen Janie lately.\u201d</p><p>Out came the cloth. Dick polished the dome of his head. \u201cOh, you know Janie. She were born a bit off, and ever since Granville got done with her, she\u2019s been even worse.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly set down his mug. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that Granville had abused Janie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen years ago. It wasn\u2019t long after your mother caught that fever and died.\u201d Dick wiped his face and neck almost frantically now. \u201cJanie was five and twenty or thereabouts, a grown woman, except maybe in her head. Anyone but Granville would\u2019ve respected that. Would\u2019ve let her alone. But him.\u201d Dick spat onto the flagstones at his feet. \u201cHe just saw her as easy pickings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe raped her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, at the beginning. I dunno.\u201d Dick stared off. His hand was stopped on top of his head, still holding the cloth. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about it, see, not for a long time. She was living with me, like she does now, but Janie\u2019s ten years the younger of me. Our da had passed years before, and Janie\u2019s mum died when she were born.\u201d The big man swallowed from his mug.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say anything for fear of stopping the flow of the story.</p><p>\u201cJanie\u2019s more like a niece or a daughter to me than a sister,\u201d Dick said. He took his hand away from his head and looked at the cloth blankly. \u201cAnd by the time I noticed that she was sneaking out at night, it\u2019d been going on a while.\u201d He gave a bark of laughter. \u201cWhen I found out and told her to stop, she said he was going to marry her.\u201d He was silent a moment.</p> <p>Harry took another drink to wash away the bile gathering in his throat. Poor, poor Janie.</p><p>\u201cCan you see it?\u201d Dick looked up, and Harry saw tears glittering in his eyes. \u201cHe was widowed, so she thought Lord Granville would marry her. Nothing I said could keep her from creeping out and meeting him at night. Went on for weeks and I thought I\u2019d go mad. Then, of course, he dropped her. Like a dirty rag he\u2019d wiped his spunk on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Dick gave another bark of laughter and finally put away his cloth. \u201cNothing. Wasn\u2019t aught I could do. She came back and stayed to herself like a good girl. I spent a couple months worried I\u2019d have to house another of Granville\u2019s bastards, but she was lucky.\u201d He lifted his mug to drink, noticed it was empty, and set it down again. \u201cProbably the only time she ever lucked out in her whole life, Janie. And not much luck at that, was it?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cDick, do you think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>A tug at his elbow interrupted him. Will had returned so silently that the two men hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment, Will.\u201d</p><p>The boy tugged again. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Both men looked at the boy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead. Me gran. She\u2019s dead.\u201d He spoke in a dull tone that worried Harry more than the news.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey found her on the heath. A farmer and his boys out looking for a stray. In a sheep pasture.\u201d Will suddenly focused on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cThey said the sheep poisoner killed her.\u201d</p><p>Harry closed his eyes. Christ, why did the dead woman have to be Will\u2019s gran, of all people?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dick was shaking his head. \u201cCan\u2019t be. The sheep poisoner couldn\u2019t have killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found false parsley by her, and she was all twisted...\u201d Will\u2019s face screwed up.</p><p>Harry put his arms around Will\u2019s shoulders and drew the boy close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The boy must still love the old witch, even after she\u2019d thrown him out like the slops. \u201cThere, there, lad.\u201d He patted the boy\u2019s back and felt stupidly angry at Will\u2019s gran for letting herself get killed.</p><p>\u201cYou best be going,\u201d Dick\u2019s voice broke in.</p><p>Harry glanced up, puzzled. The big man was looking thoughtful\u2014and worried.</p><p>He met Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf folks think you\u2019re the poisoner, they\u2019re going to believe you did this, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Dick.\u201d All Will needed was to believe Harry had killed his grandmother.</p><p>Will lifted his wet face from Harry\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill your gran, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mr. Pye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He took out a handkerchief and gave it to the boy. \u201cAnd call me Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Will\u2019s lower lip began to tremble again.</p><p>\u201cDick\u2019s right, we best be going. It\u2019s getting late anyway.\u201d Harry studied the boy. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Will nodded.</p><p>They made their way to the tavern entrance. Already men were gathering in knots and talking. Some seemed to look up and glare at him as they passed, but he might have imagined it after Dick\u2019s comment. If Will\u2019s gran had truly been murdered by the same man who\u2019d been killing the sheep, it did not bode well. The people hereabouts were worried about their livestock. How much more fearful would they be if they now had to worry about their children, their wives, maybe themselves?</p><p>As they neared the entrance, someone shoved him. He stumbled but had his knife in his hand almost instantly. When he turned, a wall of hostile faces stared back.</p><p>Someone whispered, \u201cMurderer.\u201d But no one moved.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Will.\u201d Harry slowly backed out of the Cock and Worm.</p><p>Quickly, he found his mare and boosted Will onto her back. Mounting, Harry looked around. A drunk was pissing against the tavern wall, but otherwise the darkening street was deserted. News of a murder would travel fast, but maybe night falling would delay it a bit. He should have until morning to figure out how to deal with this.</p><p>Harry chirruped to the mare and set out into the gathering dusk, Will clinging to his back. They turned onto the road home. The road passed through Granville land before going over the river to Woldsly. The lights of the town faded, leaving the dark to shroud them. No moon was out to light the road. Or to give them away.</p><p>Harry urged the mare into a trot.</p><p>\u201cAre they going to hang you?\u201d Will\u2019s voice sounded scared in the dark.</p><p>\u201cNo. They need more evidence than a bunch of gossip to hang a man.\u201d</p><p>Hoofbeats came from behind them.</p><p>Harry cocked his head. More than one horse. And coming up on them fast. \u201cWrap your arms around me, Will.\u201d</p><p>He nudged the mare into a gallop as soon as he felt the clench around his waist. The mare thundered down the road. But she was carrying two, and he knew the riders behind would soon overtake them. They were in open pasture land. Nowhere to hide. He could take the mare off the road, but in the dark she\u2019d have a fair chance of putting her hoof in a hole and killing them all. And he had Will to think of. The boy\u2019s small hands clung to his waist. Foam flew from the mare\u2019s mouth, and Harry leaned low over her sweating neck, muttering words of encouragement. If they could make it to the ford, there were places along the bank to hide. Or they could even go into the stream if necessary and follow the water downstream.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost to the ford. We\u2019ll be all right there,\u201d Harry shouted to the boy.</p><p>Will must have been afraid, but he never made a sound. Another turn. The mare\u2019s lungs heaved like bellows. The riders behind them were growing closer, their hoofbeats louder. There! The mare raced down the track to the stream. Harry almost sighed in relief. Almost. Then he saw and realized there had never been any hope at all. On the stream\u2019s far side, shadows shifted in the gloom. More men on horseback were waiting for him there.</p><p>They were herding him into a trap.</p><p>Harry glanced over his shoulder. He had maybe half a minute before the riders were upon them. He hauled on the reins, cutting the poor mare\u2019s mouth. There was no help for it. The mare half reared, skidding to a stop. Harry pried Will\u2019s hands from his waist. He grabbed the boy\u2019s wrist and flung the crying child to the ground.</p><p>\u201cHide. Now!\u201d Harry shook his head as the boy sobbed a protest. \u201cThere isn\u2019t time for that. You have to stay hidden\u2014no matter what they do. Go back to Dick, tell him to get Bennet Granville. Now run!\u201d</p><p>Harry kicked the mare and drew his knife. He didn\u2019t look back to see whether Will had done as instructed. If he could draw the attackers far enough away from Will, maybe they wouldn\u2019t bother going back for one small boy. He charged full gallop into the stream. Harry felt a grin stretch his lips just before the mare slammed into the first horse.</p><p>He was surrounded by plunging horses and foaming water. The man nearest raised his arm, and Harry drove his knife into the exposed armpit. The man didn\u2019t even groan when he fell into the stream. Around him, the horses whinnied and the men shouted. Hands grabbed for him and Harry swung his knife viciously. Desperately. Another man fell into the stream, screaming. Then they pulled him from his horse. Someone caught his knife hand. Harry closed his right hand, the one with the missing finger\u2014into a fist and hammered at any flesh near enough to hit. But there were many of them and only one of him, and they were raining down a storm of kicks and blows.</p><p>In the end, it was only a matter of time before he went under.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cMen do have their uses,\u201d Lady Beatrice Renault said as if conceding a dubious point of debate, \u201cbut giving advice on affaires de coeur is not one of them.\u201d She raised the dish of tea to her lips and took a small sip.</p><p>George repressed a sigh. She\u2019d been in London over a week and up until this morning had successfully managed to avoid Aunt Beatrice. This was all Oscar\u2019s fault. If he hadn\u2019t been so careless as to leave a letter from Violet laying around, their Aunt Beatrice would never have found out about Harry and would never have felt compelled to come and lecture George on the proper way to conduct an affair. True, Oscar had placed the damning letter in the drawer of his desk, but any fool knew that would be the first place Aunt Beatrice would start browsing when the butler left her alone in the study when she\u2019d come to call.</p><p>Definitely Oscar\u2019s fault.</p><p>\u201cThey are much too sentimental, poor dears,\u201d Aunt Beatrice continued. She bit into a piece of cake and then frowned down at it. \u201cIs this a prune filling, Georgina? I\u2019ve specifically told you that prunes do not agree with me.\u201d</p><p>George glanced at the offending slice of cake. \u201cI believe it is chocolate cream, but I can ring for a different pastry.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Beatrice had invaded George\u2019s London town house, settled into a gilt chair in her pretty blue and white sitting room, and all but demanded tea. George thought Cook had done an outstanding job, considering she\u2019d had no notice of potential guests.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Lady Beatrice poked at the cake on her plate, disemboweling it. \u201cIt looks like prunes, but if you are quite sure.\u201d She took another bite, masticating thoughtfully. \u201cAs a result, they are competent\u2014barely\u2014at running the government but a complete wash at domestic doings.\u201d</p><p>George was at a loss for a second before remembering that her aunt had been discussing men before prunes. \u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps if she feigned an attack of the vapors... But knowing Aunt Beatrice, she\u2019d probably throw cold water in her face until George admitted consciousness and then continue with her lecture. Best to sit it out.</p><p>\u201cNow, contrary to what men will tell you,\u201d her aunt continued, \u201can affair or two or more is good for a lady. Brings a certain mental alertness and, naturally, roses to the cheeks.\u201d</p><p>Lady Beatrice touched her own cheek with one manicured fingernail. It was indeed rosy, but more from rouge than nature. It was also decorated by three black velvet patches: two stars and a crescent moon.</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing for a lady to remember is to be discreet.\u201d Aunt Beatrice sipped her tea. \u201cFor instance, I have found that if one is engaged with two or more gentlemen over the same period of time, it is imperative they not find out about each other.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Beatrice was the youngest of the Littleton sisters. Aunt Clara, who\u2019d left George her fortune, had been the eldest, and George\u2019s own mother, Sarah, the middle sister. The Littleton sisters had been considered beauties in their day, cutting a devastating swath through London society. All three sisters had married unhappily. Aunt Clara had wed an insanely religious man who had died young, leaving her childless but wealthy. Aunt Beatrice had married a much older man who had kept his wife constantly pregnant while he lived. Tragically, all her babies had died in miscarriages or stillbirth.</p><p>As for Sarah, her own mother... George took a sip of her tea. Who knew what exactly was wrong with her parents\u2019 marriage? Maybe only that her mother and father had not cared for each other. In any case, Lady Maitland was bedridden with imagined ills and had been for years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven the most sophisticated man becomes like a little boy unable to share his toys,\u201d Lady Beatrice continued now. \u201cNo more than three is my motto, and really with three one has to do a fine balancing act.\u201d</p><p>George choked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever is the matter with you, Georgina?\u201d Lady Beatrice looked at her with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d George gasped. \u201cA bit of crumb.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally, I do worry about the English as a race with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat luck to find not one, but two examples of womanly pulchritude.\u201d George\u2019s sitting room door was flung open to reveal Oscar and a fair young man who bowed to the ladies.</p><p>Lady Beatrice frowned and lifted her cheek for Oscar\u2019s buss. \u201cWe are busy, dear. Go away. Not you, Cecil.\u201d The other man had started to back out the door. \u201cYou may stay. You are the only man I know with any sense, and that should be encouraged.\u201d</p><p>Cecil Barclay smiled and bowed again. \u201cYour ladyship is kind indeed.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow at George, who patted the settee cushion next to her. She\u2019d known Cecil and his younger brother, Freddy, since they\u2019d all been in leading strings.</p> <p>\u201cBut if Cecil stays, then I beg leave to do so also.\u201d Oscar sat down and helped himself to a slice of cake.</p><p>George glared at her brother.</p><p>Oscar mouthed What? at her.</p><p>She rolled her eyes in exasperation. \u201cWill you take tea, Cecil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cOscar dragged me all over Tattersall\u2019s this morning to look at horses. He wants a matched set for his new carriage and claims none in London will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen spend entirely too much money on horseflesh,\u201d Lady Beatrice pronounced.</p> <p>\u201cWhat other type of flesh would you have us spend our blunt upon?\u201d Oscar opened his wicked brown eyes wide.</p><p>Lady Beatrice tapped him overhard on the knee with her fan.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Oscar rubbed the spot. \u201cI say, is this a prune filling in the cake?\u201d</p><p>George repressed another sigh and looked out her town house windows. It wasn\u2019t raining here in London, but there was a kind of gray mist that covered everything and left behind a sticky grime. She\u2019d made a mistake. She knew that now after more than a week away from Harry and Yorkshire. She should\u2019ve stuck it out and made him talk. Or talked herself until he broke down and told her... what? His fears? Her faults? Why he didn\u2019t care for her? If it was the last, at least she would know. She wouldn\u2019t be stuck here in this limbo, not able to return to her old life and yet unable to go on with what might be a new one.</p><p>\u201cCan you come, George?\u201d Cecil was speaking to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t catch that last bit.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt and the gentlemen exchanged a look that said they had to make allowances for her mental state.</p><p>George grit her teeth.</p> <p>\u201cCecil said he was going to the theater tomorrow night and wanted to know if he could escort you,\u201d Oscar explained.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2014\u201d George was saved from making an excuse by the entrance of her butler. She knit her brows. \u201cYes, Holmes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, my lady, but a messenger has just arrived from Lady Violet.\u201d Holmes proffered a silver plate on which lay a rather muddy letter.</p><p>George took it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The butler bowed and exited.</p><p>Had Wentworth pursued Violet north? They\u2019d thought it best to leave Violet at Woldsly in the assumption that she was safest there away from society, but perhaps they\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind?\u201d George didn\u2019t wait for her guests\u2019 permission but used a butter knife to break the seal on the letter. Violet\u2019s handwriting sprawled frantically across the page, obliterated here and there by inkblots.</p><p>My Dear Sister... Harry Pye beaten and arrested... in Granville\u2019s custody... denied access... please come at once.</p><p>Beaten.</p><p>George\u2019s hand shook. Oh, dear Lord, Harry. A sob caught in her throat. She tried to remember Violet\u2019s fondness for melodrama. Perhaps she\u2019d overstated or otherwise exaggerated. But, no, Violet didn\u2019t lie. If Lord Granville had Harry in his hands, he might already be dead.</p><p>\u201cGeorgie.\u201d She looked up to find Oscar kneeling directly in front of her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Mutely, she turned the letter so he could read it.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBut there was no concrete evidence of his culpability, was there?\u201d</p><p>George shook her head and drew a ragged breath. \u201cLord Granville has a grudge against Harry. He doesn\u2019t need evidence.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI should have never left Yorkshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could have foreseen this.\u201d</p><p>She rose and started for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Oscar caught her elbow.</p><p>George shook him off. \u201cWhere do you think? To him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned on her brother savagely. \u201cI cannot wait. He may already be dead.\u201d</p><p>Oscar held up his hands as if surrendering. \u201cI know, I know, Georgie. I meant I\u2019ll go with you. See what I can do.\u201d He turned to Cecil. \u201cCan you ride and tell Tony what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Cecil nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Oscar pried the letter from George\u2019s hand. \u201cGive him this. He\u2019ll need to come when he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, old chap.\u201d Cecil looked curious but took the letter.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Tears began to run down George\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Cecil started to say more, then shook his head and left.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say that I approve of all this, whatever it is.\u201d Lady Beatrice had been quiet through the scene, but she rose now. \u201cI do not like being kept in the dark. Not at all. But I will wait just this once to find out what you are all rushing about for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Aunt.\u201d George was already half out the door, not really listening.</p><p>\u201cGeorgina.\u201d Lady Beatrice laid a palm on her niece\u2019s tear-stained face, halting her. \u201cRemember, dear, we cannot stay the hand of God, but we can be strong.\u201d She looked suddenly old. \u201cSometimes it is the only thing we can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOLD MISTRESS POLLARD WAS MURDERED, plain and simple.\u201d Silas sat back in his leather armchair and looked at his younger son with satisfaction.</p><p>Bennet paced the library like a young lion. In contrast, his brother cowered in a too-small corner chair, his knees drawn nearly to his chin. Why Thomas was in the library at all, Silas couldn\u2019t fathom, but he didn\u2019t really care either way. All his attention was on his younger son.</p><p>In the week since his men had brought in Harry Pye, Bennet had railed and raged against his father. But however much he tried, he couldn\u2019t get away from that one fact: A woman had been murdered. An old woman, true, and a poor one at that. One that nobody had much cared about when alive. Nevertheless, she was human and so, no matter how decrepit, several steps up from a dead sheep.</p><p>At least in the popular estimation.</p><p>In fact, Silas had begun to wonder if he\u2019d made a mistake in his haste to catch Pye. Local sentiment was running very high. No one liked a murderer on the loose. Had he simply left Pye to his own devices, someone might have taken matters into their own hands and lynched the bastard. He might already be dead by now. But in the long run it made very little difference. Dead now or dead in a week, either way, Pye would soon be very, very dead. And then his son would no longer be arguing with him.</p><p>\u201cShe may have been murdered, but it wasn\u2019t Harry Pye who did it.\u201d Bennet stood in front of his father\u2019s desk, arms crossed, eyes blazing.</p><p>Silas felt impatience rise in him. Everyone else believed the land steward guilty. Why couldn\u2019t his own son?</p><p>He sat forward and tapped on his desktop with a forefinger as if he could drill through the mahogany. \u201cHemlock killed her, same as the sheep. His carving was found by her corpse. The second carving, remember, discovered with these crimes.\u201d Silas thrust his hands forward, palms upward. \u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you hate Harry Pye, Father, but why would he leave his own carvings by the bodies? Why incriminate himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap the man is mad,\u201d Thomas said quietly from the corner. Silas frowned at him, but Thomas was too intent on his brother to notice. \u201cPye\u2019s mother was a slut, after all; perhaps he inherited her bad blood.\u201d</p><p>Bennet looked pained. \u201cTom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d Thomas said shrilly. \u201cI\u2019m your elder. I\u2019m the heir. Give me the respect I deserve. You\u2019re only a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Silas roared.</p><p>Thomas shrank at the bellow. \u201cBut, Father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more!\u201d Silas glared until his elder son flushed blotchily; then he sat back in the chair and turned his attention back to Bennet. \u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d</p><p>Bennet shot an apologetic glance at Thomas, which the other ignored, before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the first outward show of uncertainty. It was like balm to his soul. \u201cI am the magistrate for this county. I must uphold the law as I see fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let me see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Silas shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous criminal. It would not be responsible of me to let you near him.\u201d</p><p>Not until his men got a confession. The way Pye took a beating\u2014absorbing blow after blow until he could no longer stand, until he staggered and fell, but still refused to talk\u2014it might be several more days before he was broken. But break he would. And then Silas would hang him by the neck until dead, and no one, not the king nor God, would be able to gainsay him.</p><p>Aye, he could wait.</p><p>\u201cOh, for pity\u2019s sake.\u201d Bennet was pacing agitatedly now. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since we were lads. He\u2019s my\u2014\u201d He broke off and dismissed the sentence with a wave. \u201cJust let me talk to him. Please.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long, long while since the boy had begged. He should know by now that begging only gave the opponent ammunition.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Silas shook his head regretfully.</p><p>\u201cHe is still alive?\u201d</p><p>Silas smiled. \u201cYes. Alive, but not particularly well.\u201d</p><p>Bennet\u2019s face paled. He stared at his father as if he would hit him, and Silas actually braced himself for a blow.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you,\u201d Bennet whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe might indeed.\u201d</p><p>Bennet swung to the study door and pulled it open. A small, scrawny boy tumbled in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Silas frowned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with me. Come on, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to teach your servants not to listen at doors,\u201d Silas drawled after his son.</p><p>For some reason his words caused Bennet to stop and swing around. His son looked between Silas and the boy. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know who he is, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d Silas studied the lad. Something about his brown eyes did look familiar. He waved away the question. It didn\u2019t matter. \u201cThe boy is nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Bennet stared at him. \u201cWe\u2019re all just pawns to you, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Silas shook his head. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not fond of puzzles.\u201d</p><p>But Bennet had taken the boy\u2019s shoulder and was guiding him from the room. The door shut behind them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ungrateful,\u201d Thomas whispered from the corner. \u201cAfter all you did for him, after all I suffered, he\u2019s ungrateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point, boy?\u201d Silas growled.</p><p>Thomas blinked, then he stood, looking oddly dignified. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, Father, always. I would do anything for you.\u201d Then he, too, left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silas stared after his son for a moment, then shook his head again. He swiveled to a small door set in the wood paneling behind his desk and rapped on it. For unknown reasons, an earlier Granville had made a passage from the library to the cellars. After a small wait, the door opened. A burly man emerged, ducking his head. He was bare-chested. Heavy, muscled arms hung by his sides. The brown body hair covering his upper torso was gruesomely flecked with blood.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Silas demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe still won\u2019t talk.\u201d The big man held out swollen hands. \u201cMy knuckles are fair bloodied, and Bud has had a go as well today.\u201d</p><p>Silas scowled. \u201cDo I have to bring in someone else? He\u2019s only one man and not nearly your size. He should\u2019ve been whistling any tune you asked by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, he\u2019s a tough bugger, that one. I\u2019ve seen blokes crying like a baby after what we\u2019ve been giving him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say,\u201d Silas taunted. \u201cWrap your hands and keep at it. He\u2019s bound to break soon, and when he does, there\u2019ll be a bonus in it for you. And if you can\u2019t do it in the next day, I\u2019ll find someone who can and replace you and your mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord.\u201d The big man stared at Silas, suppressed anger firing behind his eyes before he turned away. Good, he\u2019d take it out on Pye.</p><p>The door closed behind him and Silas smiled. Soon, very soon now.</p><p>SOMEWHERE WATER was dripping.</p> <p>Slowly.</p><p>Steadily.</p><p>Endlessly.</p><p>It had dripped when he had first woken in this room, it had dripped every day since then, and it dripped now. The dripping might very well break him before the beatings did.</p><p>Harry hunched a shoulder and dragged himself painfully upright against the wall. They held him in a tiny room. He thought it must have been at least a week since they\u2019d taken him, but time was hard to judge here. And there were hours, maybe days, that he\u2019d lost to insensibility. There was a window the size of a child\u2019s head high on one wall, covered by a rusted iron grill. Outside, a few weeds poked through, so he knew the window was at ground level. It gave enough light to illuminate his cell when the sun was at a certain height. The walls were of damp stone, the floor of dirt. There was nothing else in the room save himself.</p><p>Well, usually, that is.</p> <p>At night he could hear the scratching of tiny feet, scurrying here and there. Squeaks and rustlings would suddenly still and then begin again. Mice. Or perhaps rats.</p><p>Harry hated rats.</p><p>When he\u2019d gone to the poorhouse in the city, he\u2019d quickly figured out that he and Da would starve if he couldn\u2019t fight off the others to keep their ration of food. So he\u2019d learned to fight back, fast and ruthless. The other boys and men stayed away after that.</p><p>But the rats didn\u2019t.</p><p>When dusk fell, they would come out. The wild creatures of the countryside feared people. Rats did not. They would creep right into a man\u2019s pocket to steal his last bite of bread. They would nose through a boy\u2019s hair, looking for crumbs. And if they couldn\u2019t find any leavings, they\u2019d make their own. If a man slept too deeply, whether from drink or sickness, the rats would take a nibble. From toes or fingers or ears. There were men in the poorhouse whose ears were ragged flowers. You knew those wouldn\u2019t last much longer. And if a man died in his sleep, well, by morning sometimes you didn\u2019t know his face.</p><p>You could kill the rats, of course, if you were quick enough. Some boys even roasted them over a fire and ate them. But however hungry Harry got\u2014and there\u2019d been days when his insides twisted with need\u2014he could never imagine putting that meat in his mouth. There was an evil in rats that would surely transfer to your belly and infect the soul if you ate them. And no matter how many rats you killed, there were always more.</p><p>So now at night, Harry didn\u2019t really sleep. Because there were rats out there and he knew what they could do to an injured man.</p><p>Granville\u2019s thugs had been beating him daily, sometimes twice a day, for a week now. His right eye was swollen shut, the left not much better, his lip split and resplit. At least two ribs were cracked. Several of his teeth were loose. There wasn\u2019t more than a handspan on his entire body that wasn\u2019t covered with bruises. It was only a matter of time until they hit him too hard or in the wrong place or until his body just gave out.</p> <p>And then the rats...</p><p>Harry shook his head. What he couldn\u2019t understand was why Granville hadn\u2019t killed him at once. When he\u2019d woken the day after he\u2019d been caught at the stream, there\u2019d been a moment when he had been stunned just to find himself alive. Why? Why capture him alive when Granville surely meant to kill him anyway? They kept telling him to confess to killing Will\u2019s gran, but surely that didn\u2019t really matter to Granville. The baron didn\u2019t need a confession to hang him. Nobody would care much about Harry\u2019s death or would protest it, except maybe Will.</p><p>Harry sighed and leaned his aching head against the mildewed stone wall. That wasn\u2019t true. His lady would care. Wherever she was, either in her fancy London town house or her Yorkshire mansion, she\u2019d weep when she heard of her lowborn lover\u2019s death. The light would go out of her beautiful blue eyes, and her face would crumple.</p><p>In this cell he\u2019d had many hours to ponder. Of all the things in his life that he regretted, he regretted that one thing the most: that he would cause Lady Georgina pain.</p><p>A mutter of voices and the scuff of boots on stone came from without. Harry cocked his head to listen. They were coming to beat him again. He flinched. His mind might be strong, but his body remembered and dreaded the pain. He closed his eyes in that moment before they opened the door and it all began again. He thought about Lady Georgina. In another time and place, if she\u2019d not been so highborn and he not so common, it might have worked. They might have married and had a little cottage. She might have learned to cook, and he might have come home to her sweet kiss. At night he might have lain beside her and felt the rise and fall of her body and drifted into dreamless sleep, his arm draped over her.</p><p>He might have loved her, his lady.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d George\u2019s face looked like a piece of paper scrunched up and smoothed out again. Her gray dress was so rumpled, she must have been sleeping in it all the way from London.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Violet hugged her sister, trying not to show shock at the change in her appearance. She\u2019d only been gone from Woldsly less than a fortnight. \u201cYes, he\u2019s alive as far as I know. Lord Granville isn\u2019t letting anyone see him.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s expression didn\u2019t lighten. Her eyes still stared too intently as if she\u2019d miss something important if she blinked. \u201cThen he might be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Violet widened her own eyes frantically at Oscar. Help! \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d know if Harry Pye was dead, Georgie,\u201d Oscar cut in, rescuing Violet. \u201cGranville would be crowing. The fact that he isn\u2019t means Pye is still alive.\u201d He took George\u2019s arm as if he were guiding an invalid. \u201cCome into Woldsly. Let\u2019s sit down and have a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have to see him.\u201d George flung Oscar\u2019s hand off as if he were a too-eager vender importuning her with wilted flowers.</p><p>Oscar didn\u2019t turn a hair. \u201cI know, dear one, but we need to show strength when we confront Granville, if we hope to get in. Better to be fresh and rested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Tony got the message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Oscar said as if repeating something for the hundredth time. \u201cHe\u2019ll be on the road right behind us. Let\u2019s be ready for him when he comes.\u201d He put his hand on George\u2019s elbow again, and this time she let him lead her up Woldsly\u2019s front steps.</p><p>Violet followed behind, absolutely amazed. What was wrong with George? She\u2019d expected her sister to be upset, to cry even. But this\u2014this was a kind of harrowing, tearless grief. If she heard today that Leonard, her summer lover, had died, she would feel a certain melancholy. Maybe shed a tear and mope about the house for a day or two. But she wouldn\u2019t be as devastated as George seemed to be now. And Mr. Pye wasn\u2019t even dead, as far as they knew.</p><p>It was almost as if George loved him.</p><p>Violet stopped in her tracks and watched the retreating back of her sister leaning on her brother. Surely not. George was too old for love. Of course she\u2019d been too old for a love affair as well. But, love\u2014real love\u2014was different. If George loved Mr. Pye, she might want to marry him. And if she married him, why... he\u2019d be part of the family. Oh, no! He probably had no idea which fork to use for fish, or how to address a retired general who was also a hereditary baron, or the proper way to help a lady mount a horse sidesaddle or... Good Lord! What if he started dropping his Hs!</p><p>George and Oscar had reached the drawing room, and Oscar looked around as he guided her in. He saw Violet and frowned at her. She hurried to catch up.</p><p>Inside the drawing room, he was helping George to a seat. \u201cYou\u2019ve ordered tea and refreshments?\u201d he asked Violet.</p><p>She felt her face heat guiltily. Quickly she leaned out the door and told a footman what was wanted.</p><p>\u201cViolet, what do you know?\u201d George was looking at her fixedly. \u201cYour letter said Harry was arrested but not why or how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they found a dead woman.\u201d She sat and tried to order her thoughts. \u201cOn the heath. Mistress Piller or Poller or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPollard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Violet stared at her, startled. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her grandson.\u201d George waved the interruption away. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was poisoned in the same manner as the sheep. They found those weeds by her, the ones that were by the dead sheep.\u201d</p><p>Oscar frowned. \u201cBut a woman wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to eat poison weeds like a sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a cup by her.\u201d Violet shuddered. \u201cWith some kind of dregs in it. They think he\u2014the poisoner\u2014forced her to drink it.\u201d She looked uneasily at her sister.</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d George asked. \u201cSurely someone would have told us had they found her before we left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it appears they didn\u2019t,\u201d Violet replied. \u201cThe local people found her the day before you left, but I only heard the day after you\u2019d gone. And there was a carving, an animal of some sort. They say that Mr. Pye made it, so he must have done it. Murdered her, that is.\u201d</p><p>Oscar darted a glance at George. Violet hesitated, anticipating a reaction from her sister, but George merely raised her eyebrows.</p><p>So Violet soldiered on. \u201cAnd the night you left they arrested Mr. Pye. Only no one will tell me much about his arrest, except that it took seven men to do it and two were very badly wounded. So,\u201d she inhaled and said carefully, \u201che must have put up quite a fight.\u201d She gazed expectantly at George.</p><p>Her sister stared off into space, worrying her lower lip with her teeth. \u201cMistress Pollard was killed the day before I left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Violet said. \u201cActually, they\u2019re saying it might\u2019ve been three nights before.\u201d</p><p>George suddenly focused on her.</p><p>Violet hurried on. \u201cShe was seen alive in West Dikey four nights before you left\u2014some people at a tavern saw her\u2014but the farmer swears she wasn\u2019t there the morning after she\u2019d been seen in West Dikey. He distinctly remembers moving his sheep to that pasture the next morning. It was several days before he went back again to the pasture where she was found. And they think, by the condition of the body, because of the... uh\u201d\u2014she wrinkled her nose in disgust\u2014\u201cthe deterioration, that it had been on the heath more than three nights. Ugh!\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>The tea was brought in, and Violet looked at it queasily. Cook had seen fit to include some cream cakes oozing a pink filling, which under the circumstances were quite disgusting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George ignored the tea. \u201cViolet, this is very important. You are sure it was three nights before the morning I left that she is thought to have been killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Violet swallowed and dragged her eyes from the ghastly cream cakes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord.\u201d George closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGeorgie, I know you care for him, but you can\u2019t.\u201d Oscar\u2019s voice held a warning. \u201cYou simply can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis life is at stake.\u201d George leaned toward her brother as if she could infuse him with her passion. \u201cWhat sort of a woman would I be if I ignored that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Violet looked from one to the other. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple.\u201d George finally seemed to notice the steaming teapot and reached to pour. \u201cHarry couldn\u2019t have killed Mistress Pollard on that night.\u201d She handed a cup to Violet and met her eyes. \u201cHe spent it with me.\u201d</p><p>HARRY WAS DREAMING.</p><p>In the dream there was an argument going on between an ugly ogre, a young king, and a beautiful princess. The ugly ogre and the young king looked more or less as they should, considering it was a dream. But the princess didn\u2019t have ruby lips or raven black hair. She had ginger hair and Lady Georgina\u2019s lips. Which was just as well. It was his dream after all, and he had a right to make his princess look like anyone he wanted. In his opinion, springy ginger hair was far more beautiful than smooth raven locks any day of the week.</p> <p>The young king was nattering on about the law and evidence and such in an upper-crust accent so refined it made your teeth ache. Harry could quite understand why the ogre was bellowing in reply, trying to drown out the young king\u2019s monologue. He\u2019d bellow at the blighter if he could. The young king seemed to want the ogre\u2019s tin stag. Harry suppressed a laugh. He wished he could tell the young king that the tin stag wasn\u2019t worth anything. The stag had long ago lost the better part of its rack and stood on only three legs. And besides, the animal wasn\u2019t magic. It couldn\u2019t talk and never had.</p><p>But the young king was stubborn. He wanted the stag, and he was going to have the stag, by God. To that end, he was badgering the ogre in that overbearing way the aristocracy had, as if everyone else was put on this earth merely for the joy of licking his lordship\u2019s boots clean. Thank you, m\u2019lord. It\u2019s been a pleasure, it really has.</p><p>Harry would have sided with the ogre, just on principle, but something was wrong. Princess Georgina seemed to be weeping. Great drops of liquid rolled down her translucent cheeks and slowly turned to gold as they fell. They tinkled as they hit the stone floor and rolled away.</p><p>Harry was mesmerized; he couldn\u2019t take his eyes away from her sorrow. He wanted to yell at the young king, Here is your magic! Look to the lady beside you. But, of course, he couldn\u2019t speak. And it turned out he was wrong: It was actually the princess, not the young king, who wanted the tin stag. The young king was merely acting as the princess\u2019s agent. Well, here was an entirely different matter. If Princess Georgina desired the stag, she should have it, even if it was a ratty old thing.</p><p>But the ugly ogre loved the tin stag; it was his most precious possession. To prove it, he threw the stag down and stamped on it until the stag groaned and broke into pieces. The ogre stared at it, lying there at his feet, bleeding lead, and smiled. He looked into the princess\u2019s eyes and pointed. There, take it. I\u2019ve killed it, anyway.</p><p>Then a wondrous thing happened.</p> <p>Princess Georgina knelt beside the shattered stag and wept, and as she did, her golden tears fell upon the beast. Where they lay, they formed a bond, soldering together the tin until the stag was whole again, made of both tin and gold. The princess smiled and held the strange animal to her breast, and there the stag nuzzled his head. She lifted him up, and she and the young king turned with their dubious prize.</p><p>But Harry could see over her shoulder that the ogre did not like this outcome. All the love he\u2019d borne the tin stag had now turned to hatred of the princess who had stolen it away. He wanted to shout to the young king, Be careful! Watch the princess\u2019s back! The ogre means her harm and will not rest until he has his revenge! But however much he tried, he could not speak.</p><p>You never can in dreams.</p><p>GEORGE CRADLED HARRY\u2019S HEAD in her lap and tried not to sob at the terrible marks on his face. His lips and eyes were swollen black. Fresh blood was smeared from a cut across an eyebrow and another beneath an ear. His hair was stringy and dirty, and she very much feared that part of the dirt was actually dried blood.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner we\u2019re out of here, the better,\u201d Oscar muttered. He slammed the carriage door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Tony rapped sharply on the ceiling, signaling the driver.</p><p>The carriage pulled away from Granville House. George didn\u2019t need to look back to know that its owner stared malevolently after them. She braced her body to cushion the bumps from Harry as he lay on the seat beside her.</p><p>Oscar studied him. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man beaten so badly,\u201d he whispered. The words and live hung in the air unspoken.</p> <p>\u201cAnimals.\u201d Tony looked away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cLord Granville didn\u2019t think so; otherwise he\u2019d never have let us take him. As it was, I rather had to throw my title around.\u201d Tony\u2019s lips pressed together. \u201cYou need to prepare yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d George almost smiled. \u201cHow do I prepare myself for his death? I can\u2019t, so I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll believe in his recovery instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear,\u201d Tony said, and sighed, but he made no further remark.</p><p>It seemed like forever before they eventually drew up in front of Woldsly. Oscar tumbled out, and Tony followed more sedately. George could hear them organizing footmen and finding a door to lay Harry on. She looked down. Harry hadn\u2019t moved an inch since he\u2019d been laid on her lap. His eyes were so swollen, she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to open them even if he was awake. She placed her palm against his neck and felt his pulse, slow but strong.</p><p>The men came back and took over. They wrestled Harry out of the carriage and onto the door they\u2019d found. Four men carried him up the steps and into Woldsly. Then they had to take him up more steps, sweating and cursing despite George\u2019s presence. Finally, they placed Harry on a bed in a little room in between Tony\u2019s and her own, a compromise. The room was hardly big enough to hold a bed, chest of drawers, bedside table, and chair. It was really meant to be a dressing room. But it was near her own, and that was all that mattered. All the men, even her brothers, trooped out, leaving the room suddenly quiet. Harry hadn\u2019t so much as twitched during the entire process.</p><p>George sat down wearily next to him on the bed. She laid her hand at his neck again, feeling for that heartbeat and closed her eyes.</p><p>Behind her, the door opened.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord, what they\u2019ve done to that bonny man.\u201d Tiggle stood beside her with a basin of hot water. The lady\u2019s maid met George\u2019s eyes, then squared her shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s make him comfortable, anyway, shall we, my lady?\u201d</p><p>SIX DAYS LATER, HARRY OPENED his eyes.</p><p>George was sitting by his bed in the dim little room as she had every day and almost every night since he\u2019d been laid there. She didn\u2019t let her hopes get away from her when she saw his eyelids flicker. He\u2019d opened his eyes briefly before and hadn\u2019t seemed to recognize her or even to be fully awake.</p><p>But this time his emerald eyes settled on her and stayed. \u201cMy lady.\u201d His voice was a whispered croak.</p><p>Oh, sweet Lord, thank you. She could have sung hallelujahs. She could have danced a reel around the room all by herself. She could have fallen upon her knees and offered up a prayer of thanksgiving.</p><p>But she merely lifted a cup to his lips. \u201cAre you thirsty?\u201d</p><p>He nodded without ever taking his eyes from hers. When he had swallowed, he whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d George replaced the cup on the bedside table. \u201cThey\u2019re tears of joy.\u201d</p><p>He watched her a few minutes longer; then his eyes closed again, and he fell asleep.</p><p>She put her hand to his neck as she had innumerable times over the last terrible week. She\u2019d done it so often that it had become habit. The blood beneath his skin beat strong and steady. Harry murmured at her touch and shifted.</p><p>George sighed and rose. She spent an hour in a luxurious, slow bath and took a nap that somehow lasted until nightfall. When she woke, she dressed in a yellow dimity gown with lace at the elbows and requested that her supper be brought to Harry\u2019s room.</p><p>He was awake when she entered his room, and she felt her heart skip. Such a small thing, seeing his eyes alert, but it made all the difference in her world.</p><p>Someone had helped him to sit up. \u201cHow\u2019s Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Will is staying with Bennet Granville.\u201d George went to open the curtains.</p><p>The sun was dying, but even that little light made the room seem less gloomy. She made a mental note to have the maids open the one window in the morning to get rid of the stuffy sickroom odor.</p><p>She came back beside the bed. \u201cApparently, Will hid when they took you and then ran all the way back to West Dikey to tell the Cock and Worm\u2019s landlord what had happened. Not that the landlord could do much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>George frowned at the thought of Harry in that cell being beaten every day with no one to help him. She shook her head. \u201cWill was most anxious about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told us what happened that night.\u201d George sat down. \u201cYou saved his life, you know.\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged. Obviously he didn\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some beef tea?\u201d She removed the cover to the tray of food the maids had already brought.</p><p>On her side was a plate of roast beef, steaming in juice and gravy. There were potatoes and carrots and a savory pudding. On his side of the tray stood a single cup of beef tea.</p><p>Harry eyed the food and sighed. \u201cBeef tea would be very nice, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George brought the cup to his face, intending to hold it as she had before while he drank from it, but he took the cup from her fingers. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She busied herself arranging her tray and pouring a glass of wine, but she watched him from the corner of her eye. He drank from the cup and rested it on his lap without spilling. His hands seemed steady. She relaxed a bit inside. She hadn\u2019t wanted to embarrass him by hovering, but only a day ago he\u2019d been quite insensible.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me your fairy tale, my lady?\u201d His voice had strengthened since this afternoon.</p><p>George smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably been on tenterhooks, wondering about the ending.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s bruised lips twitched, but he replied gravely, \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see.\u201d She popped a piece of beef into her mouth and thought as she chewed. The last time she had told him the story... Suddenly she remembered that she\u2019d been quite naked and Harry had... George swallowed too suddenly and had to grab for her wine. She just knew she was blushing. She snuck a look at Harry, but he was looking resignedly down at his beef tea.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cThe Leopard Prince turned into a man. He grasped his crown pendant and wished for a cloak of invisibility. Which would have been quite handy since, as we discussed before, he was most probably nude when he turned into a man.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at her over the rim of his cup.</p><p>She nodded primly. \u201cHe put the cloak on and set out to defeat the nasty witch and win the Golden Swan. And while there was a small setback when she turned him into a toad\u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled at her. How she gloried in his smiles!</p><p>\u201cEventually he was able to resume his natural form and steal the Golden Swan and bring it to the young king. Who, of course, immediately carted it off to the beautiful princess\u2019s father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cut a piece of beef and held it out to Harry. He eyed the fork, but instead of taking it, he merely opened his lips. His eyes met hers and held them as George placed the food in his mouth. For some reason this transaction made her breath quicken.</p><p>George looked down at her plate. \u201cBut the young king was out of luck again, for the Golden Swan could talk just as well as the Golden Horse. The father king took the Golden Swan aside and quizzed it and soon discovered the young king wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d stolen the Golden Swan from the nasty witch. Potato?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry closed his eyes as his lips took a piece from her fork.</p><p>George\u2019s mouth watered in sympathy. She cleared her throat. \u201cSo the father king went storming out to confront the young king. And the father king said, \u2018Right. The Golden Swan is very nice, but not exactly useful. You must bring me the Golden Eel guarded by the seven-headed dragon that lives on the Mountains of the Moon.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn eel?\u201d</p><p>She held out a spoonful of pudding, but Harry was looking at her dubiously.</p><p>She waved it under his nose. \u201cYes, an eel.\u201d</p><p>He captured her hand and guided the spoon to his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt does seem rather odd, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d George continued breathlessly. \u201cI did question Cook\u2019s aunt about it, but she was quite certain.\u201d She speared another piece of beef and held it out. \u201cI myself would have thought, oh, a wolf or a unicorn.\u201d</p> <p>Harry swallowed. \u201cNot a unicorn. Too close to the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. But, anyway, something more exotic.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at the pudding. \u201cEels\u2014even golden eels\u2014don\u2019t sound exotic to you, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I.\u201d She poked at the pudding. \u201cOf course, Cook\u2019s aunt is getting on in years. She must be at least eighty.\u201d George looked up to find him staring at the pudding she\u2019d just destroyed. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Would you like some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She fed him some pudding, watching as his lips enveloped the spoon. Goodness, he had lovely lips, even when they were bruised. \u201cAnyway, the young king trotted off back home, and I\u2019m sure he was quite nasty when he told the Leopard Prince that he had to retrieve the Golden Eel. But the Leopard Prince had no choice, did he? He turned into a man and took his emerald crown pendant in his hand, and guess what he asked for this time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-hundred-league boots.\u201d George sat back in satisfaction. \u201cCan you imagine? You put them on and the wearer can cross one hundred leagues in a single step.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t ask, my lady, but how would that help the Leopard Prince get to the Mountains of the Moon?\u201d</p><p>George stared. She\u2019d never thought of that. \u201cI haven\u2019t any idea. They would be wonderful on land, but would they work in the air?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded solemnly. \u201cIt is a problem, I fear.\u201d</p><p>George absently fed him the rest of her beef while pondering this question. She was offering the last bite when she realized that he\u2019d been watching her the entire time.</p><p>\u201cHarry...\u201d She hesitated. He was weak, barely recovered enough to sit upright. She shouldn\u2019t take advantage of him, but she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>She asked before she could rethink the idea. \u201cWhy did your father attack Lord Granville?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>She immediately regretted asking. It was more than clear he didn\u2019t want to talk about that time. How mean of her.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was Granville\u2019s whore.\u201d His words were flat.</p><p>George stopped breathing. She\u2019d never heard Harry mention his mother before.</p><p>\u201cShe was a beautiful woman, my mother.\u201d He looked down at his right hand and flexed it. \u201cToo beautiful for a gamekeeper\u2019s wife. She was all black hair and blazing green eyes. When we went to town, men used to watch her pass. Even as a lad it made me uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she a good mother?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cShe was the only mother I had. I\u2019ve none other to compare her with. She kept me fed and clothed. My da did most everything else.\u201d</p><p>George looked down at her own hands, fighting back tears, but she still heard his words, rasping and slow.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was small, she used to sing to me sometimes, late at night if I couldn\u2019t sleep. Sad love songs. Her voice was high, and not very strong, and she wouldn\u2019t sing if I looked at her face. But it was lovely when she sang.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAt least I thought so at the time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, barely moving, too afraid to interrupt the flow of his words.</p><p>\u201cThey moved here, my da and my mother, when they were first married. I don\u2019t know exactly\u2014I\u2019ve had to piece the story together from conversations I\u2019ve overheard\u2014but I think she took up with Granville soon after they came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you were born?\u201d George asked carefully.</p><p>He looked at her with steady emerald eyes and nodded once.</p><p>George let out a slow breath. \u201cDid your father know?\u201d</p><p>Harry grimaced. \u201cHe must\u2019ve. Granville took away Bennet.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. She couldn\u2019t have heard correctly. \u201cBennet Granville is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cMy mother\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he do such a thing? Didn\u2019t anyone notice when he brought a baby into his house?\u201d</p><p>Harry made a sound that was almost a laugh. \u201cOh, everyone knew\u2014quite a few hereabouts probably still remember\u2014but Granville has always been a tyrant. When he said the baby was his legitimate son, none dared disagree. Not even his lawful wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father?\u201d</p><p>Harry looked down at his hands, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t remember, I was only two or so, but I think Da must\u2019ve forgiven her. And she must\u2019ve promised to stay away from Granville. But she lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cMy father caught her. I don\u2019t know if Da always knew that she\u2019d gone back to Granville and looked away or if he fooled himself that she had turned over a new leaf or...\u201d He shook his head impatiently. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. When I was twelve, he found her in bed with Granville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Harry grimaced. \u201cAnd he went for Granville\u2019s throat. Granville was a much larger man, and he beat my father off. Da was humiliated. But Granville still had him horsewhipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You said he horsewhipped you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was young. When they started on Da with that big whip...\u201d Harry swallowed. \u201cI darted in. It was a stupid thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were trying to save your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I was. And all I got for the effort was this.\u201d Harry held up his mutilated right hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to shield my face, and the whip caught me across this hand. See?\u201d Harry pointed at a long scar that cut across the inside of his fingers. \u201cThe whip nearly severed them all, but the third finger was the worst. Lord Granville had one of his men cut it off. Said he was doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. George felt bile rise in her throat. She covered Harry\u2019s right hand with her own. He turned it over so they were palm to palm. George carefully linked her fingers with his.</p><p>\u201cDa was out of work and so badly crippled by the whipping that after a while we went into the poorhouse.\u201d Harry looked away from her, but he still clasped his hand with hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother? Did she go into the poorhouse as well?\u201d George asked in a low voice.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand squeezed hers almost painfully. \u201cNo. She stayed with Granville. As his whore. I heard many years later that she\u2019d died of the plague. But I never spoke to her again after that day. The day Da and I were horsewhipped.\u201d</p><p>She breathed deeply. \u201cDid you love her, Harry?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, crookedly. \u201cAll boys love their mothers, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George closed her eyes. What kind of woman would abandon her child to be a rich man\u2019s mistress? So many things about Harry were explained, but the knowledge was almost too painful to bear. She laid her head down in his lap and felt him stroke her hair. It was strange. She should be comforting him after his revelations. Instead, he consoled her.</p><p>He drew a breath like a sigh. \u201cNow you understand why I must leave.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cBut why must you leave?\u201d George asked.</p><p>She paced the small bedroom. She wanted to pound on the bed. Pound on the chest of drawers. Pound on Harry. It had been almost a fortnight since he\u2019d first said it. A fortnight in which he\u2019d regained his feet, his bruises had faded to the greenish-yellow color of recovery, and he hardly limped. But in that fortnight he\u2019d remained adamant. He would leave her as soon as he was well.</p><p>Every day she came to visit him in his tiny room, and every day they had the same argument. George couldn\u2019t stand this cramped room anymore\u2014Lord knew what Harry thought of it\u2014and she was about ready to scream. He was going to leave her soon, just walk out the door, and she still didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>Harry sighed now. He must be weary of her badgering him. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work, my lady. You and me. You must know that, and you\u2019ll agree with me soon.\u201d His voice was low and calm. Reasonable.</p><p>Hers was not.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d George cried like a small child told she must go to bed. All she lacked was the stomp of one foot.</p><p>Oh, Lord, she knew she was making herself ugly. But she couldn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t help pleading and whining and pestering. The thought of never seeing Harry again brought blind panic flooding into her chest.</p><p>She took a deep breath and tried to speak more sedately. \u201cWe could get married. I love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He slammed his hand against the wall, the sound like a cannon shot in the room.</p><p>She stared at him. She knew damn well Harry loved her. She knew by the way he said my lady so low it was almost a purr. The way his eyes lingered when he looked at her. The way he had made love to her so intently before he\u2019d been injured. Why couldn\u2019t he\u2014?</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Tears started in her eyes. She rubbed them away. \u201cYou can at least do me the favor of explaining why you don\u2019t think we should marry. Because I just can\u2019t see why not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why?\u201d Harry laughed sharply. \u201cHow about this reason: If I married you, my lady, the whole of England would think I did it for your money. And how exactly would we work out the money part? Eh? Would you give me a quarterly allowance?\u201d He stood with his hands on his hips and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Perhaps you\u2019d like to sign all your money over to me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a fatal second.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d He flung up his arms. \u201cSo I\u2019d be your pet monkey. Your male whore. Do you even think any of your friends would invite me to dine with them? That your family would accept me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, they would.\u201d She stuck out her jaw. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I?\u201d There was pain in his green eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d she whispered. She held out her hands in supplication. \u201cYou know you\u2019re not that to me. You\u2019re much more. I love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>But she spoke over him this time. \u201cYou. I love you, Harry. I love you. Doesn\u2019t that mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more reason not to let you be pilloried by society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be as bad as all that. And even if it was, I don\u2019t care.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d care after they figured out why you married me. You\u2019d care then.\u201d Harry was advancing on her, and George didn\u2019t like the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grasped her upper arms almost too gently, as if he held himself back by an unraveling willpower. \u201cThey\u2019d know soon enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy else would you marry me? A commoner with no money or power? You, the daughter of an earl?\u201d He leaned close and whispered, \u201cCan\u2019t you guess?\u201d His breath on her ear sent shivers down her neck. It had been so very long since he\u2019d last touched her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what they think of me,\u201d she repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d The word was whispered in her hair. \u201cBut, you see, my lady, it still won\u2019t work between us. We have one remaining problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care what they think of you.\u201d His lips came down on hers in a kiss that tasted of anger and despair.</p><p>George grabbed his head. She yanked the ribbon from his hair and ran her fingers into it. And she kissed him back, countering fury with fury. If he would just stop thinking. She nipped his bottom lip, felt the groan go through him, and opened her mouth in seductive invitation. And he took it, thrusting his tongue into her mouth and angling his face over hers. Framing her face with his hands, caressing and punishing her mouth with his. He kissed her as if it were the last embrace they would ever share.</p><p>As if he would leave her tomorrow.</p><p>George tightened her grasp in his hair at that thought. It must have hurt him, but she wasn\u2019t letting go. She pressed her body to his until she felt his arousal even through the bulk of both their clothing. She rubbed herself against him.</p><p>Harry broke their kiss and tried to pull his head up. \u201cMy lady, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d George murmured. She trailed kisses along his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear can\u2019t. I want you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>She licked the pulse at his throat, tasting salt and man. He shuddered. She bared her teeth against his neck. She released his hair with one hand and ripped at his shirt, tearing it open and off one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, I, uhh...\u201d He lapsed into a moan when she licked his exposed nipple.</p><p>From the way he took her bottom and pulled her hard into his groin, he was no longer interested in protesting. Just as well. She\u2019d never realized a man\u2019s nipples were sensitive. Someone should make this information known to the general female population. She took the tiny nubbin between her teeth and delicately bit down. He squeezed her bottom in his big hands. She lifted her head and pulled the shirt entirely off. Definitely better. Of all the things God had made on this earth, surely a man\u2019s chest must be one of the most beautiful. Or perhaps it was just Harry\u2019s chest. George ran her hands across his shoulders, skimming gently over the scars from his beating.</p><p>She\u2019d come so close to losing him.</p><p>Her fingers drifted down to circle his nipples, making him close his eyes, then lower, into the slim line of hair below his navel. Her fingernails must have tickled. Harry sucked in his stomach. Then she reached his breeches. She explored the flap and found the hidden buttons. George flicked them open, conscious all the while that his penis was underneath, already hard and tenting the fabric. She glanced up once to find him watching her under lowered lids. The emerald fire in his eyes made her squirm. A slow seep of wetness began at her core.</p><p>She opened the breeches and found her prize, poking up through the top of his smallclothes.</p><p>\u201cTake them off.\u201d She forced her gaze to his face. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Harry crooked an eyebrow but obediently stripped off his breeches, smallclothes, stockings, and shoes. Then he reached for the front of her dress.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d George danced out of his way. \u201cI can\u2019t think when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>Harry stalked her. \u201cThat\u2019s the point, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Her rear bumped against the bed. She held up her hands to ward him off. \u201cNot my point.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned close without actually touching her, the heat from his bare chest almost menacing. \u201cThe last time you played with me I nearly died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He watched her, his eyes unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou know I can deny you nothing, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now get on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Harry grimaced but he did as she ordered, stretching on his side. His cock arced up, nearly touching his navel.</p><p>\u201cUnhook me.\u201d</p><p>She presented her back and felt his fingers as he undid her gown. When he reached the end, she walked out of his reach and turned. She let the bodice fall. She wasn\u2019t wearing stays, and his eyes immediately dropped to her nipples, peaking the fabric of her shift. She placed her hands at her waist and wriggled the dress down.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p>She sat on a chair and pulled off her garters and rolled down her stockings. Wearing only her shift, she walked to the bed. When she crawled on the bed beside him, Harry reached for her at once.</p><p>\u201cNo, this won\u2019t do.\u201d George frowned. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me.\u201d She looked at the row of carved spindles on the bed\u2019s headboard. \u201cHold those.\u201d</p><p>He twisted to look and then lay down and grasped one spindle in each hand. With his arms over his head, the muscles in his upper arms and chest bunched.</p><p>George licked her bottom lip. \u201cYou can\u2019t let go until I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he growled, sounding not at all submissive. He should\u2019ve appeared weak in such a compromising position. Instead, he reminded her of a wild leopard captured and tethered. He lay there, eyeing her speculatively, a trace of a sneer on his lips.</p><p>Best not to get too close.</p><p>She ran a fingernail down his chest. \u201cPerhaps I ought to tie your wrists to the bed.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>\u201cJust to be safe,\u201d she reassured him sweetly.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cOh, never mind. But you must promise not to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my honor, I will not let go of the bedposts until you permit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d</p><p>But it was close enough. She leaned over him and licked the tip of his penis.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>George lifted her head and frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything about talking,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. If I feel inclined.\u201d She inched nearer, ignoring his grumbled curse.</p><p>This time she lifted his cock aside and planted a series of tiny, wet kisses on his belly. She ended when she came to the dark, wiry hair above his erection. She opened her mouth and scraped her teeth against his skin.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harry sucked in a breath.</p><p>His scent was pungent here. George nudged his legs apart and ran her fingers over his sac. She could feel the things that men called stones rolling about inside. Very, very carefully she squeezed.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his profanity. George grasped his cock between forefinger and thumb. She glanced up at Harry\u2019s face.</p><p>He looked worried.</p><p>Good. Now, what if she...? George bent her head and licked the underside of his manhood. She tasted salt and skin and inhaled his aroma. She shifted her fingers and ran her tongue around the head, just where it began to swell out. Harry groaned. So she repeated the process and then thought to kiss the very tip where drops of seed welled.</p><p>\u201cPut it in your mouth.\u201d His voice was a deep rasp, dark and prayerful.</p><p>It excited her unbearably. She didn\u2019t want to take his order. On the other hand... She opened her mouth over him. He was very big. Surely he didn\u2019t mean the whole thing? She fit the head into her mouth, like a small peach. Except peaches were sweet and he was musky. Tasting of man.</p><p>\u201cSuck me.\u201d</p><p>She was startled. Really? She pursed her mouth and his hips came off the bed, startling her again.</p><p>\u201cAhhh. God.\u201d</p><p>His reaction, his obvious enjoyment of what she was doing, aroused her. She could feel that part of herself throbbing. She pressed her thighs together tightly and sucked on Harry\u2019s cock. She tasted his semen and wondered if he would reach completion in her mouth. But she wanted him in her when that happened. George licked one last time and rose to straddle his hips. She guided his erection to where it should be, but it seemed so big now. She pressed and felt him begin to part her. To tunnel and push. She glanced down. The smooth red skin of his cock disappeared into her feminine hair. She moaned and almost came apart right there.</p><p>\u201cLet me move,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak. She nodded.</p><p>He placed one hand on his penis to steady it and the other on her bottom. \u201cLean toward me.\u201d</p><p>She did and he slid in suddenly, almost all the way. She caught her breath and felt unexpected tears. Harry. Harry was making love to her. She closed her eyes and ground her hips into his. Felt at the same time his thumb touch that spot. She moaned and drew up until only the head remained inside her, concentrating on her pleasure and his. Down, grinding herself into him. Up, balancing precariously on a peak. Down, his thumb pressing against that most sensitive part of her. Up...</p><p>But suddenly he broke. He gripped her bottom tightly and rolled her underneath him. Then he braced himself on his hands and ploughed into her, fast and furious. She tried to move, to respond, but he pinned her to the mattress with his weight, dominated and mastered her with his flesh. She arched her head and widened her legs helplessly. Allowed him full access. Gave herself to him as he continued his relentless pounding. He grunted with each thrust into her body, and it almost sounded like sobbing. Did he feel it as much as she?</p><p>Then she fell apart and saw stars, a glorious stream of light filling her being. Dimly she heard his cry and felt his withdrawal, like a little death.</p><p>Then he lay next to her, panting.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d George stroked his neck. Her tongue was thick with satiation. \u201cI wish you would stay with me until the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that, my lady.\u201d His voice sounded no better.</p><p>She rolled over and snuggled against him. Her hand stroked down his sweaty belly until she found his penis again. She held it. The argument could wait for tomorrow.</p><p>But when she woke in the morning, Harry was gone.</p><p>BENNET LAY WITH ONE ARM flung over his head and a foot hanging off the bed. In the moonlight, something metallic shone dully around his neck. He snored.</p><p>Harry stole across the darkened bedroom, placing his feet carefully. He should\u2019ve quit the area the night he\u2019d left his lady\u2019s bed, a week ago now. And he had meant to. It had been harder than it should\u2019ve been to watch his lady sleep, see her relaxed body after he\u2019d given her pleasure, and know he must leave her. There was simply no other choice. They had kept secret his recovery from Granville, but it was only a matter of time before Silas found out. And when he did, Lady Georgina\u2019s life would be in danger. Granville was insane. Harry had seen that firsthand during his stay in the lord\u2019s dungeon. Whatever was driving Granville to seek Harry\u2019s death had been let off its leash. Lord Granville would stop at nothing\u2014not even an innocent woman\u2014to see Harry dead. It would be irresponsible to put his lady\u2019s life in danger for an affair that had no future.</p><p>He knew all this, and yet something still held him here in Yorkshire. As a result, Harry had become a master at sneaking. He hid from Granville\u2019s watchful eyes and the men who had begun roaming the hills in the last few days, seeking him. Tonight he made almost no noise, just a faint creak from his leather boots. The man on the bed stirred not at all.</p><p>Still, the boy on the pallet beside the bed opened his eyes.</p><p>Harry stopped and watched Will. The boy nodded slightly. Harry returned the nod. He walked to the bed. For a moment, he stood looking down at Bennet. Then he leaned over and covered the other man\u2019s mouth with his hand. Bennet jackknifed convulsively. He threw out his arms and managed to knock Harry\u2019s hand aside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWha\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Harry slapped his hand back down again, grunting as Bennet elbowed him. \u201cHist, you beef-wit. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Bennet fought for a second more, and then Harry\u2019s words seemed to reach his brain. He froze.</p><p>Cautiously, Harry lifted his hand.</p> <p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better hope.\u201d He spoke barely above a whisper. \u201cThe way you sleep, it could be marauders. Even the boy woke before you.\u201d</p><p>Bennet leaned over the bed. \u201cWill? Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Will had sat up sometime during the struggle.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Bennet flopped back on the bed, covering his eyes with an arm. \u201cYou nearly gave me apoplexy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten soft living in London.\u201d The corner of Harry\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cHasn\u2019t he, Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe-ell.\u201d The boy clearly didn\u2019t want to say anything against his new mentor. \u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt to be more alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, young Will.\u201d Bennet removed his arm to glare at Harry. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing, creeping into my bedroom in the wee hours?\u201d</p><p>Harry sat on the bed, his back against one of the posts at the end. He nudged Bennet\u2019s legs with a boot. The other man stared at the boot indignantly before moving.</p><p>Harry stretched out his legs. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve come to say good-bye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d He looked down at the fingernails on his right hand. To the place where one should be but wasn\u2019t. \u201cYour father is hell-bent on having me killed. And he\u2019s none too happy with Lady Georgina for saving me.\u201d</p><p>Bennet nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s been rampaging around Granville House the last week, roaring that he\u2019d have you arrested. He\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. He\u2019s also the magistrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you do? What can anybody do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find whoever is really killing the sheep.\u201d Harry glanced at Will. \u201cAnd Mrs. Pollard\u2019s murderer as well. It might dampen his temper.\u201d And turn it away from his lady.</p><p>Bennet sat up. \u201cVery well. But how are you going to find the killer?\u201d</p><p>Harry stared. A pendant on a thin chain around Bennet\u2019s neck had swung forward: a small, crudely carved falcon.</p><p>Harry blinked, remembering.</p> <p>Long, long ago. A morning so bright and sunny it hurt to open your eyes wide to the full, blue sky. He and Benny had stretched on their backs on top of the hill, chewing grass.</p><p>\u201cLookee here.\u201d Harry took the carving out of his pocket and handed it to Benny.</p><p>Benny turned it over in his dirty fingers. \u201cA bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a falcon. Can\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course I can see.\u201d Benny glanced up. \u201cWho made it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You carved it?\u201d Benny stared at him with awe.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cMy da taught me. It\u2019s only my first, so it\u2019s not so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged again and squinted into the blinding blue sky. \u201cYou can keep it if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They had lain for a while, almost falling asleep in the warm sun.</p><p>Then Benny sat up. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d turned out both pockets and then dug down again, finally bringing up a small, dirty penknife. Benny rubbed it on his breeches and handed it to Harry.</p><p>Harry looked at the pearl handle and tested the edge with his thumb. \u201cTa, Benny. It\u2019ll be good for whittling.\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t remember what he and Bennet had done the rest of that day. Probably rode their ponies about. Maybe fished in the stream. Come home hungry. That was how they\u2019d spent most days back then. And it didn\u2019t really matter. The next afternoon Da had found his mother humping old Granville.</p><p>Harry looked up and met eyes as green as his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always worn it.\u201d Bennet touched the little falcon.</p><p>Harry nodded and glanced away from Bennet for a moment. \u201cI had started asking around, before I was arrested, and I\u2019ve tried again this last week, discreetly, lest your father track me.\u201d He looked back at Bennet, his face under control now. \u201cNobody seems to know much, but there\u2019s plenty besides me who have a reason to hate your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably most of the county.\u201d</p><p>Harry ignored the sarcasm. \u201cI thought maybe I should search a bit further back.\u201d</p><p>Bennet raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYour nurse is still alive, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Alice Humboldt?\u201d Bennet yawned. \u201cYes, she\u2019s alive. Her cottage was the first place I stopped when I got back into the district. And you\u2019re right, she might know something. Nanny is very quiet, but she always noticed everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Harry stood up. \u201cThen she\u2019s the person to question. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, now?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth twitched. He\u2019d forgotten how fun it was to bait Bennet. \u201cI had thought to wait for sunrise,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cbut if you\u2019re eager to go now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, sunrise is fine.\u201d Bennet winced. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could wait until nine o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Bennet yawned again, nearly unhinging the back of his head. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at Nanny\u2019s cottage, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Will spoke up from the pallet.</p><p>Harry and Bennet glanced at the boy. He\u2019d nearly forgotten Will. Bennet raised his eyebrows at Harry, leaving the decision to him.</p><p>\u201cAye, you\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cTa,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d</p><p>He burrowed under his pillow and came out with a long, thin object wrapped in a rag. He held it out. Harry took the bundle and unrolled it. His knife, cleaned and oiled, lay on his palm.</p><p>\u201cFound it in the stream,\u201d Will said, \u201cafter they took you. I been taking care of it for you. Until you was ready for it again.\u201d</p><p>It was the most Harry had ever heard from the boy\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Harry smiled. \u201cTa, Will.\u201d</p><p>GEORGE TOUCHED THE LITTLE SWAN swimming on her pillow. It was the second carving Harry had given her. The first had been a rearing horse. He\u2019d been gone from her seven days, but he hadn\u2019t left the neighborhood. That much was obvious from the tiny carvings he\u2019d somehow placed on her bed.</p><p>\u201cGave you another one, has he, my lady?\u201d Tiggle bustled about the room, putting away her dress and gathering soiled things for the laundry.</p><p>George picked up the swan. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d questioned the servants after the first carving. Nobody had seen Harry enter or leave Woldsly, not even Oscar, who kept the irregular hours of a bachelor. Her middle brother had remained behind after Tony had left for London. Oscar said it was to keep her and Violet company, but she suspected the real reason had more to do with his creditors in London.</p><p>\u201cRomantic of Mr. Pye, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tiggle sighed.</p><p>\u201cOr irritating.\u201d George wrinkled her nose at the swan and placed it carefully on her dressing table beside the horse.</p><p>\u201cOr irritating, I guess, my lady,\u201d Tiggle agreed.</p><p>The maid came over and laid a hand on George\u2019s shoulder, gently pressing her into the chair before the dressing table. She took up the silver-backed brush and began to stroke it through George\u2019s hair. Tiggle started at the ends and worked to the roots, teasing out the tangles. George closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t always see things the same way we do, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but think that Mr. Pye was dropped on his head as a baby.\u201d George squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cWhy won\u2019t he come back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say, my lady.\u201d The tangles worked out, Tiggle began stroking from her crown down to the ends of her hair.</p><p>George sighed in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cBut he hasn\u2019t gone too far away, now, has he?\u201d the maid pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d George tilted her head so Tiggle could do that side.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to go\u2014you\u2019ve said so yourself, my lady\u2014but he hasn\u2019t.\u201d Tiggle started on the other side, brushing gently from the temple. \u201cStands to reason, then, that maybe he can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re speaking in riddles and I\u2019m too tired to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying maybe he can\u2019t leave you, my lady.\u201d Tiggle set down the brush with a thump and began braiding her hair.</p><p>\u201cA lot of good that does me if he can\u2019t bring himself to face me, either.\u201d George frowned in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll be back.\u201d The maid tied a ribbon at the end of George\u2019s braid and leaned over her shoulder to meet her eyes in the mirror. \u201cAnd when he comes, you\u2019ll be needing to tell him, if you don\u2019t mind my saying so, my lady.\u201d</p><p>George blushed. She had hoped Tiggle wouldn\u2019t notice, but she should have realized the maid kept track of everything. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, there is. And you being so regular like...\u201d Tiggle gave her an old-fashioned look. \u201cGood night, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She left the room.</p><p>George sighed and dropped her head into her hands. Tiggle had better be right about Harry. Because if he waited too long to return, there would be no need to tell him she was expecting.</p><p>He\u2019d see it.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d The wizened face peeped out the door crack.</p><p>Harry looked down. The old woman\u2019s head didn\u2019t come to his breastbone. The hump on her back bent her until she had to peer sideways and up to see her caller.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mistress Humboldt. My name is Harry Pye. I\u2019d like to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest come in, then, hadn\u2019t you, young man?\u201d The tiny figure smiled at Harry\u2019s left ear and opened the door wider. Only then, in the light let in by the open door, did he see the cataracts that clouded the old woman\u2019s blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Bennet and Will were there before him. They sat by a smoldering fire, the only light in the dim room. Will was munching on a scone and eyeing another on a tray.</p><p>\u201cLate, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Bennet was more alert than he\u2019d been five hours before. He looked quite pleased to have got the first dig in.</p><p>\u201cSome of us have to travel by back lanes.\u201d</p><p>Harry helped Mistress Humboldt lower herself into a fan-backed chair piled with knitted pillows. A calico cat padded over, meowing. It leaped into the old lady\u2019s lap and purred loudly even before she started stroking its back.</p><p>\u201cHave a scone, Mr. Pye. And if you don\u2019t mind, you can help yourself to tea.\u201d Mistress Humboldt\u2019s voice was thin and whistling. \u201cNow. What have you lads come to talk to me about that you must do it in secret?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth twitched. The old woman\u2019s eyes might be fading, but her mind surely wasn\u2019t. \u201cLord Granville and his enemies.\u201d</p><p>Mistress Humboldt smiled sweetly. \u201cHave you got all day, then, young man? For if I was to list everyone who ever had a grudge against that lord, I\u2019d still be talking tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Bennet laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite right, ma\u2019am,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut what I\u2019m after is the person poisoning the sheep. Who has such -hatred of Granville that they\u2019d want to do these crimes?\u201d</p><p>The old woman cocked her head and stared at the fire for a moment, the only sound in the room the purring of the cat and Will eating his scone.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking on these sheep killings myself.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cBad things they are and evil because while it hurts the farmer, it merely bothers Lord Granville. Seems to me that what you really should be asking, young man, is who has the heart to do this.\u201d Mistress Humboldt took a sip of tea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bennet started to speak. Harry shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt takes a hard heart to not care that others are hurt along the way to getting at the lord.\u201d Mistress Humboldt tapped a shaking finger on her knee to punctuate her point. \u201cA hard heart and a brave one as well. Lord Granville is the law and the fist in this county, and whoever goes against him is gambling their very life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho fits your description, Nanny?\u201d Bennet leaned forward impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI can think of two men that answer, at least in parts.\u201d She wrinkled her brow. \u201cBut neither are quite right.\u201d She raised her teacup to her lips with a wavering hand.</p> <p>Bennet shifted in his chair, jiggled one leg up and down, and sighed.</p><p>Harry leaned forward in his own chair and selected a scone.</p><p>Bennet shot him an incredulous glare.</p><p>Harry raised his eyebrows as he bit into the scone.</p><p>\u201cDick Crumb,\u201d the old woman said, and Harry lowered the scone. \u201cA while back, his sister, Janie, the one who\u2019s weak in the head, was seduced by the lord. A terrible thing, preying on that child-woman.\u201d The corners of Mistress Humboldt\u2019s mouth crumpled in a frown. \u201cAnd Dick, when he found out, why, he nearly lost his head. Said he\u2019d have killed him had it been any man but the lord. Would have, too.\u201d</p> <p>Harry frowned. Dick hadn\u2019t said he\u2019d threatened Granville\u2019s life, but then what man would? Surely that by itself...</p><p>Mistress Humboldt held out her cup, and Bennet silently poured tea for her and placed the cup back in her hand.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cDick isn\u2019t a mean man. Hard, yes, but not hard-hearted. As for the other man\u2014Mistress Humboldt looked in Bennet\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cperhaps it\u2019s best to let sleeping dogs lie.\u201d</p><p>Bennet seemed bewildered. \u201cWhat sleeping dogs?\u201d</p><p>Will stopped eating. He looked between Bennet and the old woman. Damn. Harry had a feeling he knew what Mistress Humboldt was getting at. Perhaps it would be better to leave it alone.</p><p>Bennet caught some of Harry\u2019s unease. He leaned forward tensely, his elbows on his knees, both heels tapping now. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThomas.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Harry looked away.</p><p>\u201cThomas who?\u201d It seemed to hit Bennet all at once. He stopped moving for a second, then exploded out of the chair, pacing in the tiny space before the fire. \u201cThomas, my brother?\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. He\u2019s a... a milksop. He wouldn\u2019t say nay to Father if he told him the sun rose in the west and he shat pearls.\u201d</p><p>The old woman compressed her lips at the profanity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nanny,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cBut Thomas! He\u2019s lived under my father\u2019s thumb so long he has calluses on his buttocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d In contrast to the young man, Mistress Humboldt was calm. She must have expected his reaction. Or maybe she was simply used to his constant movement. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I name him.\u201d</p><p>Bennet stared.</p><p>\u201cA man so long under his father\u2019s power isn\u2019t natural. Your father took a dislike to Thomas when he was very young. I\u2019ve never understood it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cLord Granville hating his own son so thoroughly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut even so, he\u2019d never...\u201d Bennet\u2019s words trailed off, and he abruptly turned away.</p><p>Mistress Humboldt looked sad. \u201cHe might. You know it yourself, Master Bennet. The way your father has treated him shows. He\u2019s like a tree trying to grow through a crack in a rock. Twisted. Not quite right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the mice he\u2019d catch sometimes when he was a boy? I found him once with one he\u2019d caught. He\u2019d cut off it\u2019s feet. He was watching it try to crawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Bennet muttered.</p><p>\u201cI had to kill it. But then I couldn\u2019t punish him, poor lad. His father beat him enough already. I never saw him again with a mouse, but I don\u2019t think he stopped. He just got better at hiding it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to pursue this,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Bennet swung around, his eyes desperate. \u201cAnd what if he is the sheep poisoner? What if he kills someone else?\u201d</p><p>His question hung in the air. No one could answer it but Bennet.</p><p>He seemed to realize it was up to him. He squared his broad shoulders. \u201cIf it is Thomas, he\u2019s murdered a woman. I need to stop him.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Dick Crumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cYou\u2019ve helped us, Nanny. You see things nobody else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not with my eyes anymore, but I always could read a person.\u201d Mistress Humboldt held out a wavering hand to her former charge.</p><p>Bennet grasped it.</p><p>\u201cGod save and protect you, Master Bennet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task you have.\u201d</p><p>Bennet leaned down to kiss the withered cheek. \u201cThank you, Nanny.\u201d He straightened and clapped Will on the shoulder. \u201cWe best be going, Will, before you finish those last two scones.\u201d</p><p>The old woman smiled. \u201cLet the lad take the rest. It\u2019s been so long since I had a boy to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Will stuffed the scones into his pockets.</p><p>She saw them to the door and stood and waved as they rode away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten how sharp Nanny is. Thomas and I could never get anything past her.\u201d Bennet\u2019s face darkened when he spoke his brother\u2019s name.</p><p>Harry glanced at him. \u201cIf you want, you can put off talking to Thomas until tomorrow, after I\u2019ve sounded out Dick Crumb. I\u2019ll have to wait until nightfall to find him, anyway. Best time to catch Dick is at the Cock and Worm after ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to wait another day to talk to Thomas. Better to do it right away.\u201d</p><p>They rode for a half mile or more in silence, Will clinging behind Bennet.</p><p>\u201cSo once we find whoever\u2019s doing this,\u201d Bennet said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Harry watched the road ahead but could feel the other man\u2019s gaze on him.</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression that you and Lady Georgina had an... uh... understanding.\u201d</p><p>Harry gave Bennet a look that usually shut a man up. Not him. \u201cBecause, I mean, it\u2019s a bit thick, what? A fellow just up and leaving a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from her class.\u201d \u201cYes, but that obviously doesn\u2019t matter to her, does it? Or she\u2019d never have taken up with you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t mind me being blunt, she must be pretty gone on you.\u201d Bennet looked him up and down as if he were a side of spoiled beef. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t exactly have the sort of face that women swoon over. More in my line, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennet\u2014\u201d \u201cNot to blow my own horn, but I could tell you quite a tale of a delectable bird in London\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded at Will, who was wide-eyed and listening to every word.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bennet coughed. \u201cQuite. Shall I see you tomorrow, then? We\u2019ll meet and exchange information.\u201d</p><p>They had neared a copse of trees that marked where the main road crossed the lane they traveled on.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Harry pulled his mare to a halt. \u201cThis is where I must turn off, anyway. And Bennet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He turned his face and the sun fell full upon it, tracing the laugh lines around his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIf it is Thomas, he\u2019ll be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be careful as well, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cGodspeed.\u201d</p><p>Bennet waved and rode off.</p><p>Harry spent the rest of the daylight hours laying low. When dusk fell, he made his way to West Dikey and the Cock and Worm. He ducked his head as he entered and scanned the crowd from under his low hat brim. A table of farmers, smoking clay pipes in the corner, burst into boisterous laughter. A weathered-looking barmaid dodged with practiced ease a heavy hand aimed at her rump and made her way to the counter.</p><p>\u201cDick in tonight?\u201d Harry bawled in her ear. \u201cSorry, luv.\u201d She pivoted and shouldered a tray of drinks. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowned and ordered a pint from the counterman, a lad he remembered seeing once or twice before. Was Dick hiding in back or was he really not in the building? He leaned on the wood counter while he thought and watched a gentleman, obviously a traveler, judging from the mud on his boots, enter and stare bemusedly around. The man\u2019s face was handsome but long and bland, rather like a goat\u2019s. Harry shook his head. The traveler must\u2019ve missed the sign for the White Mare. He wasn\u2019t the Cock and Worm\u2019s usual type of customer.</p><p>The boy slid Harry his mug of ale, and Harry rolled a few coins back. He moved over and took a sip as the traveler came to the counter.</p><p>\u201cPardon me, but do you know the way to Woldsly Manor?\u201d</p><p>Harry froze for a second, his mug at his lips. The stranger hadn\u2019t paid him any attention; he was leaning over the counter to the boy.</p><p>\u201cSay again?\u201d the boy shouted. \u201cWoldsly Manor,\u201d the stranger raised his voice. \u201cLady Georgina Maitland\u2019s estate. I\u2019m an intimate of her younger sister, Lady Violet. I can\u2019t seem to find the road\u2014\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s gaze darted to Harry.</p><p>Harry clapped his hand on the other\u2019s shoulder, making the stranger start. \u201cI can show you the way, friend, soon as I finish my ale.\u201d</p><p>The man turned, his face brightening. \u201cWould you?\u201d \u201cNo problem at all.\u201d Harry nodded at the boy. \u201cAnother pint for my friend here. I\u2019m sorry, didn\u2019t catch your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWentworth. Leonard Wentworth.\u201d \u201cAh.\u201d Harry suppressed a feral smile. \u201cLet\u2019s find a table, shall we?\u201d As the other man turned, Harry leaned over the counter and murmured urgent instructions to the boy, then passed him a coin.</p><p>An hour later, when the middle Maitland brother strolled into the Cock and Worm, Wentworth was on his fourth pint. Harry had been nursing his second for some time now and felt as if he needed a bath. Wentworth had been quite forthcoming about bedding a fifteen-year-old, his marriage hopes, and what he would do with Lady Violet\u2019s money once he got his hands on it.</p><p>So it was with some relief that Harry spotted the red Maitland hair. \u201cOver here,\u201d he shouted at the newcomer.</p><p>He\u2019d only spoken to Lady Georgina\u2019s middle brother once or twice, and the man hadn\u2019t been all that friendly. But all of Maitland\u2019s animosity was reserved for Harry\u2019s companion at the moment. He made his way to them with a look that would\u2019ve sent Wentworth running, had be been sober.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d The redheaded man nodded at him; only then did Harry remember his name: Oscar.</p><p>\u201cMaitland.\u201d Harry nodded. \u201cLike you to meet an acquaintance of mine, Leonard Wentworth. Says he seduced your younger sister this last summer.\u201d</p><p>Wentworth paled. \u201cNow w-w-wait a\u2014\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Oscar drawled. \u201cIndeed,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019s been telling me about his debts and how her dowry will help settle them, once he\u2019s blackmailed her into marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Oscar grinned. \u201cPerhaps we should discuss this outside.\u201d He took one of Wentworth\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cMay I assist you?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Harry took the other. \u201cUhh!\u201d was all Wentworth got out before they frog-marched him through the doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a carriage over here.\u201d Oscar was no longer smiling.</p><p>Wentworth whimpered.</p><p>Oscar casually cuffed him over the head and Wentworth subsided. \u201cI\u2019ll take him to London and my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need my help on the road?\u201d Harry asked. Oscar shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got him pretty far gone with drink. He\u2019ll sleep most of the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They heaved Wentworth\u2019s now-inert body into the carriage.</p><p>Oscar dusted his hands. \u201cThanks, Harry.

Maybe it was the life growing inside of her, making its presence known by disturbing her sleep. Maybe it was the thought of the decisions she must make soon. Or maybe it was wondering where Harry was spending the night. Was he sleeping under the stars, shivering in a bundled up cloak? Had he found sanctuary with friends somewhere? Was he keeping another woman warm tonight?</p><p>No, best not to think of that.</p> <p>She rolled over and stared out her black bedroom window. Maybe it was just the chill of the autumn air. A tree branch rattled in the wind. George drew the covers up to her chin. She\u2019d found Harry\u2019s latest gift earlier when she\u2019d prepared for bed. A small, rather funny eel. She\u2019d thought it a snake at first, before remembering the fairy tale. Then she could see the tiny fin running along the creature\u2019s back. Did that complete her collection? He\u2019d made all the animals the Leopard Prince had obtained for the princess. Perhaps it was his way of saying good-bye.</p><p>A shadow shifted outside her window, and the frame slid smoothly up. Harry Pye swung a leg over the sill and climbed into her room.</p><p>Thank goodness. \u201cIs that how you\u2019ve been getting in and out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly I\u2019ve been sneaking in the kitchen door.\u201d Harry gently shut the window.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nearly as romantic as the window.\u201d George sat up and hugged her knees to her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s a lot easier.\u201d \u201cI had noticed that it\u2019s a three-story drop to the ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith prickly rose bushes at the base, my lady. I hope you saw those, too.\u201d He strolled to the bed.</p><p>\u201cMmm. I did see the roses. Of course, now that I know you were merely using the kitchen entrance...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not tonight,\u201d George agreed. Oh, how she loved him. His green, ever-watchful eyes. His words, so carefully chosen. \u201cBut, even so, I\u2019m afraid it has shattered some of my dreams.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips twitched. His mouth sometimes gave him away.</p><p>\u201cI found the eel tonight.\u201d She nodded at her dressing table.</p><p>He didn\u2019t follow her gaze. Instead, he continued to watch her. \u201cI have one more.\u201d He held out his fist and opened his fingers.</p><p>A leopard lay on his palm. \u201cWhy is it caged?\u201d</p> <p>George took it from him and looked closely. The workmanship was incredibly cunning. The cage was all of one piece but separate from the leopard within. He would\u2019ve had to whittle the animal inside the cage. The leopard in turn wore a miniscule chain about its neck, each link carefully delineated. A tiny, tiny crown hung from the chain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s marvelous,\u201d she said, \u201cbut why did you carve the leopard in a cage?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s enchanted, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cI suppose, but\u2014\u201d \u201cI thought you\u2019d ask me why I\u2019m here.\u201d He paced to the dresser.</p><p>She\u2019d have to tell him soon, just not yet. Not while he seemed on the verge of flight. George set the caged leopard on her knees. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d She poked a finger through the bars and gently moved the leopard\u2019s necklace. \u201cI\u2019ll always be happy when you come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Harry was looking down at the carved animals.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d he murmured noncommittally. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve asked that question of myself: Why I keep coming back when I\u2019ve already said good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you have an answer for yourself?\u201d George held her breath, hoping.</p><p>\u201cNo. Except that I can\u2019t seem to stay away.\u201d \u201cMaybe that\u2019s your answer, then.\u201d \u201cNo. It\u2019s too simple.\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cA man should be able to lead his life, make his decisions, in a more reasoned way. I said I would leave you, and so I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She set the leopard on the little table beside her bed and propped her chin on her knees. \u201cBut then what are emotions for? The good Lord gave them to men just as much as he gave intellectual thought. Surely He meant us to use our feelings as well?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cEmotions shouldn\u2019t hold sway over reasoned thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d George asked softly. \u201cIf the Lord gave us both, then surely your emotion\u2014your love of me\u2014is just as important as what you think about our match. Perhaps it\u2019s more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it for you?\u201d Harry began to walk back to the bed. \u201cYes.\u201d George lifted her head. \u201cMy love for you is more important than the fears I might have of marriage or of letting a man have dominion over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fears are those, my lady?\u201d He had reached her bedside again. He stroked a finger down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat you might betray me with another woman.\u201d She leaned her cheek on his hand. \u201cThat we might eventually grow apart and even come to hate each other.\u201d She waited, but he didn\u2019t try to allay her worries. She sighed. \u201cMy own parents didn\u2019t have a happy marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor did mine.\u201d Harry sat on the bed to take off his boots. \u201cMy mother betrayed Da for years; perhaps for the whole of their marriage. Yet he forgave her again and again. Until he could forgive her no more.\u201d He removed his coat.</p><p>\u201cHe loved her,\u201d George said softly. \u201cYes, and it made him weak and eventually led to his death.\u201d</p><p>She could no more reassure him than he\u2019d been able to reassure her. She wouldn\u2019t ever betray him with another man; she knew that. But who was to say she wouldn\u2019t lead to his destruction in another way? Did loving her make Harry weak?</p><p>George studied the caged leopard. \u201cHe gets free, you know.\u201d</p><p>He paused in unbuttoning his waistcoat and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>She held up the carving. \u201cThe Leopard Prince. He\u2019s freed in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He shrugged off the waistcoat.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and said slowly, \u201cThe young king brought the Golden Eel to the father king, just as he had the other gifts. But the Golden Eel was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was ugly.\u201d Harry started on his shirt. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d George admitted. \u201cBut besides that, it could speak, and it was wise. When the father king got it alone, it said, \u2018Tush! That weakling no more stole me than the wind did. Listen now, tell the young king that the beautiful princess will only marry the man who wears the golden chain with the emerald crown on it. Then you will have the man who has done all these wonderful things. That man and no other shall be her bridegroom.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to suspect you are making parts of this fairy tale up, my lady.\u201d Harry tossed his shirt to a chair.</p><p>George held up her hand. \u201cOn my honor as a Maitland. This is exactly how Cook\u2019s aunt told it to me in the kitchen of my town house over tea and crumpets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against the headboard. \u201cSo the father king marched back to the young king and told him the Golden Eel\u2019s words. The young king smiled and said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s easy enough!\u2019 And he didn\u2019t even have to return home, for he\u2019d brought the Leopard Prince with him. He went to the Leopard Prince and said, \u2018Give me that chain that hangs about your neck.\u2019 \u201d She paused a moment to watch as Harry started to unbutton his breeches. \u201cAnd what do you think the Leopard Prince said?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cShove it up your\u201d\u2014he glanced at her\u2014\u201cnose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She frowned severely. \u201cNo one talks like that in fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they ought.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his mutter. \u201cThe Leopard Prince said, \u2018Impossible, my liege, for if I remove this chain, I will soon sicken and die.\u2019 The young king replied, \u2018Well, that\u2019s a pity, for I\u2019ve found you quite useful, but I need the chain now, so you must give it to me at once.\u2019 And so the Leopard Prince did.\u201d George looked at Harry, expecting a protest, a comment, something.</p><p>But he simply returned her gaze and removed his breeches. This made her temporarily forget where she was in the fairy tale. She watched as he sat on the bed beside her, quite nude.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he murmured. \u201cIs that it? The Leopard Prince dies and the young king marries the beautiful princess?\u201d</p><p>George reached up and untied the black ribbon holding his queue. She ran her fingers through his brown hair, spreading it on his shoulders. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Harry arched his eyebrows, but turned so his back was to her.</p><p>\u201cThe young king presented himself to the father king,\u201d George said quietly as she stroked her hands down his back, feeling the bumps of his spine. \u201cAnd the father king had to admit that he wore the chain described by the Golden Eel. Reluctantly, he sent for his daughter, the beautiful princess.\u201d She paused to dig her thumbs into the muscles that sloped up from his shoulders to his neck.</p><p>Harry let his head fall forward. \u201cAhhh.\u201d \u201cBut the beautiful princess took one look at the young king and started laughing. Naturally, all the courtiers and ladies and lords and the people who hang about a royal court just stared at the beautiful princess. They could not understand why she laughed.\u201d She worked her fingers into the muscles at the back of his head.</p><p>Harry groaned.</p><p>George leaned forward and whispered in his ear as she bore down on his shoulder muscles. \u201cFinally her father, the king, said, \u2018What causes such mirth, my daughter?\u2019 And the beautiful princess said, \u2018Why, the chain doesn\u2019t fit him!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can a chain not fit?\u201d Harry mumbled over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d George pushed his head back down. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It probably hung to his knees or something.\u201d She dug her thumbs into the hills along his spine. \u201cAnyway, the beautiful princess looked around the court and said, \u2018There. That is the man the chain belongs to.\u2019 And, of course, it was the Leopard Prince\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, she just picked him out of the crowd?\u201d He twisted out of her hands this time.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d George placed her hands on her hips. \u201cYes, she just picked him out of the crowd. He was an enchanted Leopard Prince, remember. I\u2019m sure he looked quite distinguished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was dying, you said.\u201d Harry was almost surly now. \u201cHe probably looked a right mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t after the beautiful princess put the chain back on him.\u201d George crossed her arms. Really. Men were quite unreasonable sometimes. \u201cHe got better right away, and the beautiful princess kissed him, and they were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably it was the kiss that revived him.\u201d Harry\u2019s mouth quirked. He leaned toward her. \u201cAnd was the spell broken? He never turned into a leopard again?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cCook\u2019s aunt didn\u2019t say. I would think so, wouldn\u2019t you? I mean, that is the usual thing in fairy tales, the spell is broken and they marry.\u201d</p><p>She was frowning thoughtfully and was consequently caught off guard when Harry lunged and captured her wrists. He pulled her hands above her head and loomed over her menacingly. \u201cBut perhaps the princess would have preferred that he remain a Leopard Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d George asked, batting her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u201d\u2014he nibbled at her neck\u2014\u201cit might have been more interesting on their wedding night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squirmed under the sensations he was arousing and stifled a giggle. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be bestiality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry took her wrists in one hand and used the other to whip off her covers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are mistaken in that, my lady.\u201d He flung up her shift, exposing her nude legs. She spread them invitingly, and he settled his hips there, making her gasp at the contact. \u201cBestiality,\u201d Harry murmured in her ear, \u201cis congress between a human and a common animal, such as a horse or bull or rooster. Sexual activity with a leopard, on the other hand, is merely exotic.\u201d He nudged his hips, burrowing the length of his penis between her folds and touching her just there.</p><p>George\u2019s eyes closed. \u201cA rooster?\u201d \u201cIn theory.\u201d He licked along her neck. \u201cBut how could a rooster\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He used his free hand to pinch her nipple.</p> <p>She moaned and arched beneath him, spreading her knees wider.</p><p>\u201cYou seem very interested in roosters,\u201d he purred. Harry rubbed his thumb over her nipple.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved his hips since that first time. George tried to bump hers up to encourage him, but his full weight lay heavily on her, and she realized he wasn\u2019t going to move until he wanted to. \u201cActually, you could say I\u2019m more interested in one cock in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d He raised his head, and she could see the censorious frown on his lips. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I do not approve of such language.\u201d</p><p>She felt a gush of erotic desire. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She lowered her eyelashes demurely. \u201cWhatever can I do to win your approval?\u201d</p> <p>There was silence.</p><p>George began to wonder if she had overstepped some boundary. But then she glanced up and saw Harry trying to repress a smile.</p><p>He bent his head until they were nose-to-nose. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy to get in my good graces again.\u201d He flicked her nipple with a fingernail.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Almost casually he tugged the ribbon on her chemise and pulled it down. He cupped her breast in his hand. His palm felt incredibly hot. \u201cYou will have to work very hard.\u201d He flexed his hips, sliding between her folds.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Harry stopped moving. \u201cMy lady?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d George muttered irritably. She nudged up, but he wouldn\u2019t move.</p> <p>\u201cPay attention.\u201d He pinched her nipple again. \u201cI am.\u201d She opened her eyes wide to prove it.</p><p>He moved again. Agonizingly slow. She could feel the head of his erection slipping down, almost to her entrance and then back up to kiss her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cYou want to win my approval,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYes.\u201d She would have agreed to just about anything he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>She had an inspiration. \u201cBy pleasing you, sir?\u201d</p><p>He appeared to give that serious thought. All the while, his cock rubbed against her and his hand fondled her breast. \u201cWell, yes, that might be one way to do it. Are you sure that\u2019s the way you want to choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d George nodded fervently. \u201cAnd how will you please me?\u201d His voice had lowered to that deep tone that meant he was very aroused.</p><p>\u201cBy tupping you, sir?\u201d</p> <p>Harry froze. She was afraid for a moment that she might have shocked him.</p><p>Then he lifted his hips. \u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d And he thrust himself into her, hard and fast.</p><p>She felt a scream building in her throat as he pounded her into the mattress, all trace of playfulness wiped from his face. She wrapped her legs high over his hips, digging her heels into his buttocks. He\u2019d let go of her wrists, and she dragged his head down by his hair to kiss him. Deeply. Ravenously. Desperately.</p><p>Please, please, dear Lord, don\u2019t let this be the last time.</p><p>He was relentless, and she could feel the explosion building within her, but she held it off, forcing open her eyes. It was important that she see him, that they be together at the end. His face was shining with sweat, his nostrils flared. As she watched, his rhythm broke. She let go of his hair to clutch at his shoulders, her entire being focused on keeping him within her.</p><p>And she felt it, at the end.</p><p>He reared back, his hips still locked with hers. She could feel his cock jump within her. Feel the spurt and warmth of his seed filling her. She arched her head and gave herself over to the waves of her own release, creaming and flooding with his. It was magnificent, like no other thing she had ever felt, having Harry spend in her body. Tears ran down her temples into her tangled hair. How could she ever let him go after this?</p><p>Harry suddenly shifted and tried to withdraw. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d George placed her fingers against his mouth, silencing his apology. \u201cI\u2019m increasing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The word increasing seemed to echo around Lady Georgina\u2019s room, bouncing off the china-blue walls and dainty lace bed curtains. For a moment, Harry thought she meant that he\u2019d made her pregnant just now when he\u2019d filled her with his seed. When he\u2019d been seduced by the force of his orgasm and the accompanying surge of his feelings for her.</p><p>Love for his Lady Georgina.</p><p>Even knowing he had to withdraw, he\u2019d simply been unable to resist the moment. Unable to resist the woman.</p><p>Then sense returned. He rolled off Lady Georgina and stared at her. She was pregnant. He felt a spurt of ridiculous anger, hurt, that all his self-debate and worry didn\u2019t in the end even matter.</p><p>She was pregnant.</p><p>He\u2019d have to marry her. Whether or not he wanted to marry her. Whether he could bring himself to let go and trust in their love. Whether he was able to fit himself into her life, so far out of his experience. All of that was beside the point now. Put simply, it was no longer of any importance. He\u2019d been trapped by his own seed and a woman\u2019s body. He almost felt like laughing. That least-smart part of himself had made the decision for him.</p><p>Harry realized that he\u2019d been staring at his lady far too long. Her hopeful expression had closed into one more guarded. He opened his mouth to reassure her when he caught a flicker from the corner of his eye. He raised his head. Yellow and orange lights danced at the window.</p><p>He stood up and strode to the window. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lady Georgina called from behind him. In the distance, a pyramid of light lit the night, glowing like something out of hell itself.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d He felt Lady Georgina\u2019s fingers on his bare shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranville House is burning.\u201d Bennet. Panic, pure and instinctual, flooded his veins.</p><p>Lady Georgina gasped. \u201cOh, my dear Lord.\u201d</p><p>Harry whirled and caught his shirt, flinging it on. \u201cI need to go. See if I can help in any way.\u201d Was Bennet asleep in his father\u2019s house tonight?</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She bent to pick up his breeches. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He snatched the breeches from her hand and tried to control his voice. \u201cNo. You must stay here.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina frowned in that stubborn way of hers. He didn\u2019t have time for this. Bennet needed him now. \u201cBut I\u2014\u201d she began. \u201cListen to me.\u201d Harry finished tucking in his shirt and grabbed his lady\u2019s upper arms. \u201cI want you to do as I tell you. Granville is dangerous. He doesn\u2019t like you. I saw the look he gave you when you took me from his tender care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you\u2019ll need me.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t listening to his words. She thought herself invincible, his beautiful lady, and she was simply going to do as she pleased. Regardless of what he thought. Regardless of Granville. Regardless of the danger to herself and the babe.</p><p>Harry felt fear build to an unbearable level inside him. \u201cI don\u2019t need you there.\u201d He shook her. \u201cYou\u2019ll only get in the way. You might get yourself killed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you are worried, Harry, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Would she never give up? \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d He frantically looked around for his boots. \u201cI can\u2019t fight the fire and you at the same time. Stay here!\u201d</p><p>There they were, half under the bedskirts. He pulled his boots out and stamped them on, then snatched up his coat and waistcoat. He ran to the door. No use going out the window again\u2014all of England would know soon enough that he\u2019d been in his lady\u2019s bed.</p><p>He twisted at the door to repeat, \u201cStay here!\u201d</p><p>On his last glimpse of her, Lady Georgina seemed to be pouting.</p><p>He thundered down the stairs, pulling on his coat. He would have to do a lot of apologizing when he returned, but he didn\u2019t have time to think of that now. His brother needed him. He dashed to the front door, waking a sleeping footman as he passed, and then he was out in the night. Gravel crunched beneath his boots. He ran around the corner of Woldsly. He\u2019d tied the mare not far from his lady\u2019s window.</p><p>Come on. Come on.</p><p>The mare was standing in the shadows, dozing. He vaulted into the saddle, startling the horse. He kicked her into a gallop, rounding the manor. By the time they hit the drive, the mare was going flat out. Here in the open, the fire seemed to loom larger in the sky. Even from this distance, he could see the flames leaping into heaven. He thought he smelled the smoke. It looked huge. Was the whole of Granville House engulfed? The mare reached the road and he slowed just enough to make sure there were no obstacles ahead. If Bennet and Will had been inside asleep...</p><p>Harry shook the thought away. He would not think until he reached Granville House and saw the damage.</p><p>Past the stream, lights glowed in the cottages dotting the hills. The farmers who lived and worked on Granville land were awake and must know of the blaze. But strangely he met no one else hurrying to the fire. Had they gone on ahead or were they huddled inside their cottages, pretending they didn\u2019t see? He topped the rise before the Granville gates, and the wind blew smoke and dancing ashes in his face. The mare was flecked with foam, but he urged her on down the drive.</p><p>And then he saw. The blaze had enveloped the stables, but Granville House was yet untouched.</p><p>The mare reared at the sight of the fire. Harry fought her down and forced her closer. As they neared, he could hear the shouting of men and the dreadful roar of the flames consuming the stables. Granville prided himself on his horseflesh, and he probably had twenty or more horses stabled here.</p><p>Only two horses were outside the stables.</p><p>Harry clattered into the yard, unnoticed by the lord or his servants. Men milled, half-dressed, seemingly in a daze. Their blackened faces were weirdly lit by the flames, the whites of eyes and teeth reflecting the glow. A few had formed a line and threw puny buckets of water on the inferno, merely making the monster more angry. In the middle of it all, Silas Granville was a figure out of hell. In his nightshirt, his bare legs sticking out of buckle shoes, his gray hair standing wildly on end, he surged around the courtyard, shaking his fists.</p><p>\u201cGet him! Get him!\u201d Granville cuffed a man, sending him sprawling to the cobblestones. \u201cGoddamn all of you! I\u2019ll see you run out of my lands! I\u2019ll see you hung, you filthy curs! Someone get my son!\u201d</p><p>Only on the last word did Harry realize a man was trapped in the inferno. He stared at the burning stables. The flames licked hungrily at the walls. Was it Thomas or Bennet?</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d</p><p>Somehow, over the roaring and shouting, he heard the thin wail. He swung in its direction and saw Will, held physically off the ground by a burly footman. The boy struggled and fought, his gaze fixed on the flames all the while. \u201cNooo!\u201d</p><p>It was Bennet in there.</p><p>Harry jumped from his horse and ran to the line of men hauling water. He grabbed a full bucket and up ended it over his own head, gasping as the cold water slapped him.</p><p>\u201cOy!\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>Harry ignored the shout and plunged into the stable.</p><p>It was like diving into the sun. The heat embraced and overwhelmed him, pulling him greedily down. The water in his hair and clothes hissed as it turned to steam. A black wall of smoke blocked his way. Around him, horses screamed their fear. He smelled ashes and, horribly, burning flesh. And everywhere, over all the rest, the awful flames eating the stable and everything within. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBennet!\u201d He had the breath for one bellow.</p><p>His second breath brought ashes and burning heat into his lungs. Harry choked, unable to speak. He pulled his damp shirt up and covered his nose and mouth, but it made little difference. He stumbled forward like a drunkard, desperately feeling with his hands. How long could a man live without air? His foot struck something. Unable to see, he fell forward. He landed on a body, felt hair.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d A ghastly rasp. Bennet.</p><p>Harry searched quickly with his hands. He\u2019d found Bennet. And another man.</p> <p>\u201cHave to get him out.\u201d Bennet was on his knees, struggling to pull the man, moving the dead weight only an inch or two.</p><p>Nearer the floor, the air was a little better. Harry gasped, taking in a lungful, and grabbed one of the unconscious man\u2019s arms. He heaved. His chest burned and his back ached as if the muscles were tearing. Bennet had the man\u2019s other arm, but he\u2019d obviously reached the end of his rope. He pulled only feebly. Harry hoped, prayed, that they moved in the direction of the stable door, that he\u2019d not gotten turned around in the smoke and screaming and ashes and death. If they went in the wrong direction, they would die here. Their bodies would be so thoroughly burned that no one would know which man was which.</p><p>My lady needs me. He grit his teeth and pulled against the agony in his arms.</p><p>I will be a father soon. His foot caught and he staggered, but kept himself upright.</p><p>My child will need me. He could hear Bennet sobbing behind him, whether from the smoke or from fear, he didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Please, God, they both need me. Let me live.</p><p>And Harry saw it: the stable door. He gave an inarticulate shout and coughed convulsively. One last, terrible heave and they were through the stable doors. The cool night air embraced them like the kiss of a mother. Harry staggered, still clutching the unconscious man. Then other men were there, shouting and helping them away from the flames. He fell to the cobblestones, Bennet beside him. He felt small fingers on his face.</p><p>He opened his eyes to see Will in front of him. \u201cHarry, you came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did.\u201d He laughed and then started coughing, hugging the wiggling boy to himself. Someone brought a cup of water, and he sipped at it gratefully. He turned to Bennet, a smile on his face.</p><p>Bennet still wept. He coughed convulsively and clutched the unconscious man in his arms.</p><p>Harry frowned. \u201cWho\u2014?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Thomas,\u201d Will said in his ear. \u201cHe went into the stables when he saw the fire. Because of the horses. But he didn\u2019t come out, and Bennet ran in after him.\u201d The boy patted Harry\u2019s face again. \u201cHe made me stay with that man. I thought he\u2019d never come out again. And then you went in, too.\u201d Will wrapped his thin arms around Harry\u2019s neck, nearly throttling him.</p> <p>Harry gently pried loose the boy\u2019s arms and looked at the man they\u2019d pulled from the stable. Half his face was blistered and red, the hair singed black and short on that side. But the other half was recognizable as Bennet\u2019s older brother. Harry held the side of his hand beneath Thomas\u2019s nose. Then he moved his fingers to the man\u2019s neck.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He touched Bennet\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Bennet rasped in an awful voice. \u201cNo. He grasped my hand inside. He was alive then.\u201d He raised red-rimmed eyes. \u201cWe pulled him out, Harry. We saved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Harry felt helpless. \u201cYou!\u201d Granville\u2019s roar came from behind them. Harry jumped to his feet, fists clenched. \u201cHarry Pye, you goddamn criminal, you started this fire! Arrest him! I\u2019ll see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved my life, Father,\u201d Bennet choked out. \u201cLeave Harry alone. You know as well as I that he didn\u2019t set the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of the sort.\u201d Granville advanced menacingly.</p><p>Harry took out his knife and sank into a fighting crouch.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake. Thomas is dead,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cWhat?\u201d Granville looked for the first time at his eldest son, lying by his feet. \u201cDead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bennet said bitterly. \u201cHe went in after your damn horses and died.\u201d</p><p>Granville scowled. \u201cI never told him to go in there. Stupid thing to do, just like everything else he\u2019s ever done. Foolish and pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Bennet whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s still warm. He breathed his last only minutes ago, and you\u2019re already demeaning him.\u201d He glared up at his father. \u201cThey were your horses. He probably ran in there to win your approval, and you can\u2019t even give him that after death.\u201d Bennet laid Thomas\u2019s head down on the hard cobblestones and rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, too, for going in after him,\u201d Granville sputtered.</p><p>For a moment Harry thought Bennet would hit his father. \u201cYou\u2019re not even human, are you?\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>Granville frowned as if he hadn\u2019t heard, and maybe he hadn\u2019t. His son\u2019s voice was nearly ruined.</p><p>Bennet turned away nevertheless. \u201cDid you talk to Dick Crumb?\u201d he asked Harry in a voice so low no one else could hear. \u201cI don\u2019t think Thomas set this fire and then ran into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cI went to the Cock and Worm earlier, but he never showed.\u201d</p><p>Bennet\u2019s face was grim. \u201cThen let\u2019s go find him now.\u201d Harry nodded. There was no longer any way to put it off. If Dick Crumb had set this fire, he would hang for it.</p><p>GEORGE WATCHED THE DAWN BREAK with resignation. Harry had said he didn\u2019t need her, and he had not returned last night.</p><p>The message was quite clear.</p><p>Oh, she knew he\u2019d spoken in haste, that when Harry had said, I don\u2019t need you, he\u2019d feared Lord Granville might harm her. But she couldn\u2019t help feeling that he had spoken a hidden truth in that moment of frantic hurry. Harry guarded his words so well, was always so careful not to offend her. Would he ever have told her that he just didn\u2019t want to be with her had he not been driven to it?</p><p>She turned the little carved leopard in her hands. He looked back at her, his eyes blank inside his cage. Did Harry see himself in the animal? She hadn\u2019t meant to cage Harry; she\u2019d only wanted to love him. But no matter how she wished, she could not change the fact that she was an aristocrat and Harry a commoner. The very circumstance of their disparate ranks seemed to be the basis of Harry\u2019s anguish. And that would never change.</p><p>She rose carefully from her bed, hesitating when her stomach gave an unpleasant roll.</p><p>\u201cMy lady!\u201d Tiggle burst into the bedroom.</p><p>George looked up, startled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cMr. Thomas Granville is dead.\u201d \u201cGood Lord.\u201d George sat back down on the edge of the bed. She had almost forgotten the fire in her misery.</p><p>\u201cThe Granville stables burned last night,\u201d Tiggle continued, oblivious to her mistress\u2019s consternation. \u201cThey say it was set afire on purpose. And Mr. Thomas Granville ran in to save the horses, but he didn\u2019t come out. Then Mr. Bennet Granville went in despite his father\u2019s pleas not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Bennet killed as well?\u201d \u201cNo, my lady.\u201d Tiggle shook her head, dislodging a pin. \u201cBut he was inside so long that everyone thought them both dead. And then Mr. Pye rode up. He ran inside right away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d George leaped to her feet in terror. The room spun about her sickeningly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, my lady.\u201d Tiggle caught her before George could run to the door. Or fall down. \u201cHe\u2019s all right. Mr. Pye is fine.\u201d</p><p>George slumped with a hand over her heart. Her stomach was backing up into her throat. \u201cTiggle, for shame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. But Mr. Pye, he pulled them both out, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bennet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved Bennet, then?\u201d George closed her eyes and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. After what Lord Granville did to Mr. Pye, no one could believe it. Mr. Pye, would have saved them both, but Mr. Thomas was already dead. Burned fearfully, he was.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s stomach lurched at the thought. \u201cPoor Bennet. To lose a brother in such a manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it must have been bad for Mr. Bennet. They say he held his brother\u2019s body as if he\u2019d never let go. But that Lord Granville didn\u2019t turn a hair. Hardly looked at his dead son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Granville must be mad.\u201d George closed her eyes and shuddered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some who think so, indeed.\u201d Tiggle frowned down at her. \u201cGracious, my lady, you\u2019re that pale. What you need is a nice cup of hot tea.\u201d She bustled to the door.</p><p>George lay back down, closing her eyes. Maybe if she was very still for a bit...</p><p>Tiggle returned, her heels tapping across the wood floor. \u201cI thought that pale green gown would look very good when Mr. Pye comes to call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear the brown print.\u201d \u201cBut my lady.\u201d Tiggle sounded scandalized. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not the thing to see a gentleman in. At least not a special gentleman. Why, after last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>George swallowed and tried to summon the strength to battle her lady\u2019s maid. \u201cI won\u2019t be seeing Mr. Pye again. We\u2019ll be leaving for London today.\u201d</p><p>Tiggle drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>George\u2019s stomach gurgled. She braced herself. \u201cMy lady,\u201d Tiggle said, \u201cjust about every servant in this house knows who came to call last night in your private rooms. And then the brave thing he did at Granville House! The younger maids have been sighing over Mr. Pye all morning, and the only reason the older maids aren\u2019t sighing as well is the look in Mr. Greaves\u2019s eyes. You cannot leave Mr. Pye.\u201d</p><p>The whole world was against her. George felt a wave of self-pity and nausea well up in her. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving him. We\u2019ve simply come to an agreement that we\u2019re better off apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m sorry, my lady. I don\u2019t usually speak my mind,\u201d Tiggle said with apparent sincerity, \u201cbut that man loves you. He\u2019s a good man, Harry Pye is. He\u2019ll make a good husband. And you\u2019re carrying his babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d George belched ominously. \u201cMr. Pye may love me, but he doesn\u2019t want to. Please, Tiggle. I can\u2019t remain, hoping and clinging to him.\u201d She opened her eyes wide in desperation. \u201cCan\u2019t you see? He\u2019ll marry me out of honor or pity and he\u2019ll spend the rest of his life hating me. I must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Tiggle said. \u201cI think you\u2019re making a mistake, but I\u2019ll pack to leave if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s what I want,\u201d George said.</p><p>And promptly threw up into the chamber pot.</p><p>THE SUN HAD LIT THE morning sky for more than an hour by the time Harry and Bennet rode up to the small, dilapidated cottage. They\u2019d spent most of the night waiting at the Cock and Worm, even though Harry had suspected it was useless within the first half hour.</p><p>They\u2019d first made sure of Will\u2019s safety by taking the sleepy boy to Mistress Humboldt\u2019s cottage. Despite the unholy hour, that lady had been glad to have the boy and they\u2019d left him contentedly stuffing his face with muffins. Then they\u2019d ridden to the Cock and Worm.</p><p>Dick Crumb and his sister both lived above the tavern in low-ceilinged rooms that were surprisingly tidy. Searching the rooms, his head grazing the lintels, Harry had thought that Dick must have to continuously stoop in his own house. Of course, neither Dick nor Janie had been there; in fact, the tavern had never opened that night, much to the disgust of several yokels hanging about the door. Dick and Janie had so few possessions, it was hard to tell if anything had been removed from the rooms. But Harry didn\u2019t think they\u2019d taken anything. That was odd. Surely if Dick had decided to run with his sister, he would have taken at least Janie\u2019s things? But her few clothes\u2014an extra dress, some chemises, and a pathetic pair of stockings riddled with holes\u2014still hung from the pegs in her room beneath the eaves. There was even a small leather pouch with several silver coins hidden under Dick\u2019s thin mattress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, thinking the tavern keeper would come back for the money if nothing else, Harry and Bennet had lurked in the dark tavern. They had coughed and spit up black phlegm once or twice, but they hadn\u2019t talked. Thomas\u2019s death had stunned Bennet. He stared into space, his eyes far, far away. And Harry had considered his future life with a wife and a child and a whole new way of living.</p><p>As the dawn gave light to the dim room and it became evident that Dick wasn\u2019t going to show up, Harry remembered the cottage. The Crumb cottage, the hovel where Dick and his sister had been raised, had long ago fallen into ruin. But maybe Dick might use it as temporary shelter? Far more likely he was in the next county by now, but they might as well check it.</p><p>Now as they neared, the cottage looked deserted. The thatched roof had mostly fallen in, and one wall was crumbled, leaving the chimney pointing nakedly to the sky. They dismounted and Harry\u2019s boots sank into mud, no doubt the reason for the cottage having been abandoned. The river behind the tiny house spread over her banks here, making a marshy area. Every spring the cottage probably flooded. It was an unhealthy place to live. Harry couldn\u2019t think why anyone would build here.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if we should even try the door,\u201d he said. They looked at the door, tilting inward under a leaning lintel.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s check around back,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>Harry walked as quietly as he could in the mud, but his boots made a squishing sound as the muck sucked at them with each step. If Dick was here, he was already warned.</p><p>He was in the lead when he rounded the corner and stopped short. Plants as tall as a man grew in the boggy ground behind the cottage. They had delicate, branching fronds, and some still bore flat seed heads.</p><p>Water hemlock. \u201cJesus,\u201d Bennet breathed. He\u2019d come around Harry, but it wasn\u2019t the plants he looked at.</p><p>Harry followed the direction of his gaze and saw that the entire back wall of the cottage was gone. From one of the remaining rafters a rope was tied and a pathetic bundle dangled at its end.</p> <p>Janie Crumb had hung herself.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know what she was doing.\u201d Dick Crumb sat with his back against the decayed stone of the cottage. He still wore his stained tavern apron, and one hand clutched a crumpled handkerchief.</p><p>Harry looked at Janie\u2019s body, swaying only feet away from where her brother sat. Her neck was grotesquely elongated, and her blackened tongue protruded from swollen lips.</p><p>Nothing could be done for Janie Crumb now. \u201cShe was never right, poor lass, not after what he did to her,\u201d Dick continued.</p><p>How long had he been sitting there? \u201cShe used to slip away at night. Wander the fields. Maybe do other things I didn\u2019t want to know about.\u201d Dick shook his head. \u201cIt took me a while to realize she might be up to something else. And then Mistress Pollard died.\u201d Dick looked up. His eyes were bloodshot, his eyelids reddened. \u201cShe came in after they took you, Harry. She was wild, her hair all flying away. Said she hadn\u2019t done it. Hadn\u2019t killed Mistress Pollard like she killed the sheep. Was calling Lord Granville the devil and cursing him.\u201d The big man knit his brows like a puzzled little boy. \u201cShe said Lord Granville killed old woman Pollard. Janie was crazy. Just plum crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Dick Crumb nodded, as if relieved by his agreement. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. She was my little sister, crazy or no.\u201d He wiped the dome of his head with a shaking hand. \u201cThe only family I had left. My baby sister. I loved her, Harry!\u201d</p><p>The body on the rope seemed to twist in horrible reply. \u201cSo I did nothing. And last night, when I heard that she\u2019d fired the Granville stables, I came a running down here. The old place had always been her hidey-hole. Don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done. Only I found her like this.\u201d He threw his hands out to the corpse as if in prayer. \u201cLike this. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The big man began to cry, great heaving sobs that shook his shoulders.</p><p>Harry looked away. What could one do in the face of such overwhelming grief?</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to apologize, Mr. Crumb,\u201d Bennet spoke from beside Harry.</p><p>Dick raised his head. Snot shone beneath his nose. \u201cThe blame lies with my father, not you.\u201d Bennet nodded curtly and walked back around the cottage.</p><p>Harry took out his knife. Dragging a chair over beneath the corpse, he climbed up and cut the rope. Janie slumped, suddenly freed from her self-imposed punishment. He caught the body and gently lowered her to the ground. As he did so, he felt something small and hard fall out of Janie\u2019s pocket. He bent to look and saw one of his own carvings: a duck. Quickly, he palmed the little bird. Had Janie been placing his carvings at the poisonings all along? Why? Had she meant to set him against Granville? Perhaps she\u2019d seen Harry as her instrument of revenge. Harry darted a glance at Dick, but the older man was simply staring into the face of his dead sister. It would only grieve Dick further to tell him Janie had meant for Harry to take the blame for her crimes. Harry pocketed the duck.</p><p>\u201cTa, Harry,\u201d Dick said. He took off his apron and covered his sister\u2019s distorted face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Harry laid his hand on the other man\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Dick nodded, grief overtaking him again.</p><p>Harry turned to join Bennet. The last sight he had of Dick Crumb was the big man bending, a mountain of sorrow, over the slight form of his sister\u2019s body.</p><p>Behind them, the water hemlocks danced gracefully.</p><p>\u201cTHERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN a lot of traveling of late,\u201d Euphie murmured, smiling benignly around the carriage. \u201cBack and forth between Yorkshire and London. Why, it seems that everyone barely draws breath before they rush off again. I don\u2019t believe I remember so much coming and going since, well, since ever.\u201d</p><p>Violet sighed, shook her head slightly, and gazed out the window. Tiggle, sitting with Violet, looked puzzled. And George, scrunched next to Euphie on the same seat, closed her eyes and gripped the tin basin she\u2019d brought along just in case. I will not cast up. I will not cast up. I will not cast up.</p><p>The carriage lurched around the corner, jostling her against the rain-streaked window. She decided abruptly that her stomach was better with her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Violet huffed, and folded her arms. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to marry, anyway, I simply do not see what is wrong with Mr. Pye. He likes you, after all. I\u2019m sure we can help him if he has trouble with his Hs.\u201d</p><p>His Hs? \u201cYou were the one who thought he was a sheep murderer.\u201d She was getting tired of the almost universal disapproval aimed at her head.</p><p>One would think Harry a veritable saint from the shocked reaction of her servants at her decampment. Even Greaves had stood on the Woldsly steps, the rain trickling off his long nose, staring mournfully at her as she climbed into the carriage.</p><p>\u201cThat was before,\u201d Violet said with unarguable logic. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought him the poisoner for at least three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord.\u201d \u201cMy lady,\u201d Euphie exclaimed. \u201cWe should, as gentle-women, never take the good Lord\u2019s name in vain. I am sure it was a mistake on your part.\u201d</p><p>Violet stared at Euphie in exaggerated astonishment while beside her Tiggle rolled her eyes. George sighed and rested her head on the cushions.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, Mr. Pye is quite handsome.\u201d Violet wasn\u2019t going to let go of this argument. Ever. \u201cFor a land steward. You aren\u2019t likely to find a nicer one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLand steward or husband?\u201d George asked nastily. \u201cAre you contemplating marriage, my lady?\u201d Euphie inquired. Her eyes opened wide, like an interested pigeon.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d George said.</p><p>Which was almost drowned out by Violet\u2019s \u201cYes!\u201d Euphie blinked rapidly. \u201cMarriage is a hallowed state, becoming to even the most respectable of ladies. Of course, I myself have never experienced that heavenly communion with a gentleman, but that is not to say that I do not wholeheartedly endorse its rites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to marry someone,\u201d Violet said. She gestured crassly toward George\u2019s abdomen. \u201cUnless you intend to take a protracted tour of the continent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroadening the mind by travel\u2014\u201d Euphie started. \u201cI have no intention of touring the continent.\u201d George cut Euphie off before she could gather wind and babble about traveling until they reached London. \u201cPerhaps I could marry Cecil Barclay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecil!\u201d Violet gaped at her sister as if she\u2019d announced her intention of wedding a codfish. One would think Violet would be a little more sympathetic, considering her own near predicament. \u201cHave you gone raving mad? You\u2019ll trample Cecil as if he were a fluffy bunny rabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d George swallowed and pressed her hand to her belly. \u201cYou make me sound like a harpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you mention it...\u201d</p><p>George narrowed her eyes. \u201cMr. Pye is quiet, but at least he never backed down from you.\u201d Violet\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHave you considered what he\u2019ll do when he finds out you\u2019ve run away from him? It\u2019s the silent ones who have the worst tempers, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you get these melodramatic ideas. And besides, I haven\u2019t run away.\u201d George ignored her sister, pointedly glancing around the carriage, which was presently bumping out of Yorkshire. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think he will do anything.\u201d Her stomach rolled at the thought of Harry finding her gone.</p><p>Violet looked doubtful. \u201cMr. Pye didn\u2019t strike me as the kind of man to just sit back and let his woman find another man to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not Mr. Pye\u2019s woman.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure what else you would call it\u2014\u201d \u201cViolet!\u201d George clutched the tin basin under her chin. I will not cast up. I will not cast up. I will no\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling quite the thing, my lady?\u201d Euphie piped. \u201cWhy, you look almost green. Do you know, your mother bore that exact same face when she was\u201d\u2014the companion leaned forward and hissed as if a gentleman might somehow hear her inside the moving carriage\u2014\u201cincreasing with Lady Violet.\u201d Euphie sat back and blushed a bright pink. \u201cBut of course that can\u2019t be your problem.\u201d</p><p>Violet stared at Euphie as if mesmerized.</p><p>Tiggle buried her face in her hands.</p><p>And George groaned. She was going to die before she made it to London.</p><p>\u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE\u2019S GONE?\u201d Harry tried to keep his voice even. He stood in the front hall of Woldsly. He\u2019d come here to see his lady, only to have the butler tell him that she\u2019d left over an hour ago.</p><p>Greaves backed up a step. \u201cExactly that, Mr. Pye.\u201d The butler cleared his throat. \u201cLady Georgina accompanied by Lady Violet and Miss Hope left quite early this morning for London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say.\u201d Had she received urgent news about a relative, maybe one of her brothers?</p><p>\u201cMr. Pye.\u201d The butler drew himself up in offense. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very hard night, Mr. Greaves.\u201d And a harder morning. Harry passed a hand over his aching forehead. \u201cWas a letter brought to my lady? Or a rider? Did a rider come bearing some kind of news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not that it is any concern of yours, Mr. Pye.\u201d Greaves stared down his thin nose. \u201cNow, if I may show you the door?\u201d</p><p>Harry took two quick steps and grabbed the butler by the shirtfront. One step more and he slammed the man against the wall, cracking the plaster. \u201cAs it happens, what my lady does is my concern.\u201d Harry leaned close enough to smell the powder on Greaves\u2019s wig. \u201cShe\u2019s carrying my child and will soon be my wife. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>The butler nodded, sending a fine dusting of powder onto his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Harry released the other man.</p><p>What would make her leave so suddenly? Frowning, he took the curving main stairs two at a time and headed down the long hall to his lady\u2019s room. Had he missed something? Said the wrong thing? The problem with women was that it could be damn near anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry threw open the bedroom door, scaring a maid cleaning out the hearth. He strode to Lady Georgina\u2019s vanity table. The top had been cleared. He opened drawers and flung them shut just as fast. They were empty save for a few hairpins and a forgotten handkerchief. The maid scurried from the room. Harry straightened from the vanity and surveyed the room. The wardrobe doors stood ajar and empty. A lone candlestick sat on the table by her bed. The bed itself had already been stripped. There wasn\u2019t anything to indicate where she\u2019d gone.</p><p>He quit the room and ran back down the stairs, knowing the servants were aware of his movements. He knew he must seem a madman, racing about the manor and claiming the daughter of an earl as his bride. Well, damn them all to hell. He wasn\u2019t backing down. She was the one who had brought it this far. She\u2019d laid down the gauntlet and then run for it. This time around he wasn\u2019t going to wait for her to come to her senses. Who knew how long it would take her to get over whatever snit she\u2019d gotten herself into? He might be a commoner, he might be poor, but by God, he was going to be Lady Georgina\u2019s husband, and his wife needed to learn that she couldn\u2019t just light out every time she got a bee in her bonnet.</p><p>Harry mounted the poor mare, already half asleep, and turned her in the direction of his own little cottage. He\u2019d pack the barest essentials. If he was fast, he might catch her before Lincoln.</p><p>Five minutes later, he opened the door to his cottage, thinking about what to bring, but all thought stopped when he saw the table. The leopard stood on it. Harry picked up the carved animal. It was exactly the same as the last time he\u2019d seen it in her palm. Except that it was no longer in a cage.</p> <p>She\u2019d set the leopard free.</p><p>He stared at the wooden creature in his hands for a minute, rubbing his thumb over the smooth back he\u2019d so carefully whittled. Then he looked at the table again. There was a note. He picked it up with a shaking hand.</p><p>My Dear Harry,</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I never meant to cage you. I see now that it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to force myself on you. I\u2019ll take care of matters myself. Enclosed is something I had drawn up when last in London.</p><p>\u2014Georgina</p> <p>The second paper was a legal document. Lady Georgina had given him the Woldsly estate.</p><p>No.</p><p>Harry reread the fine script. The document remained the same.</p><p>No. No. No. He crumpled the paper in his fist. Did she hate him that much? Hate him enough to give up part of her inheritance to get him out of her life? He sank into a chair and stared at the balled scrap in his hand. Perhaps she\u2019d finally come to her senses. Finally realized how very far beneath her he lay. If so, there would be no redemption for him. He laughed, but it came out more a sob, even to his own ears. He\u2019d spent the last weeks pushing Lady Georgina away, but even as he\u2019d done so, he\u2019d known.</p><p>She was the one.</p><p>The one and only lady for him in this lifetime. If she left him, there would be no other. And he\u2019d thought that was fine. His life had been adequate up until now, hadn\u2019t it? He could continue without her. But somehow in the last weeks she had burrowed into his life. Into him. And the things she had offered him so casually, a wife and family, a home, those things had become like meat and wine put before a man who had eaten only bread and water his entire life.</p> <p>Vital.</p><p>Harry looked down at the crushed piece of paper and realized that he was afraid. Afraid he couldn\u2019t make this right. Afraid he\u2019d never be whole again.</p><p>Afraid he\u2019d lost his lady and their child.</p><p>TWO HORSES.</p><p>Silas snorted and kicked a still-smoldering beam. Two horses out of a stable of nine and twenty. Even Thomas\u2019s last act had been a piss-poor one; he\u2019d managed to save only the pair of nags before succumbing to the flames. The air was thick with the stench of burned meat. Some of the men pulling out the carcasses were gagging, despite the scarves they wore over their mouths. Like little girls they were, whining over the stink and filth.</p><p>Silas looked at the remains of the great Granville stables. A heap of smoking debris now. All because of a deranged woman, so Bennet said. A pity she\u2019d taken her own life. It would\u2019ve set a nice example for the local peasants had she been fodder for the hangman. But in the end, perhaps he would\u2019ve thanked the crazy wench. She\u2019d murdered his elder son, which made Bennet his heir now. No more jaunting off to London for that young man. As the heir, he would have to stay at Granville House and learn how to run the estates. Silas curled his upper lip back in a grin. He had Bennet now. The boy might buck and paw, but he knew his duty. The heir to Granville must oversee the estates.</p><p>A rider clattered into the yard. Silas nearly choked when he saw who it was. \u201cGet out! Get out, you young cur!\u201d How dare Harry Pye just dance onto Granville land? Silas started for the horse and rider.</p><p>Pye dismounted his horse without even looking in his direction. \u201cOut of my way, old man.\u201d He started for the house.</p> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d Fury clogged Silas\u2019s throat. He turned to the gawking workmen. \u201cSeize him! Throw him off my land, damn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Pye spoke softly behind him.</p><p>Several of the men backed up, the cowards. Silas turned and saw that Pye had a long, thin knife in his left hand.</p><p>The bounder pivoted in his direction. \u201cHow about acting for yourself, Granville?\u201d</p><p>Silas stood still, clenching and unclenching his fists. Had he been twenty years younger, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. His chest burned.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Pye sneered. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind if I have a word with your son.\u201d He ran up the steps to Granville House and disappeared inside.</p><p>Filthy, common lout. Silas backhanded the servant nearest him. The man was caught off guard and went down. The other workmen stared at their fellow wallowing in the stable yard muck. One offered his hand to the man on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all sacked after this day\u2019s work,\u201d Silas said, and didn\u2019t wait to hear the grumbling behind him.</p><p>He mounted his own stairs, rubbing at the fire in his chest. He\u2019d throw the bastard out himself if it killed him. He didn\u2019t have far to go. Entering the great hall, he could hear men\u2019s voices coming from the front room where Thomas\u2019s body had been laid out.</p><p>Silas swung the door open, banging it against the wall. Pye and Bennet looked up from where they stood near the table bearing Thomas\u2019s charred corpse. Bennet deliberately turned away from his father. \u201cI can go with you, but I\u2019ll have to see Thomas properly buried first.\u201d His voice was a whispered rasp from the fire.</p><p>\u201cOf course. My horse will need to rest after last night, anyway,\u201d Pye replied.</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a minute,\u201d Silas interrupted the cozy pair. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, Bennet. Especially not with this bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go where I want.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019ll not,\u201d Silas said. The burning pain was spreading to his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re the heir to Granville now. You\u2019ll stay right here if you want a penny more from me.\u201d</p><p>Bennet finally looked up. Silas had never seen such hatred in another man\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want a penny or anything else from you. I\u2019m traveling to London as soon as Thomas has been decently buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith him?\u201d Silas jerked his head in Pye\u2019s direction, but he didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cSo your baseborn blood has begun to tell, has it?\u201d</p><p>Both men turned.</p><p>Silas grinned in satisfaction. \u201cYour mother was a whore, you know that, don\u2019t you? I wasn\u2019t even the first she\u2019d cuckolded John Pye with. That woman had an itch that just couldn\u2019t be scratched by one man. If she hadn\u2019t died so soon, she\u2019d be spreading her legs in the gutter right now, just to feel a cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may have been a faithless lying whore, but she was a saint compared to you,\u201d Pye said.</p><p>Silas laughed. He couldn\u2019t help it. What a joke! The boy must have no idea. He gasped for breath. \u201cCan\u2019t you do sums, lad? Must not be something they teach in the poorhouse, eh?\u201d Another chuckle shook him. \u201cWell let me spell it out for you, nice and slow. Your mother came here before you were conceived. You\u2019re as likely my son as John Pye\u2019s. More like, the way she panted after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Strangely, Pye showed no reaction. \u201cYou may well have planted the seed in my mother, but John Pye and only John Pye was my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Silas spat. \u201cI doubt John Pye was even capable of getting a woman with child.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Silas thought Pye would go for his throat, and his heart leapt painfully. But the bastard turned aside and walked to the window, as if Silas were not worth the effort.</p><p>Silas scowled and gestured scornfully. \u201cDo you see what I saved you from, Bennet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved me?\u201d His son opened his mouth as if laughing, but no sound came out. \u201cSaved me how? By bringing me to this mausoleum? By putting me in the tender care of your bitch of a wife? A woman who must have felt the sting of her humiliation every single time she looked at me? By favoring me over Thomas so there was no way we would ever have a normal relationship?\u201d Bennet was shouting hoarsely now. \u201cBy banishing Harry, my brother? God! Tell me, Father, how exactly have you saved me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walk out that door, boy, and I\u2019ll never welcome you back, heir or no.\u201d The pain in his chest was back again. Silas rubbed his breastbone. \u201cYou\u2019ll get no more money, no more help from me. You\u2019ll starve in a ditch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Bennet turned away. \u201cHarry, Will is in the kitchen. I can have my bags packed in a half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennet!\u201d The word felt as if it were ripped from Silas\u2019s lungs.</p><p>His son walked away from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed for you, boy.\u201d Damn it, he would not go groveling after his own son.</p><p>Bennet turned, a look of mingled horror and loathing on his face. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurdered for you.\u201d Silas thought he bellowed, but the words weren\u2019t as loud as before.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ. Did he say he murdered someone?\u201d Bennet\u2019s voice seemed to float around him.</p><p>The pain in his chest had spread and become a fire burning through to his back. Silas staggered. Tried to grab a chair and fell, toppling the chair next to him. He lay on his side and felt the flames licking hungrily down his arm and over his shoulder. He smelled ashes from his son\u2019s body and piss from his own.</p><p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d His voice was a thin trickle.</p><p>Someone stood over him. Boots filled his vision. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>Then Pye\u2019s face was in front of his own. \u201cYou killed Mistress Pollard, didn\u2019t you, Granville? That\u2019s who you murdered. Janie Crumb never had the strength to feed another woman poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Bennet whispered in his ruined voice. Bile suddenly filled Silas\u2019s throat, and he heaved, choking on the contents of his own stomach. The carpet wool chafed his cheek as he convulsed.</p><p>Dimly, Silas saw Pye step aside, avoiding the pool of vomit.</p><p>Help me.</p><p>Harry Pye\u2019s green eyes seemed to bore into him. \u201cI never begged for mercy when you had me beaten. Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>Silas shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pride or bravery,\u201d he heard Pye say.</p><p>The fire crawled up into his throat. The room was going dark.</p><p>\u201cMy da begged you for mercy when you had him horse-whipped. You ignored him. There is no mercy in you.\u201d</p><p>Silas choked, coughing on hot coals. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d someone said.</p><p>But by that time, the fire had reached Silas\u2019s eyes and he no longer cared.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone mad.\u201d Tony sat back in the settee as if his pronouncement settled the matter.</p><p>They were in his elegant town house sitting room. Across from him, George sat stiffly in an armchair, the now-ever-present basin at the ready by her feet. Oscar prowled the room, munching on a muffin. No doubt, Violet and Ralph were taking turns pressing their ears to the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George sighed. They\u2019d arrived in London yesterday, and she seemed to have spent all the time since debating her condition with her brothers. I should have just eloped with Cecil. She could have informed her family in a note and not even have been around to hear the resulting commotion.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve gone sane,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhy is it that everyone was against my being with Harry before and now they keep pushing me at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t increasing before, Georgie,\u201d Oscar pointed out kindly. He had a fading bruise high on one cheek, and she briefly stared at it, wondering where he\u2019d got it.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d She winced as her tummy gave a bubbling rumble. \u201cI think I\u2019m aware of my state. I don\u2019t see that it matters.\u201d</p> <p>Tony sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse. You know very well that your state is the reason you need to marry. The problem is the man you\u2019ve chosen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit thick, you must admit.\u201d Oscar leaned forward from his place at the mantelpiece and waved a muffin at her, scattering crumbs. \u201cI mean, you are carrying the fellow\u2019s child. Seems only right he should have a chance at marrying you.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Oscar, of all people, was lecturing her on propriety.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a land steward. You told me only recently that a land steward just wasn\u2019t done.\u201d George lowered her voice in a fair imitation of Oscar\u2019s tone. \u201cCecil comes from a very respectable family. And you like him.\u201d She folded her arms, sure of her point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terribly disappointed in your lack of morals, Georgie, old girl. Can\u2019t tell you how disillusioning this insight into the female mind is for me. Might very well make me cynical for years to come.\u201d Oscar frowned. \u201cA man has a right to his own progeny. Doesn\u2019t matter what class he comes from, the principle is the same.\u201d He bit into his muffin for emphasis.</p> <p>\u201cNot to mention poor Cecil,\u201d Tony muttered, \u201cfoisted off with someone else\u2019s get. How are you going to explain that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that probably won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Oscar muttered sotto voce.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d \u201cNo. Cecil\u2019s not that interested in females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot inter\u2014oh.\u201d Tony cleared his throat and yanked down on his waistcoat. She noticed for the first time that his knuckles were raw. \u201cWell. And that\u2019s another consideration for you, George. Surely you don\u2019t mean to have that kind of marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of marriage I\u2019ll have, does it?\u201d Her lower lip trembled. Not now. The last few days she\u2019d found herself almost constantly on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters.\u201d Tony was obviously affronted. \u201cWe want you to be happy, Georgie,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cYou seemed happy with Pye before.\u201d</p> <p>George bit her lip. She would not cry. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t happy with me.\u201d</p><p>Oscar exchanged a look with Tony.</p><p>Tony drew his heavy eyebrows together. \u201cIf Pye needs to be persuaded to marry you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d George drew a shuddering breath. \u201cNo. Can\u2019t you understand that if he\u2019s forced to marry me, it would be far worse than marriage to Cecil? Or no marriage at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see why.\u201d Oscar scowled. \u201cHe might balk at first, but I think he\u2019d soon come around once married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d George stared at Oscar.</p><p>He looked taken aback.</p><p>She switched her gaze to Tony. \u201cEither of you? If you were forced to marry by the brothers of your bride, would you soon forgive and forget?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe\u2014\u201d Oscar began.</p><p>Tony spoke over him. \u201cNo.\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cLook\u2014\u201d Oscar started.</p><p>The door opened and Cecil Barclay stuck his head around it. \u201cOh, sorry. Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Come back later, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d George lowered her voice. \u201cCome in, Cecil, do. We were just talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He looked warily at Tony and Oscar, but he closed the door behind him and advanced into the room. He shook out a sleeve, spraying drops of water. \u201cGhastly weather out. Can\u2019t remember when it\u2019s rained so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you read my letter?\u201d George asked.</p><p>Oscar muttered something and flopped into an armchair. Tony propped his chin in a hand, long bony fingers covering his mouth.</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Cecil glanced at Tony. \u201cIt seems an interesting proposition. I take it you have discussed this idea with your brothers and it meets with their approval?\u201d</p><p>George swallowed down a wave of nausea. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d Oscar muttered, more loudly this time.</p><p>Tony arched a hairy eyebrow. \u201cBut does it meet with your approval, Cecil?\u201d George forced herself to ask.</p><p>Cecil started. He\u2019d been looking rather worriedly at Oscar, slumped in the armchair. \u201cYes. Yes, actually it does. Solves a rather tricky problem, in fact. Due to a childhood illness, I doubt I\u2019m able to, uh, father a... a...\u201d Cecil petered out, staring a bit fixedly at her tummy.</p><p>George pressed a hand to her belly, wishing desperately that it would calm down.</p><p>\u201cQuite. Quite. Quite.\u201d Cecil had regained his power of speech. He brought out a handkerchief and blotted his upper lip. \u201cThere is only one hitch, as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Tony dropped his hand.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cecil sat in an armchair next to George, and she realized guiltily that she\u2019d forgotten to offer him a seat. \u201cIt\u2019s the title, I\u2019m afraid. It isn\u2019t much of one, only a obscure baronetcy that Grandfather has, but the estate that goes with it is rather large.\u201d Cecil passed the handkerchief over his brow. \u201cHuge, to be quite vulgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t want the child inheriting it?\u201d Tony spoke quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo. That is, yes,\u201d Cecil gasped. \u201cWhole point of the proposition, isn\u2019t it? Having an heir? No, the problem is in my aunt. Aunt Irene, that is. The bally woman has always blamed me for being next in line to inherit.\u201d Cecil shuddered. \u201cFact is, I\u2019d be afraid to meet the old bat in a dark alley. Might take the opportunity to make the succession a little closer to her own son, Alphonse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating as this family history is, Cecil, old man, how does it pertain to Georgie?\u201d Oscar asked. He\u2019d sat up during Cecil\u2019s recitation.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you see? Aunt Irene might challenge any heir that arrived, er, a little early.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared. \u201cWhat about your younger brother, Freddy?\u201d</p><p>Cecil nodded. \u201cYes, I know. A sane woman would see that too many stood between her Alphonse and the inheritance, but that\u2019s just it. Aunt Irene ain\u2019t sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Tony sat back, apparently in thought. \u201cSo what are we to do?\u201d George just wanted to retire to her rooms and go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cIf t\u2019were done, t\u2019were best done quickly,\u201d Oscar said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cecil knit his brow.</p><p>But Tony sat up and nodded. \u201cYes. You\u2019ve mangled the quote, of course, but you\u2019re quite right.\u201d He turned to Cecil. \u201cHow soon can you get a special license?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Cecil blinked. \u201cIn a fortnight?\u201d</p><p>Oscar shook his head. \u201cToo long. Two, three days at the most. Knew a fellow got one within a day of applying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the archbishop of\u2014\u201d \u201cCanterbury\u2019s a personal friend of Aunt Beatrice\u2019s,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cHe\u2019s in London right now. She was telling me only the other day.\u201d He clapped Cecil on the back. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll help you find him. And congratulations. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make an excellent brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, er, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Oscar and Cecil slammed out of the room.</p><p>George looked at Tony.</p><p>He turned down one corner of his wide mouth. \u201cYou\u2019d better start looking for a wedding dress, Georgie.\u201d</p><p>Which was when George realized she was engaged\u2014to the wrong man.</p><p>She grabbed the basin just in time.</p><p>THE RAIN POUNDED DOWN. Harry stepped unwarily and sank ankle-deep in oozing muck. The entire road was more a moving stream than solid ground.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Bennet panted from atop his horse. \u201cI think I\u2019m growing mildew between my toes. I can\u2019t believe this rain. Can you? Four days straight without any letup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty,\u201d Will mumbled indistinctly from his place behind Bennet. His face was all but hidden in Bennet\u2019s cape.</p><p>It had started raining the day of Thomas\u2019s funeral and continued through Lord Granville\u2019s internment the day after, but Harry didn\u2019t say that. Bennet knew the facts well enough. \u201cAye, it\u2019s nasty all right.\u201d The mare nuzzled the back of his neck, blowing a warm, musty breath against his skin.</p><p>The horse had gone lame a mile back. He\u2019d tried looking at the mud-clogged hoof but hadn\u2019t found anything obviously wrong. Now he was reduced to walking her to the next town. Slowly walking her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you intend to do once we catch up with Lady Georgina?\u201d Bennet asked.</p><p>Harry turned to peer at him through the downpour. Bennet had an expression of studied nonchalance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry her,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019d got the idea that was your overall plan.\u201d Bennet scratched his chin. \u201cBut she did take off for London. You must admit it looks rather as if she might be, well, unreceptive to the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s carrying my child.\u201d A gust of wind flung a spatter of icy raindrops playfully against Harry\u2019s face. His cheeks were so numb with cold he hardly felt it.</p><p>\u201cThat part puzzles me.\u201d Bennet cleared his throat. \u201cBecause a lady in such a state, you\u2019d think she\u2019d be running to you with open arms. Instead, she appears to be running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already been over that.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Bennet agreed. \u201cBut, I mean, did you say something to her before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cBecause women can be awfully sensitive when they\u2019re in the family way.\u201d</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you would you know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone...\u201d Bennet tilted his chin down, causing a trickle of water to pour off his tricorn into his lap. \u201cDamn!\u201d He straightened. \u201cEveryone knows about women with child. It\u2019s just common knowledge. Perhaps you didn\u2019t pay enough attention to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got quite a bit of attention from me,\u201d Harry growled irritably. He noted Will\u2019s brown eyes peering curiously around Bennet\u2019s back and grimaced. \u201cEspecially on the night before she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Ah.\u201d Bennet frowned thoughtfully.</p><p>Harry searched for a change of subject. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to you for coming with me,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry you had to rush Thomas\u2019s funeral. And your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u201d\u2014Bennet cleared his throat\u2014\u201cI was glad you were there, rushed or not. Thomas and I weren\u2019t close, but he was my brother. And it was hard dealing with the succession on top of his funeral. As for Father...\u201d Bennet swiped a drip of water off his nose and shrugged.</p><p>Harry splashed through a puddle. Not that it mattered. He was already soaked to the skin.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re my brother, too,\u201d Bennet said. Harry shot a glance at him. Bennet was squinting down the road.</p><p>\u201cThe only brother I have now.\u201d Bennet turned and gave him a surprisingly sweet smile.</p><p>Harry half grinned. \u201cAye.\u201d \u201cExcepting Will, here.\u201d Bennet nodded to the boy clinging to his back like a monkey.</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Harry scowled. He hadn\u2019t wanted to tell Will, as he was afraid it would confuse the boy\u2019s already complicated life, but it appeared that Bennet wasn\u2019t waiting to discuss the matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt seems that my father might very well be yours as well,\u201d Bennet said now to the child. \u201cWe have similar eyes, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut mine are brown.\u201d Will frowned. \u201cThe shape, he means,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOh.\u201d Will thought about that for a bit, then peeked at him. \u201cWhat about Harry? Am I his brother, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cBut since we don\u2019t, we might as well say we are. If you don\u2019t mind. Do you?\u201d</p><p>Will vigorously shook his head. \u201cGood,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cNow that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m sure Will is as concerned as I am about your impending nuptials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry lost the smile that had begun to form on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Lady Georgina is the Earl of Maitland\u2019s sister.\u201d Bennet pursed his lips. \u201cAnd if she decides to dig in her heels... might be a problem, the two of us going up against an earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Harry said. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him before that he might have to go through his lady\u2019s brothers in order to speak to her. But if she was well and truly mad at him... \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Bennet nodded. \u201cIt\u2019d help if we could send word ahead to someone in London when we reach the next town. Have them reconnoiter, so to speak. Especially if it takes a while to get you a fresh horse.\u201d Bennet looked at the mare, who was definitely lagging.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to mention, it would be nice to have someone at our back when we confront Maitland,\u201d Bennet continued. \u201cI know a couple of blokes in London, of course. Might be up for it, if we can convince them it\u2019s a sort of lark.\u201d His brow furrowed. \u201cThey aren\u2019t usually sober, but if I impress upon them the seriousness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some friends,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cEdward de Raaf and Simon Iddesleigh.\u201d \u201cThe Earl of Swartingham?\u201d Bennet\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAnd Iddesleigh\u2019s titled, too, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Viscount Iddesleigh.\u201d \u201cHow the hell do you know them?\u201d \u201cMet through the Agrarian Society.\u201d \u201cThe Agrarians?\u201d Bennet wrinkled his nose as if at a bad smell. \u201cDon\u2019t they debate turnips?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cIt\u2019s for gentlemen interested in agriculture, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it takes all kinds.\u201d Bennet still looked dubious. \u201cChrist, Harry, I had no idea. If you have friends like that, why the hell are you playing around with me and Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are my brothers, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cAye!\u201d Will shouted. \u201cSo we are.\u201d Bennet\u2019s face broke into a broad smile. And then he tipped back his head and laughed into the rain.</p> <p>\u201cTHIS BLUE IS VERY NICE, my lady.\u201d Tiggle held up the gown in question, spreading the skirts over her arm.</p><p>George glanced at the frock so enticingly displayed and tried to muster some enthusiasm. Or at the very least care one way or the other. It was her wedding day. She and Tiggle were in her bedroom in her London town house, which was presently strewn with the bright colors of rejected frocks. George was having a hard time convincing herself the wedding was real. It was only a scant week since she and her brothers had talked to Cecil, and now she was readying herself to marry him. Her life had taken on the aspect of one of those horrid dreams where a ghastly doom was inevitable and nobody could hear the screams.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Tiggle prompted.</p><p>If she screamed now, would anyone hear? George shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The neckline doesn\u2019t really suit me, does it?\u201d</p><p>Tiggle pursed her lips and set aside the blue. \u201cThen what about the yellow brocade? The neckline is square and quite low, but we could put in a lace fichu, if you like.\u201d</p><p>George wrinkled her nose without looking. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy all the ruffles about the bottom of the skirt. Makes me look like a cake with too much marzipan decoration.\u201d</p><p>What she really ought to wear was black. Black with a black veil. She looked down at her vanity and touched with one finger the little carved horse standing on it. The swan and the eel sat to either side of the horse. They looked rather forlorn without the leopard to guard them, but she\u2019d left him behind for Harry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to decide soon, my lady,\u201d Tiggle said from behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re to be wed in less than two hours.\u201d</p> <p>George sighed. Tiggle was being awfully kind to her. Normally, a bit of vinegar would have shown through her lady\u2019s maid fa\u00e7ade by now. And she was right. It was no use holding on to dreams. Soon she would have a baby. Its welfare was of far greater importance than the silly fantasies of a woman who liked to collect fairy tales.</p><p>\u201cI think the green, the one embroidered with lilies,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as new as the others, but it\u2019s rather fine and I\u2019ve always felt it became me.\u201d</p><p>Tiggle gave a sigh of what sounded like relief. \u201cA good choice, my lady. I\u2019ll get it out.\u201d</p><p>George nodded. She pulled out one of the shallow drawers at the top of her vanity. Inside was a plain wooden box. She opened the box and carefully laid the horse, the swan, and the eel inside.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Tiggle was waiting with the gown. George closed the box and the drawer and turned to prepare for her wedding.</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS WHERE THE AGRARIANS MEET?\u201d Bennet looked incredulously at the low-slung entrance to the coffee-house. It was on the bottom floor\u2014really the cellar\u2014of a half-timbered building in a narrow back lane. \u201cThe place isn\u2019t going to fall, is it?\u201d He eyed the second floor looming over the lane.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d Harry ducked and entered the smoky room, Will sticking close to his side. He\u2019d asked de Raaf to meet him here.</p><p>Behind him, he heard Bennet swear as he caught his head on the lintel. \u201cThe coffee had better be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d \u201cHarry!\u201d A large, pockmarked man hailed him from a table.</p><p>\u201cLord Swartingham.\u201d Harry made his way to the table. \u201cThank you for coming, my lord. May I present my brothers, Bennet Granville and Will?\u201d</p><p>Edward de Raaf, fifth Earl of Swartingham, frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve told you to call me Edward or de Raaf. This my lord stuff is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Harry merely smiled and turned to the second man at the table. \u201cLord Iddesleigh. I hadn\u2019t expected you. Bennet, Will, this is Simon Iddesleigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow d\u2019you do?\u201d Bennet bowed.</p><p>Will merely ducked his head. \u201cCharmed.\u201d Iddesleigh, a lean aristocrat with ice-gray eyes, inclined his head. \u201cI had no idea Harry had relations. I was under the impression that he\u2019d sprung fully formed like Athena from a rock. Or maybe a mangel-wurzel. It goes to show one can\u2019t always go by impressions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d Harry held up two fingers to a passing boy and took a seat, making room for Bennet and Will.</p><p>Iddesleigh flipped a lace-trimmed wrist. \u201cWasn\u2019t much else going on today, anyway. Thought I\u2019d tag along. It was either that or attend Lillipin\u2019s lecture on compost layering, and fascinating though the subject of decay may be, I can\u2019t think how one could take up three whole hours on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillipin could,\u201d de Raaf muttered.</p><p>The boy banged down two steaming mugs of coffee and whirled away.</p><p>Harry took a scalding sip and sighed. \u201cDo you have the special license?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d De Raaf patted his pocket. \u201cYou think there will be objections from the family?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cLady Georgina is the Earl of Maitland\u2019s sister\u2014\u201d But he cut himself off because Iddesleigh was choking on his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Simon?\u201d de Raaf barked. \u201cSorry,\u201d Iddesleigh gasped. \u201cYour intended is Maitland\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Harry felt his shoulders tense.</p><p>\u201cThe older sister?\u201d</p><p>Harry merely stared, dread filling him. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, just spit it out,\u201d de Raaf said. \u201cYou could have told me the bride\u2019s name, de Raaf. I only heard the news this morning from Freddy Barclay. We happened to meet at my tailor\u2019s, wonderful chap on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon,\u201d de Raaf growled. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d Iddesleigh suddenly sobered. \u201cShe\u2019s getting married. Your Lady Georgina. To Cecil Barclay\u2014\u201d</p><p>No. Harry closed his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t shut out the other man\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cToday.\u201d</p><p>TONY WAS WAITING OUTSIDE, hands clasped behind his back, when George emerged from her town house. Raindrops speckled the shoulders of his greatcoat. His carriage, which had the Maitland crest in gilt on the doors, stood ready at the curb.</p><p>He turned as George descended the steps and frowned with concern. \u201cI was beginning to think I would have to come in after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Tony.\u201d George held out her hand.</p><p>He enveloped it in his own big hand and helped her into the carriage.</p><p>Tony took his seat across from her, the leather squeaking as he settled. \u201cI\u2019m sure the rain will stop soon.\u201d</p><p>George looked at her brother\u2019s hands resting on his knees and noticed again the scabbed knuckles. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Tony flexed his right hand as if testing the scrapes. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We sorted out Wentworth last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOscar, Ralph, and I,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThat\u2019s not important now. Listen, George.\u201d He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through with this. Cecil will understand, and we can work something out. Retiring to the country or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d George cut him off. \u201cNo, I thank you, Tony, but this is the best way. For the baby, for Cecil, and even for me.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. She hadn\u2019t wanted to admit it, even to herself, but now George faced it: Somewhere deep inside, she\u2019d secretly hoped Harry would stop her. She grimaced ruefully. She\u2019d expected him to come charging up on a white stallion and sweep her off her feet. Perhaps wheel his stallion around while fighting ten men and go galloping off into the sunset with her.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>Harry Pye was a land steward with an old mare and a life of his own. She was a pregnant woman of eight and twenty years. Time to put the past behind her.</p><p>She managed a smile for Tony. It wasn\u2019t a very good one, judging by the doubt on his face, but it was the best she could do at the moment. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m a grown woman. I have to face my responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>George shook her head.</p><p>Tony bit off whatever he was going to say. He stared out the window, tapping long fingers against his knee. \u201cDamn, I hate this.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the carriage pulled up before a dingy little church in an unfashionable part of London.</p><p>Tony descended the carriage steps, then helped George down. \u201cRemember, you can still end this,\u201d he murmured in her ear as he tucked her hand in the crook of his arm.</p><p>George just thinned her lips.</p><p>Inside, the church was dark and somewhat chilly with the faint smell of mildew lingering in the air. Above the altar, a small rose window hung in the shadows, the light outside too dim to tell what color the glass might be. Tony and George walked down the uncarpeted nave, their footsteps echoing off the old stones. Several candles were lit at the front near the altar, supplementing the feeble light from the clerestory. A small group was gathered there. She saw Oscar, Ralph, and Violet as well as her imminent husband, Cecil, and his brother, Freddy. Ralph was sporting a yellowing black eye.</p><p>\u201cAh, the bride, I presume?\u201d The vicar peered over half-moon glasses. \u201cQuite. Quite. And your name is, umm\u201d\u2014he consulted a piece of notepaper stuck in his Bible\u2014\u201cGeorge Regina Catherine Maitland? Yes? But what an odd name for a woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cleared her throat, tamping down hysterical laughter and sudden nausea. Oh, please, Lord, not now. \u201cActually, my given name is Georgina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgiana?\u201d the vicar asked. \u201cNo, Georgina.\u201d Did it really matter? If this silly man said the wrong name during the service, would she not be married to Cecil?</p><p>\u201cGeorgina. Quite. Now, then, if we are all here and ready?\u201d The assembled nobility nodded meekly. \u201cThen let us proceed. Young lady, please stand here.\u201d</p><p>He shuffled them around until George and Cecil were side by side with Tony at George\u2019s side and Freddy as best man at Cecil\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d The vicar blinked at them, then spent a prolonged minute ruffling his paper and Bible. He cleared his throat. \u201cDearly beloved,\u201d he began in a strange falsetto.</p><p>George winced. The poor man must think it more carrying.</p><p>\u201cWe are gathered here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sound of the church doors smacking against the wall reverberated throughout the church. The group turned as one to look.</p> <p>Four men marched grimly up the aisle, trailed by one small boy.</p><p>The vicar frowned. \u201cRude. Quite rude. Astonishing what people think they can get away with these days.\u201d</p><p>But the men had reached the altar now. \u201cExcuse me, but I believe you have my lady,\u201d one of them said in a quiet, deep voice that sent veritable chills down George\u2019s spine.</p><p>Harry.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>The shriek of steel against steel echoed from the walls of the little church as every man in the wedding party drew his sword simultaneously. Followed immediately by Bennet, de Raaf, and Iddesleigh unsheathing their weapons. Bennet looked very serious. He\u2019d shoved Will into a pew as soon as they\u2019d neared the altar, and now he held his sword high and his body angled. De Raaf\u2019s pale, pock-marked face was alert, his arm steady. Iddesleigh had a bored expression and handled his sword carelessly, his long, lace-draped fingers nearly limp. Of course, Iddesleigh was probably more dangerous than any of them with a sword.</p> <p>Harry sighed.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t slept in two days. He was muddy and no doubt smelled. He couldn\u2019t remember his last meal. And he\u2019d spent the last terror-stricken, heart-stopping, god-awful hour riding hell for leather across London, thinking they would never make it in time to stop his lady from marrying another man.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>Harry strode through the mess of weapon-wielding aristocrats to his lady\u2019s side. \u201cIf I might have a word, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I mean...\u201d the skinny blond man by her side, presumably the groom, damn his hide, protested.</p><p>Harry turned his head and looked the man in the eye. The groom backed up so fast he nearly stumbled. \u201cJolly good! Jolly good! No doubt it\u2019s important, what?\u201d He sheathed his sword with a shaking hand.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, young man?\u201d The vicar peered over his spectacles at Harry.</p><p>Harry gritted his teeth and pulled back his lips in something like a smile. \u201cI\u2019m the father of the child Lady Georgina is carrying.\u201d</p> <p>De Raaf cleared his throat.</p><p>One of his lady\u2019s brothers muttered, \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>And Lady Violet giggled.</p><p>The cleric blinked his myopic light blue eyes rapidly. \u201cWell, then, I suggest you indeed have a word with this lady. You may use the vestry.\u201d He closed his Bible.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry latched one hand around his lady\u2019s wrist and pulled her toward the little door off to the side. He needed to make the room before his pain exploded from him. Behind them there was absolute silence.</p><p>He dragged his lady into the room and kicked the door closed. \u201cWhat the hell did you mean by this?\u201d Harry took out the legal document deeding Woldsly to him. He held it up to her face and shook it, his anger\u2014his anguish\u2014barely contained. \u201cDid you think I could be bought off?\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina retreated before the paper, her face confused. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink again, my lady.\u201d Harry tore the paper into shreds and threw them on the floor. He gripped her upper arms, flexing his trembling fingers against her flesh. \u201cI\u2019m not a lackey to be dismissed with a too-generous present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only\u2014\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t be dismissed at all.\u201d</p><p>Lady Georgina opened her lips again, but he didn\u2019t wait for her to speak. He didn\u2019t want to hear her reject him. So Harry covered her lips with his own. He ground down on her soft, lush mouth, thrusting in his tongue. He placed his hand under her chin and felt the vibration of her moan in her throat. His cock was already hard and aching. He wanted to pound it against her, pound it into her. Put himself inside her and stay there until she told him why she had run away. Until she promised never to do it again.</p><p>He crowded her against a heavy trestle table and felt her body yield to his. That submission brought him a small measure of control.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he groaned against her lips. \u201cWhy did you leave me?\u201d</p><p>She made a small sound, and he nipped her bottom lip to silence her.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d He licked her bruised lip to soothe it. \u201cI can\u2019t think straight without you. My world is all turned around, and I go through it in pain, wanting to hurt someone.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, open-mouthed, to reassure himself that she was really here in his arms. Her mouth was warm and wet and tasted of her morning\u2019s tea. He could spend the rest of his life just tasting her.</p><p>\u201cI hurt. Here.\u201d He grabbed her hand and placed her palm against his chest. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He pulled it lower and thrust his prick crudely into her fingers.</p><p>That felt good, to have her hand on him again, but it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Harry picked his lady up and sat her on the table. \u201cYou need me as well. I know you do.\u201d He flung up her skirts and burrowed his hand under them, feeling along her thighs.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2014\u201d \u201cShhh,\u201d he murmured against her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t talk. Don\u2019t think. Just feel.\u201d His fingers found her cunny, and she was wet. \u201cAhh, there. Do you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He touched her pea-shaped bit of flesh and she moaned, eyes closed. The sound inflamed him.</p><p>\u201cHush, my lady.\u201d He unbuttoned his breeches and parted her thighs wider, stepping between them.</p><p>She moaned again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care much, but she might be embarrassed. Later. \u201cShhh. You have to be quiet. Very quiet.\u201d His flesh pressed against her weeping opening.</p><p>Her eyes suddenly flew open at the touch of his cock. \u201cBut, Harry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d He gently pushed in. Ah, God, so tight.</p><p>She clutched him as if she would never let him go. And that was fine with him. He was more than glad to stay right here for eternity. Or maybe a little farther in.</p><p>He shoved again. \u201cOh, Harry,\u201d his lady sighed.</p><p>Someone pounded on the door.</p><p>She started, squeezing him inside. He bit back a groan. \u201cGeorge? Are you all right?\u201d One of the brothers. Harry withdrew a little and thrust carefully. Tenderly. \u201cAnswer him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it locked?\u201d His lady arched her back as he thrust. \u201cIs the door locked?\u201d</p><p>He grit his teeth. \u201cNo.\u201d He wrapped his hands around her bare rump.</p><p>The pounding started again. \u201cGeorge? Should I come in?\u201d His lady panted.</p><p>He somehow grinned through his terrible desire. \u201cShould he?\u201d He thrust deeply, burying himself in her heat. Whatever happened, he wasn\u2019t fleeing. He didn\u2019t think he could, anyway.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWhat?\u201d From the door. \u201cNo!\u201d she yelled. \u201cUnh. Go away, Tony! Harry and I need to converse a little longer.\u201d</p><p>Harry cocked an eyebrow. \u201cConverse?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, her face flushed and damp. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Tony apparently cared deeply for his sister.</p><p>Harry knew he would appreciate that fact later. He brought one hand to where he was joined with her. He touched her.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she screamed. \u201cFine, then.\u201d Footsteps retreated.</p><p>His lady wrapped her legs high over his hips and leaned forward to bite his mouth. \u201cFinish it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes half closed at the feel, the perfection, of her. This was his lady, and he was going to claim her. His chest filled with gratitude that he\u2019d been given this second chance.</p><p>But she was still waiting. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d He pressed his thumb firmly on her and at the same time thrust hard and quick, shaking the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord!\u201d she moaned. \u201cBite my shoulder,\u201d he panted, picking up his pace even more.</p><p>He felt the pinch even through his coat\u2019s broadcloth. And then he burst within her, flinging his own head back and grinding his teeth to keep from shouting in ecstasy. \u201cGod!\u201d</p><p>His entire body trembled in the aftermath, and he had to prop one arm on the table to brace both of them. He locked his knees to stay upright and gasped, \u201cWill you marry me, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking now?\u201d Her voice was weak.</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t the only one affected. \u201cYes. And I\u2019m not leaving until you give me an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY be talking about this long?\u201d Violet asked no one in particular. She shivered and wished she\u2019d thought to bring a wrap. The church was chilly.</p><p>The vicar muttered and settled more deeply into a front pew. His eyes were closed. She suspected he\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>She tapped her foot on the flagstones. When Harry and his friends had first shown up, it had been quite tense, exciting really, with all those swords waving about. She\u2019d thought for sure that some type of fight would break out. She\u2019d been all ready to start tearing up her underskirts in the proscribed manner should any blood be spilled. But as the minutes wore on, the gentlemen had begun to look, well, bored.</p><p>The big man with the scarred face started poking the tip of his sword into the cracks in the church flagstones. The elegant-looking man was glaring at the big man and lecturing him on the proper maintenance of blades. The third man in Harry\u2019s group had brown hair and was wearing a terribly dusty coat. That was all she knew about him because his back was to everyone else as he idly inspected the church\u2019s stained-glass windows. He had a small boy by his side and appeared to be pointing out to him the biblical scenes depicted in the glass.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oscar, Ralph, Cecil, and Freddy, the defenders of George\u2019s honor, were arguing about the correct way to hold a sword. Ralph\u2019s eye was swollen and turning greenish yellow, and Oscar was limping. She\u2019d have to find out about that later.</p><p>Violet sighed. It was all rather disappointing. \u201cI say, aren\u2019t you de Raaf?\u201d Tony had returned from knocking on the vestry with an odd, almost embarrassed expression. He addressed the scarred man. \u201cThe Earl of Swartingham, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The big man frowned ferociously. \u201cMaitland here.\u201d Tony stuck out his hand.</p><p>Lord Swartingham stared at the proffered appendage for a moment, then sheathed his sword. \u201cHow d\u2019you do?\u201d He tilted his head toward the elegant man. \u201cThis is Iddesleigh, viscount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, indeed.\u201d Tony shook hands with him as well. \u201cHeard of you, de Raaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The big man looked wary. \u201cYes.\u201d Tony was unperturbed. \u201cRead a manuscript of yours a while back. About crop rotation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The big man\u2019s face cleared. \u201cDo you practice crop rotation on your lands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve begun to. We\u2019re a bit farther north than you, and peas are a major crop in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd barley and swedes,\u201d Oscar cut in. He and Ralph wandered over.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Lord Swartingham murmured.</p><p>Swedes? Violet stared. They were discussing farming as if they were at an afternoon tea. Or rather, in this case, at the neighborhood tavern.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Tony indicated his brothers. \u201cThis is Oscar and Ralph, my younger brothers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow d\u2019you do?\u201d</p><p>Another round of masculine handshaking.</p><p>Violet shook her head dumbly. She would never, never, never understand the human male.</p><p>\u201cOh, and this is Cecil and Freddy Barclay.\u201d Tony cleared his throat. \u201cCecil was to marry my sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot anymore, I fear,\u201d Cecil said ruefully.</p><p>They all chuckled, the boobies. \u201cAnd you must be the little sister,\u201d a male voice said in her ear.</p><p>Violet whirled to find Harry\u2019s third friend standing behind her. He\u2019d left the boy kicking his heels in a pew. Up close, the man\u2019s eyes were a beautiful green, and he was suspiciously handsome.</p><p>Violet narrowed her own eyes. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cGranville, Bennet Granville.\u201d He bowed.</p><p>Violet didn\u2019t curtsy. This was too confusing. Why would a Granville be helping Harry?</p> <p>\u201cLord Granville nearly killed Mr. Pye.\u201d She scowled up at Bennet Granville.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s my father.\u201d His smile slipped a bit. \u201cNot my fault, I assure you. I had very little to do with my conception.\u201d</p><p>Violet felt her mouth start to relax into a smile and suppressed it ruthlessly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that is a story\u2014\u201d Mr. Granville cut himself off, and his gaze moved over her head. \u201cAh, I think they\u2019re emerging.\u201d</p><p>And the questions Violet had been about to ask slid from her mind. She turned to see if George had decided which man she would marry.</p><p>GEORGE SIGHED LUXURIOUSLY. She could fall asleep right here in Harry\u2019s arms. Even if she was perched on a vestry table.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d He nudged her with his chin.</p><p>Apparently he wanted an answer now. She tried to think, hoping her brain hadn\u2019t turned to mush like her legs. \u201cI love you, Harry, you know I do. But what about your reservations? That others would think you my pet\u201d\u2014she gulped, hating to say the word\u2014\u201cmonkey?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled the hair at her temple. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that it will bother me. That and what they will say about you. But the thing is\u201d\u2014he raised his head and she saw that his emerald eyes had grown soft, almost vulnerable\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t think I can live without you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Harry.\u201d She cradled his face in her palms. \u201cMy brothers like you, as does Violet. And, really, they\u2019re all that matter in the end. The rest can go hang for all I care.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and as always, her heart sang at the sight. \u201cThen will you marry me and be my lady for all our lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, of course I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d She felt tears start in her eyes. \u201cI love you desperately, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he said rather absently, in her opinion. He carefully removed himself from her sensitive flesh.</p><p>\u201cOh, must you?\u201d George tried to hold on to him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d Harry was swiftly rebuttoning his breeches. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for us out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, let them wait.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. He\u2019d just proposed to her in a most romantic manner. Couldn\u2019t she savor the moment?</p><p>Harry leaned forward to flip down her skirts and kiss her nose. \u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to lounge about after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter?\u201d \u201cAfter our marriage.\u201d Harry frowned at her. \u201cYou did just agree to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t imagine right away.\u201d She checked her bodice. Why wasn\u2019t there a mirror in here?</p><p>\u201cYou were ready to marry that popinjay out there right away.\u201d Harry gestured with an outflung arm.</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d Did she look like she\u2019d been doing what she had been doing? \u201cAnd Cecil isn\u2019t a popinjay; he\u2019s\u2014\u201d She noticed that his expression had darkened alarmingly. Perhaps it was time to change the subject. \u201cWe can\u2019t get married. We need a license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have one.\u201d Harry patted his coat pocket. It crinkled.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He cut her off with a kiss that could only be described as masterful. \u201cAre you going to marry me or not?\u201d</p><p>George clutched at his arms. Really, some of Harry\u2019s kisses left her quite weak. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Harry tucked her arm through his and marched her to the door.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Men could be so obtuse. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019ve just been tumbled?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou look like the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d He kissed her soundly again. He hadn\u2019t exactly answered her question, but it was too late now.</p><p>He opened the door.</p><p>The two camps had merged into one lump, crowded around the altar. Good Lord, they hadn\u2019t been fighting, had they? Everyone turned expectantly.</p><p>George cleared her throat, trying to put together the right words. Then she saw something and stopped dead. \u201cHarry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d \u201cLook.\u201d She pointed.</p><p>A Persian carpet of lights danced on the formerly dingy floor: cobalt blues, ruby reds, and amber yellows. She followed the beam of light back to its source, the rose window above the altar. It glowed, lit from without by sunshine.</p><p>\u201cThe sun has come out,\u201d George whispered in awe. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten what it looked like. Do you think it\u2019s shining in Yorkshire as well?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s green eyes sparkled down at her. \u201cI have no doubt, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d George looked up to see Violet staring at them in a rather exasperated manner. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI shall be marrying Mr. Pye today.\u201d Violet squealed. \u201cAbout time,\u201d someone, probably Oscar, muttered. George ignored that and tried to look contrite as she turned to poor Cecil. \u201cI am so sorry, Cecil. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Cecil interrupted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry your head, old thing. I shall dine out on this tale for the next year. It isn\u2019t every day a fellow is left at the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d A cry from the front pew brought everyone around. The vicar straightened his wig. He returned his spectacles to his nose and searched the gathering until his eyes lit on George. \u201cNow, then, young lady. Which of these gentlemen will you marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one.\u201d She squeezed Harry\u2019s arm.</p><p>The vicar inspected Harry and sniffed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look that much different from the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless\u201d\u2014she fought to remain sober-faced\u2014\u201cthis is the man I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The vicar frowned at Harry. \u201cHave you a license?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He produced the piece of paper. \u201cAnd my brothers will serve as groomsmen.\u201d</p><p>Bennet walked to Harry\u2019s side and stood with Will just a little behind him. The boy looked both terrified and excited.</p><p>\u201cBrothers?\u201d Violet hissed. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later,\u201d George said. She blinked back sudden tears.</p><p>\u201cMy dinner is waiting, so let us commence.\u201d The vicar cleared his throat noisily. He began again in the same falsetto voice he\u2019d used before, \u201cDearly beloved...\u201d</p><p>Everything else was different.</p><p>The sun shone through the rose window, lighting and warming the little church. Tony looked relieved, as if a terrible burden had been lifted from his shoulders. Ralph grinned next to him. Oscar winked at George as she caught his eye. Violet kept shooting puzzled glances at Bennet, but in between she grinned at George. Bennet stood a little awkwardly beside Harry, but he seemed proud as well. Will was bouncing on his toes in excitement.</p><p>And Harry...</p><p>George looked at him and felt a great bubble of joy well up inside her. Harry watched her as if she were the center of his soul. He wasn\u2019t smiling, but his beautiful emerald eyes were warm and serene.</p><p>When it came time to pledge herself to Harry, George leaned toward him and whispered, \u201cI forgot one thing when I told you about the end of the fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>Her almost husband smiled down at her and asked gravely, \u201cWhat was that, my lady?\u201d</p><p>She savored the moment and the love in his eyes, then declared, \u201cAnd they lived happily ever after!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they did,\u201d Harry whispered back, and kissed her. Vaguely she heard the vicar moan, \u201cNo, no, not yet!\u201d and then, \u201cOh, never mind. I pronounce you man and wife.\u201d</p><p>And that was how it should be, George thought as she opened her mouth beneath her husband\u2019s. She was Harry\u2019s wife.</p><p>And Harry was her man. </p> </body></html>"]
