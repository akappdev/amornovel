Trapped in darkness, weak to the point of death, I woke only to suck his soul dry until the notes and droplets merged in my veins. Whoever he was, he was my inferior, my prey, and his life was my due. What\u2019s the point of being a princess if you can\u2019t kill your subjects?</p><p>His blood was spiced with wine; I could tell that much. As I listened, stilling my breathing and willing my heart to pump again, I realized that I didn\u2019t know the song he was playing. It wasn\u2019t any of the Freesian lullabies from my childhood, nor was it anything that had been popular at court. I could even pick out the sound of his fingertips stroking the keys without the telltale muting of suede gloves. Peculiar. No wonder I could smell him, whoever he was\u2014he wasn\u2019t protecting his delicious skin from the world. From me.</p><p>He stopped playing and sighed, and my instincts took over. I lunged toward that intoxicating scent. But the attempt to pounce was painfully foiled by . . . something. Leather. I was trapped, tucked into a ball, boxed and balanced on my bustled bum. When he started playing again, my hand stole sideways toward the musty leather. With one wicked claw, I began to carve a way out.</p> <p>The tiniest sliver of light stole in, orange and murky. Fresh air hit my face, and with it, his scent. It took every ounce of well-bred patience for me to remain silent and still and not fumble and flounder out of whatever held me bound like a Kraken from the deep. My mother\u2019s voice rang in my mind, her queenly tone unmistakable.</p><p>Silence. Cunning. Quickness. That is how the enemy falls, princess. You are the predator\u2019s predator. The queen of the beasts. Now kill him. Slowly.</p><p>My fingernails had grown overlong and sharper than was fashionable in court, and the rest of the leather fell away in one long curve. I lifted the flap with one hand and dared to peek out.</p><p>The room was dim and mostly empty, with a high ceiling and wooden floors. Spindly chairs perched on round tables. Across the room, lit by one orange gas spotlight, was a stage, and on that stage was a harpsichord, and playing that harpsichord was my lunch.</p><p>Seeing him there, the princess receded, and the beast took over. Body crouched and fingers curled, I sidled out through the hole, my eyes glued to my prey. He hadn\u2019t noticed the creature hunting him from the shadows. His eyes were closed, and he was singing something plaintive, something about someone named Jude. I wasn\u2019t Jude, so it didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>The refined part of my brain barely registered that I was dressed in high-heeled boots and swishing taffeta. I knew well enough how to stalk in my best clothes and had been doing so since my days in a linen pinafore and ermine ruff. As I slipped into the shadows along the wall and glided toward the stage, hunger pounded in time with my heartbeat and his slow keystrokes. It felt like a lifetime had passed since I had last eaten. And maybe it had. Never had I felt so drained.</p><p>I made it across the room without detection. He continued moaning about Jude in a husky voice so sad that it moved even the animal in me. I stopped to consider him from behind deep-red velvet curtains that had definitely known better days. But I didn\u2019t see a man. Just food. And in that sense, he had all but arrayed himself on a platter, walking around with his shirt open, boots off, and gloves nowhere to be seen. Exposed and reeking of alcohol, he was an easy target.</p><p>He broke off from his strange song and reached for a green bottle, tipping it to lips flushed pink with blood and feeling. I watched his neck thrown back, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing, and a deafening roar overtook me. I couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. I was across the stage and on him in a heartbeat.</p><p>Tiny as I was, the momentum from my attack knocked him backward off the bench. The bottle skittered across the floor, and he made a pathetically clumsy grab for it. I had one hand tangled in his long hair, the other pinning down his chest, long talons prickling into his flesh and drawing pinpoints of delicious blood to pepper the air. I took a deep breath, savoring it. The kill was sure. I smiled, displaying fangs.</p><p>His red-rimmed eyes met mine in understanding, and he smiled back, a feral glint surprising me. Something smashed into my head, and he rolled me over and lurched to his feet with a wild laugh. Red liquid streamed through my hair and down my face, and I hissed and shook shards of green glass from my shoulders. The uppity bastard had hit me with his bottle. If I hadn\u2019t already planned to kill him, I now had just cause.</p><p>As I circled him, I wiped the stinging wine from my eyes with the back of my hand. I was dizzy with hunger, almost woozy, and he took advantage of my delicate condition to leap forward and slice my forearm with the jagged ends of his blasted bottle. I hissed again and went for his throat, but at the last minute, something stopped me short. He didn\u2019t smell so good, not anymore.</p> <p>The beast within receded, and my posture straightened. My arms swung, useless, at my sides. His finger was in his mouth, and when he pulled it out with a dramatic pop, his lips were stained red with my blud. Now he just smelled like me. And less like food.</p><p>\u201cNot today, Josephine,\u201d he said with a cocky grin.</p><p>I struggled to stand tall and not wobble. Now that he had swallowed my blud, the beast wasn\u2019t controlling me, and there was nothing holding me up. I was as empty as a cloud, light as a snowflake, beyond hunger. My heart was barely beating. And I felt more than a little bewildered.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d I said, one hand to my dripping hair. \u201cI do believe I might swoon. And you\u2019ve ruined my dress as well. Your lord is simply going to draw and quarter you.\u201d</p><p>I did swoon then. As the world went black, I felt his hands catching me, his delicious\u2014if no longer maddening\u2014blood pumping millimeters away from my own.</p><p>\u201cEasy, little girl,\u201d he said. I smelled wine and sadness on him and something else, something deep and musky and not quite right.</p><p>I was delirious as he gently helped me fall to the ground. I could barely mumble, \u201cI\u2019m not a little girl, and you\u2019re the most badly behaved servant I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>The world fell away, and his laughter and music followed me into my dreams.</p> <p>2</p><p>Before my eyes were open, before I was actually awake, I was drinking. Four great gulps, and I gasped for more. I clawed at the empty glass tube held to my mouth and flung it to the ground.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I rasped. \u201cI demand more.\u201d</p><p>Another tube replaced it, and I sighed and swallowed again. Someone chuckled. The blood ran down my throat, cool and warm at the same time. It tasted exotic. Must have been the local flavor.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been hiding in that old suitcase?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, suddenly aware of the unladylike nature of my predicament. I sprawled on the ground, legs splayed out over the dusty wooden boards. A man\u2019s arm was around my shoulders, his ungloved human hand holding a vial to my lips as I drank the blood as greedily as a child with holiday sweets. My hair had fallen to disarray, and some of the straggling locks around my face were tinted red with what smelled like old wine. I slapped the vial to the ground\u2014after I\u2019d finished the last drop, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou varlet,\u201d I growled in my most ladylike growl. \u201cYou blasphemous dog. How dare you touch me? I\u2019ll use your blood for ink.\u201d</p><p>I jerked out of his hands and tried to stand, but my legs couldn\u2019t hold me. Without his body behind me, I toppled right back over and flopped on my back like a fish. Whatever had been done to me, two vials of blood wasn\u2019t enough to get me back on my feet.</p><p>But what had been done to me? And by whom?</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said. My eyes narrowed, focused on him.</p><p>He sat on his haunches a few feet away, elbows easy on his knees, watching me. I\u2019d never seen so much exposed skin on a servant who wasn\u2019t being offered as a meal. His eyes were bright blue, regarding me with curiosity and a noticeable absence of fear and respect.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to me, offal?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and grinned. He had dimples. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I saved your life, right after you attacked me. I don\u2019t hold it against you, though. Looks like you were drained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even stand, little girl.\u201d</p><p>I tried to lift a hand to crush his throat, but my arm weighed a ton. I was starting to get woozy again, as if there was a block of stone on my chest. It was a struggle to breathe. Movement caught my eyes, and I saw a fresh vial of blood glinting in his hand, flipping back and forth over his knuckles. I\u2019d never seen anything so beautiful, and I had to swallow down an unbecoming drop of drool.</p><p>\u201cGive me that,\u201d I said, voice husky and commanding.</p><p>\u201cTell me who you are first.\u201d</p><p>I was starting to pant, watching the blood twirl around his fingers. He may have ingested my own blud and calmed the beast within me, but he still smelled like food. If I could have ripped his throat out, I would have been sunk to my ears in his neck, drinking in ecstasy. But I forced that image from my mind and met his steely blue glare, fighting for control over the beast beginning to surface again.</p><p>\u201cLet us understand each other,\u201d I said, enunciating every word clearly. \u201cI am not little, and I am not a girl. I am twenty-seven years old, and I am a princess. And you, whoever you are, are my subject. You owe me obeisance, fealty, and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and get it, then.\u201d His grin taunted me with unexpected good humor as he held up the vial, the amber light glinting off the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou know very well I cannot,\u201d I spat, struggling for control. I had never been so helpless, and he was mocking me, and it was untenable. Once I was strong again, he was going to pay.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to strike a bargain, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen good luck, princess.\u201d</p><p>He stood and walked back to his harpsichord. Long, tangled chestnut hair rippled over his stained white shirt, and I pledged to make a mop out of it one day. Rage consumed me. Rage and hunger.</p><p>As if sensing my fury, he turned back and winked with one damnable blue eye, then threw the vial into the air. I swallowed hard, watching the precious glass tube flip over and over in a perfect arc. When it smashed against the floor, I let out an inhuman wail and tried to drag myself over the worn boards. I was a princess, but I would gladly have licked the glass-dusted blood from the dirty ground. I couldn\u2019t move, not even an inch. All the training and breeding and hunting in the world had never prepared me for such utter helplessness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I gasped, my black hands scrabbling against the floorboards. I winced at the sound of my long white talons scritching uselessly over the wood. He had to be right; only draining could reduce me to mewling like a kitten. To begging and desperation.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He turned around to grin at me again with those hateful dimples.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a bargain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d see it my way.\u201d He walked back to me, pulling another vial from his shirt pocket. He sat down cross-legged, just out of reach, and began flipping it over his knuckles again. The way I felt reminded me of a wolfhound my father used to have, the way she would gulp under her jeweled collar when he forced her to balance a bone on her nose until he gave her the signal to eat it. I gulped, too.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, who are you really?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, fighting for control of my emotions. I had never begged before, never been in any position that didn\u2019t involve absolute power. I had definitely never been helpless at the bare feet of a Pinky, a servant, a paltry human. My hands made fists in the ice-blue taffeta of my gown, the talons piercing the ruffles and digging painfully into my palms.</p><p>\u201cI am Princess Ahnastasia Feodor. My mother is the Blud Tsarina of Freesia, and we reside in the Ice Palace of Muscovy.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of my name, his face underwent a strange ripple of emotions, from recognition to understanding to what appeared to be pity.</p> <p>\u201cBad news, princess. I follow the papers. You were declared dead four years ago. They said you were kidnapped and that your ashes were returned to the palace in your engraved vial case.\u201d</p><p>I would not have guessed it possible that I could feel weaker and dizzier than I already felt, but fear and anger roiled through my barely breathing body. Me, kidnapped and drained? I imagined my parents holding the gold case they had given me on my sixteenth birthday to carry the vials of blood collected from only the most highly valued, most pedigreed servants. I tried to imagine what my mother\u2019s regal face would look like at my funeral ceremony, whether her carefully studied mask would break as my supposed ashes blew away in the wind of a snowstorm. Would she cry? Did she even know how?</p><p>I swallowed hard, my throat gritty. \u201cThis is not possible.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head at me, squinting as he looked me up and down. I was accustomed to seeing awe, fear, and polite admiration in a Bludman\u2019s eyes. I had never had a human look so brazenly into my face, seeming to reach down into my soul and question what was found there. But this man did just that. And the answering expression on his face showed an unwelcome sympathy. I flinched under his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cYou do look like the broadsheets, although the drawings showed you a little younger. If you\u2019ve been drained and hidden in that suitcase for years, I guess it could be you. If you really are the Princess Ahnastasia, your sister is also missing, and your brother is sickly.\u201d He looked down to fiddle with the vial of blood, and my eyes followed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but your parents are dead. They were executed a few months ago in a coup by a gypsy sorceress named Ravenna, and she\u2019s a heartbeat away from complete control of Freesia. Tell me, princess, what do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t . . .\u201d I faltered and closed my eyes. They were too dry to produce tears. \u201cI need more blood,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>With another look of pity, he uncorked the vial he held. I allowed him to lift me into a sitting position and gulped the blood as politely as possible, so stricken with grief that it was like swallowing past a stone. After I\u2019d emptied the vial and licked the lip of the glass clean, I muttered, \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He obliged, producing yet another vial from his shirt pocket. I had enough strength by then to slap his hand away and hold the vial myself, but I let him keep his arm behind my back, supporting me. My talons were atrociously long, the pinkie fingers beginning to twist into unfashionable corkscrews. At least my mother would never see me this way. I grimaced as I set the vial on the floor. The blood loss, the heartbreak\u2014it was too much to bear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all the blood I can find.\u201d He pocketed the empty vials and dusted off his hands as if he didn\u2019t like touching them. \u201cThe delivery isn\u2019t due until this afternoon, I\u2019m afraid. No one comes to the Seven Scars before lunch except me and Tom Pain. Isn\u2019t that so, Tommy?\u201d</p><p>And then I smelled the strangest thing. An animal. A fellow predator but an unfamiliar and somehow non-threatening one. A rumbling noise started up, and an odd creature padded out from the shadows. It was heavy and black and furry, with one great, green eye that regarded me philosophically. The other eye was scarred over, an ugly slash against the creature\u2019s face. I had never seen anything like it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a monster. It\u2019s a cat.\u201d</p><p>As he reached to stroke the rumbling creature, I realized that I was sitting up on my own. I finally had enough strength to support myself again. The man focused on the animal, and I scooted unobtrusively toward the broken vial of blood, dragging my fingers through the red puddle and licking them clean with a new desperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat, they don\u2019t have cats in Freesia?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought cats were everywhere. Old Tommy has lived at the Seven Scars pub for much longer than any cat has a right to live. They say cats have nine lives, and he\u2019s on his tenth.\u201d</p> <p>The man scratched the cat-thing under the chin, and the cat closed his eye in bliss and rubbed his head all over the man in an entirely unrepentant way that still managed to exude superiority. I began to like the cat. The man, on the other hand . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve answered your question,\u201d I said, my haughtiness returning with my strength. \u201cNow you will answer mine. Who are you? And what are you? You smell wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Casper Sterling,\u201d It was unsettling, the way his eyes held mine. I refused to blink as I waited for the answers he owed me. \u201cI\u2019m the greatest musician in London, maybe in the entire world of Sang. And I\u2019m mostly drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s wrong about you. I know the smell of drink. It\u2019s something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI answered your question, princess,\u201d he snarled. \u201cNow we bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will admit I owe you a debt,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cAnd you owe me one as well. We are even.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a dark, empty, reckless sound.</p><p>\u201cI owe you? We\u2019re even? Bullshit. You attacked me, and I saved your life anyway. You owe me. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut me. Where I come from, those who threaten the lives of nobles are lucky to be drawn, quartered, and left for the bludlemmings and snow wolves. If you were my servant and you purposefully drew my blud, as you have, your entire family would be staked on the frozen hills and nibbled to death at a party. The debt you owe me is far greater than the one I owe you because I am naturally superior to you in species and breeding.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. He glared back. Then he stood and walked over to me, his bare feet brushing the ripped and faded taffeta of my skirt. Leaning down, his face inches from mine, he bared his teeth at me. At me! I could feel the malevolence and alcohol rolling off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cHurt me, then. Go on. Bite me. End me. I\u2019ve lost everything I ever valued. I would welcome it, princess.\u201d</p><p>It came out as a growl through shining teeth, and I flinched in spite of myself. I raised one shaking, black-scaled hand. Our eyes were locked, his pupils pinpricks in twilight blue. With every ounce of strength I could muster, filled with anger at his base nature and fury at his pity, I curled my sharp talons around his throat. I could see the pulse hammering there, smell the anger pounding through him. I tightened my grip, seeking the wet burst of his skin and the hard ridges of his spine.</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d His lips curled back over canine teeth that were sharper than I had expected. \u201cEnd it! Send me back to the grave where I belong, you goddamn monster!\u201d</p><p>I hissed at him and squeezed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even pierce his skin.</p><p>I let go of his neck, my throat convulsing in a sob. I couldn\u2019t even take what was mine. He was right\u2014I was a monster. A broken one.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I fell back onto the boards and curled on my side, sobbing. A single tear rolled down my cheek and fell to my wrist, leaving a pink trail. The little strength I\u2019d gained was gone. I needed more blood if I was going to kill him. And I was going to kill him, because any human who saw royal tears had seen his own doom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to end you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m going to find blood, and I\u2019m going to get strong, and I\u2019m going to drain you dry. Nothing shall be more beautiful than your death.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me strangely. \u201cYou do that,\u201d he said in a voice as ragged as torn paper.</p><p>I was starting to lose consciousness again, but I felt his arms around me, lifting me from the ground and carrying me. The velvet curtains whispered past, brushing my boots.</p><p>The last thing I heard before I passed out was his whispered, \u201cDeath has to be better than this.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>My first thought upon waking was that all this passing out was terribly uncouth. My second thought was that I wanted to kiss whoever had taken off my boots. My third thought, as I wiggled my toes, was that I would probably have to kill them after I\u2019d kissed them, because people can\u2019t just go around undressing princesses without permission. My fourth thought was that I wasn\u2019t a princess anymore. If my mother truly was dead, I was the Tsarina.</p><p>Then I realized that Casper was watching me.</p><p>I took stock of my body with eyes still closed and feigning sleep. Although I remembered everything that had happened since waking in the awful valise, I still had no idea where I was, what day it was, what year it was, or what my captor/savior wanted from me. I needed to strategize, but my thoughts were as muddled as a snowstorm on a moonless night.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake, princess. I can see you wiggling your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou again, servant?\u201d I tried to sit up and smacked my forehead on something hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe eaves are rather low,\u201d he said bitterly as I floundered. \u201cI can\u2019t afford better. This ain\u2019t the Ice Palace.\u201d</p><p>My eyes adjusted to the dimness as I managed to roll onto an elbow. He was across the small room\u2014more of a closet, really\u2014sitting on a stool as he pulled on a pair of shiny knee-high boots with silver toe caps. I wanted to say something snide, but he was too interesting. The scruffy, careless, drunken wastrel I\u2019d encountered earlier had metamorphosed into a sleekly handsome creature just this side of a dandy. Tight suede breeches, a flouncy shirt with feathery layers of lace, and a gem-encrusted coat winked in the twilight. His hair shimmered over his shoulders in glossy waves. He reminded me of my mother\u2019s favorite pet Pinky dressed up for a parade, although there was something vaguely threatening about him. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what it was, his posture or his scent or his wolfish grin, but something dangerous lurked under the surface of Casper Sterling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to perform.\u201d He stood, checking his image in a hanging mirror. \u201cYou need to stay right where you are. I looked up some old broadsheets, and anyone less drunk would recognize you in a heartbeat. So start thinking about what you can do to change that, starting with your hair.\u201d</p> <p>My bare hand went to the long white-blond curls rippling over the side of the bed. Ye gods, had he taken the pins out while I\u2019d slept? I was scandalized, to think of those long fingers buried in my hair. And he actually expected me to change my favorite feature? I couldn\u2019t alter the ice-blue eyes of my Muscovy heritage, so my hair was the only logical choice. Then I realized the implications of what he had said.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I disguise myself?\u201d I pulled my shoulders back and stuck out my chin despite an unladylike position. \u201cI am the princess. I will soon be Tsarina. Once the authorities are made aware of my whereabouts, I will be returned to the Ice Palace. You may even be rewarded for your trouble.\u201d</p><p>Before we drain you and eat your heart on toast, I added silently.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Freesia. And Freesia isn\u2019t what it was four years ago. There\u2019s civil unrest there, talk of revolt against the landed Bludmen\u2019s harsh rule. The price on your head is high, and if you actually made it back home alive, Ravenna would have you killed. If the people still want you, they don\u2019t know it. They\u2019re completely in her power. Mesmerized or bullied or fed only propaganda. Perhaps all of the above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Each word dripped icicles.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I lie? This is London, and I\u2019m a has-been playing tunes for coppers in a third-rate Blud bar. I\u2019m a dancing monkey. If I wanted to hurt you, I would have turned you in to the Coppers while you were asleep and taken the reward.\u201d He tied his cravat and flashed his dimpled grin. \u201cIt\u2019s up to a thousand silvers, you know. They think you\u2019re dead. But someone\u2019s not willing to bet on it.\u201d</p><p>On the outside, my nostrils flared. On the inside, I was breaking apart, cracks invading me like a glacier about to plummet into the fathomless deep. If he wasn\u2019t lying, my parents were gone, and the beautiful palace where I\u2019d led a charmed life was more than a thousand miles away and no longer safe. The sea, the mountains, the wilds of the tundra standing in my way were rendered insignificant only by the understanding that someone wanted me dead. And they had very nearly gotten their way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get back.\u201d I had to discover what Ravenna held over my country and my last remaining sibling. If it was as bad as he had described, it was my duty to them and my birthright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d worry about standing up first. Looks like you were drained to the cusp of death. What\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward into a golden ray of sunset shining through a window so small it resembled a porthole. The bloodshot whites of his eyes served only to enhance the blue. I inhaled deeply and found that his smell nagged at me. He wasn\u2019t a Bludman, that was for sure. But what was he?</p><p>And where had I been for the last four years?</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing I remember clearly was sitting by the fountain in the back courtyard. There was a thin layer of ice on top, like the film on blood br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I was tracing patterns in the ice, watching the koi swim underneath, trying to reach my fingers through the crust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I was in the dark, plotting your death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nice,\u201d I growled. With a bit of a struggle, I pulled myself to sitting on the other end of the bed, where the eaves weren\u2019t so low. \u201cNice is for nursemaids and stable boys. I\u2019m royalty. And I\u2019m a pragmatist. And I wake up cranky. Why do you smell different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your servant.\u201d</p> <p>I hissed. \u201cIf you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s very sweet, you threatening me all the time. But you\u2019re weak, you\u2019re wanted, and you\u2019re in my power. Deal with it. I\u2019ve got to be onstage in five minutes, or I won\u2019t have the money to buy more blood for you. Can I trust you to stay here?\u201d</p><p>Finally, something I could work with.</p><p>I smiled my most beguiling smile, showing kitten teeth and batting my eyelashes. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll just take a nap while I wait, and then we can arrange transportation.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, and my cheeks grew hot.</p><p>\u201cYou know, two years ago, I would have fallen for that, hook, line, and sinker. But a lot\u2019s happened since then, and now I know a lying woman when I see one.\u201d</p><p>My hands made fists in the scratchy blanket on his bed. I was growing accustomed to the feeling of my overgrown nails digging into cloth. It didn\u2019t bother me so much now. But as I settled my feet on the floor and curled into an attack position, he calmly put a gloved hand against my shoulder and shoved me, hard, back onto the bed.</p><p>I spluttered in indignation and fought gravity, but I was still very weak. It had cost me everything I had just to sit up. Shame nearly killed me, taking over where the draining left off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you, princess. I don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re going to do, but I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d He mucked around in a crooked drawer and held up a handful of silk cravats.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>I struggled, but it was no good. He hummed under his breath as he tied my hands together at the wrists. When he reached for my stocking-clad ankles, deeply bred propriety propelled my weakly kicking feet.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I gasped, \u201chas ever touched my ankles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever threatened to kill me ten times in ten different ways in one day.\u201d He neatly snagged my feet and wound my ankles around with a wine-colored length of silk. \u201cBut I need this job. I\u2019ve drunk my way through every theater and bar in the city, and it\u2019s Deep Darkside and Beggar\u2019s Row after this. I won\u2019t let myself fall that far.\u201d</p><p>He was talking to himself now. I was bound, hand and foot, trussed up like a fly in a spider\u2019s web\u2014or, to be more honest, like a spider temporarily restrained by a very foolish fly. My mind turned from escape to cunning, and I held very still, letting him go on. The more I could learn about my prey-turned-captor, the better my chances of besting him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI died. You don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like. Or maybe you do, now. But music is the only thing I have left. I was famous. Celebrated, in two different worlds. And both times, I lost it. A girl I thought I loved told me that loss was supposed to be my salvation. But you know what? I don\u2019t feel saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is ever safe,\u201d I added, my voice soothing.</p><p>He pulled a coin from his pocket and began flipping it back and forth over his knuckles. His eyes closed, and a look of pain flickered over his features. Faster and faster the coin spun in the last rays of evening, glinting in the light and showing me the copper-cast face of a kindly old man with a mustache. I didn\u2019t move a muscle. I simply studied my prey, as I had been taught. He swallowed hard, and I focused on his lips, on the sensual curve of the lower one, waiting to see what he would reveal next.</p><p>\u201cOi, Maestro,\u201d someone called, the voice tinny and echoing somewhere beyond the closed door. \u201cIt\u2019s your last chance, mate. You\u2019d better get down here and start playing, unless you want to end up in the gutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore threats,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cIt must be Monday.\u201d</p><p>He checked the knots again, and seeing that I\u2019d managed to wiggle just the tiniest bit loose, he yanked them hard enough to make me yelp in a decidedly unladylike manner.</p><p>\u201cHow dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well how I dare.\u201d His gaze traveled over me, and he took a deep breath as if scenting the air. \u201cJust remember when you\u2019ve regained your strength that I could have done a lot worse to you.\u201d He licked his lips as his eyes lingered on the low cut of my gown, giving me a dark look that heated me straight through. I showed him my teeth.</p><p>He patted my hair, and I shook him off with a hiss. The movement pushed me past the point of exhaustion, but I hated the thought of his filthy peasant hands touching me. In my head, I killed him for the thousandth time, laughing as his blood painted my teeth.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t remember what you didn\u2019t do,\u201d I said under my breath as I curled onto my side and prepared to sleep or pass out or whatever kept taking me over. \u201cI\u2019ll only remember this.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>I drifted in and out of sleep, too empty to dream. When I woke, I could hear the strains of his harpsichord somewhere below me, sometimes dulcet and slow and seductive, sometimes loud and brash and accompanied by the stomping of boots and ribald shouts and singing. Still, there was a melancholy undertone to the music, a sadness rippling under the surface of even the happiest tunes. I felt like that inside\u2014a yawning chasm of sorrow that couldn\u2019t be filled. But I was going to do something about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the door finally opened, I was mostly awake, lying on my side and diligently sawing through the silk cravat around my wrists with my fangs. I didn\u2019t try to hide it from him. I just smiled around what was left of his tie and continued gnawing. With the black cat trotting at his heels, he ducked through the door and went about his business as if I wasn\u2019t there. He tossed his gloves onto the dresser and cracked his knuckles one at a time, watching me in bemusement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a feisty little monster, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he finally asked, slurring a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a monster.\u201d I spat out bits of cravat and rubbed my sore wrists. The silk tasted too closely of human and soap and something else, a musky stink that I didn\u2019t like. I tossed it onto the ground, and Tommy Pain batted it around as if it was a toy. It was charming, this cat creature. But Casper wasn\u2019t. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand who I am or what I mean. You\u2019re uncivilized.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivility depends upon not tying people up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf our roles were reversed, you wouldn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019d take your time killing me. I can see it in your eyes. It\u2019s a shame, too. They\u2019d be pretty, if they weren\u2019t so set on murder.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, low and sweet. He didn\u2019t know the half of it. But I\u2019d been thinking. I had figured out a way to get what I wanted all around. My strength back, my life back, my revenge, and, in time, his head on a silver platter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to murder you anymore.\u201d I smiled sweetly. \u201cI think we can help each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you, now?\u201d He turned his back to me. My anger flared, that he thought me so inconsequential and harmless.</p><p>He was undressing. I had to turn my eyes\u2014or at least appear to. Not only because I was scandalized but because despite the strange stink, he was still full of blood barely contained by warm skin. As my beloved old nursemaid used to say, even a cracked teacup made a fine vessel for the right drink. And this teacup was far from cracked.</p><p>He tossed his glittering jacket over the dresser and wrenched off his cravat. Next came the frilly shirt, shrugged overhead and flung into the corner. His skin was golden, almost unheard of in my country, where ice-white was in fashion. He was more broadly built than the royals I had grown up with, and his muscular shoulders didn\u2019t need any padding. Fine curly hair on his chest caught in the lamplight, trailing down and down.</p><p>I heard the button on his breeches and may have peeked out of idle curiosity, but he seemed to recall where he was at that moment and stopped, eyes meeting mine with a sneer. Instead, he kicked his boots across the room and slammed a fist into the faded white paint on the wall. Tommy Pain shot under the low bed with a hiss. The cracked mirror hanging from a wire fell to the ground and shattered to pieces, each shard reflecting the pathetic little room and us, its pathetic inhabitants.</p><p>Me, a lost princess and future queen, far from home and so weak I couldn\u2019t untie the cravat around my ankles. Him, an uncivilized and fallen . . . whatever he was. I could read rage in the tension of his back, in the white of his fists against the crumbling wall where the mirror had been. Even in stillness, he was a tempest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s seven years of bad luck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already put in three.\u201d He lightly banged his forehead against the plaster. \u201cWhat will be left of me in four more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you accept my bargain, a wealthy man.\u201d I sat up. \u201cNow, have you any more vials?\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from the wall and pinned me with a steely blue glare. I didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d I added, as much as it pained me.</p><p>With a chuckle, he fished three glass tubes out of his jacket and uncorked the first one Pinky-style, with two hands. By the time I\u2019d downed all of the vials, I had enough strength to untie my feet and stand, although the ceiling didn\u2019t allow even my child-sized frame a decent stretch. I hadn\u2019t stood since I\u2019d attacked him downstairs, and my corset hung loosely around my waist and itched. I was well trained enough not to scratch.</p><p>He watched me the entire time, cautious but curious and unsmiling. Casper made me feel self-conscious, which I deeply resented, since a princess existed only to be admired and feared. Another mark against him. I looked down at the rumpled sack of a dress hanging from my wasted frame. It had once been my third-best gown, the height of fashion, hand-sewn with golden thread. What must he think of me, weak and girlish and left to rot in a suitcase? And yet there was something hungry lurking in his gaze.</p><p>I would teach him what to think of me. I reached down to hand him his cravat.</p><p>\u201cHere is the bargain I offer you.\u201d I folded my hands together and mimicked my mother\u2019s precise intonation. \u201cI must return to my people. I understand that I am being hunted and that I am recognizable, and I admit that I know little of the squalid life outside of the Ice Palace. You will disguise me and escort me to Muscovy, acting as guide and guard. You will help me discover what power Ravenna holds over my kingdom, and you will help me depose her. If we are successful, you will be court musician to the Tsarina of Freesia, composer to the Snow Court of Muscovy. You will never want again. Whatever you are, you will have whatever you need. Whatever you wish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever I wish?\u201d One eyebrow went up, and a strange recognition shuddered through me. I ignored it.</p><p>\u201cWithin reason.\u201d</p><p>The cold silence hung between us, the shards of the mirror on the floor brighter than snow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to bargaining, are you?\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve basically told me that if I can do the impossible, keep you alive for more than a thousand miles, and depose one of the most powerful despots in the entire world, then I can sit around and play the harpsichord in the snow whenever you crook your little claw. But I\u2019ll still be an inferior, won\u2019t I? Your pet slave.\u201d He chuckled and leaned back against the wall, crossing his bare feet. \u201cIt\u2019s what they call a fool\u2019s bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou strike me as a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, because I\u2019m here, crouched in the attic and playing piano for blue-collar bloodsuckers who can\u2019t tell Beethoven from Brahms? Because I spend most of my time drunk and wishing for something stronger than drink? Or because I took pity on what I thought was a starving child but was actually a murderous little ice bitch with plans of world domination?\u201d</p><p>As he panted with anger and hunched over, stalking toward me in the scant space between us, I saw in him the echoes of a Bludman\u2019s inner beast and wondered, in truth, what he was. But I smiled at his little tirade.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool because you underestimate me.\u201d I ran a thumb over the edge of the mirror shard hidden behind my skirt, swiped from the ground when his back was turned.</p><p>Then I pounced for his neck.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much strength or weight to knock him over\u2014he must have been drunker than he seemed. His arm jerked up just in time to stop my slash for his jugular, and I hissed and aimed for his bare shoulder. The mirror shard plunged into his skin, and as he shrieked and struggled, I yanked out the tip and pressed my mouth to the wound.</p><p>Finally. Real blood. Straight from the animal, as it should be. Vials could never equal this rush, this eye-rolling pleasure.</p><p>Except.</p><p>I pulled back and stared at the blood dribbling from the wound. It wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>In that second of curiosity, as Casper clutched at his shoulder and swore in words I\u2019d never heard before, something heavy landed on my back with a screech. Claws dug into the tender flesh above my corset, and teeth nipped against my neck. I growled in response and scrabbled at the heavy, furry shape with my talons. With one last, insulted hiss, Tommy Pain leaped off me and shot back under the bed, where he growled menacingly from the shadows.</p><p>I decided that I had mixed feelings about cats.</p><p>Casper erupted under me, dumping me onto the dusty floorboards in a heap. He lurched away to where the mirror used to be, then swore some more as he tried to find another way to assess the damage I\u2019d done. I licked my lips meditatively, still wondering what the bitter taste might be. My already ruined dress now resembled a garbage sack, and creamy straggles of dusty hair tangled over my shoulders, sticky with blood and old wine. And I was still raging with hunger. His blood wasn\u2019t perfect, but it would have served its purpose if I hadn\u2019t stopped to deliberate.</p><p>Had I been a lesser being, I would have felt very sorry for myself. I might have endeavored to cry again. As it was, I held out a hand toward Casper and said, \u201cYou may consider us equal. Your blood in exchange for having restrained me. Shall we be friends?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean it. Not the equal part, not the friends part. I\u2019d seen a human singing to some pigeons once, luring one close enough to twist its neck. I could sing like that, too.</p><p>He looked at my hand as if it still held the scrap of mirror. Luckily, his blood had already clotted, so it wasn\u2019t hard to control myself. I\u2019d gotten a couple of good mouth-fuls, and it was enough. But I wanted him to help me up. I wanted him to start thinking of himself as my servant. So I smiled. And I waited.</p><p>Casper stood over me so long that my arm started to shake. I had thus far managed to ignore my body\u2019s constant groans and aches since my emergence from the valise. But even fresh blood couldn\u2019t fix four years of starvation, stillness, and atrophy, not even on a Bludwoman\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I added hopefully.</p><p>He dug into his pocket and dropped another vial into my hand instead. My black-scaled fingers curled around the cool glass on instinct, and I was already thinking of how good it would taste going down. I\u2019d never drunk more than two vials in a day, but I felt that I would never be full again.</p><p>\u201cDrink it,\u201d he said, his voice dull and deadly. \u201cI have errands to run. If you still want to strike this ridiculous bargain, you\u2019ll stay here, in this room, and sleep. You\u2019re going to need strength and stamina for this to work. I\u2019ll be here when you wake up, and I\u2019ll be ready to leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll help me, then? You\u2019ll take me back to Freesia?\u201d</p><p>The naive hope rose in my voice. Maybe that was what finally tipped his scales.</p><p>\u201cAnything is better than this.\u201d He nodded once and stormed out of the room.</p> <p>I was swallowing the blood before his bare feet slapped down the stairs.</p><p>I had guessed right\u2014he was a fool. And I knew exactly what to do with fools.</p><p>5</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sleep. There was too much to contemplate\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to give Casper the satisfaction of my obedience. The longer I lay there, staring at the low ceiling, the more I thought of what I had lost. My parents had not been warm and loving\u2014how could they, predators and royal to boot? And my sister, Olgha, had been even worse. But they had been my family, my anchor, the structure around which my life had been planned. And now that plan was gone, and I was alone and distraught.</p><p>All that, and the stupid cat kept making an entirely inappropriate rumbling noise from underneath the bed. So I gave up on sleep and did something I had never done before.</p> <p>I snooped. I tossed drawers, rifled through pockets, hunted for loose floorboards, and even turned over the mattress, much to Tommy Pain\u2019s chagrin. And I wasn\u2019t sneaky about it, either. If Casper wasn\u2019t going to play nice, neither was I.</p><p>The infuriating man appeared to own very little. His clothes, a hidden bottle of wine sealed with wax, and a small notebook with bizarre poetry in nearly illegible handwriting. Angry slashes marred almost every page. The first page said \u201cLeaves of Grass,\u201d which seemed beyond ridiculous. Blades of grass, maybe. But leaves? I flipped through the book, trying to understand what appeared to be a very angry and scattered mind.</p><p>One phrase stood stark on a page, each word written in block letters with a heavy pen.</p><p>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,</p><p>Hoping to cease not till death.</p><p>Fuck you, Walt Whitman.</p> <p>What a singularly bizarre man. With his things arrayed before me, I was no closer to mastering the servant I would pretend to befriend for the sake of my country. And I was running out of time. Improper and awkward as it was, I flopped onto the dusty floor and stuck my arm as far under the unkempt bed as I could. My hand grazed something small tucked against the wall, and I withdrew from the shadows with the object in my hand and a scratch from Tommy Pain for my trouble.</p><p>It was a little box of polished wood with a simple hinge and clasp. I flicked it open. Inside I found a single copper coin and a deep red feather.</p><p>\u201cTrying to kill the Maestro wasn\u2019t good enough. Now you\u2019re stealing from him, too?\u201d someone said from the door.</p><p>I slammed the box shut and threw it back under the bed, where it hit the mad cat with a hearty thwack. He shot out of the darkness and curled up in the corner to lick his nethers in an extremely improper fashion. I coughed politely.</p><p>Even if my height was never going to make me imposing, I still stood before I faced my accuser. And for once, I was taller than someone. Through the successive layers of grimy and stained clothing and the leather aviator\u2019s hat and goggles, I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. A girl, a boy, a child, a youth. Only one thing I could tell from across the small room: it was human.</p><p>And I was going to drain it.</p><p>\u201cI lost a hairpin under the bed,\u201d I said crisply. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault if he chooses to keep his sundries among the dustlemmings.\u201d</p><p>I glided toward my prey, my fingers curling into claws. The figure smirked and showed me a knife.</p> <p>\u201cLesson one. Don\u2019t kid a kidder, kid. You suck on me, and Casper will turn you in for a thousand well-earned silvers unless I can gut you first. I\u2019m Keen, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to the mongrel child. \u201cGreetings, Keen. I am Ahnastasia, princess of the Great Snow Court of Muscovy, crown capitol of the Tsarina of Freesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m the bloody king of Franchia.\u201d Keen grinned with surprisingly white teeth for what I had to assume was a diseased foundling. Tommy Pain had completed his vile self-grooming and twined around Keen\u2019s feet. When the stained brown gloves began to scratch under his chin, he rumbled like a steam engine.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care about that maddening man?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNone of your goddamn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to get that a lot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because poor people like us hate rich people who try to make us feel like crap,\u201d Keen answered with slitted eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo I look rich to you?\u201d I held my hands out to show my ruined, blood-spattered dress.</p><p>\u201cMaestro told me you\u2019ve been stored in a suitcase for four years, so of course your frock looks like a handkerchief somebody sneezed in. But I bet that thread\u2019s still made of enough gold to feed me for a year. I see you staring at me like I\u2019m nothing, like I should be bowing and kissing your feet. That\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d</p><p>I sat down on the bed, glaring. Taking a sphere of tarnished brass from a jacket pocket, the little urchin tossed and rolled it from one gloved hand to another with a private smile. I watched for a few moments, noting the markings and indentations in the metal, wondering what the thing was. Raised eyebrows told me I was being purposefully tortured. I sighed in resignation, exhausted from the small act of standing.</p><p>\u201cEnough of this ridiculous standoff. Where is your Maestro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting ready for the trip. He asked me to fetch you to the costumer\u2019s for your disguise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. He\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>I patted my dress and hair, as if anything I could do with my own two hands would prepare me for being seen on the street. What if there were people out there\u2014and not people like Casper and Keen but People. Real people, people who mattered, people who might know me. I cringed inwardly and tilted my head benevolently.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am ready, then. Lead on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got to do something first.\u201d Keen burst into a wide, toothy grin. I finally understood, seeing that brilliant smile, that she was a girl, a young and pretty one, hiding for some reason under short hair and shapeless clothes and a silly hat. Something evil glinted in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d I crossed my arms and nodded. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>She reached into her jacket, tucked the sphere away, and pulled out a pair of jagged, rusty scissors, the sort of thing our gardeners would have saved for lopping off weeds and the heads of pesky bludlemmings.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we got to cut your hair off.\u201d</p><p>I drew back and hissed, clutching long white-blond locks to my chest.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDeal or no deal, princess?\u201d She snicked the scissors open and closed. \u201cThey always got room for bludwhores in the next bar over, if you ain\u2019t willing.\u201d</p><p>My hair had never been cut. Not once in my entire twenty-seven years of life. No, make that thirty-one. I had lost four years, and I was well on my way to being whispered about at court as a spinster, if I lived long enough for some snide baroness to call me such. But Keen left me with little choice, and I knew well enough that my hair was my most recognizable feature.</p><p>The little monster didn\u2019t even let me brush it first. As soon as I\u2019d pulled out the few silver pins that remained, she darted behind me and wrapped a grimy glove around the knee-length mass. I yelped and fought her, but that only pulled the hair taut and straight, and I was still weak. She took advantage of my mistake to hack into the mess with her clippers, and tears stung my eyes in pain and sadness. The tugging hurt, but the injured vanity hurt more.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d She held up more than three feet of my pride and joy, a hunting trophy. It was shiny, beautiful, and the color of buttermilk, if slightly dusty and blood-streaked buttermilk. The color was unusual in Freesia and had been my trademark. I grabbed for it, but she danced back, winding it around her hand and stuffing it neatly into a bag. She pocketed the pins, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d I said menacingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to buy your disguise. Which we can\u2019t get until we cut off even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I felt for the cruelly snagged ends of my remaining locks. They fell just below my shoulders. It was a tragedy. My fingers played with the rough curls, and I glared at Keen, imagining her head next to Casper\u2019s on a platter.</p><p>\u201cLook, lady. It\u2019s simple. Do you want to live, or do you want to die? Somebody wants you to lie down and stuff it, and you don\u2019t strike me as the sort of bitch that\u2019s going to oblige. So let\u2019s get on with it before the shops close and your type fills the streets, eh? Short hair ain\u2019t so bad. And you\u2019re less likely to get the nits.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. Common folk and their filth had never been a consideration before. Did I see things moving in her dull, mud-brown hair, or was that just my imagination?</p><p>She took a step toward me, scissors held out. I slapped her arm away, and quick as a snake, she slapped my arm with her free hand. It fell to my side, limp. I had never been struck before. The little beast took advantage of my shock to shove me onto Casper\u2019s stool. I tried to stand, but her foot pinned my skirts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind stabbing you,\u201d she said in a businesslike manner, \u201cbut you\u2019ll look nicer if you just let me take care of it.\u201d</p><p>In the end, I sat there, stunned and already grieving my youth and beauty. Each snippet of ice-white hair that fluttered to the ground felt like a year of my life. Instead of feeling lighter, my head felt weighed down by all the sorrow in the world. I was weak. I was lost. And now I was ugly.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Keen said at last. \u201cAnd a lovely job it is, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>I thought about scooping up another shard of mirror to see the damage she\u2019d done, but I knew that I was too distraught to stop myself from stabbing her, and then Casper would never help me. What was done was done.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>Keen shoved something green and smelly into my hands. I dumped it onto the floor, where Tommy Pain batted it about.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want that hat, you know,\u201d Keen said. \u201cYour hair stands out. You\u2019ve got to cover it, at least until we can get some dye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the end of my emotional rope and badly in need of blood and non-Keen company, I shoved the hat onto my head. It was large and floppy and made of the itchiest substance I\u2019d ever touched, the sort of thing an old servant man would wear to keep the rain off.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you find anything smaller than this monstrosity?\u201d I tried to arrange it so it wouldn\u2019t itch. \u201cI could fit Tommy Pain in here and still have room for\u2014\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, eyes wide. She grinned her evil grin again, the one that transformed her face into something beatific. And something that I wanted to destroy. I threw the hat at her instead. She caught it neatly and twirled it around a finger. Anger bubbled up in my chest.</p> <p>\u201cI could have stuffed all my hair in here, you brat. We didn\u2019t have to cut it off yet, or so badly. It didn\u2019t have to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We didn\u2019t. But I think it was more fun this way. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see your head\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a platter. Yeah, the Maestro told me about that. Why would you even want someone\u2019s head on a platter? It would just wobble around and leak and make a mess, and they\u2019d be all staring at you with their dead eyes. A pike would be so much more dramatic. Or a fishbowl full of whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019ve been giving it some thought,\u201d I snapped.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with enemies.\u201d</p><p>While we bantered, my traitorous hands crept up to what was left of my curls. My talons caught on the tangled ends, and my breath hitched. People could see my ears. It was the worst disaster since the last blood famine.</p><p>She snickered and patted the bag. \u201cGoing to get a good price for it, you know. Bloody idiots will think it\u2019s a unicorn tail with magical properties, make it into good-luck watch fobs. You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagical properties? You\u2019ve obviously never met a unicorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t met a sea monster or hellbear, either.\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to grin and flash my pointed teeth. \u201cThen you haven\u2019t been to Freesia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSave the fairy tales for the kiddies, princess.\u201d But I had seen her tough fa\u00e7ade falter, just for a moment. I was guessing she\u2019d never been out of London and was scared of travel. She had reason to be, if she thought she was coming with us to Freesia. And now I had a little something to hold over her. Excellent.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not fairy tales, ragamuffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re still in London, and we\u2019re running late. So let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I took my time tightening my corset and lacing my old boots back on. Four years ago, they had been as soft as a baby\u2019s cheek, perfectly tanned bludelk leather dyed to a deep gold. Now they were cracked with age and disuse, the laces hard and bent. As for my dress, there was nothing I could do about it, and I didn\u2019t want her filthy little paws on my person anyway. I snatched the hat back and draped it over my head, hiding my face under the sagging brim.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a drunk grandmother,\u201d Keen said with a laugh. \u201cJust stagger about a bit and burp every now and then. They\u2019ll just assume you\u2019re blitzed on bludwine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s go. Don\u2019t speak to anyone. Try to hunch over a bit like there ain\u2019t a red-hot poker up your bum. Don\u2019t say anything about heads on platters.\u201d She yanked a faded plaid blanket from Casper\u2019s bed and tossed it over my shoulders. It smelled like him, good and bad at the same time. \u201cAnd keep this around your shoulders and neck. Hide your hands. They ain\u2019t so nice to Bluddies where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>I arranged the pathetic little scrap of fabric the way I\u2019d seen our old Pinky cook wear her shawl while making bloodcakes or mixing the potion for my baths. I hunched over, letting my head slump forward and bending my knees. It went against everything in my blud, pretending to be something less than I was. But I\u2019d heard wild rumors of the Pinkies of Sangland, who held sway over the Bludmen in a blasphemous sort of power struggle that went against nature itself. I wasn\u2019t ready to be drained again or hit in the face with a moldy bit of vegetable.</p> <p>Without a word, she led me out the door and down the rickety stairs. I was pleased to discover that I could walk, but I was still exhausted. It was like the dreamy ache of falling asleep beside the fire after a daylong hunt, but without the pleasant floaty feeling of a belly full of fresh blood.</p><p>We passed several open doors, one showing the empty music hall where I\u2019d first found Casper and woken in the darkness. A jumble of crates, valises, and flotsam sat in the corner, and I thought I spotted the flap of leather from my own suitcase.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I whispered, and Keen grunted. Before she could stop me, I darted over to the suitcase and scrabbled inside, feeling for some remnant of my old life, some clue to the last four years. The lights were low, since there were no windows, and even with my excellent night vision, I couldn\u2019t see much. I had nearly given up when my talon caught in the fabric lining, tearing it. I felt around between the ragged silk and the leather until something cool scraped my fingertips.</p><p>I pulled out my prize and sighed. I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was contentment or sadness. In my hand was the necklace I\u2019d been wearing that day by the fish pond, the day that, to the best of my memory, was the day of my abduction. White diamonds and blue sapphires winked in a collar that made me look like a glacier carved of ice. It had been a gift from my father for my fifteenth birthday in those beautiful, dancing days before Ravenna had begun to insinuate herself into our family and our state.</p><p>\u201cYou find anything?\u201d Keen called from the doorway.</p><p>I slipped the necklace down the front of my corset and called back, \u201cNo, nothing here.\u201d</p><p>But for some reason, I wasn\u2019t ready to leave the suitcase yet. It had been an unwitting prison, but it was the only clue to my apparent kidnapping. I pushed it over to investigate. Scuffed tan leather, thick and cheaply stitched. On one side, the curved flap I\u2019d carved with my claws. On the other side, a host of odd stickers with strange names I had to squint to read. Stockhelm. Constantinoble. Kyro. Places I\u2019d seen in my books and on the ornate, gemstone-dappled globe in my father\u2019s study. I had apparently been to those faraway places, unconscious and on the verge of death. I had missed the mountains, the sunrises, those abominations called camels that spit blud when angry. So much time and so many opportunities, lost forever.</p><p>And on the top, another sticker had been torn just enough to obscure the recipient\u2019s name. Written in dark red ink, the remaining words read, \u201c-seinist, -uby Lane, -ontown, land.\u201d</p><p>They had shipped me, whoever they were. Like luggage. Less than chattel. Dumped in a case and passed along, hand to hand, never to reach my final destination. And now I knew, at least partially, to whom. And I wasn\u2019t leaving London until I\u2019d learned why.</p><p>6</p><p>I was so busy fighting my way through the streets of London that I barely had time to register the details in the chaos. Head down and shawl-sheltered, I mostly saw Keen\u2019s back, the bag full of my hair bouncing against her grungy jacket. Every time I tried to look up and soak in the shops, the filth in the streets, the mouthwatering children plucking my skirts with innocent grins and handfuls of violets, I would nearly lose my guide. So instead, I focused on the spot between her shoulder blades, thinking about how pleasant it would be to plant a knife there.</p><p>She ducked down an alley, and I followed. We tiptoed over piles of rotten Pinky fodder, past drunks and fallen women, and through the lairs of the biggest bludlemmings I\u2019d ever seen, their maroon fur bristling as they hissed at me. At last, Keen held open a nondescript door, and I stepped into darkness.</p><p>\u201cGods of ice, I\u2019m sick of squalor,\u201d I muttered under my breath. We were in an antechamber, a sad little closet barely big enough for the two of us and the giant black cat that had apparently chased us all the way from the Seven Scars, bludlemmings be damned. I began to see why they called him Tommy Pain, because he certainly was a pain.</p><p>Keen knocked on the inner door, and locks clicked within.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Casper said through the crack before Keen shoved me through.</p><p>The room beyond was nothing like what I had expected from the dismal antechamber and Casper\u2019s room under the eaves. Bright red walls, a salmon-pink ceiling, and a wooden floor painted with giant swirls made my eyes hurt after the grim dullness of everything else I\u2019d seen in London so far. Perhaps these people weren\u2019t as depressing and deadened as I had assumed.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s ze little princess,\u201d mused a cultured lady\u2019s voice with a Franchian accent.</p><p>The tall woman at Casper\u2019s side was mostly uncovered, her skin shimmering with color, red and deep orange and violet like a sunset. Her eyes were black all around, and I would have sworn that feathers were somehow glued to her eyelashes, making them seem as long as fingers. A daimon. I\u2019d never seen one outside of books or paintings.</p><p>I knew I was staring, and I knew it was rude. I forced myself to look down.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, madam. I\u2019ve been out of the world for a long time and have forgotten myself.\u201d</p><p>It was the most polite I\u2019d been in London, mainly because I could sense some common feeling in the proud carriage of this odd lady. If she wasn\u2019t royalty where she came from, she was something close.</p><p>\u201cI understand what it is like to be alone among ze barbarians,\u201d she answered with a coy smile. \u201cAnd I offer my condolences on the loss of your hair. I remember from ze broadsheets that it was quite beautiful.\u201d</p><p>My hand went to the heinous hat. I removed it and dropped it right on Tommy Pain\u2019s head. He shook it off and glared at me with his bright green eye. I almost smiled.</p><p>\u201cI am Madamoiselle Beaureve, but here they call me Reve. If you will allow, I will help you to bathe and dress in a disguise, so that you may travel unimpeded. The price, as you know, is your hair. Do you accept this arrangement?\u201d</p><p>Keen handed her the bag, and Reve opened it with a look of awe. Her skin shivered in feathery patterns of violet and indigo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is very fine. It will be a joy to work with such beautiful hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTruly, you don\u2019t want to know, princess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some sick bastards in this town,\u201d Keen muttered under her breath. Judging by her bitterness, maybe she was older than she looked.</p><p>\u201cIt seems I have no choice but to accept.\u201d</p><p>My eyes met Casper\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t read what I saw there, a stormy mixture of determination and surrender, like a man being sucked into darkness and welcoming the maelstrom. He closed his eyes as if in pain and slipped out the door without a word.</p><p>Reve pooled my golden curls reverently on a work-table with a farewell pat. I told myself that my hair would grow back, that it would one day regain and surpass its former beauty, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I believed it.</p><p>The daimon walked around me, her long tail waving as she plucked my sleeves and felt the stuff of my skirt and tilted my head up with a hot-skinned magenta finger under my chin.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be fun,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She bowed me through another door. I was soon alone, soaking in a copper tub, the water from the steam pipes nearly boiling my skin. Once I got over my inbred fear of water and accepted that there wasn\u2019t a grain of salt in the sweet-smelling bubbles, I was able to finally relax. I hadn\u2019t realized how dusty and tightly wound I had been. The bathtub, clearly selected for Reve, dwarfed my petite form, and I stretched in ecstasy. In the workshop, the daimon would be plucking out the gold thread and burning my old dress, or maybe cutting it into ragged skirts for the less-picky whores. So it was done, then. I was ready to begin the next chapter of my life.</p><p>The water was soon cloudy with the filth of years, and it was delicious to scrub my short hair and feel the water running down my scalp. By the time I exited the steam-filled bathroom wrapped in a skimpy cotton robe, I was almost looking forward to life on the road. I\u2019d never undertaken a journey before, and even if my main companion was an unpleasant ruffian like Casper, at least I wasn\u2019t half-drained in a valise.</p><p>Reve was waiting for me in the workroom, surrounded by heaps of fabric and ribbons.</p><p>\u201cOh la, ch\u00e9rie. You are ready? Good. We begin.\u201d She led me to a tall chair, and I sat, mesmerized by my image in the mirror.</p><p>She fluffed my damp hair with her fingers, which were now green. It curled loosely around my head in a pretty cloud of lightest blond, and I sighed.</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know. Sangland is a bland place, and you are accustomed to standing out. Brown dye will seem cruel to you, but it\u2019s the only way to avoid detection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtifice,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, her voice like water over rocks. \u201cYou are Freesian royalty. You drank artifice with your mother\u2019s milk and blud. This is just a little paint.\u201d</p><p>With quick fingers, she mixed a strange concoction from bottles and powders and coated my hair with dull brown. Without a word and with an ease that suggested prior dealings with Bludmen, she clipped and filed my talons to the exactly proper length. When she finally washed the muck from my hair, I looked like a drowned bludlemming.</p><p>I was accustomed to being primped and dressed, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have known how to do half of it. I was more than content to let myself be manipulated as I meditated on my various plans. Heads on platters. Or spikes. Travel by coach or elegant airship, velvet couches, a parasol at my side. Sinking my teeth into Ravenna\u2019s throat and being welcomed back into the embrace of my country. Raising monuments to my parents and moving into the royal chamber.</p><p>I patted the robe\u2019s pocket, feeling the weight of my jeweled necklace there. I still had riches. It would be a piece of bludcake.</p><p>Reve helped me step into the bulky undergarments favored in London, frilly petticoats that would make my skirt stand out round as a bell.</p><p>\u201cNow for your dress,\u201d she said, and I inspected the rich fabrics and trims draped everywhere.</p> <p>My smile crumbled when she held out the dullest thing in the room.</p><p>\u201cA sack?\u201d I asked, acid in my voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, la, little princess. What you see here are costumes for performers. The dancers, the acrobats, the whores. They all come to me for the brightest, the lowest-cut, the most daring. But you must do your best not to stand out. You must escape notice. Eyes must travel over you and never remember that you existed. That scarlet satin would drop wagging jaws, and then you would find yourself in another suitcase.\u201d</p><p>I poked the dull brown thing draped over her arms. Then I wiped my fingers off on my robe.</p><p>\u201cTell yourself it is a costume. Call the color bronze or palomino. And don\u2019t give up yet\u2014there is more to do.\u201d</p><p>With daggers of distaste in my eyes, I let her dump me into the dress. The rough, canvas-like fabric grated against my wrists and neck. I\u2019d never dressed as a Pinky, never had my throat covered up to my chin, and I wanted to gag with the intimacy of the garment.</p><p>\u201cThis next bit is special,\u201d Reve said, interrupting my sulk. She held something heavy and leathery out to me, and I sneered at it.</p><p>\u201cA saddle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no stirrups, ch\u00e9rie.\u201d</p><p>She winked and lifted my arms to buckle the thing around me. It was a leather corset. And it had to weigh at least twenty pounds.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to torture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you alive, silly goose. A leather corset reinforced with steel bones and extra-thick panels. It works both ways\u2014not only will it keep you from being accidentally stabbed or arrow-shot, but it will make you look like the most frightened Pinky that ever walked the earth. No Bludwoman in her right mind would wear such a thing, no?\u201d</p><p>I could barely move in it, and when she had finished tightening the straps, I could barely breathe. As I panted and glared, Reve glanced at a cuckoo clock and sucked at her lip.</p><p>\u201cWe are running out of time. Quit pouting and act useful.\u201d</p><p>She helped me back into my ragged boots and laced them for me, since I couldn\u2019t bend over. I put on the gloves she gave me and clenched my hands, feeling muffled and dull. I had never put on used clothes before, never had any fabric touch my body that had been touched by uncovered human hands, much less worn by the filthy wretches. It was like wearing trash. Ugly trash. I imagined what my proud mother would think if she saw me like this. Probably retch into a painted ewer at the sight of her favorite daughter drained, dressed in rags, and nearly bald.</p><p>But no. The dead don\u2019t retch.</p><p>\u201cCome and see, ch\u00e9rie.\u201d Reve tugged me toward a looking glass.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t give me a choice, and the Bludwoman in the mirror was a complete stranger. From her huge ice-blue eyes to her hollow cheeks and dirt-colored hair, she was a mystery. The tan dress and dark brown corset went together like a steamer trunk; the little brass hooks up the front heightened the resemblance. Everything was so plain, so worn. There were no frills, no lace, no jewels, no clever wink of golden thread to glitter as I walked. I was no longer a princess. Not even a person. A thing.</p><p>\u201cI am a portmanteau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eyes are the only thing left of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d She tsked. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>She tossed a hat at me and perched a pair of dark glasses over my nose. The hat was a smallish topper that buckled under the chin, rough canvas, more tan with gray plumes. I tried to fasten it on correctly, but with my fingers entombed in gloves, it was hopeless. She snatched it from me and arranged everything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn how to do all of this yourself.\u201d She canted the hat at a slight angle, nearly choking me. \u201cCasper has worked in a caravan. He can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him that if he touched me again, I would see his head on a platter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a man who once devised a platter for just such occasions,\u201d she mused with a little smile. \u201cIt had an elegantly barbed spike in the middle and an outside trough to catch the blood. Like a moat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like his address, please,\u201d I said without a trace of humor. And then I remembered my secondary plot. \u201cAnd I need your help deciphering this note. Have you paper and pen?\u201d</p><p>She provided them, and I struggled to write in the damnable gloves. Four years of disuse combined with an annoying amount of kidskin between my fingers meant that my handwriting was barely legible, but she understood almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cThe tasseinist on Ruby Lane. Mr. Sweeting. You cannot go there. He is a fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what is a tasseinist?\u201d</p><p>Her skin rippled into mottled shades of lavender and sea green and brown. I\u2019d seen a similar configuration when I\u2019d found a long-dead Pinky on a hunt once. Bruise and rot. Whatever a tasseinist was, it scared her.</p><p>\u201cIt is horrid, what a tasseinist does. How do you say it? Like a taxidermist but for people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would want such things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScientists. Loved ones who can\u2019t let go. Sadists. Those who would preserve the flesh with hopes of reanimating it. It is a dark place, indeed. He is a daimon like me, but a very bad one who feeds on the basest of emotions. Do not go there. And where did you find this address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it somewhere,\u201d I said lightly.</p><p>If I told her that it was my body\u2019s original destination, I\u2019d never find a way to get there. As it was, I barely had the stomach for it. But I knew that I needed whatever answers Mr. Sweeting might hold before I went up against the formidable Ravenna. And I had a disguise now, so my only concern was getting to Ruby Lane before Casper returned.</p><p>\u201cI have work to do,\u201d Reve said. \u201cPlease make yourself at home. Keen has some blood for you in the sitting room, I believe.\u201d</p><p>She waved me toward another door, and I realized just how hungry I was. Growing up in the palace, I had never known hunger. It was difficult for a Bludman to grow fat, and my mother had always insisted that I be dainty and refined in my drinking and my killing. But the draining had left me utterly insatiable. I smacked my lips when I saw Keen standing by a bookshelf in the sitting room, her short hair showing a strip of her tender neck to delicious advantage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got only two vials for you.\u201d She laid them on a table. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no cup, so you won\u2019t be able to stick your scaly pinkie in the air.\u201d</p><p>I watched her as I uncorked a vial and downed it in three gulps. It was clear that she hated me, whether because I was a Bludman, a rich Bludman, or just someone she was forced to talk to. But I wasn\u2019t about to broach that topic.</p><p>\u201cCan you read?\u201d I asked instead, seeing her glove brush the line of book spines.</p> <p>She jerked her hand away guiltily. \u201c \u2019Course I can. But nobody gives books to foundlings. It would just give us uppity ideas, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re an orphan, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your bloody business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat again. Your rudeness is intolerable.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cJust because you\u2019re the bitchiest bloodsucker in London doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re my boss.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed as I uncorked the next vial. Hidden hostility I was used to, but this sort of outspoken hatred was entirely new to me, as anyone in Freesia who spoke to me that way would have been on the dinner table within moments. Was this how all the Pinkies of Sangland felt about Bludmen, or did she have a problem with me in particular? I had to find a way to win her over if I wanted her help.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some books of your own? When we\u2019ve succeeded, I\u2019ll give you free run of the library of the Ice Palace, maybe even give you a few volumes for your own collection. I\u2019ve always enjoyed a good novel. Robertson Crusoe, for example.\u201d</p><p>I plucked the novel off the shelf and admired the green leather cover and gold-leafed pages. Longing rippled briefly over her face, and she gulped. Then her eyes went shifty.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want in exchange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very wise child.\u201d I held out the book to her. \u201cI just want to make a little detour before we leave. There\u2019s a shop I\u2019ve been meaning to visit. Would you take me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. But I know it\u2019s on Ruby Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuby Lane? You want me to take you to Ruby Lane?\u201d She threw back her head and laughed, hands on her skinny hips. \u201cThat\u2019s a good joke, lady. Casper would skin me whole if I took you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the heart of Deep Darkside. Chock full of diabolists, bludwhores, opium dens, and the sort of daimon that does more than change color. We\u2019d be lucky to get out alive.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, showing her my fangs, which I knew were stained with blood. \u201cKeen, darling, I may be small and well mannered, but I assure you that I am a killing machine. There is nothing on Ruby Lane that you should fear more than my displeasure.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against the bookshelf, biting her lip and staring at me. I met her eyes. Neither of us blinked. Normally, I was quite good at reading people. But I had no idea what was going on in that shaggy, ill-bred head of hers.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she finally said. \u201cBut we leave now, without a word to Reve. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I grinned, feeling immensely pleased with myself.</p> <p>After all, if things went as I hoped they would, she\u2019d soon be too dead to read any books.</p><p>7</p><p>Escape was easier than anticipated, thanks to the overpowering cabaret tunes belting out of Reve\u2019s gramophone\u2014and mouth\u2014as she worked. The daimon had a lovely, husky voice that quavered with unexpected bitterness. We climbed out a back window and dropped into a filthy alley. The conveniently placed rubbish bin and Keen\u2019s mischievous smile told me that she had done this before.</p><p>Following her through the shadows of London was easier this time around, mostly because we stayed in the less-traveled areas. Every turn seemed to take us into a darker, more miserable alley. I got a closer look at the giant maroon rodents that had hissed at me on my way to Reve\u2019s workshop and realized that they weren\u2019t simply bludlemmings of a different color. These things were the size of Tommy Pain, who had decided to sit out this journey on a tufted footstool. Later I\u2019d have to wonder how the cat knew exactly where things would be safer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d I whispered, tugging on Keen\u2019s jacket.</p><p>\u201cBludrat,\u201d she whispered back over her shoulder. \u201cJust leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>I was happy to comply. Ugly was bad enough, but it was slick with grime, too. I preferred my predators to have some elegance about them. Although I was sure that the bludrats wouldn\u2019t be able to digest me, I didn\u2019t want proof.</p><p>When Keen finally stopped, I almost ran into her. She stood stock-still in front of the darkest alley I\u2019d seen yet. A heavy archway of weeping stones framed the dismal shadows beyond. \u201cRuby Lane\u201d was slashed over the arch in paint too red to be blood. An evil chuckle echoed from the unaccountably thick fog and rolled down the glistening cobblestones.</p><p>\u201cHow picturesque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do it this way on purpose.\u201d Keen shrugged as if she was shaking a spider off her shoulder. \u201cTo keep the wrong sort of people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whom do they consider \u2018the wrong sort of people\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right sort of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get this over with quickly.\u201d I pressed bravely into the gloom.</p><p>We walked side-by-side, and I could barely see her. The mist smelled of magic, and I wondered what sort of hag spent her days conjuring a cloud to hide the dark goings-on of Ruby Lane.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going, then?\u201d Keen asked me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>We passed shivering bundles of clothing that must have been people. We passed small fires that stunk of magic and bones. We passed an old woman selling roasted bludrats on sticks, a sickening steam rising from their charred fur and twitching legs. We held our breath by the Dragon\u2019s Lair, where heady lavender smoke swirled along the ground, beckoning with the mystery of the East. We heard the mournful strains of an out-of-tune harpsichord drunkenly plunking from the Green Fairy\u2019s Sister, the sort of place where the absinthe most likely harbored something worse than wormwood. A two-headed dog followed us briefly, sniffing at my hand and growling before I kicked at it and hissed. It was altogether the most unpleasant place I\u2019d ever seen, outside of my own palace\u2019s dungeon.</p><p>The next shop window stopped me in my tracks, though. Behind the clouded glass, hanging on a stark white wall and arrayed on a shelf, were a variety of monstrosities. Body parts, shiny skulls, deformed fetuses floating in large jars, a stuffed child covered in lizard scales, and a woman\u2019s head mounted on a plaque. Keen kept walking, but I stopped to stare. That woman\u2014I knew her. Correction: had known.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t labeled. And I could tell that the eyes were made of glass, because the color was a little off. But the hair was real and arranged with care, and the earbobs dangling from her ears had surely been borrowed from my mother\u2019s boudoir without permission.</p><p>\u201cSee something you need?\u201d Keen shivered and turned to the next shop.</p><p>I put a glove to the ice-cold glass. \u201cOlgha,\u201d I said stiffly. \u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d she murmured. I didn\u2019t know who that was, and I had expected something snottier from her, but it didn\u2019t come.</p><p>I was mesmerized by the horror, unable to stop staring at features I\u2019d known all my life. From Olgha\u2019s much-bemoaned, overly large nose, inherited straight from our father, to the scar under her right eye that I\u2019d made with my own talons during a squabble over a bit of ribbon, she was trapped forever, mounted like the bludstags and wolf heads on the walls of the palace library. The only thing missing was the other sister. Me.</p><p>\u201cYou still want to do this?\u201d Keen\u2019s voice was pitched low, one foot poised to run.</p><p>\u201cI must. Now more than ever.\u201d</p><p>I steeled myself. Keen handed me a crusty handkerchief, and I wiped the place where tears would have been and settled the dark glasses more firmly on my button nose, which I had fortunately inherited from my mother or possibly, as many said, handsome King Charles of Sveden. Thanks to my unusually light hair, there had been much talk regarding my birth exactly nine months after my parents\u2019 diplomatic mission to Stockhelm. But of course, anyone caught calling me anything other than the true daughter of Tsar Nikolas would have been tortured to death. For the moment, staring through the window, it was a blessing to look nothing like my sister.</p><p>I stepped through the door with a meekness I didn\u2019t feel and pretended to fidget as I\u2019d seen frightened humans do. I didn\u2019t want to appear a threat to this Mr. Sweeting. Not at first.</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t as dusty as it looked from outside. But it was crowded. An army of jars squatted on a bookshelf, each of their freakish inhabitants more grotesque than the last. An entire wall held nothing but heads on plaques, from the usual hunting trophies to more humans and Bludmen, their glass eyes too focused for comfort. A large black bear loomed in the corner, mouth open to show ivory teeth tipped in red. And the glass counter facing the door held anything that could be stuffed and even some things that didn\u2019t seem possible, such as a tiny Kraken that should have collapsed out of water, frozen in time and shiny with varnish. A clockwork fox trotted out from behind the counter and barked, copper wings folded at its sides.</p><p>Something stroked my shoulder with a serpent\u2019s impersonal coldness, and I bit back a hiss. It was a bookish-looking man in a stylish suit, with red skin, a black spade beard, and horns. He was the Pinky devil incarnate, despite his natty cravat, and I disliked him immediately.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, miss?\u201d he said with a crocodile\u2019s smile.</p><p>\u201cI was interested in the earbobs on that . . . er . . . lady\u2019s head in the window. Are they for sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like my usual customers.\u201d He hadn\u2019t blinked yet. Neither had I.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like my usual tasseinist, and you didn\u2019t answer my question. The earbobs. Are they for sale or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, miss. That piece is on reserve for a very important foreign client, half of a matched set, and I can\u2019t dismantle the merchandise. But I\u2019ve got an entire case of trinkets over here, if you\u2019d care to look.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t care to do any such thing, but I couldn\u2019t think of a reasonable response to the contrary. He led me to a different case, shining under a single light. I was treated to the strange theatrics of his tail, which was red and long, with a forked end. It waved around behind him in a distracting sort of way, as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s earbobs you\u2019re looking for, there are several sets in this case. But I must warn you, miss.\u201d He leaned over the glass, his eyes boring into mine. \u201cThese aren\u2019t ordinary goods. I\u2019m not a milliner or a jeweler or even an antiques dealer. Everything in my shop has a price. Some pieces are cursed, some are lucky, most were taken off of dead bodies or stolen from the claws of skeletons. Touch not, lest ye be touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d My nod of dismissal didn\u2019t budge him. \u201cThank you for the warning.\u201d</p> <p>As I considered the case of sparkling jewelry, he loomed over me. Did I imagine that leather wings curled around me, luring me closer to the magical objects within? Surely he had some sort of magic about him, for every object seemed brighter and more beautiful than the last. Gems, necklaces, bracelets, earbobs with silver clips, rings, a diadem, and a set of talons made of rubies all beckoned, whispering on the edge of hearing.</p><p>And then I saw it.</p><p>\u201cThat piddly little ring there, with the blue paste jewel. How much?\u201d</p><p>His gloved hand snaked in and pulled it out.</p><p>\u201cYou have quite the eye, miss.\u201d He rolled the ring back and forth between satin gloves.</p> <p>Somewhere in the back of my mind, I noticed that he had six fingers on each hand. But that wasn\u2019t important. What really mattered was that he was holding the Ring of Freesian Succession, the jewel that announced Olgha\u2019s claim to our matriarchal throne. Its very existence was a deeply kept family secret, or else it would have already been in Ravenna\u2019s lacquered claws, and he surely wouldn\u2019t have had it on display with the other baubles.</p><p>\u201cBut I assure you that this stone is not paste. This, my lady, is a midnight diamond, perfectly formed and flawless. The fifteen blue topazes circling it are cold as ice and said to have mesmerizing powers when wielded by a true witch. It is the finest piece in my collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>I turned in surprise to find Keen standing there, her hands in fists at her sides.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Miss Lorelei. I didn\u2019t see you there, especially as you\u2019ve been forbidden to enter my shop. Perhaps you\u2019d like to leave before I disembowel you?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sweeting\u2019s voice stayed calm and polite, but his tail twitched back and forth, stabbing the air. Something brushed my skirts, and I looked down to see the clockwork fox, wings raised and sharp as hatchets, mouth open and razor-sharp teeth vibrating. I took a step back.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t call me Lorelei, you devil bastard. Second, we both know there\u2019s nothing magical about that manky old trinket. Third of all, you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe our bargain has been satisfied.\u201d He took a menacing step closer.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just go find a Copper, and we\u2019ll have a chat, yeah?\u201d she said, her little chin jutting out.</p><p>\u201cJust because you found me standing in an open grave doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve done anything illegal, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s exactly what it means, daimon.\u201d</p><p>The tension grew as thick as London fog. I cleared my throat. \u201cThis is all very exciting, but I\u2019d really just like to hear the price of that ring, assuming that it is indeed paste, as it appears.\u201d I held up my hands in what I hoped was a harmless fashion. I even remembered not to curl my fingers into talons.</p><p>The tasseinist turned to me with a double row of teeth drawn back in something like a smile. \u201cFine. Let us bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d I said to myself, but he ignored it.</p> <p>\u201cYou give me your true name, and I\u2019ll give you the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy true name? That\u2019s all you want?\u201d I laughed. \u201cBut sir, surely it can\u2019t be worth that much to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look familiar to me.\u201d I could feel his eyes traveling over my face with the skittering invasiveness of insect feet. \u201cAnd certainty is sometimes worth more than silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have a deal. That ring for my true name.\u201d</p><p>We shook. But when I tried to pull my hand back, he held it firmly between his own. His prehensile tail waved, the barbed point coming to rest over my heart, in a place where the leather corset couldn\u2019t protect me.</p><p>\u201cLook into my eyes. I\u2019ll know if you\u2019re lying. And if you lie, I strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you I have no intention of lying.\u201d I shifted, his tail following me like a cobra. \u201cBut what would happen if you did strike me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poison is insidious. You would be numb but alive, watching and feeling and thinking but trapped within a useless body, mine, to do with whatever I chose. You might end up hacked into pieces, or floating in a jar, or nailed on the wall. Whatever I, and my customers, could imagine. But since you didn\u2019t ask about that bit before we struck our bargain, it\u2019s too late to back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very cunning, Mr. Sweeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am among the darkest of daimons, miss, and I do what I must to feed. Now, look into my eyes, and tell me your true name.\u201d</p><p>Keen took a ragged breath, and I gave her a brief smile of reassurance. Then I looked into Mr. Sweeting\u2019s acid-yellow eyes and said, \u201cMy name is Anne Carol.\u201d</p><p>His tail quivered, the sharp barb wavering over my stuttering heart. I was almost sure it would work. His eyes narrowed, and his hands dropped mine and crushed my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not lying,\u201d he said, his voice deadly. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something from me, but by the gods of hell, you\u2019re not lying.\u201d</p><p>He shook with rage, and I could hear his teeth grinding. His fingers pressed into my flesh, and I fought the urge to hiss and tear him to ribbons, monster to monster.</p><p>\u201cWhoever you are, rest assured I won\u2019t forget this. You\u2019d better pray that I never find you alone after dark. As for you, Lorelei, if I see you again, I\u2019ll hammer your ear to my door and let your head drip on the welcome mat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ve actually reserved her head for a pike.\u201d I snatched the ring off his palm and slipped it over my glove\u2019s thumb, for I knew from years of forbidden and secret practice that it was much too big for its rightful place on my fourth finger. \u201cCome along, Keen.\u201d And with that, I walked out the door.</p><p>His roar rattled the wood at my back, and I finally took a breath. I paused in front of the window, and no matter how hard Keen tugged at my hand, I wouldn\u2019t budge. Not until I was ready.</p><p>\u201cDo svidaniya,\u201d I said to the perpetually smiling head surrounded by her court of horror. \u201cI promise I will avenge you, my sister. And thank you, Olgha, for the ring.\u201d</p><p>I had once asked to wear it, when I was very young. \u201cYou\u2019re a bastard and a cuckoo, and you\u2019ll wear it over my dead body!\u201d she had shouted before shoving me into the pond. I had wanted revenge. I guess I finally had it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel as good as I thought it would.</p><p>8</p><p>By the time we slipped in through the back window, it was nearly dark. Reve was in an uproar, screeching so loud in a foreign language that Tommy Pain had scuttled under an ottoman. And then she saw us.</p><p>\u201cIdiot children! Fools! Of all the ridiculous, dangerous, foolhardy adventures, did it have to be to Sweeting? I can smell him on you! You reek of death and broken promises and lies as sweet as poisoned caramel. And you have something. Of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a fair bargain.\u201d I hid my hands behind my back. \u201cAnd it\u2019s mine by rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou I would believe it of,\u201d she spat at me. \u201cBut Keen, ch\u00e9rie. You know better. You know so much better.\u201d</p><p>Keen\u2019s only answer was a sulky glare.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do it, child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know where she wanted to go. She just said Ruby Lane. Seemed harmless enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything poor Casper has done for you both, and you repay him with this, a trip into hell and an angry dark daimon who will track you back to my doorstep.\u201d She shook her head, her skin rippling through furious shades of burgundy and black.</p><p>At the mention of Casper, I watched her more carefully. What exactly had he done for us? He had a bargain with me, one that should provide a payout better than his wildest dreams. But what had he done for Keen? She was the filthiest, scrawniest, most pathetic creature I\u2019d ever seen. What could she possibly have to repay anyone? For the first time in my life, I was curious about other people and their own machinations outside of what I could take from them.</p><p>\u201cMy ears were burning.\u201d Casper stepped from the antechamber with a grin. He had a satchel over one shoulder and pulled a wheeled trunk behind him.</p><p>\u201cYour little b\u00eates noires have been out to play,\u201d Reve said sharply. She disappeared behind a screen to rustle around, leaving us to face Casper alone.</p><p>\u201cCasper, we\u2014\u201d Keen started. But I held my tongue. I didn\u2019t have to explain myself to him, no matter what some feisty daimon might think.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d He held up a gloved hand, and she sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong to me. We have an arrangement, and what you do on your own time is your own business, just as what I do on my own time is my own business. You\u2019re alive and seemingly unharmed, and that\u2019s all I care about.\u201d</p><p>His face was like steel, as if the man inside was miles within and untouchable. Keen\u2019s breath hitched, and she stormed upstairs. His words had wounded her somehow. But he hadn\u2019t wounded me. I was untouchable, too.</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s behind us, what\u2019s the next step?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve secured transport out of the city. We\u2019ll take a bus tank to Dover, then scout around. We\u2019ll find a steamboat or airship or coach, whatever will get us to the Continent and Muscovy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your plan?\u201d I snorted most unroyally. \u201cI could have planned a better strategy when I was seven. And a bank? A princess, a royal Bludwoman, on a filthy, smoke-belching monstrosity of public conveyance, surrounded by commoners who can\u2019t afford a coach?

But I\u2019m willing to bet my life that I can figure it out to our eventual satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>My hands made fists in the thick stuff of my skirt, and I could feel my ribs pressing against the leather corset with every breath. Being so near him made me angry and hungry and unsettled in a way I couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he added, grinning in the face of my fury, \u201cit\u2019s not like you have any options.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tread on my patience.\u201d</p><p>He stepped dangerously close. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re angry. I like a girl with spirit.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, hampered by the corset. I couldn\u2019t let him know how much he affected me. I had to look down. \u201cI\u2019m not a girl, Casper.\u201d My voice was softer than I meant it to be, softer than he\u2019d heard it before. Whether I was reminding him that I was fully mature or that I was of a different species, I didn\u2019t know. Being near him made me muddled, as if I was always half-drained.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said softly to himself. One hand crept up to touch my face, and I slapped it away, but gently.</p><p>\u201cI will do whatever it takes to get back to my people, including putting up with you.\u201d</p> <p>I stepped away, breathing out through my nose so I wouldn\u2019t take in any more of his scent, so slightly wrong and yet so right. I needed to get out of the cluttered shop, where every move one of us made brought the other closer in proximity. London was definitely not a safe town for me, even if my suitcase coffin had never reached the tasseinist\u2019s clever hands.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then get ready. Our bank leaves from the southern gate in two hours.\u201d</p><p>He opened the box he\u2019d dragged in, a lady\u2019s traveling trunk. I expected to see gowns and boots and jewels, but instead, it was divided into two sections. One held clothes, papers, and books. The other side held a crate of blood vials, each snuggled in its own little niche.</p><p>\u201cI traded my harpsichord for this,\u201d he said. But I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off all the blood. I was still hollow with hunger, the need for blood as annoying and constant as a hair caught in my corset. I licked my lips and reached out for a vial.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my shoulders, and I hissed and tried to pull away, but he wouldn\u2019t let go. His eyes clouded over, his teeth bared in fury, and his fingers dug into flesh that was still tender from my visit with Mr. Sweeting\u2019s claws. There was a ferocity in the lines of his body, in the growl of his musical voice, that made me see him as more than a meal, as more than just a human. His eyes reminded me of a frozen lake, of the deep darkness trapped in ice, and being so near him made my breath catch in my throat. But I had seen what happened to noble Bludwomen who used their humans for the needs of the flesh and grew too attached. Humiliation and heavy fines and, if they weren\u2019t careful and contrite, public disfigurement. I looked down. Would they accept me as queen, if I fell into such an entanglement?</p> <p>\u201cLook at me, Ahnastasia. You\u2019re not a princess now. And I\u2019m not some lowly trash. I\u2019m your only way out of here. The least you can do is acknowledge me when I\u2019m telling you that I sold the last piece of my soul for a box of blood. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your soul,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m nearly drained. I need more\u2014\u201d</p><p>But his lips sealed over mine.</p><p>I gasped into his mouth and pushed against his chest with my hands, but I was still weak, and he was much stronger than I had imagined. His mouth was hot and spiced with wine, his lips soft but aggressive against mine. For a moment, the world stopped spinning, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I realized my hands weren\u2019t resisting him anymore; they were curled into his shirt.</p><p>And then he shoved me roughly away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with needs,\u201d he said raggedly. \u201cYou might not be a girl, but don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>I put a gloved hand to my mouth, to the place where his cheek had rasped against mine. He had stolen my first kiss, the bastard. Just another reason to make him pay. His hands hung at his sides as his eyes searched mine for something he didn\u2019t seem to find. I felt dizzy and weak, hungrier than ever.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I need is blood.\u201d I was surprised at how tiny my voice could be.</p> <p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that. You kissed me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Finally, his eyes released me, and the moment snapped like a snagged thread. I stepped back, my hands flying instinctively to smooth hair that was no longer there. He stepped away from me, too, his boot nudging his leather satchel. It clanked lightly, and my eyes were drawn to it.</p><p>\u201cI can smell when you\u2019re lying.\u201d He gave me a crooked smile. \u201cAnd I saw what you did to my room. Don\u2019t ever touch my things again, or I\u2019ll put you right back in that suitcase where I found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feather and the coin\u2014\u201d I started, but he cut me off with a finger in my face.</p><p>\u201cNever speak of it again.\u201d</p><p>The words fell, heavy as boulders, to the ground. For all his threats and promises, they were the darkest words he\u2019d spoken yet. And I found myself determined to discover what such an odd creature could hold so dear.</p><p>Since I had no belongings to pack and no preparations to make, I spent the next bit of time scratching Tommy Pain\u2019s belly and studying my sister\u2019s ring in the bright lights of Reve\u2019s mirror. Any Bludman could tell it wasn\u2019t paste; the dark diamond oozed power and rarity like a fine perfume. And Mr. Sweeting had been right about the topaz stones\u2014they were colder than ice. But they weren\u2019t the seat of the ring\u2019s power and magic, other than the magic of inheriting a matriarchy that was currently in thrall to a monster.</p><p>A monster called Ravenna.</p><p>She had come to our country as a traveling mystic. With her ink-black curls and dusky skin and huge, almond-shaped eyes, she had seemed a harmless curiosity. From the villages of the Pinkies to the back doors of the Blud Barons to the gates of the Ice Palace she had gone, winning over everyone she met with charm, cleverness, and a low, sweet voice like winter wine.</p><p>The first time I saw her, I was but a pup, dancing through the gates of the Sugar Snow Festival. Children were allowed to enjoy the festivities and performers and treats on the palace grounds in the evening, but we were always herded back into the castle to lie in bed long before moonrise, ears straining to hear the first waltz of the Sugar Snow Ball. Later, after all the children were asleep, the adults danced a dance so beautiful and mysterious that no one ever spoke of it. But it was twilight when Ravenna found me there by the palace wall as I galloped around my nursemaid among the wagons of the caravan.</p><p>\u201cTell your fortune, ice princess,\u201d a low voice had murmured from behind the indigo silk of a star-strewn tent.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, little beauty,\u201d my maid had said. \u201cSee what the famous Ravenna can tell you of your future greatness.\u201d</p><p>Ravenna had been but a lapdog then and harmless. She had smiled at me, teeth bright against her honey-colored skin.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d she had said, and I still remembered how my temper had flared, that this common foreigner would dare demand anything of me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me,\u201d I had answered, my pert little nose in the air.</p><p>And she had laughed a laugh like icicles chiming in the wind and said, \u201cThen there is your fortune, princess.\u201d</p><p>I had stomped and shrieked and wailed and threatened, but after that, she had utterly refused to take my palm and tell me of my future.</p><p>My maid had comforted me and given me a cone of bloody snow to suck on, saying, \u201cThe wildest things refuse to be tamed, sweet one.\u201d</p><p>Now, years later, after all I\u2019d seen, I wondered which of us she had meant.</p><p>\u201cBonne chance, ch\u00e9rie,\u201d Reve called out the door after us, the black cat twining around her legs. \u201cIf you succeed, remember where to find the greatest costumer in the world, eh?\u201d</p><p>I waved royally until Keen slapped my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not in a parade. Tone it down.\u201d</p><p>When I let out a warning hiss, Casper stepped between us. \u201cShe\u2019s right. You\u2019ve got to pretend you\u2019re nobody.\u201d And that\u2019s when I was given the bags to carry and the trunk to pull. I was so furious at being treated like a servant that my palpable rage probably scared off more potential attackers than Casper\u2019s walking cane and Keen\u2019s blade.</p><p>The walk to London\u2019s southern gate was dark and dirty. The streets were mostly empty at night, aside from some Pinkies and Bludmen too dull with drink to note the danger all around. Singing and shouting carried on the heavy air, surging out from under the doors of orange-lit bars and inns. Bludrats hissed from every shadow, and sometimes screams would ring out, followed by the sound of rending flesh.</p><p>We stuck to larger roads lit by an endless string of gas lamps. Most trouble avoided us, although Casper did have to club a scrawny old Bludman who staggered out from a dark alley, hands outstretched, muttering, \u201cOh, middlings. Dark and deep, dark and deep.\u201d He fell to the ground, bleeding from the temple and mumbling to himself with a toothless mouth. I had never seen anything more pathetic.</p><p>After that, Casper hummed forcefully to himself, the same tune he\u2019d been playing when he\u2019d found me, the one about \u201cHey, Jude.\u201d The song was becoming familiar to me, and I caught myself humming along once and quickly covered it up with a cough.</p><p>As we walked farther and farther downhill, an ominous form loomed over us. Of course, I had heard of the huge walls the Pinkies erected around their cities in Sangland, but it was another thing entirely to find myself dwarfed by the ugly, imposing structure of brick and barbed wire. These fortifications had been designed to keep the monsters out\u2014the bludstags, the bludbunnies, the wolves that were always crying with hunger. And they kept the soft, edible creatures safe inside\u2014the cows and chickens and pigs, not to mention the Pinkies themselves.</p><p>But it was hideous and unnatural, blotting out the stars like that, even if the sky was garbled with smoke and pollution from the factories and machinery. The celebrated city of London had shown me nothing but fear, repulsiveness, starvation, and horror, and I would not be sorry to leave it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we passed a cattle lot, the fool creatures screamed and bawled and rolled their eyes, skittering away from me and huddling in the shadows, wearing shawls of their own droppings. My prey in Freesia had always been so elegant, so pretty and poised, wild animals and carefully groomed servants. These dumb creatures had nothing to fear from me, no matter how hungry I might have been. I still had standards.</p><p>We finally entered the alley by the wall, and Casper led us along under its shadow.</p><p>\u201cHere are the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the bank and for whatever we find after that. Princess, you pretend to be a common Pinky. Deferential, meek, frightened even. Don\u2019t speak unless you have to. And don\u2019t stare too long at exposed skin, if anyone is stupid enough to have it. Do you have an alias?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about Anne Carol?\u201d I could hear the sneer in Keen\u2019s voice. I kept my face carefully blank and shrugged as if I didn\u2019t care what they called me.</p><p>Casper thought a moment. \u201cThat\u2019ll do. Anne Carol it is.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and spun Keen around, nudging her under a gas lamp and using her skinny back as a writing desk for a piece of worn brown paper. He scribbled something with a brass fountain pen and waved the page in the air to dry the ink.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s done. I\u2019ll be posing as your uncle, since you look like you\u2019re eighteen and have hair a similar color to mine now. I\u2019m chaperoning you en route to a job as a governess to a baron\u2019s house in Muscovy. I\u2019m a musician. Keen is my servant. Everybody got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Keen said, hard on my heels.</p><p>Casper didn\u2019t even turn around. \u201cTough.\u201d</p><p>We had reached the gate by then, a huge and rusty affair with a lamp-lit guard box to the side.</p><p>\u201cPapers!\u201d the guard shouted, his voice magnified by a speaker. I couldn\u2019t even see his face, just a tall brown hat and goggles. He might as well have been a brass clockwork, for all I could see. Which was probably the point.</p><p>Casper put a packet of brown papers into a metal box, which withdrew into the guard post with a ringing clank. \u201cCasper Sterling. Lorelei Keen. Anne Carol. Will you be returning to London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorelei and I will. My niece is traveling to be a governess in Muscovy.\u201d</p> <p>The box shot back out, and Casper took our papers.</p><p>\u201cMay Saint Ermenegilda have mercy on your soul, Miss Carol,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>Before I could ask what on earth he meant by that, Casper had me by the arm and propelled me and the trunk toward a large gray vehicle that shuddered, chugging in place against a dark and cloudy sky. We stepped up stairs mere inches away from the heavy treads, and Casper handed the driver our tickets.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d the thick man muttered around a pipe before clomping outside to stow our trunk.</p><p>I ducked through the narrow door. The inside of the bus-tank didn\u2019t smell any better than the fuggy cloud around the begoggled driver. It was less than half full, and most of the other passengers looked to be of the low-class, seedy sort I\u2019d only read about in newspapers. Traveling salesmen wore extra-tall top hats buttoned tightly under the chin, with enormous unfolding suitcases beside them on their seats. Young men who had likely sold their souls to the navy or something more piratical quivered fearfully in place, en route to sinking ships and sea monsters. One other woman, who looked more masculine than the driver, held a corncob pipe clenched in yellow-streaked teeth, squatting across two seats like a citadel over a river.</p><p>Casper led us to the back, pointing me toward the very last seat. He shoved our bags into the bins overhead. As Keen settled in front of me, Casper slid onto the bench, his leg pressing warm against mine.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something to read.\u201d</p><p>He shoved a rolled-up tube of greasy newspapers into my hand. I felt something hard in the middle and sighed in relief. A corked vial of blood, wrapped with yet more newspaper and tied with twine. I untied it and held a section of newspaper in front of my face to hide the vial as I gulped, and Casper leaned over to block the view from the aisle. His face was so uncomfortably close that my eyes sought the newspaper, and that\u2019s when I noticed that it was the London Observer, and I was staring at a section labeled \u201cNews of Sang,\u201d including updates on \u201cVictory in Freesia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVictory in Freesia? That does sound like a good read, uncle,\u201d I said.</p><p>He chuckled darkly and handed me a red handkerchief, which I stared at in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be disappointed, niece. Don\u2019t forget who writes the papers in London.\u201d</p><p>I expected him to leave me then, but he didn\u2019t budge from my side. As I scanned the story and finally understood the depth of my country\u2019s trouble, I put my head to his shoulder and wept.</p><p>9</p><p>When I pulled my face away from Casper\u2019s shoulder, the handkerchief between us was sticky with blud tears. Much to my surprise, his arm was around me, and even more to my surprise, I didn\u2019t care. The fall of my family may have seemed like a victory to the Pinkies of London, but for my people and my country, it was a tragedy.</p><p>Casper had told me the truth. Freesia was collapsing. My parents were recently executed, my sister and I had been missing for years, and my younger brother, Alex, was in thrall to Ravenna.</p><p>According to reports from Muscovy, the upstart gypsy witch had deposed or murdered several landed barons and hand-picked their replacements on the Blud Council, our token House of Lords. She had been declared prime minister and was absorbing several of the Tsarina\u2019s roles as she stood at Alex\u2019s side. And she was having a statue raised in honor of the lost Princess Olgha, whose ship had supposedly been sunk by her younger sister, the bastard half-Svede Ahnastasia. I was also presumed dead, but the price on my head had gone up even more.</p><p>Which I could handle. I no longer resembled the doe-eyed, long-haired ice angel in the newspaper image. What pained me the most were the rumors that my brother Alex was in love with Ravenna and on the verge of marrying her. The papers claimed that she fed him secret medicines and magic potions to combat his chronic ferocity, trying to tame the hot blood that made him little more than an animal and the only Feodor sibling incapable of taking the throne. No wonder he was the only one she had left alive\u2014he was by far the most easily mastered.</p><p>I fought the urge to rip the paper to shreds with my teeth and then kill everyone on the bank. I had never felt so helpless, so far from home. I looked out the window, watching the endless green of the moors roll by, willing the bank to speed up. But the gears kept grinding, and the engine kept burning, and we plodded along at the speed of a fast trot. I had to lash out at something, so I kicked the seat in front of me with a growl.</p><p>Casper chuckled softly, a look of grim understanding in his eyes. \u201cMakes you want to burn down the world, doesn\u2019t it? Knowing that what you want most is far away. That your old life is gone forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy entire world.\u201d I stroked a finger down the thick, cloudy glass. \u201cMy family. My country. Gone in a heartbeat. Gone, while I slept.\u201d I wiped away another tear. \u201cI\u2019m completely alone.\u201d</p><p>The silence fell heavy between us. I could sense that he wanted me to look at him, that there was something he wanted to tell me. But I resisted. What I felt\u2014it was too much. He couldn\u2019t possibly understand.</p><p>With a last, sorrowful sigh and a hand on my shoulder, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s ever lost a world, you know. And you\u2019re only as alone as you want to be.\u201d</p><p>He slipped back onto the bench in front of me. Keen murmured in sleepy annoyance as he settled down beside her. I should have been exhausted myself, but I was caught between sorrow and uselessness and hunger, trapped on a slow, plodding bank with my listless, clueless prey. Had they known what I was, what I wanted to do to them, they would have hated me. It was an uncomfortable feeling, being hated by creatures who had all but worshipped me in my youth, even as I fed from them. The Pinkies of Sang were so different from the ones in Freesia.</p><p>I looked over at the nearest passenger, trying to see past his blood to the person below. It was a young man in a sailor\u2019s uniform sitting diagonally from me. His silly white hat extended down over his neck and buckled to his navy-blue jacket. His eyes glanced nervously around the bank, full of fear, and he panted as if he were losing a fight against his uniform\u2019s chin strap. Closing my eyes, I inhaled. I could smell his terror, as sure as a hawk could sense a baby bird in its nest. This boy had most likely chafed at being cooped up in London, probably bragged to his friends and his girl about joining the navy and seeing the exotic places of Sang. And now he was petrified of the outside world. He smelled of dead plants and cheap soap. Like a peasant.</p><p>But most of all, he smelled of blood. Sweet, warm, deep. I could scent it on his breath, see the tiny patch on his cheek that he\u2019d sliced open shaving that morning. In my old life, he would have knelt before me, in his proper place, cleaned and dressed, his hair parted just so, and I would have taken my due with great care and restraint. Instead, I exhaled and pressed the grease-splotched newspaper against my nose, willing myself not to think about food. After four years of starvation and a few tiny vials, he was still more appetizer than equal.</p><p>At least Casper and Keen didn\u2019t smell so good to me. She was too filthy and covered up, and he had that strange stink. It reminded me of something I had read once about how wild animals would urinate around their dens, marking their territory as a warning. But who had marked him? And what in Sang had driven Casper to kiss me? And why was I more curious than angry about it?</p><p>Feelings warred inside me, sadness and loss and fury and hunger and the deep, pounding need for revenge. And something else, a softening warmth that seemed to radiate from the shoulder Casper had just squeezed. For a moment, I caught the soft glow of his hair over the edge of his seat, but he gave a dreamy sigh and shifted away. I turned my face to the window, trying to ignore the odd longing tugging at my heart where no longing had any right to be.</p><p>I watched the grasses roll by, the smooth darkness of the moor outside broken up only by the stars shining on an occasional copse or abandoned town or warren of bludbunnies. My eyes dipped closed. And eventually, I slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Movement woke me, and with it, the smell of food dangerously near. But I denied the beast inside and raised one eyelid, peeking underneath my arm, fully aware of where I was and what was at stake.</p><p>A man sat in the seat across from mine, which had previously been empty. He stank of wine. Leaning toward me, elbows on his knees, he hissed, \u201cOi, pretty little thing.\u201d</p><p>I quickly took stock of my environment. By the low lights of the bank, I could see Keen\u2019s head leaning on Casper\u2019s shoulder through the space between their seats, and if I focused, I could hear their slow, steady breathing. The world outside was as dark as a closet, not even a glint of light. The only sound I could hear on the entire bank was soft snoring, and the air was filled with the warm, cozy smell of pulsing blood.</p> <p>\u201cYou awake, love?\u201d The man hissed and made kissing noises through his teeth, a little louder this time. The cloth of his jacket whispered as his hand reached for my leg.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I sat up cautiously, crossing my arms and glaring at him.</p><p>He lurched back and fiddled with his watch chain as if trying to hide that he\u2019d been on the verge of touching a strange woman\u2019s knee. He was young but wiry, cocky, and almost good-looking for a Pinky. But there was something wanting, a certain looseness of morals to be read in his narrow shoulders, too-short trousers, and cruel, yellowing grin. Had I been anyone else, this fellow would have been trouble.</p><p>As it was, I was the trouble.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to talk, love.\u201d He winked. \u201cEverybody else is asleep, and I thought you might like some company, as they say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? I was fairly certain you were about to make free with my sleeping person, actually.\u201d I smiled, keeping my lips carefully pulled down over too-sharp teeth.</p><p>He had the absolute gall to look injured. \u201cI would never make advances at an innocent young miss as such. Unless . . . hmm?\u201d He waggled his eyebrows as high as his bowler would allow and held out a tarnished flask.</p><p>I glanced around, throwing out all of my senses. Everyone else was unconscious, which was probably why he\u2019d sought me out in the first place.</p><p>\u201cCome close, and I\u2019ll tell you a secret.\u201d I pursed my lips and batted my eyelashes.</p><p>His grin widened, and his eyes took on a predatory gleam that I unconsciously mirrored. It was a different kind of hunger that moved me to my next action, inappropriate and dangerous as it was.</p><p>I scooted into the corner and patted the space I\u2019d just vacated, which was still warm from my sleeping body. He took a sip from his flask and sidled across the aisle to slide in beside me, leaving his salesman\u2019s valise in the other seat, where it advertised Stephanie\u2019s Superior Seamstress Salve to no one. His hand was working its way up my skirt before his weight had settled on the plush bench. I let his fingers wander, curious at the feelings it aroused.</p> <p>As a young princess, I had been kept far away from most males, especially those my own age. Even at the Sugar Snow Ball, no one had dared to touch me improperly, much less tempt me into the shadows with my parents and all of the Freesian royalty watching. I had heard rumors and whispers of love play in the castle, and Olgha had told me some desperately ridiculous things about mating. Other than Casper\u2019s kiss, which I still didn\u2019t really understand, I knew very little of what passed between men and women. With the boy\u2019s forceful hand stroking up my calf, I was disgusted but curious.</p><p>With a knowing smile, I began pulling the laces under his chin to loosen his hat. So inconvenient, the way these Sanglish Pinkies kept themselves all laced up, their pulse points covered in smelly old leather.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dirty girl, you are,\u201d he said approvingly as his hand caressed my knee, only a thin stretch of stocking between his glove and my flesh.</p><p>Finally, I pulled out the last of the filthy laces and pushed back his hat. The smell of his hair underneath was nauseating\u2014had he even heard of bathing? The stench probably did more to scare off local Bludmen than the leather shielding. But underneath the stink was the true smell. The blood, warm and inviting.</p><p>I ran a hand through his hair and nibbled his ear, and he sucked air in through his teeth. His hand jerked up to my thigh, digging into the flesh. For a few brief seconds, I let his hand angle farther upward. My legs were crossed tightly, but it was fun, defying his urgency to pry them open. I licked a line from his ear to the place where his jugular vein nearly touched the surface. My lips lingered there, prolonging the moment. He hummed, caught in my power.</p><p>And then I bit down.</p><p>Before he could make even the slightest groan, my glove was over his mouth, my other arm holding him tightly to my chest. If anyone had been awake to see it, they would have seen two young people fumbling with underclothes in the back of the bank, an occurrence that surely had some precedent in impolite society. Still, I slid down a little in my seat, in case the driver chose that exact moment to look up from his sleepy parade across the lonely moors.</p><p>The man struggled against me, but he was no match for a Bludman\u2019s strength, even a young and weakened little thing like me. I drank, deep and deeper, eyes rolled back in bliss. The liquor in his blood made me feel warm and dreamy. When I was so full that my belly swelled uncomfortably against the leather corset, I licked my lips and tugged the grubby handkerchief out of his pocket to wipe at the little tear my teeth had made in his neck.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a lovely conversation,\u201d I whispered into his grime-stained ear.</p><p>I stood, letting him slump to the seat. Everyone on the bank still slept. I had killed one of their fellows mere feet away, and their breathing hadn\u2019t even stuttered. I turned my back to the far-off and mostly hidden driver\u2019s box and opened the back door. It was a common occurrence for a lady to empty a chamberpot hidden under her voluminous skirts; I\u2019d seen it happen several times myself, the scent of blood in their cheeks singing to me of their embarrassment and edibility. The banks stopped for nothing, especially not bladders, and I\u2019d been careful to look away each time someone tossed something unmentionable out into the sea of grass. No wonder the back seats had been empty.</p><p>Using my wide skirts to block the aisle, I tossed the man\u2019s body outside and kicked his valise after him. The roaring of the motor and the grinding of the treads engulfed any sound he made when he hit the ground. I shut the door, wiped my hands off on my skirt, and sat back down in my seat.</p><p>Perhaps public transportation wasn\u2019t so horrid after all.</p><p>Oddly enough, I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. As warm and dreamy and satisfied as I felt, there was something else plucking at my metaphorical sleeve. With so many worries, it was no surprise. As the other passengers woke up, I watched carefully to see if anyone would notice the missing salesman, but no one did. Not that he mattered to me\u2014he was prey, and dangerous prey at that. Perhaps I\u2019d even saved the virtue of some other, slightly more innocent traveler. As the sun rose bloodred on a gray sky the color of bruises, I tried to put the entire incident out of mind.</p><p>When a slight change in his breathing signaled Casper\u2019s return to consciousness, I pretended to be asleep.</p><p>\u201cAnne?\u201d he whispered around the edge of the seat.</p><p>\u201cHmph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, I suppose I did. The sound of the engines and the rumble of the treads are quite soporific, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like the sleep did you good.\u201d He scanned my face but seemed hesitant to move closer. \u201cI was worried that the night would be . . . difficult for you. Considering.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a winning smile and flicked my fingers. \u201cDifficult? Gracious, no. I\u2019ve had to practice self-control my entire life. This is nothing.\u201d I hoped he wouldn\u2019t notice the little droplets of blood on my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me, and I shrugged innocently. \u201cStill, take this. We can\u2019t have any accidents.\u201d</p><p>He handed me another vial swaddled in greasy newspaper. I wasn\u2019t hungry, but I managed to gulp it down anyway. With every drop of blood, my strength increased, and I was going to need all the power I could muster to face Ravenna.</p><p>Shortly after that, the bank rumbled to a halt, and we disembarked. I was the last one off. The driver hunched over the steering wheel, holding a clipboard and glaring at me. He was more heavily dressed than anyone I\u2019d seen yet, as if wild Bludmen roamed the moors, waiting to attack. I imagined that he would have smelled like a shoe if he ever took off all that leather.</p><p>\u201cYou the last one off, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said sweetly. \u201cWhat a charming journey.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me through his goggles, his mud-brown eyes utterly surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, yes, thank you, miss,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cYou have a nice time in Dover.\u201d He trudged back onto the bank, muttering, \u201cBloody traveling salesmen. Lad\u2019s probably drunk under the seats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d I tugged Casper\u2019s arm to follow the crowd toward the tall city gates of Dover. Keen gave me her sneaky, slit-eyed look, and I smiled, showing her my teeth.</p><p>The guard checked our papers at the wall, and we followed our fellow passengers into the port city as dawn lit the tired white buildings within. I stayed close to Casper, grateful for his hand on my elbow in the sea of strangers milling anxiously toward the docks. I grew accustomed to being jostled and having my feet trod upon, all while holding my nose, both for the stench and the blood. And then I felt a tug at my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYou dropped this on the bank,\u201d Keen whispered, shoving something into my hand.</p><p>It was the salesman\u2019s grubby handkerchief, still wet with blood.</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t mine, Keen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever said it was . . . Anne.\u201d</p><p>I let the hankie fall, pausing to grind it into the filthy cobbles with my heel. Casper\u2019s fingers tugged against my elbow, urging me to keep up with the crowd. Sighing heavily, he pulled me closer, tucking my arm tightly to his chest. I was too surprised to fight him.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s simple. Don\u2019t look at anyone. Don\u2019t speak to anyone. Don\u2019t stand out. Your job is to remain unnoticed. That\u2019s what shy Pinky girls do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to pretend that you\u2019re my porter, and I\u2019ve told you to arrange everything on my behalf.\u201d I patted his arm. \u201cPorter, make it so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pretend that you\u2019re a child I\u2019m babysitting and ignore most of what you say,\u201d Casper said as he led me along, but I could hear him fighting a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh, and if I disobey, what are you going to do?\u201d I grinned. \u201cSmack my hand or chain me up in the dungeon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d The words were playful, but the tone was dark, and he squeezed my hand with more strength than I expected.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to catch me first.\u201d It came out low and breathy as I squeezed back, feeling the bones in his fingers rub together. He didn\u2019t flinch, but I had made my point. How many times did I have to remind him that I was a woman grown, not the child I so resembled?</p><p>Keen sighed dramatically behind us. I glanced back to find the little monster waving a now even grubbier bloody hankie at me. So she\u2019d mastered the art of blackmail; I could only hope that her price wouldn\u2019t be too high. And apparently, she\u2019d mastered the art of pickpocketing, too, as she was eating a shiny yellow apple of such beauty and quality that I knew she could never have afforded it, not even if she had possessed anything worth selling.</p><p>\u201cPut that away,\u201d Casper hissed over his shoulder. \u201cThe Coppers will beat you bloody, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it matters.\u201d By the time Casper had turned around, the hankie had disappeared, and now the apple did, too. Instead, she took out the brass sphere I\u2019d seen her juggling earlier. To me, it didn\u2019t look much different from the apple. She saw me watching her and waggled her eyebrows. She must have stolen that, too.</p> <p>Even amid the crowd, Casper exuded a confidence and quiet strength that I had never seen before in a human. And I still wasn\u2019t sure if he even was a human. Maybe he was part daimon and kept his strangeness under wraps. A hidden tail, perhaps? I leaned back to check his posterior, but all was exactly where it was supposed to be. Or maybe he was something entirely new, something that hadn\u2019t been included in my nursemaid\u2019s lectures on the people of Sang.</p><p>I\u2019d learned only the barest history of countries that weren\u2019t under the rule of Freesia or allied against us. Although I knew the ice folk of Sveden well, the other nations and races of the world were mostly bedtime stories for a princess whose sphere would be only the Snow Court or the castles of nearby kings. Sang was such a large place, and everything was so far apart, and travel was so dangerous and sea monsters so prevalent, that most people who crossed great distances either died or just stayed where they landed.</p><p>I\u2019d heard of the daimons of Franchia, strange creatures like Reve and Mr. Sweeting who fed on the emotions of humans. I had heard fairy tales of lizard people, bird people, fish people, witches, ghosts, and even people whose blood made Bludmen crazy. And I knew of the beastfolk of Almanica who lived as barbarians and rode in chariots pulled by buffalo and bludstags.</p><p>Perhaps that was what Casper was\u2014perhaps he could change into a wolf or a wild cat, if the feeling took him. It would certainly explain his odd accent, strangely animal smell, uncanny strength, and dislike of restrictive clothing. I\u2019d have to provoke him and find out, one day, what he was capable of. I could have simply asked, but I was far too well bred for that sort of thing.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d he whispered, startling me. I\u2019d been unconsciously lingering on the way his silky copper-colored hair curled over his exposed ear, wondering how his skin would taste in comparison with the traveling salesman. With his hand still on my elbow, he led us to a low wall where people had stopped, piling up their trunks and valises as if waiting for something to happen.</p><p>I looked ahead, over the top hats and bonnets of the folks in the street. I had expected to see the masts of ships and the periscopes of submarines. Instead, I saw ropes dangling from the sky.</p> <p>I gulped.</p><p>\u201cDear Aztarte. Surely you don\u2019t mean we\u2019re flying?\u201d</p><p>He just chuckled darkly, as if he already knew I was terrified of heights.</p><p>My eyes traced the thick ropes up, up, and still farther up, to where a variety of airships hung suspended among the low clouds. I moaned and collapsed onto the wheeled trunk.</p><p>\u201cFinally found a chink in your armor, eh?\u201d Keen laughed. \u201cGuess you Bluddies aren\u2019t so perfect, now, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a Bludman\u2019s got nothing to do with fear of heights,\u201d I said, my voice barely a squeak. \u201cIt\u2019s just a deep personal flaw.\u201d</p><p>I could barely breathe, and my hands struggled to undo the brass clasps on my corset until gloved hands pulled them away gently and dropped them into my lap. Casper sat down beside me on the trunk, the wood creaking under his added weight.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not so bad. We\u2019ll find a larger one, something with a windowless cabin. Once you\u2019re on board, you won\u2019t even feel like you\u2019re up high.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t like it.\u201d I slumped over, boneless. \u201cNot a bit. Can\u2019t we take a ship instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about that.\u201d Casper scratched his chin under the leather strap of his hat. \u201cBut ships are dangerous for you. They\u2019re watched more carefully. There are navies and pirates and the possibility of being thrown overboard, which you couldn\u2019t survive. And the airships have a little more leeway for us to work for passage. I can probably find a place as a musician on a large one, and then you can hide in the cabin as my invalid niece.\u201d He looked down into my eyes, over the lenses of my dark glasses. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m terrified of the sea monsters. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sea\u2019s the scary part.\u201d I shivered and scrunched my nose. \u201cAll that salt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? And there\u2019s another reason to take to the air. Now, I did a bit of research, and here\u2019s what I know. The ones that are lowest to the ground\u2014the gaudy ones? Those are simple hot-air balloons. They can only carry a few people, and they aren\u2019t very good for the crossing, due to wind issues. More for pleasure rides and lovers looking for a tryst.\u201d</p><p>And I could see exactly what he meant. A mauve balloon all hung over with ribbons and sashes and bloodred hearts played backdrop for a man in a top hat kissing a woman, her arm draped over the balloon\u2019s woven basket, a brass spyglass dangling forgotten from her hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd there, the next biggest ones. Zeppelins.\u201d He pointed to a ship with a flat deck suspended from an oblong bladder that glowed like amber. \u201cThose are mostly used for the crossing over to Callous. They\u2019re dangerous, since they\u2019re made of skin, but they\u2019re very fast. They use those mostly for shipping things they don\u2019t care much about, including the poorer people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go on one of those.\u201d Blood rose in my throat. I didn\u2019t trust something as flimsy as skin to keep me in the air. And it didn\u2019t have a rail that I could see, either.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t. We\u2019re going to find a nice metal-cladder, one of the bigger ones. Very expensive to own, so they take over lots of people at a time. Like banks, but for the air, and with actual rooms. Very slow but steady\u2014and safer. Keen\u2019s off negotiating.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even noticed that the unctuous ragamuffin was gone. But I thought again of that shiny golden apple and her run-in with Mr. Sweeting and had to assume that she was more competent than she appeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her story?\u201d I asked him. He gazed off into the distance with a sort of fond, confused sadness that reminded me of a falconer with no hawk on his arm. He sighed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hers to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your story?\u201d I said before I could stop myself.</p><p>The brightness of his smile winked out, leaving again the dark mask.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine. And I don\u2019t give it away as easily as I used to.\u201d</p><p>Keen appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. They conversed in hurried whispers. She was excited about something, but he shook his head in annoyance. I fiddled with my dark glasses in an attempt to cover up my embarrassment. Not only had I asked a personal question and been denied, something I was entirely unaccustomed to, but now he knew that he had something I wanted. I hated being in someone else\u2019s power, and even more, I despised making tactical mistakes.</p><p>But what bothered me the most was that I genuinely wanted to know. I, who had never cared about anything but myself, now wanted to know more about this strange man who was neither a Bludman nor royalty. It was a troubling impulse, and I straightened my back with renewed purpose. Use him for my goals and then keep my promise regarding his head on a platter\u2014that was the plan. And if he was lucky, let him play the royal harpsichord, just once, in the most beautiful palace in the world. Just enough to make good on our agreement. Just enough to hear the beauty he could coax from its ancient, magical keys.</p><p>He turned to me with a scowl, hands on slim hips. \u201cMost of the ships are full. Keen\u2019s found us a metal-cladder, but I have to make the final arrangements. You two wait here. I\u2019ll only be a moment.\u201d He pinned Keen with a sharp glare. \u201cIf anything happens to her, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Keen wrinkled her nose and nodded sullenly as she sat beside me on the trunk with an unladylike slump. I watched Casper disappear into the milling crowd of tourists and sailors and hawk-eyed vendors. With a sudden thump, Keen collapsed, curled up on the trunk like a puppy, and began to snore softly. Confused by the behavior but glad to be free of her company, I closed my eyes and let the scents of hundreds of Pinkies invade me, noting the foreign spices and overlying stink of the ignorant herd and, somewhere nearby, just a whiff of magic.</p><p>\u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The voice was cultured, cool, and amused, and I looked up into the face of the first real Bludman I\u2019d seen in Sangland.</p><p>My heart leaped to see sharp features and a cloudy gaze, to know that I wasn\u2019t alone in playacting among the prey. And my heart stayed right where it was, heavy in my throat, when I saw what an attractive Bludman he was. Spare but powerful, with shadowy gray eyes dancing with excitement and smooth black hair pulled back under his hat. He could have been a prince, with a face like that. Oddly, a Pinky clung tightly to his arm, and her smell hung over him like a second skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re unaccustomed to the stink of rabble, my lady. And to think that they aren\u2019t even aware of two foxes in the henhouse. Or two snow foxes among the bludlemmings, perhaps.\u201d His mouth quirked up, and he winked.</p><p>I went on alert immediately and barely stopped myself from hissing as I stood to face him. Was I that easy to recognize? Was he an assassin? Would I have to kill him right here?</p><p>\u201cYou have me at a disadvantage,\u201d I said, my accent making my words all the colder.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, Crim. You\u2019re going to give the poor girl a conniption.\u201d The Pinky smiled at me in an oddly kind fashion and stroked one gloved hand down his arm in the same manner I would use to calm an overexcited bludmare.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, then, princess. My name is Criminy Stain, and I\u2019m at your service.\u201d He swept a practiced bow and rose with a bouquet of snow-white flowers in hand. \u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around. The crowd was oblivious, as if they couldn\u2019t even see us. My eyes narrowed at him, but his smile was bright, and I couldn\u2019t sense a bit of aggression. Still, I didn\u2019t take the flowers.</p><p>\u201cHow did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the proprietor of a traveling caravan, and my wife is a fortune-teller. Our train is stopped just outside of Dover, and a glance last night informed her that we would find you here. I couldn\u2019t miss a chance to meet you, my dear. I wish you only the best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want? Money?\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed. \u201cWhat is money to me? No, pet. I wanted only to see you myself and give you a gift.\u201d</p><p>I raised one eyebrow. \u201cFlowers?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and clapped his hands together. The bouquet of white blooms exploded in a shower of glittering snow. With a sudden jolt of homesickness, I reached out to catch the falling flakes, but they were neither cold nor wet and simply disappeared.</p><p>Criminy\u2019s hand swiftly clasped mine, and he wrapped my gloved fingers around something hard before I could pull away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need this, Ahnastasia,\u201d he whispered, leaning close. \u201cMore than you know. One day, it will be the only thing between you and a world of pain.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down and opened my hand. It was a paper packet folded tightly and sealed with a wax stamp bearing a compass and an S. My instinct was to throw it onto the ground, but something stopped me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Why do I need it?\u201d</p><p>Criminy looked at the Pinky on his arm, fierce warmth and love radiating from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you, honey,\u201d the woman said. She looked as if she wanted to reach out and pat my arm but knew that I would rip it off if she tried. \u201cOpen it when you\u2019re at the final straw. That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d</p><p>Turning the packet over in my hands, I shivered. I hadn\u2019t dealt with magic since Ravenna and then Mr. Sweeting, and I didn\u2019t like the thought of more mystery, much less mysterious gifts from someone who knew who I was. How was I supposed to trust this strange pair?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d the Bludman spat, and his Pinky nodded and said, \u201cTell Casper that Tish said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, my princess.\u201d Criminy bowed again and gave me a knowing, charming smile. \u201cMy lady wife is always right, and I assure you that all will turn out for the best, much as I hate to say it, for that undeserving bugger.\u201d He jerked his head toward the airships, and within seconds, he and his Pinky had disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAnne!\u201d</p> <p>My head spun in the opposite direction as Casper hurried toward me, worry written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find you. Who were you talking to? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know this \u2018okay,\u2019 but I am safe.\u201d I sat back down on the trunk, before my legs could collapse. \u201cTell me, what do you know of Criminy Stain?\u201d</p><p>Casper stilled, eyes going hard as he took a deep breath through his nostrils. \u201cCriminy Stain. Criminy Stain was here?\u201d He searched the crowd, avid as a wolf. \u201cWas he alone? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here. He knew me. He had a pet Pinky with him, a fortune-teller, but she smelled strange. She said to tell you Tish said hi. And Criminy gave me this.\u201d</p><p>I held out the packet, but Casper didn\u2019t touch it. \u201cIf Tish saw something of the future and Criminy gave you that, it\u2019s important.\u201d He looked both furious and lost, and I slipped the folded paper into the top of my corset, next to the necklace from my valise.</p><p>\u201cBut who are they? Who is Tish?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as if trying to dislodge something painful. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll tell you someday. For now, we have to hurry. It\u2019s almost time to take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve secured passage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look happy about it,\u201d I murmured. And he didn\u2019t. He looked irritated, and worried, and ever so slightly amused.</p><p>\u201cThe passenger ships are full and only take coin, so this is a trade situation. They need a musician, seeing as how the old one\u2019s too drunk to play. But we have to share a room, and you\u2019ll need to stay in it the entire time. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndubitably. I don\u2019t want to be outside among Pinkies and ruffians.\u201d I salivated a little, thinking about all that blood, but caught myself before I licked my lips. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only for the crossing. A day at most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, our ride will take several days, all the way to Muscovy, with brief stops at Paris, Barlin, Warsaw, and Minks. Stops for which you and Keen will remain locked in our room at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not accustomed to following orders.\u201d I stood and crossed my arms. Unfortunately, the top of my head barely came up to his broad chest, and with his top hat, he towered over me.</p><p>\u201cIf you expect me to get you to Muscovy in one pretty little piece, you\u2019re going to learn,\u201d he snapped. He shrugged his shoulders with a menacing creak of leather, and without thinking, I took a step back.</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s say I agree to this airship. Why are you so worried about it?\u201d</p><p>He threw a look of stern annoyance at Keen, who was rising from her nap on the trunk with a look of groggy confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, her voice slurry with sleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m filling Anne in on the fine accommodations you\u2019ve secured.\u201d</p><p>Keen chuckled, stuck her hands in her pants pockets, and beamed that one, extraordinary smile. She looked far too proud of herself for any good to come of the situation.</p><p>Casper sighed and pointed into the clouds. I followed his finger to an enormous metal-clad behemoth of an airship\u2014one of the biggest. The body was brass, shining dully with the lemon-yellow rays of the morning sun. Beneath it hung a large sort of box, which was painted with the gargantuan image of a mostly naked woman draped over a swoopy couch. Large, curlicued letters spelled \u201cA.S. Maybuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that woman . . . ?\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. As are many of the passengers. The Maybuck is Sang\u2019s largest\u2014and only\u2014floating brothel. And we\u2019re expected on the deck in half an hour for launch.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>They didn\u2019t have to carry me kicking and screaming\u2014not until we were right under the Maybuck. I balked then, and Casper had to drag me firmly by the arm while Keen stayed close enough behind me that I couldn\u2019t run back down the long, narrow ramp that led to the docking platform. When it was our turn to embark, I stepped onto the lift and collapsed to the muddy planks with my eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>\u201cSit on me,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Casper snorted. \u201cWon\u2019t you have me beheaded for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d It came out as a whimper.</p><p>Keen had no such trepidations and planted her skinny rump right in the middle of my back. I exhaled gratefully, hugging the boards and moaning. Casper got down on his haunches and peered into my face.</p><p>\u201cCare to explain your sudden collapse, niece?\u201d He was trying not to laugh\u2014but not trying too hard, I noticed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fly away and fall down,\u201d I explained. \u201cIf the wind caught in my skirts, a fierce gale could send me over the edge to my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a railing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very small. I weigh practically nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither!\u201d Keen shouted, bouncing up and down and leaving what I was sure were permanent corset-shaped indentations in my back.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be so helpless one day,\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither!\u201d She stopped bouncing and all but ground me into the boards.</p><p>With a sudden lurch and a metallic squeal, our platform began to rise. I closed my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cHold my hand.\u201d</p><p>My voice came out tiny and plaintive, and Casper leaned closer. \u201cWas that an order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold my hand, please?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and sat on the boards near my head, curling both of his hands around one of mine. Even through the gloves, he was warm, and it was his calming touch more than Keen\u2019s insignificant weight that kept me in place.</p><p>In all my planning of revenge and ultimate victory, it somehow hadn\u2019t been clear to me that getting from Sangland to Muscovy was going to involve either sea or air. It would have been easier if I had still been unconscious and securely buckled inside a valise. At least I wouldn\u2019t have been this terrified and had my weaknesses broadcast to the world. I turned my head to the side and dashed away a red-tinged tear before anyone could see it. At least Reve had provided gloves of a deep, rusty brown, handy for concealing both today\u2019s tears and the stains from last night\u2019s snack.</p><p>Ascending to the airship proper took eons. Ages. Epochs. Dragons roamed Sangland again by the time the platform finally shuddered to a halt and I heard the sound of metal clipping into place as it was fastened to the airship deck.</p><p>Keen leaped up, and Casper helped me stand. The platform swayed slightly, and I clung to him, legs wobbling.</p><p>\u201cMy niece gets vertigo,\u201d he said to someone I couldn\u2019t see, since my eyes were still squeezed shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAround here, we call that a case of the shits.\u201d</p><p>The new voice was loud and filled with lusty good humor. I looked up and nearly heaved all over her platform boots, narrowly avoiding unmasking myself in a splatter of blood and getting us all thrown overboard. It wasn\u2019t that she was ugly\u2014far from it. The woman was past her bloom but holding steady in her prime, lush and flush and clearly the queen of the ship. She was a Pinky, but dressed with a Bludwoman\u2019s love of flesh\u2014and she was smoking a pipe. She was just fine\u2014more than fine, if I had been in any way hungry.</p><p>The problem was that we were surrounded by clouds.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to the Maybuck, Maestro.\u201d She held out a lace-gloved hand to Casper. \u201cStill can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you, although I\u2019ve read about your exploits in the papers. You\u2019ll be fitting in right well, I think. And welcome to you, too, Miss . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy niece, Miss Anne Carol,\u201d Casper said. \u201cMy brother\u2019s daughter. From London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Carol.\u201d She nodded in my direction. I smiled as best I could, mouth closed over teeth stained with blood from my near-retching. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my girl; you\u2019ll get your air legs about you soon enough. Looks like your little maid is already enjoying herself. She got a trade yet, that one?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at Keen\u2019s blindingly pretty smile. The girl had climbed partway up a rope and was dangling from the metal balloon, her hair whipping in the wind and her cheeks pink with excitement. The woman looked Keen\u2019s body up and down as if measuring future growth and meditatively chewed her pipe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m training her in harpsichord,\u201d Casper snapped.</p> <p>\u201cPity.\u201d The woman shrugged sinuously, her flesh rippling. \u201cShe\u2019s going to bloom like a rose one day, and there\u2019s copper to be made among the clouds. I\u2019m Madam Laurabelle May, by the way. But everyone calls me Miss May.\u201d She nudged Casper in the side and winked, adding, \u201cAlthough certain lads with enough copper can call me Mother-May-I, then, can\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure to meet you, Miss May.\u201d He flashed a wolfish grin I hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>\u201cPleasure\u2019s all mine, I\u2019m quite sure,\u201d she purred back.</p><p>\u201cStateroom?\u201d I managed to groan, my head down and my mouth hidden behind my hand.</p><p>\u201cDid she ask for a stateroom?\u201d Miss May cackled. \u201cOh, yes, your highness. I\u2019ll have the palanquin fetch you to your gilded throne!\u201d Once she\u2019d gotten all the laughter out, she pointed at me with her pipe and said, \u201cSmall, windowless, as requested, and all three of you will share it. But I\u2019ll have someone take you there before you yark on my deck and put the boys off their feed.\u201d</p><p>I heard giggling and the slap of a bare hand on skin. I was grateful for the nausea, because I began to suspect that there was an overabundance of naked flesh on the Maybuck. Better to be ill than bloodhungry.</p> <p>\u201cColette! Victoire! Please show the Maestro and his niece to the Velvet Room.\u201d</p><p>Two girls even younger than Keen ran up and curtsied. When I saw that they wore nothing but diaphanous white gowns, I covered my nose and mouth with my glove and tried to think about a much-decomposed and thoroughly unappetizing bear corpse I\u2019d once come across on a hunt. Casper\u2019s hands on my shoulders steered me across the ship, and with my eyes still closed, I could almost imagine that we were on land. Almost.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice room,\u201d said one of the girls in a distinctly Sanglish accent. The Franchian names must have been part of the game, like the see-through gowns. I heard a door open, and Casper ushered me inside, thanked the girls, and slammed it behind us. I collapsed across the bed on my belly, burying my face in a pillow and tossing aside the smoky glasses.</p><p>\u201cAhnastasia, how are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>He sat down beside me, not close enough to touch, but I felt the soft mattress indent beneath his weight. Another first: I was alone in a small room, arranged on a bed with a strange man of questionable background and species.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a floating brothel surrounded by naked degenerates,\u201d I muttered into the soft pink velvet coverlet. It was so luxuriously deep that it reminded me of the lion\u2019s tongue I had once seen at the royal zoo. \u201cI\u2019m not well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw one of his gloved hands move toward my back and hover there, as if his impulse was to touch me but something held him back. The princess and the beast weren\u2019t the only instincts within me anymore, but I didn\u2019t know how to describe the new urge, the one that had awakened with his kiss, the one that wanted to be touched. Instead, I slunk from under his hand and sat against the headboard, pulling a tasseled pillow to my chest.</p> <p>\u201cI think I can manage it now.\u201d I breathed in stale air thick with Casper\u2019s scent and fanned myself with a hand. \u201cAlthough there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough air in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted a cabin with no windows, and that\u2019s what you got.\u201d</p><p>We both looked around the small room. The walls were papered in red velvet damask, and the floor had fuzzy rugs that looked like entire scalped sheep. Tommy Pain would have loved lounging among them like an overfed sultan, and I realized that I missed the strange cat, who had been left behind with Reve. The bed took up most of the space and was quite large, but there was a small writing desk with a stool on one side and room for our trunk. Two smaller doors must have led to the bathroom and closet. I secretly smirked about Keen\u2014wherever she slept, it was going to be uncomfortable. It was a hell she richly deserved for tricking me into traveling aboard a brothel.</p><p>It would be hell for me, too, if I didn\u2019t get enough blood. Who knew how long I would be trapped in this tiny, airless room with two people and nothing but a cask of vials? Casper\u2019s blood wasn\u2019t entirely perfect, but it was still nutritional enough to keep me sated, and killing Keen would be hard to resist, if only for the peace and quiet. I wondered exactly how many passengers were on the Maybuck and how well they were accounted for. If the promise of a hand under my skirt was all it took to lure some idiotic Pinky into serving himself up to me on a platter, I was definitely on the right boat\u2014provided I could pitch his body overboard before anyone noticed.</p><p>And that reminded me of something.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s clean?\u201d I asked. I sniffed the pillow in front of me but didn\u2019t pick up any odors that smelled . . . lascivious.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly haven\u2019t heard of the Maybuck?\u201d Casper grinned at me with those damned dimples again.</p><p>\u201cThe care and feeding of princesses doesn\u2019t normally include discussions of prostitutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but surely you\u2019ve read about it? The Maybuck is Sang\u2019s only floating brothel. It\u2019s known for high-class courtesans who choose their own patrons and can only be bought by the wealthy and royal, many of whom are currently on board. If one of their customers ever found so much as a flea on this boat, Miss May\u2019s reputation would be shot.\u201d</p><p>I fingered the coverlet and had to admit to myself that it was fine stuff. The ermine tails on the fur-covered pillows were definitely real. And the Titian hanging over the bed had every appearance of being by the master himself. Even I had to admit that it was a terribly royal-looking brothel.</p><p>\u201cAnd they let us on here for free?\u201d I asked. It simply didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>He unlaced his hat and ran a hand through his sweaty hair. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person in Sang who hasn\u2019t heard of Casper Sterling, world-famous musician. I used to be in the papers even more than you. I was the biggest celebrity in London and toured all the major cities\u2014Paris, Bruzzles, Stockhelm. That\u2019s why everyone calls me Maestro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I had to know.</p><p>His expression darkened. He made dark look delicious. \u201cI told you: my business is my business.\u201d He looked away, and I stared at his back. Sweat had streaked his hair the color of old copper, and the tiny cabin was filled with the scent of male. I inhaled despite myself. But his anger wasn\u2019t about to stop me. I was curious.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stuck here in very close quarters, Maestro. We\u2019re going to have to trust each other, at least a little bit.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean I was going to go spilling my heart out to him, but I wanted to know his mysterious past, and I was sick of having to ask. And sick of being denied.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper, then,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He pulled off his gloves and stuffed them into his top hat. His fingers flexed and popped, and he stared at them with the oddest mixture of love and hate. Then he pulled a copper coin out of his waistcoat and began flipping it over his knuckles, back and forth. It was hypnotic, and in the still, airless silence, I held my breath, waiting for what came next.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I had my heart broken one too many times and went looking for the pieces in the wrong bottle,\u201d he finally said, his voice raw. \u201cAnd then, one day, I woke up in a third-rate Blud bar with a two-year hangover, playing tunes no one else had ever heard, unsure if they\u2019d ever existed or I was losing my mind. No one recognized me anymore. And I didn\u2019t really recognize myself.\u201d</p><p>The coin rippled across his fingers, and I wondered what he would have played had there been a harpsichord at hand. Something loud and crashing and furious or something slow and painful, each note a blade\u2019s kiss, bleeding out the past?</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd then a skinny little blond ice monster jumped out of a suitcase and tried to murder me.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling again, although something still roved, restless and dangerous, behind his eyes. The coin disappeared back to wherever he kept it. I knew it had to be the one from the box under his bed, and I wondered where its companion feather was hiding.</p><p>\u201cA skinny little blond ice monster?\u201d I said in mock indignation. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that my presentation ball was the most beautiful in Freesian history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the sketches in the paper.\u201d He looked me up and down, and I sat up straighter, wishing for the frame of my hair and the hypnotic power of a beautiful dress. Brown would never be my color. \u201cYou were like a porcelain doll, before they drained you and left you for dead. But you must admit that it was quite the wake-up call. For both of us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must have been very frightening.\u201d I looked down and fiddled with the tassels on the pillow.</p><p>\u201cYou were nothing but the beast,\u201d he said gently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. I can\u2019t believe you were that close to drained and still able to come back at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the music,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThat and the blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Beatles fan, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside joke. Between me and Keen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like jokes,\u201d I said, trying not to sound as if it mattered.</p><p>\u201cSorry, princess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your Mario is in another castle.\u201d</p> <p>Before I could ask what that meant, Keen burst through the door. Casper and I jumped apart, although we hadn\u2019t been anywhere close to touching. The girl smirked and tossed a blood orange in the air.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s in an hour, and we\u2019re expected to dine at the main table. I told Miss May that Anne\u2019s probably too pukey to show.\u201d</p><p>For reasons I couldn\u2019t yet contemplate, the thought of Casper walking into that room of half-clad women and a smiling Miss May made my ferocity override my fear.</p><p>\u201cDinner? Oh, I wouldn\u2019t dare miss it.\u201d I smiled sweetly at their matching expressions of surprise mixed with dread. \u201cBut at least I\u2019ll have a good reason not to eat, now that you\u2019ve spread the word about what a horrible traveler I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s safe for you to go?\u201d Casper asked cautiously, as if I was going to attack him for questioning me. Which, I supposed, was a reasonable fear, considering my previous behavior.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what sorts of tales the people of Sangland tell about Bludmen,\u201d I said, unbuttoning my hat and fluffing my short hair, \u201cbut so long as we\u2019re well fed, we have great control. Nearly all of our lower-ranked palace servants are Pinkies. My first memory is of having my hand smacked for trying to bite a maid\u2019s leg. My manners and self-control are impeccable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcept when you\u2019re attacking the Maestro or killing innocent people,\u201d Keen added, and my heart stuttered in horror.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t help attacking me. And she hasn\u2019t killed anyone in at least four years.\u201d Casper shot her a disapproving look. \u201cYou know what they say about when you assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s an ass,\u201d Keen muttered, but she gave me a sly wink before she slunk back out the door.</p><p>\u201cGet back in here, Keen. It\u2019s not safe for a girl like you\u2014\u201d</p><p>With admirable quickness, she shut the door before he could finish.</p><p>\u201cI am cursed with unruly women,\u201d Casper said to himself.</p><p>But I was still staring at the door Keen had just slammed. That proved it\u2014she\u2019d seen me with the boy on the bank. But why hadn\u2019t she said anything? Did Casper have a clue? And, more important, what did she want from me as payment for her continued silence?</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to get through dinner? Do you need another vial?\u201d</p> <p>Casper slid off the bed and rummaged in the trunk for a tube of blood.</p><p>\u201cHow many do we have?\u201d I wasn\u2019t hungry, of course, but I needed to pretend that I hadn\u2019t utterly bloated myself last night while he was sleeping.</p><p>\u201cEnough to get you home, I think.\u201d</p><p>I thought about counting the vials and doing the calculations in my head, but it just made me dizzier. For now, I\u2019d be content to leave the mechanics of the journey to fate. If the worst came to pass, surely there was some nasty little cabin boy that could be spared. But I took the vial from Casper and drank it lustily to bolster my charade.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d I held out the empty vial with a tame smile. \u201cDinner should be a snap.\u201d</p><p>At the time, I utterly failed to understand his facial expression, an unflattering mix of amusement, horror, and impending disaster.</p><p>After dinner, I understood.</p><p>12</p><p>I would have dressed for the occasion, but I had only one dress. In a minor huff, I settled for pinning up what little hair I had left and doing my makeup in the Pinky style. To be honest, I was enjoying that part of the masquerade. I\u2019d never pretended to be anything other than the willful brat that I was, and it was refreshing to be free from royal expectation. In a fit of rebellion, I unbuttoned my blouse and rolled up my sleeves, grateful for some air on my skin.</p><p>Casper stayed in the room while I went through my ministrations, reading a book he had pulled from the trunk. I was curious\u2014was he staying because he didn\u2019t trust me, or was he just as worried about going to dinner as I was? I\u2019d never been among whores and degenerates before. Still, it was oddly comforting to have him nearby, his steady breathing helping me to relax.</p><p>It was a short walk down the hallway to a closed door and a brass plaque announcing the captain\u2019s quarters. I kept my eyes shut and my hands clamped on his arm. Despite what I\u2019d said of my control, the smell of human bodies was nearly overwhelming, not least of all Casper\u2019s. He had returned to the same open-necked costume he\u2019d worn at the Seven Scars, and I realized I\u2019d have to grow accustomed to seeing the blue veins pulse in his neck, wrists, and hands. I dared to peek at the arm I was holding, nothing but loose linen separating my teeth from his golden skin. Licking my lips, I took a deep breath to test my resolve, but all was well under control. I no longer wanted to rip out his throat. Thank heavens I\u2019d snatched that boy on the bank.</p><p>Casper stopped me in front of the door and whispered into my ear. I froze.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d</p><p>His breath tickled the exposed curve of my neck, and a little thrill ran through me. I held very still, waiting to feel it again and shiver. I missed the first part of what he said and caught just the tail end.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to lose control in here, just act like you\u2019re going to be sick and run out. I\u2019ll make your excuses. Niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle Casper,\u201d I said sweetly and breathily in his ear.</p><p>He swallowed hard and stumbled toward the door.</p><p>I smiled. Two could play at this game.</p><p>The door swung open on a writhing mass of flesh. Feeling safe from the dangers of my kind, the whores and their customers were dressed to show as much skin as possible. One girl wore only a tight red corset and bloomers and boots, the bright scarlet plume from her tiny hat dipping all over the table as she laughed. The lady next to her had the tall white-powdered hair of the last century and was dressed in a gorgeous brocade gown fit for a queen\u2014except for the fact that the front panel was missing, exposing her legs from ankle to thigh when she stood to reach for the wine. Another posed in an odd outfit of nothing but sleek black leather and shiny silver rings. Her hair was short and slicked back like a man\u2019s, and there was actually a small piece of metal through each of her ears. I unconsciously licked my lips.</p><p>Those three caught my eye, but the overall impression was of temptation, glamour, costume, delight, and a massive amount of wickedness. The men lounged and laughed and ogled in a state of undress that was outrageous, according to my conservative upbringing. Cravats untied, shirts unbuttoned, no hats, and one gentleman appeared to be wearing some sort of plaid skirt with a furry purse. I blushed and looked away.</p><p>Casper\u2019s hand tightened on my arm. We\u2019d been standing in the doorway for all of three seconds, and no one had acknowledged us. I was sure my complexion was an unbecoming shade of mauve. Casper sighed and steered me to a chair in the far corner, placing himself between me and the fellow in the skirt. I looked around for Keen, but she was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cBonjour, darling,\u201d trilled the girl dressed like a queen, who was sitting on the other side of my corner. She gracefully pulled her long legs out of a stodgy-looking old man\u2019s lap. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a new girl, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my niece, Anne,\u201d Casper said. \u201cA passenger. She\u2019s to be a governess in Freesia. And you\u2019re Jeanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d she said with delight, holding out her bare, bejeweled hand for his kiss. \u201cI see my reputation precedes me, even in the pious Sangland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI played for you once, in Paris.\u201d Casper released her hand with a distant smile. \u201cWe performed a Franchian lullaby together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I remember now. We did other things, too.\u201d Jeanne dimpled behind her fan. \u201cWith my scarf and a horse whip, non?\u201d And she laughed, a sound both carefree and practiced, like gilt-edged leaves dancing in the breeze.</p><p>Casper cleared his throat and grinned at me, shrugging. I gave him a withering glare. He met my eyes for a few seconds longer than was necessary, until the look became something else entirely. I cleared my throat and searched the table for a napkin. There wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were getting a new girl.\u201d An older woman leaned across the table. She was dressed smartly and in a modern fashion that I had to assume was very de mode, although her dress was hemmed above the knee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a passenger,\u201d I answered for myself. \u201cBut your hat is exquisite. Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, not the fake smile of a prostitute but the genuine smile of a woman whose genius has been recognized. \u201cLike it, do you? It\u2019s my own work, dear. I was a milliner before I took to the air.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was refined and high London, and her manner told me she\u2019d been raised properly. How had she ended up on the Maybuck, I wondered? I liked her instantly, and not just because of her bonnet.</p><p>\u201cIf she is new, I\u2019ll take the first plunge,\u201d the man in the skirt said with a heavy brogue, leaning behind Casper to run a hand up my arm. \u201cShe looks juicy as a plum.\u201d</p><p>Casper leaned back, crushing the man\u2019s arm. \u201cShe\u2019s a passenger. Off limits.\u201d</p><p>The man withdrew his arm with a jerk, rubbing the velvet sleeve of his fine coat. \u201cLook, laddie. You needn\u2019t be brash. I\u2019ve a purse full of coin. There\u2019s a price for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my niece, my lord, en route to Freesia as a governess,\u201d Casper growled with barely contained rage. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been charged with protecting her innocence. Surely a gentleman understands an oath of such magnitude?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBonny, she is.\u201d The man ignored Casper to lean across the table. He was ruggedly handsome and knew it, probably a good fighter, with broad shoulders and huge hands. Another predator. I batted my eyelashes at him, feigning naive curiosity. His long lips curled into a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cFreesia\u2019s full of monsters, wee thing. You\u2019ll go there to watch a Blud Baron\u2019s spawn, and they\u2019ll eat you right up. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be a lord\u2019s mistress? Nice little cottage in Glasgow, weekly allowance, pretty dresses? I won\u2019t use ye too hard. Eh?\u201d</p><p>I heard a cracking noise and looked over to find Casper\u2019s hands flexing, his teeth bared. Before I could decide how to extricate myself from my first proposal, Casper leaned over and whispered something into his ear.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps another time, lass.\u201d The man scooted his chair back abruptly and found a different seat at the other end of the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d I whispered to Casper.</p><p>\u201cNone of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014goddamn business,\u201d I finished for him with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cExactly, yes,\u201d he said in a dignified voice as the table went quiet.</p> <p>Miss May posed dramatically in the doorway. After slamming it shut, she swaggered into the room and to the head of the table. She was dressed as a lady pirate, with the most covering bits of her costume missing. She swung one booted foot up onto her chair, letting the fluttering petticoats drip from her knee and offering a view that made me cough and look away.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, all, to the Airship Maybuck, the world\u2019s first and best floating pleasure ship. Everything on this boat is for sale, at a price. You know the rules, or you wouldn\u2019t have made it past the dock. Pay for what you take. Mind your manners. And no fighting. Break a rule, and you\u2019ll find yourself in the brig or thrown overboard. Until then, enjoy yourself. We\u2019re here for your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Her grin made it very clear that it was somewhat for her pleasure, too. Everyone cheered, and the men managed somehow to untangle their limbs from the ladies long enough to raise a toast of wine to the ship\u2019s captain. She raised her glass in return, and the little girls in their white gowns filed in through the door with platters of food that I couldn\u2019t identify. It was all meat or trash to me, but there was a lot of it.</p><p>Just then, I noticed that the pretty girl carrying a smallish pig was none other than Keen. In a diaphanous white gown, with her hair and face washed, she was like an angel, all huge brown eyes and long lashes and that mischievous grin that made me want to drain her and then strangle her for being so foolish.</p><p>Casper stiffened beside me, grabbing her wrist as she set down the piglet with a chaste curtsy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you playing at?\u201d he hissed.</p> <p>She yanked her arm back. \u201cI make my own choices. And you\u2019re not my dad.\u201d She offered him a blinding smile and scampered out the door. A hand from the crowd reached out to smack her on the rump, and I felt Casper shaking with anger beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a dad?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He put his head in his hands, speaking quickly and so low I had to lean close to hear him.</p><p>\u201cDad means father. She thinks I act too much like her father. But she forgets what a dangerous world this is. She\u2019s too young to be here. I shouldn\u2019t have brought her along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are her real parents? Why is it your business, what she does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that if she\u2019s over fourteen, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something I can do.\u201d</p> <p>He reached into his waistcoat and pulled out a silver flask, which he slopped into his red wine in such a way as to obscure the contents. Stronger liquor, perhaps? Laudanum? A potion? But he didn\u2019t have the eyes of an opium addict\u2014our old butler had had that look, shortly before my mother staked him for incompetence. There were so many smells in the room, so much skin scent in the air, that I didn\u2019t have a hope of puzzling out his secret ingredient.</p><p>\u201cOi, Maestro!\u201d Miss May lounged back in her chair and grinned at Casper. She held up her own glass of deep burgundy wine. \u201cTo an excellent bargain.\u201d</p><p>He toasted her in return and drank deeply before pouring himself another glass.</p><p>Casper and I spent the rest of the meal in our own pool of silence, a tiny island of tension amid the great, lashing waves of flesh and gluttony. He finished his glass of wine and swirled the last drops of deep maroon around and around in his goblet.</p><p>He never ate a bite.</p><p>The dinner didn\u2019t come to an end so much as the food was sampled and abandoned for other needs. The wine still flowed, though, and the party only became more animated as Keen and the other girls carried platters out to make space. When an elderly gentleman with a curled mustache pulled one of the girls into his lap and yanked down the sheer fabric above her corset to expose pierced nipples, Casper bolted up from his seat.</p><p>\u201cLeaving so soon?\u201d Miss May murmured sweetly, her ruby lips against a flushed young man\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cMy niece is unaccustomed to such goings-on.\u201d Casper pulled me behind him, attempting to drag me around the table toward the door.</p><p>Without really thinking, I said, \u201cBut, Uncle, I think this could be quite educational.\u201d</p><p>Quite honestly, I was intrigued. I knew that my mother had had her pets, that her marriage to my father was mostly a political alliance. And of course, that he truly had been my father was in question, if you believed certain circles. But what sport occurred at the Ice Palace occurred behind firmly closed and locked doors. I\u2019d never seen a live naked woman\u2019s body, other than my own. And I\u2019d never seen what lay under a man\u2019s many layers of clothes.</p><p>The old man shifted the half-dressed, laughing girl and fussed with his buttons, and I leaned over in amazement, angling to see more. With a snarl, Casper lifted me around the waist and carried me out of the room past the giggling, moaning guests and their quickly disappearing clothing.</p><p>He slammed the door and dropped me to the deck, steering me down the hall by my arm.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a little awkward of you, Uncle.\u201d I tripped, trying to keep up with him. \u201cThings were just getting interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may be hitching a ride on a floating whorehouse, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to stand around and watch you be utterly . . .\u201d</p><p>I watched him wince, fighting for the right word.</p><p>\u201cDebased? Spoiled? Scandalized? Ruined?\u201d I smirked. \u201cInformed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that those men aren\u2019t used to being told no, and that room is going to get a lot worse.\u201d And then his face went totally white, and he ran a hand through his hair. \u201cKeen. Dear God. I left the poor girl in there. We\u2019ve got to go find her.\u201d He started to walk back down the hall, but I didn\u2019t move, and he soon turned back with worry in his eyes. \u201cAhna, come on. It will only be a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the room. I can take care of myself.\u201d I flashed my fangs and huffed. Being told what to do rankled, and I badly needed a vial of blood.</p><p>He stepped closer, one hand around my upper arm and his hair brushing my cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing, though. If they find out what you are, who you are, the worst won\u2019t be getting thrown off this boat. They could ransom you, punish you, chain you up. Torture you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAnything. Please just come with me now. Don\u2019t make me worry for you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . you . . .\u201d It was hard to concentrate, being so close to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry for me. The men are all in that room and busy. There is nothing to fear out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right . . . but you might be wrong. Just get back to the room and lock the door. I\u2019ll hurry.\u201d</p><p>He released me and stormed down the hall, already intent on his next errand. I took the rare chance to admire his backside in the tight breeches and the way his coppery hair floated behind him, lit by the orange lamps. He really was a fine physical specimen, whatever he was. What had truly captured my attention, though, had been the look in his eyes and the purpose in his stride. He wasn\u2019t just protecting his meal ticket\u2014he really was afraid for me, the predator who had promised to put his head on a pike. And the only reason he was willing to leave me alone was to go save the insolent young girl who had recently accused him of acting too much like her father. No matter what Casper\u2019s sharp words might have said, he honestly cared about us both. I was annoyed\u2014but oddly touched.</p><p>I turned back to creep down the long hall, taking time to read the plaques by each door. The Leather Room. The Brocade Room. The Silk Room. The Damask Room. All fabrics, and lush ones. Did each girl have her own room, I wondered, or were they at the mercy of any wealthy passenger who beckoned? And who would normally have used our chamber, the Velvet Room?</p><p>I was so interested in my surroundings that I didn\u2019t notice the man waiting in the shadows until he was close enough to stroke my cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you lost, little snowbird?\u201d</p><p>It took every ounce of self-control I had not to hiss, let my shaking hands curl into talons, and rip into him. Instead, I stepped back and put my hands in front of me in a gesture of supplication that I\u2019d seen frightened maids use when my mother was on a rampage. I blinked, opening my eyes wide, and simpered at him.</p><p>My immediate impression was of an ermine in the summer, small and dark and deft. But his smile was after something more carnal than meat, and his sharp teeth matched my own. A Bludman\u2014but for some reason, I couldn\u2019t smell him, and that scared me even more.</p><p>\u201cPlease, good sir. I am a maid and a passenger here, not one of . . . not a . . .\u201d I stumbled over the word. What would a girl call a whore if she didn\u2019t know what a whore was?</p><p>\u201cNot a lady of the night?\u201d His snicker was teasing, but I could hear an accent under the words. I looked more closely.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dressed like the other men on the boat, in clothes that showed status and wealth. Aside from eyes so light they were nearly white, everything about him was shadowy, down to the leather that held all of his weapons and the kohl ringing his eyes. He didn\u2019t seem to belong there at all, and that\u2019s what made unfamiliar fear trickle down my spine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, but you are a different sort of lady, and it is the night, and we are alone. And I think you won\u2019t want to scream now.\u201d</p><p>One black-gloved finger moved toward my face, and I pursed my lips to keep from biting it. I was a roiling storm of emotions. My natural instincts to maim and kill and drink raged against my self-control with every thump of my hungry heart against the tight leather corset. And my ingrained behavior, the princess in me, was insulted that this man would dare to touch me and make pretty, lying words at me as if he was offering candy to an innocent Pinky child.</p><p>I began to understand the bone-deep fear of prey. This man wasn\u2019t a soft duke or an aging baron. He didn\u2019t belong on the Maybuck, which meant that no one knew he was there. Would it be anything close to a fair fight? He was bristling with weapons, and I was sorely hampered by leather and canvas and lace. Even if I managed to kill him, I would expose myself as a Bludwoman and follow him over the side to the sea far below.</p> <p>So that left me in the position of any other young girl: I was in his power. I had to find a way to escape him before he hurt me or drove me to a killing fury. Or both.</p><p>He took a step toward me, a knowing smile on his lips. I took a step back, hands still up.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I said again. \u201cMy uncle will be back soon. He\u2019s the Maestro. He\u2019ll be most upset if my person is assaulted in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your uncle, little flower. And whoever he is, if he brought you on the Maybuck, he didn\u2019t have much concern for your honor.\u201d Quick as a whip, he swung around, one hand on either side of my face, trapping me against the wall. So I played prey. I cowered.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ll return you in good shape,\u201d he whispered in my ear, the scent of blood and wine heavy on his breath. \u201cI\u2019ll get you warmed up for your future husband. Do the hard work. You\u2019ll thank me for it. For warming you up.\u201d</p> <p>I gulped and turned away as he nuzzled my neck where I\u2019d unlaced the thick collar of my shirt. One of his hands fumbled with the cloth of my skirt, as the boy\u2019s had the night before. No wonder women wore so many layers of clothes. My hands slapped his away, but his fingers only dug harder into my flesh.</p><p>My breathing sped up, my chest straining against the corset. The more I fought him, and the more he fought the cloth hiding my scent, the more I realized that I was truly in danger. Even without unleashing his sharp teeth, he was besting me. His beast was stronger than my beast, and I began to push him away in earnest.</p><p>\u201cI like it if you fight me a little, vixen,\u201d he murmured, his voice husky.</p><p>Left with little choice, I sighed and jerked away from his hand. And then I head-butted him.</p><p>I heard the crack and saw stars, but it bought me only a moment of mercy.</p><p>\u201cYou nasty little bitch.\u201d He touched the split skin on his forehead and snarled, snagging both of my gloved wrists and pinning them painfully against the wall over my head. He tucked his blud-covered forehead into my shoulder, beyond the reach of another head-butt. Shoving his hips hard against me, he said, \u201cYou owe me your maiden\u2019s blood now, little flower, and I\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p> <p>His tongue darted out to slide up my face, until he pulled back in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou! On this ship! How can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, he went completely stiff and shuddered, then vomited blood and wine all over my skirts. He dropped my wrists and fell to his knees, and I screeched and danced away from him, trying to fling the wine-soaked filth from the only dress I owned.</p><p>There was a loud thud as boot met face, and my attacker fell to the boards. When I looked up again, Casper stood like a vengeful god over the man\u2019s inert body, his face white with rage and his eyes promising murder. His hands were taut white fists at his sides, and he was panting in a way that made all his veins throb with a song as lovely as his music. Keen stood just behind him, her crafty glare and alert stance at odds with the frilly, diaphanous gown.</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d Casper\u2019s voice was soft, flat, deadly.</p><p>Rubbing my forehead, I gave a weak chuckle and said, \u201cNo, but I split his forehead open.\u201d</p><p>He gave a humorless snort and kicked the body over with a high black boot. When he saw the man\u2019s unusual dress, he inhaled through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cKnow what that is?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cA Bludman. Not someone who belongs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pirate. An assassin or a scout, maybe. But you\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t belong here. And we\u2019ve got to get rid of him\u2014fast.\u201d</p><p>Casper looked up and down the hall before picking the pirate up under his armpits and dragging him quickly away. Keen grabbed the man\u2019s soft black boots, and they were soon tossing him overboard from the empty deck. I grinned as I watched the body fall into the midnight clouds and noted that I didn\u2019t feel airsick at all.</p><p>\u201cWe tell no one.\u201d Casper scanned the hollow sky as if expecting a skull-plastered ship to be waiting nearby. \u201cIf Miss May hears of pirates, they\u2019ll search every crevice of the Maybuck. If they find what\u2019s hidden in our room, we\u2019ll be exposed and tossed out. We\u2019ll just have to hope he was alone.\u201d He rubbed his fist and cracked his knuckles. \u201cGod, that hurts. I must have punched him in a knife. Or a bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou punched him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight in the kidney.\u201d His lopsided smile was full of pride and dimples. \u201cI read somewhere that it can make you throw up, being punched in the kidney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t read it. I told you,\u201d Keen muttered. \u201cLearned it on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEffective, if messy.\u201d I smiled at Casper, caught off guard by our strange situation. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm, and I took it, careful not to get gore on his shirt as he guided me back to our room. I didn\u2019t read the plaques on the doors this time\u2014the barely lit passages didn\u2019t feel as safe as they had before, and I wanted to be behind my own closed door. The fact of the matter was, I was shaken.</p><p>For the first time in my life. I didn\u2019t feel like a princess or a beast or a Bludman. Just a creature grateful to be alive. My first real taste of physical fear wasn\u2019t sitting well with me. I\u2019d faced off with the largest, fiercest predators the tundra could produce. Ice bears, timber wolves, wolverines, and me armed with nothing but my own sharp teeth and nails and determination to master the enemy. I\u2019d faced my mother in one of her world-famous dark moods. I\u2019d floated into the clouds, shivering against wood boards and waiting for the moment the wind carried me overboard and into the sea.</p><p>But I\u2019d never lacked confidence in my own abilities as a predator, not until a stronger Bludman\u2019s hands had pinned my wrists, finally showing me where I fit in the world. Whatever Casper was, he had saved me when I couldn\u2019t save myself. I wasn\u2019t the ultimate killing machine my mother had always told me I was.</p><p>Perhaps that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing after all.</p><p>13</p><p>Somehow we ended up back at our door, Casper\u2019s arm around my shivering shoulders. He withdrew with a gentle pat, hovering near, probably afraid I was going to fall over without him there to hold me up. For once, I wasn\u2019t angered by his attentiveness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my bunk.\u201d Keen disappeared into the closet and slammed the door. Her next words were muffled by thick wood. \u201cEnough bloody excitement for one night.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my only dress, the thick, tawny cloth splattered with wine stains and blood.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to clean this up? I have no wardrobe, no maid. Do we even have running water on this flying hatbox?\u201d</p><p>Casper looked me up and down and flushed, then turned to dig through my trunk. He handed me a wad of soft white cloth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bedtime. Here\u2019s your nightgown. Just go to sleep, and we\u2019ll deal with it in the morning, when everyone is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess coital?\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cMore clothed and sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go outside to keep watch. The other passengers will just think I\u2019m drunk. I\u2019m possibly the only person besides you who isn\u2019t. So that\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>He went for the door, and I panicked. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d His gaze was steady, roving over me as if hunting for sore places.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind . . .\u201d I took a deep breath, searching for the right words. I was accustomed to ordering people around, not asking favors.</p><p>Casper\u2019s face softened. \u201cShall I stay in the room until you\u2019re asleep?\u201d</p><p>A small smile and a nod were all I could muster.</p><p>He pulled a book out of the trunk and began to read by the light of the wall sconce. After a contemplative look, I went into the bathroom to disrobe. It was the same size as the closet and very primitive, just a toilet, a spigot, and a mirror, but all I needed was the privacy. It felt wonderful to unbuckle the corset and peel the filthy layers from my skin. I\u2019d never worn clothes so heavy and tight and binding. Or, for that matter, so smelly. I pulled on the light cotton nightgown Reve had packed for me and tiptoed to the bed, leaving my soiled clothes on the ground. Casper did me the courtesy of not looking up, and I turned on my side and pulled the velvet coverlet over my shoulder.</p><p>As I fell asleep, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about Casper, listening to him breathe as his bare fingers whispered over the pages of his book. I\u2019d watched him drinking. He\u2019d had glass after glass of wine, and he\u2019d surreptitiously mixed in his own special brew from the flask with every refill. He should have been drunk. But he wasn\u2019t. Either that, or he was a good actor. And under the smell of red wine, filling the airless room, there was still something else, irritating me like an itch I couldn\u2019t quite scratch.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ahna,\u201d he whispered. As if I finally had permission, I slept.</p><p>I was trying to muddle through Casper\u2019s book when the door opened the next morning. I hadn\u2019t seen Casper or Keen since waking up, and I was bored already, sick of the small room and unaccustomed to being trapped. The book was dull, nothing but music theory and dizzying arrays of notes. Casper\u2019s company would be a welcome diversion, if only for the bickering. Maybe that was why there was something teasing in my tone when I said, \u201cAnd where have you been?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPicking out the perfect gown to highlight your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The voice belonged to a woman, and I stifled my instinct to attack her as she emerged from behind the door with an impish smile.

Her dress was in a loose, foreign style, with a flowing skirt and a fitted bodice, the entire garment almost see-through. One hand held folded blue cloth, and the other one stroked suggestively down her collarbone as she closed the door and leaned back against it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lovely, you know,\u201d she murmured in a cultured London accent. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off you at dinner last night.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I said nothing, just glared.</p><p>\u201cYou could make a lot of money. I could teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all bad. I can make sure you enjoy it.\u201d She walked toward me, hips swaying and painted lips quirked up on one side.</p><p>The only thing I needed less than a half-dressed snack in my room was a prostitute in my bed. I drew a deep breath and opened my mouth as if to scream, and she drew back with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t fuss. I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying harpsichord at breakfast, albeit very softly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d</p> <p>She grinned and winked, holding up a shimmery puddle of blue silk. \u201cMiss May asked me to bring you something to wear while they clean your clothes. I thought this might suit.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow and reached for the dress. It would be a welcome change, wearing something pretty and light again. I could already imagine the silk sliding over my skin, whispering as I walked. But she yanked it back, her eyes glazing over with hunger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating, lovely. Off with the nightdress first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out. Now.\u201d</p><p>She held up the dress, letting the skirt tumble from her bare hands to dance in the air. I crossed my arms over my chest and barely stopped myself from hissing.</p><p>\u201cYou truly are a beauty,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cAre you still a virgin? Miss May would set a price that would keep you in silks for life, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not for sale at any price. You delivered the dress. Now, go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pay the price first, little pretty,\u201d she purred. \u201cAnd everything on the Maybuck has a price.\u201d</p> <p>She draped the dress over the foot of the bed, the light blue silk shining against the plush velvet. With a confident smile, she leaned close and placed one soft, white hand to my cheek as if to pull me closer. I froze as my beast roared inside. A glimmering curtain of red overlay everything I saw, and I lunged for her bare white throat.</p><p>My teeth met in the air, barely a whisper away from her jugular, her hands on either side of my face.</p><p>She actually laughed. \u201cNot today, sweetheart,\u201d she said.</p><p>Soft bare fingers held my head away with a strength she should not have had. Her pulse hadn\u2019t even gone up. Before she could say anything else, I whipped my face out of her grasp and crawled hastily off the bed. I wouldn\u2019t underestimate her again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you,\u201d I said, making it a statement.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who wants to be like you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lingered on the low neck of my gown. I snatched Casper\u2019s coat off the desk and slung it around my shoulders, tucking it over my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her chin toward my hands, and I realized they had been bare the whole time. \u201cYou\u2019re a Bludwoman in disguise, and that means each of us has something the other wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your blud, and you want my silence. You give me what I want, I\u2019ll keep your secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you blackmailing me?\u201d I asked carefully.</p><p>A slow, dreamy, satisfied smile spread over her face. She reclined on the bed as gracefully as water toppling over rocks and said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I am. And now that I think of it, you have two things I want. And from what I hear, you\u2019re only going to enjoy one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give me your blud or your body, or I tell Miss May that a monster\u2019s hiding on her boat. She\u2019ll toss you overboard into the sea quicker than I can snap.\u201d She held up long, slender fingers and snapped. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with my blud?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat good will it do?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered as she bit her red-painted lip coyly. \u201cOh, honey. You can\u2019t be that naive. Did no one ever teach you how to blud someone?\u201d</p><p>My nails dug into my palms. I hated admitting ignorance. But I had no earthly idea what she was talking about. And I could barely control myself from attacking her again, the way she had arrayed herself on my bed like food on a table. She was taunting me, and she was loving it.</p><p>\u201cGuess not,\u201d she said to herself. She sat up and leaned toward me like a little girl sharing a secret. \u201cSee, Bludmen can turn humans into Bludmen. Drinking just a little bit of blud makes a human stronger and less attractive to Bludmen as prey. But once we start drinking blud, once we tip over from a dab to an addiction, we can\u2019t stop, or we go mad. Blud is rather expensive, and most of us halfbluds would sell our souls for the next sip. Being bludded would be much better, but your sort are so selfish.\u201d She shrugged, her slender shoulders rising in a practiced way that made her dress slide off one side, revealing a blue vein just underneath creamy skin. I licked my lips. \u201cYou would get to drink my blood, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>I snapped back to attention. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. It can\u2019t be true. You can\u2019t just change your species by drinking someone\u2019s blud.\u201d</p><p>She rose sinuously from my bed and smoothed the coverlet, her gaze lingering on the bedside table, where an empty wine bottle sat.</p><p>\u201cAsk the Maestro about it,\u201d she said with a secretive smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you the truth. And then you come find me. Wear that dress, either way. I\u2019ll give you until midnight to decide. Body or blud.\u201d</p><p>She sashayed across the room with practiced grace, her slippers whispering over the boards. Turning at the door with a self-satisfied smirk, she added, \u201cThe name\u2019s Cora Pearl, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead woman, Cora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am, honey.\u201d</p><p>I heard her laughing all the way down the hall. When the room was silent again, I slipped out of the nightdress and into the blue gown, with my back to the door and a blush hot in my cheeks. She had made me feel dirty and foolish, and the dress now seemed tawdry and revealing. Whatever I chose, she\u2019d turned me into a traitor or a whore, and I couldn\u2019t even kill her for it. I locked the door and fluffed the pillows and buried myself under the blankets, wishing to hide for the first time in my life.</p><p>I had no idea what time it was, but midnight would come too soon.</p><p>14</p><p>When the doorknob jiggled, it might have been minutes later, or it might have been hours. I was no closer to making my decision.</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d I pulled the thick covers up to my chin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was Casper. I darted to the door, unlocked it, and dove back into bed.</p><p>Casper walked in looking sorely put-upon. When he saw me cowering under the blanket, he had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hiding from me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m hiding from the hordes of pirates and prostitutes who insist upon attacking me,\u201d I mumbled peevishly. I dropped the covers, then remembered how much my blue dress revealed and pulled them back up. He stifled another laugh in a cough. \u201cIf you\u2019re not here to attack me, are you here to feed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your manservant, princess. You can eat anytime you need to. The blood\u2019s been in the closet all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>I slid out of bed and knelt to rummage in the box in the closet, painfully aware that half of my back was revealed by the flimsy blue dress. The glutted rush of the boy on the bank was long gone, and my run-ins with the pirate and Cora had left me ravenous. I popped the cork from a vial and stood. And then I froze.</p><p>His eyes reminded me of a wolf I\u2019d once seen. I hadn\u2019t been hunting that day, and neither I nor the wolf had been paying particular attention to our surroundings. I rounded an outcropping, and there he was, ice-spangled white fur dancing around deep blue eyes.</p><p>In Casper, as in the wolf, there was neither desperation nor mercy. Only dead stillness and an odd, patient hunger. I couldn\u2019t look away. A strange little thrill quivered down my spine like the thrum of plucked strings, and I had to focus on my breathing to keep from betraying myself. Never show weakness. Never blink first.</p><p>He broke the tension, whipping out his dimpled smile like a dagger, saying, \u201cSo are you going to drink that or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d was all I could manage.</p><p>But I kept my eyes locked on his as I drank. I imagined it was his blood on my tongue, hot and wet. He returned the stare with a dark grin that made me wish I could read his thoughts. Two gulps and the vial was empty, and he watched me lick my lips. Altogether, the scene lasted about twenty seconds and felt more intimate than draining the boy on the bus with his hand twitching against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cI see Cora found you with the dress.\u201d</p><p>I almost fumbled the vial as I put it back in the box. With my back to Casper, I said, \u201cShe was very . . . persistent.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t quite sure how much to tell Casper. In my former life, I had confided only in my old nursemaid, Verusha. Had I met Casper on my own terms, I probably would have had him killed or beaten within moments. But now, trapped on the Maybuck, he was the closest thing I had to an ally. And if what Cora had said was true, there was a lot more to the world than I knew. In the dark room with no pocket watch, I had no idea how much time I had left until midnight, but there were things I needed to know\u2014and fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The only thing to do was confess, and it came out in a rush.</p><p>\u201cCora wants me to blud her.\u201d</p><p>His gaze sharpened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was possible. I don\u2019t know how to do it. But if I don\u2019t, she\u2019s going to tell Miss May what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say why she wanted to be bludded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she was a halfblud, and it made her nearly mad. And she said that my part in the process would be painful. Is it all true?\u201d</p><p>I had once asked my mother the same question about fairies, and it didn\u2019t escape me that all the wrong things turned out to be real. His eyebrows were drawn down as if it hurt to speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He glanced to the closet, where the box still showed dozens of blood-filled vials. \u201cIt\u2019s a nasty business. Whether halfbluds are born or made, most of them just want to be bludded and get on with life without the unbearable hunger and inevitable madness. Are there no halfbluds in Freesia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I snapped. \u201cThey would be seen as an abomination. Ever since the Bloodless Revolution, the lines between Bludmen and humans are very strict. In the palace, a nobleman would no sooner share blud with a human than you would serve a dog your lopped-off finger in a bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting analogy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was possible,\u201d I said, mostly to myself. Now, among all my other problems, I had to wonder what else had been purposefully omitted from my privileged education.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not considered a polite topic of conversation.\u201d He leaned back against the wall and crossed his arms. I suddenly became aware that he was seeing altogether more skin than he\u2019d ever seen on me. His eyes lingered on my collarbones, and goose bumps rose along my arms. I went back to rummage through the closet for . . . anything, really. I didn\u2019t have possessions, but I needed something to do with my hands and eyes while his voice filled the small room. In a nest of scraps and trash, I found Keen\u2019s brass sphere and rolled it between my palms as Casper deliberated. The thing was incised all over and heavy, but I had no idea what it was. I set it down and turned around to face him when he began talking again.</p><p>\u201cIn Sangland, the Bludmen are bad off, but the halfbluds have it worse. They try to keep what they are a secret, as Pinkies and Bludmen both consider them unpredictable and dangerous, but as it goes on, it\u2019s harder to hide. It\u2019s expensive to buy enough blud to keep from going mad. And even if you\u2019re lucky enough to find a Bludman willing to accept the pain of the bludding and give you his or her blud, it doesn\u2019t always take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could actually kill her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor my sake and Keen\u2019s, let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t. I\u2019d rather not walk the airship plank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t Miss May know about her? Wouldn\u2019t she be just as unwelcome on the Maybuck as I would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d Casper said softly. \u201cIf Miss May knows what Cora is, and Cora makes enough to pay for the blud. She\u2019s probably considered exotic. So long as she\u2019s controlled, her price might even be higher. It\u2019s said that halfbluds have a sort of intoxicating charisma.\u201d</p><p>My head fell forward. \u201cI hate having to hide who I am.\u201d</p><p>I heard his sigh, his bare feet whispering across the thick rugs. When had he taken off his boots? He stopped just behind me, and I paused, my arm on his coat in the closet, where I\u2019d hung it once Cora had left.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. But it\u2019s necessary if you want to get back home. And you\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>He was so close that I could smell him, the hot scent of his skin, the sweet call of his blood, and a heady, musky cologne. Part of me ached to feel his hand on my shoulder, but I was scared, too. Scared to trust anyone, scared to be comforted when I was accustomed to putting up a smooth royal front. I almost told him about Cora\u2019s offer for my body, but I was too proud to let him see me blush.</p><p>\u201cI am always alone,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re only as alone as you wish to be.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say, what to do with my hands. I wanted to cover up, and for the first time, I missed the rough, heavy material of my old dress. And Casper just stood there, still and steady, damn him. As if he had all the answers. But what did he know? He didn\u2019t have a midnight deadline to give up something he prized.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>He was silent for a moment, and I wondered if he was studying me as hard as I was studying his presence, trying to understand him as one animal does another. He didn\u2019t feel like prey anymore, and I didn\u2019t necessarily feel like a predator. I could read his face somehow but not his body, not his silence.</p><p>After a whisper of cloth and a metallic snap, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s afternoon. If you\u2019re going to blud her, you need to fill up. You\u2019ll nearly drain her of blud, but she\u2019ll nearly drain yours, over and over again\u2014or something like that. And get some sleep, too, if you can.\u201d He sighed in annoyance. \u201cI have to go play the harpsichord, not as if they even hear it. Will you be okay until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to be.\u201d</p><p>He moved away as I knelt and fumbled around for two more vials. I was going through them faster than I had anticipated, and it would have been helpful to know more about our schedule, such as how long until we touched down in another big city and found enough blood to keep me docile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s eleven thirty, shall I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bear to turn around. I felt like a string pulled taut, barely held together, and if his eyes had been too kind, I might have snapped. But he didn\u2019t move, and he didn\u2019t reach out. He was waiting for something, some signal I didn\u2019t know how to give.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>I would have sworn I heard him smile. It didn\u2019t occur to me until after he\u2019d shut the door that I had already broken one rule.</p><p>Princesses weren\u2019t supposed to say thank you.</p><p>Even after three vials of blood, sleep eluded me. I had made my choice, and I was antsy, waiting for it to be over. I pulled a book from the small bookshelf fitted into the wall and lost myself in the sort of novel I\u2019d never known existed. It was a flying brothel, after all. And despite my foreboding, it was a very educational afternoon.</p><p>When Casper knocked, I leaped up, shoving the book under my pillow before he could open the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother arguing. I\u2019m escorting you there, at the very least.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling the corner of my mouth quirk up and tremble.</p><p>My heart was beating so hard against my chest that I expected it to show through the blue silk. My corset and clothes had not been returned, and I wondered how much of that was Cora\u2019s doing. As I followed Casper through the halls, I was all too aware of the sounds on the other side of each door I passed. Moans, laughter, the slap of leather on flesh, and in one case, manly snores that recalled a dying bear.</p><p>Finally, we came to the Pearl Room. An engraved calling card was tucked into a slot below the plaque, with \u201cMiss Cora Pearl\u201d curling across the creamy paper in elegant script. With a deep breath, I straightened my dress and knocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d Casper whispered.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, darling,\u201d Cora called, her voice as sweet as bells in winter. It was meant to entice and charm, but it chilled my blood nonetheless. I didn\u2019t finish my sentence, but Casper walked backward away from me, his eyes crying helplessness and his mouth in a hard line.</p><p>I slipped inside, anxious to keep my shame hidden. I was willing to bet that no Freesian princess had ever knowingly entered a courtesan\u2019s chambers.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, darling,\u201d she purred from the bed. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting you. Have you made your choice, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>My back was against the door, my arms crossed over my chest. Cora posed in a long, beautifully draped kimono that trailed over the ground. In one hand, she held a green crystal decanter, and in the other, a dainty glass goblet of dark red wine. Her hair was perfectly smooth, her lips bright red and perfect. Her smile spoke of power, of smug self-satisfaction. The room was much larger than mine and done in an elegant Eastern style, all cranes and chrysanthemums, and she was curled in the middle of it like a pearl nestled in velvet.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d She held out the goblet.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh rippled as she crossed the room to stand uncomfortably close.</p><p>\u201cDarling, they really didn\u2019t tell you anything, did they? You must have come from an orphanage. You can drink wine, so long as it\u2019s mixed with blood. It\u2019ll help you relax.\u201d</p><p>I knew that, of course. Celebrations at the palace included tables laden with delicacies, blood mixed with candies and liquors and dainty tarts. But she didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>She took a sip, her throat rippling and her eyes closed in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not drugged, sugar. See?\u201d</p><p>I reached for the wine as if it was a dare, taking the first sip with a rebellious glare at my blackmailer. Up close, I could see that her eyebrows had been filled in with some sort of paint and that her long dark eyelashes were drenched in kohl. The tiny lines at the corners of her eyes were hidden with white powder. No wonder she wanted my blud. When her beauty faded, so did her way of life. Here was a woman who couldn\u2019t do without her pearls and crystal.</p><p>The glass was cool against my lips, and the first sip was heady. Along with the usual warm, satisfying tang of blood, I welcomed the tart bite of wine and, deeper down, something sweet that numbed my lips. She must have seen my surprise, as she giggled like a little girl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never tasted blud before? I mixed that up just for us. Thought you might need some liquid courage.\u201d</p><p>I took another sip, savoring the velvety burn as I weighed my options. I\u2019d never tasted the blud of my own people, had always thought it forbidden. But there it was, rolling over my tongue and sliding down my throat, fiery and exciting. I licked my lips and stared at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allowing my body to be used was out of the question, and so was bludding her. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of this horrid creature touching me, much less walking the earth with my own lifeblud in her veins. All day, I had thought on it. And still I had reached the same conclusion.</p><p>A clock chimed daintily, and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s midnight, and I can\u2019t wait to hear your choice, little pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p> <p>Her hands stroked the silk on my shoulders, and her breath tickled my ear, and she said, \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, doll?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and bared my fangs as my hands locked around her throat.</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d she whispered, choking as she dangled in my grasp, feet kicking weakly. The empty goblet dropped from her hand and bounced on the thick rug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a pet.\u201d I squeezed, both thumbs on her trachea. \u201cI\u2019m not some tame thing.\u201d</p> <p>Cora tried to swallow, her throat working under my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell no one. Because if you do, I\u2019ll find you and drain you dry and toss you over the rail.\u201d</p><p>I loosened my hold, curious to hear her reaction.</p><p>Each word was a gasp. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. I would relish it.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped her, and she collapsed on the bed, one hand to her bruised neck. I stood with as much grace as I could muster, hoping the long skirt hid my shaking knees and wishing I\u2019d just strangled her earlier in the afternoon. I had stalled and acquiesced, hoping for a better choice. But, as ever, a predator was a predator, and my only choice was the one I was willing to fight for. After straightening my dress, I turned to her. She looked pathetic and broken, lying there, lipstick smeared and creamy skin mottled with maroon splotches.</p><p>\u201cYou would make a terrible Bludwoman, Cora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide when it\u2019s over.\u201d I smoothed down my hair in the mirror by the door as she coughed. \u201cBut understand me when I say that this is my first act of mercy, and I\u2019m liable to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>By the time I slammed the door, she was already pouring herself another glass of wine from the green crystal decanter.</p><p>15</p><p>I ran down the halls, my bare feet cold on the wood planks. I passed one couple grunting against the walls, and the man called, \u201cJoin us, sweeting? There\u2019s a silver in it for you.\u201d</p><p>I had to fight the urge to gut him on the spot. I was angry and scared and ashamed and deeply, ferociously hungry. Cora\u2019s wine had left me feeling strange. I didn\u2019t even pause as I turned the corner.</p> <p>The door was open just the tiniest bit, and inside, Keen was crying. I peeked in through the doorway, unsure of how to approach. Casper glared at me over the girl\u2019s shaking shoulders, her head buried in his shirt and her back to me. Her white gown had an ugly rip at the neck that made my hackles rise.</p><p>\u201cYou should have been taking care of me. You should have been there!\u201d she cried in a strange accent.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, honey,\u201d he murmured in the same accent, his eyes never leaving mine. \u201cI had to help Ahna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need you. She\u2019s a freakin\u2019 Dracula. But I\u2019m people, Cas. And that bastard tried to grab me.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI seem to recall you telling me to back off. That I\u2019m not your dad.\u201d</p><p>Keen pushed away from him and stumbled. She was gasping, her shoulder blades heaving. She held the torn neck of the thin white chemise together as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re as stupid as he was. You think I don\u2019t see what\u2019s been happening? I\u2019m not that naive. You\u2019re not the same as you were when you found me. You saved me. But I can\u2019t save you. Maybe she can. But you\u2019re going to lose me. God, this is so fucked up. Like a Disney movie or something. Stupid princesses.\u201d</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t seen me. Casper drew her back into his arms, and she broke into racking sobs. I couldn\u2019t fathom her age, but she had never seemed as small and lost and tender as she did now, curled against him, beating his chest weakly with white fists.</p><p>She looked up at his face and followed his line of sight straight to me.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re here,\u201d she said in her usual Sanglish accent. \u201cCan\u2019t even let us have a moment\u2019s peace, can you?\u201d</p><p>I went rigid. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask to be here.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, and my pity for her disappeared. The crying child was gone, the stone-eyed urchin left to scowl at me. \u201cNeither did we. But it\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to drag you back to our world, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy entire country is at stake.\u201d My fingers curled into claws at my sides as my teeth ground together with each word. \u201cThis is not a lark or a pleasure trip. The lives of thousands of people hang in the balance. Perhaps you\u2019re unfamiliar with responsibility. With politics. With family. Perhaps you forget my parents and sister were murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to me about losing family? Really?\u201d She dropped the Sanglish accent entirely, advancing on me as if I wasn\u2019t a Bludman, as if I was just something standing in her way. \u201cYou have no idea who I am and what I\u2019ve been through. You\u2019re the most selfish, superior, nasty bitch I\u2019ve ever met, and I spent the last few years living in a place where toddlers will cut your throat for bread. You will not take the only thing I have left.\u201d</p><p>The beast in me stilled, considering her. Casper\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you want? To take what you need and damn the rest? Did you ever think about what it\u2019s like for us, about how\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hissed, long and low.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Keen.\u201d Casper pulled her back against his chest, where she gave in to another round of shuddering sobs. His accent was subtly changed, too. Rounder, softer. Mellow, like afternoon sunshine. Definitely not from Sangland.</p><p>I nodded at Keen\u2019s dress. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one under attack. Cora was blackmailing me. She wants to be bludded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keen looked from me to Casper in shock.</p><p>Casper nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t tell you that she offered me a third choice. She could tell Miss May, I could blud her, or . . . I could give her my body.\u201d</p><p>They both stared at me. Keen\u2019s mouth hung open. Casper cocked his head, alert and considering.</p><p>\u201cAnd you let her?\u201d Keen finally asked.</p><p>I drew myself up, tall and proud. \u201cI\u2019d rather die than give my blud or my body to someone undeserving. So I shook her by the neck and told her I\u2019d kill her if she exposed me.\u201d</p><p>Keen sniffled and straightened. \u201cMust be nice to be that dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you can\u2019t show your fangs.\u201d I grinned, showing them just to her. \u201cBut I witness and wait. No one needs to know what I can do now. Let them underestimate us both. We\u2019ll show them later what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, giving me a rare, shy smile. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to later myself. And I\u2019m going to Kitty\u2019s room for new duds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s safe?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m moving, I\u2019m safe. It\u2019s when I hold still that things go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Ahna?\u201d Casper asked once she had darted out the door. \u201cDo we need to get off at Barlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I thought Cora was going to tell, I would have gone ahead and killed her.\u201d I looked down at my bare feet, suddenly aware of how very little I was wearing and how very small the cabin was. \u201cShe struck me as a coward who valued her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you call someone who was the opposite of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone with courage and no love of life?\u201d I thought about it for a second, tracing the wood grain with my big toe. \u201cLucky, I suppose. They\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and scratched his beard stubble. \u201cAye, there\u2019s the rub,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Keen talking about earlier?\u201d I asked. \u201cShe mentioned stupid princesses?\u201d</p><p>His smile was sad and tired. \u201cShe was talking about fairy tales where we come from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that end happily ever after, of course. Isn\u2019t that how they all end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Freesia, they mostly end with people having their hearts torn out and their blood drained through the hole into goblets.\u201d</p><p>That earned a real laugh out of him, the kind of laugh that kept going until tears ran down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s much more accurate,\u201d he said, \u201cif a bit braggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve actually done it, it\u2019s not bragging.\u201d I grinned at him, licking my lips.</p><p>He looked at me as if he\u2019d seen a ghost\u2014but a welcome one. I shrugged and, realizing I was starving, fetched another vial of blood.</p><p>Before I raised it to my lips, he excused himself to go play the harpsichord on the deck, although he didn\u2019t seem particularly happy about it. We were apparently hovering over Barlin.</p><p>\u201cMiss May wants me front and center when the Maybuck stops in a new city. As if the new passengers are here for me.\u201d He shrugged into his glittering jacket and ran a hand through his hair with a sigh.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether his look of frustration was out of concern for my safety or his own longing for a soft bed and sleep, but I noted that he locked the door on his way out. As it was past midnight, I washed quickly with the ewer and cloth provided and crawled into bed, but sleep wouldn\u2019t come. I knew I would be on edge until we landed. Cora would always be waiting, somewhere, for more leverage.</p><p>To my vexation, I missed Casper\u2019s presence, if only for the comfort of not being alone. And where, for that matter, was Keen spending all her time? From what I could tell, she had been assaulted by one of the men, yet she had walked back out that door with her original confidence, never looking back. I had once dreaded sharing the tiny room with them both, but now the air grew cold and empty, humming with unanswered questions and my own conflicted emotions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While I was still tossing and turning, Keen sneaked in, fluttered around in the closet, and eventually settled into childish snores. Still later, I heard Casper\u2019s boots on the boards and the whisper of his jacket hitting the desk. He paused there in the near darkness, and I gave my best imitation of sleep, curious if he could tell the difference\u2014and if he could, anxious to see what we would have to say to each other. He cracked his fingers one at a time, as was his habit. And then I heard him sigh and slip to the floor. Even with the furs and rugs, it couldn\u2019t have been comfortable. But since I wasn\u2019t about to invite him into my large and comfortable bed, there didn\u2019t seem any point in feeling bad about it.</p><p>I listened to his breathing, even and deep in the shadows. I found myself unconsciously inhaling and exhaling in time with him, attuning myself to his body. And I was asleep before I could conclude what that might mean.</p><p>I woke up on my side in the dark, and the first thing I saw by the light of a glowing clock was Casper asleep on the floor. My arm hung over the edge of the bed, and his outstretched hand was almost close enough to touch. Dear Aztarte, had I sought him while asleep? I snatched my arm back so quickly that he startled awake.</p> <p>\u201cAhna? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I flopped back against the pillows, fumbling for something to say.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d the clock come from?\u201d was the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re trapped in here, I thought you might like a little light in the darkness and a way to tell if it was day or night. It must be confusing for you.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, rubbing his eyes and running a hand through sleep-tangled hair.</p> <p>\u201cI need fresh air,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI vastly underestimated how cramped and airless a windowless cabin would be. I can\u2019t breathe in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, technically, you\u2019re not supposed to leave the room.\u201d He seemed bemused by my grouchiness, and it occurred to me that perhaps his hand had been the one to seek mine.</p><p>\u201cDaylight should be safe enough for me. Won\u2019t they all be asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time is safe for you on the Maybuck,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cBut at least you have time to rest and get strong again before facing off with Ravenna. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone surviving so long after being drained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother always said I was hard to kill.\u201d With a sigh, I touched my shorn hair. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny. I\u2019ve missed four Sugar Snow Balls in Freesia by now. My beaux will have moved on. I\u2019m past my prime, as princesses go.\u201d I sighed. \u201cA spinster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne.\u201d</p> <p>He stood, forcing me to look up at him.</p><p>I blushed at what I saw on his face. I was thankful that he didn\u2019t have a Bludman\u2019s eyes in the darkness to see my reaction.</p><p>\u201cAhna. You\u2019re not a princess anymore. You\u2019re a queen. You know you\u2019re lovely, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself.\u201d I looked away, fiddling with the ermine tails on a pillow. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my hair. These aren\u2019t my clothes. I don\u2019t have a purpose here. I\u2019m drifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all drifting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just have to get to where you don\u2019t mind so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was raised to be someone special. To do something special. I used to be . . . extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. And tonight I\u2019ll be playing an out-of-tune harpsichord while rich men dance badly with prostitutes on a zeppelin. And worrying about two ladies who mostly hate me but are, for better or worse, in my care.\u201d He leaned over to turn on the light and look into my eyes. \u201cMiss May is expecting me to play all night for the new passengers. Promise me you won\u2019t open the door for anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Keen says, you are not my father.\u201d I sat up to glare at him with light-blind eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI know that. Of course, I know that,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut you can\u2019t protect yourself without revealing what you are. Cora already knows. We don\u2019t need anyone else to. And we don\u2019t want to end up on our own in Barlin, either. Unless you speak Prussian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. We don\u2019t have any coppers. We\u2019re stuck on the Maybuck, for better or worse. Once we\u2019re on the ground in Freesia, you\u2019re in charge. Until then, you do what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d I stood and took a step toward him, my mouth curling in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, if you go off on your own again? I\u2019ll truss you up and lock you in this room.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged off his shirt, and I tried not to stare at his well-muscled torso as he rummaged through the trunk for another.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought plenty of cravats. Try me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on a new shirt and turned to face me, standing so close that I could see his eyelashes. They were white-blond at the roots and auburn at the tips. Pretty. And there was a gruffness in him, a power I hadn\u2019t seen before. Something he kept in check, lurking behind the sunshine and dimples.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever threatened me before,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cExcept Cora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Except her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and look what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I can\u2019t punch myself in the kidney.\u201d</p><p>And then, in perfect unison, we burst out laughing. I felt relief\u2014and a strange giddiness, as though Cora\u2019s wine still rippled through my veins.</p><p>\u201cBut there has to be some way I can get a little fresh air. I\u2019m practically swooning, Casper.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cNo one\u2019s allowed above deck right now. The servants are decorating it for a special dinner. But I can take you to the library, if you\u2019re not too worried about windows. Believe me when I say it\u2019s rarely used, as the gentlemen are far too busy elsewhere and the chairs aren\u2019t roomy enough for two. But it\u2019s got a great view.\u201d</p><p>He handed me my gloves and held out his arm. I slipped them on to disguise my hands, and he led me down the hall in the opposite direction from Cora\u2019s room. I added the new hallways to my mental map of the airship\u2019s interior, but I was still surprised when we came to a set of winding wooden stairs. I hadn\u2019t known that the ship had more than one level. When I should have been studying it from the ground, I had been cowering flat on my face.</p><p>Instead of rooms named after fine fabrics, we passed kitchens, pounding machinery, and a butcher\u2019s workshop filled with ice and hanging carcasses that smelled heavily of blood. Finally, Casper opened the door at the end of the hall, revealing a room filled with blessed light and fresh air. Two large stained-glass windows shaped like white roses gave everything a warm glow.</p><p>No. Strike that.</p><p>The windows were shaped like breasts. But one was open, letting in a crisp breeze and more sunshine than I\u2019d seen in days. Cushy seats with plump pillows nestled under the windows, and the walls were solid with books. In the center of the room sat a table with a globe, several strange machines, a humidor, and a bottle of golden liquid that didn\u2019t have a bottom but rolled back and forth as the ship moved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find Sang\u2019s greatest literature in here.\u201d Casper held a slim volume upside down, and a fold-out tumbled from between the pages, showing a woman in a mask doing something unexpected with a parasol. I grimaced. \u201cBut there\u2019s probably something better than Lady Gabriella\u2019s Clockwork Cobbler.\u201d</p><p>I blushed and picked up the first thing that came to hand, one of the instruments on the table. So he\u2019d noticed the book I\u2019d hidden under the pillow. He chuckled, and I inspected the instrument further to hide my face.</p><p>It was a spyglass, but I couldn\u2019t find the mechanism to expand it. Casper took it gently from my hands and flicked a switch, and the thing elongated in a manner that would have seemed more scandalous had we not been on a flying brothel.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cradle for it here, by the window.\u201d</p><p>He set it up and beckoned me over, and I looked out onto one of the most stunning tableaus I\u2019d ever seen. A village was built into the mountains below, with picturesque Prussian chalets as dainty as cuckoo clocks leaning precariously over the snow-dusted valley. The spyglass brought the image so close that I could see clothes drying on lines between the buildings and goats grazing among the crags.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d I held out the glass to him, and he swiveled it around and looked down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a little Christmas village,\u201d he said with a surprised chuckle. \u201cThe tiny flags, the goats. I can even see buttons on that boy\u2019s jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Christmas village?\u201d I asked. He left the glass to inspect the books, his back to me.</p><p>\u201cOh. Just something from where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually asked you where you\u2019re from originally. I had just assumed it was Sangland. But you don\u2019t always have the right accent. Almanica, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He feigned interest in the bookshelves. \u201cFrom the east coast. I don\u2019t like to talk about home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about Almanica.\u201d I focused on the village through the spyglass so I didn\u2019t have to look at him and feel clumsy. It was an awkward dance, trying to learn more about him. \u201cMy tutors always said it was a wild place, where people lived by different rules. Did you like it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll go back one day.\u201d</p><p>The air went cold, and I looked up in confusion. I\u2019d been on the verge of flirting with him, and now he was tense, his face unreadable as he looked out the window. I had definitely said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the library for as long as you like,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m locking you in to keep you out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d I started, but he cut off my highly unusual apology.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You can\u2019t possibly know what I lost. I won\u2019t be going back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spun and stormed out the door, slamming it behind him. A key turned in the lock, and I knew that trying to force the doors would be useless. My anger only lasted until a fresh breeze blew in through the giant glass breast and some geese honked just outside. But my curiosity grew deeper still. I had to figure out where Casper had come from, and more important, why he couldn\u2019t return.</p><p>16</p><p>My nose was so deep in a book on Almanica that I was startled by the sound of the key scraping in the lock. Panicking, I threw the thick volume out the window and put my eye to the telescope, lest Casper think I was trying to study up on his home. Unfortunately, I hadn\u2019t learned anything that would help me understand him better.</p> <p>\u201cMay I escort you to your prison, my lady?\u201d</p><p>When I looked up at him, he smirked. He was wearing the same fancy outfit he had worn at the Seven Scars, the glittering tailcoat and tight breeches and high, polished boots. But the stubble had grown out on his cheeks, giving him a rakish air, and the cravat he was wearing was one of the ones I recalled from being tied up in his room.</p><p>I returned the smirk. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m bound to accept.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Down the hall and up the stairs, my hand felt oddly formal on his arm. The sequins on his jacket were cold and hard, and I was well aware that I was still in Cora\u2019s flimsy blue dress. When he deposited me in our empty room, I felt the way I had as a little princess, sent to bed as all the adults arrived in their fine carriages for a ball. It was clear that he was in a hurry to leave, but I wasn\u2019t ready to be alone.</p> <p>\u201cIs it pleasant?\u201d I asked him. \u201cPlaying for them?\u201d</p><p>Casper cocked his head at me. \u201cI think you know well enough that nothing\u2019s fun when you\u2019re forced. No one wants to work at a party while other people dance. But at least I still have my music, even if the company\u2019s horrible. If it gets too bad, I can always jump ship.\u201d</p><p>He sounded all too much as if he meant it. As he took a sip from his flask, I flopped backward on the bed in a huff and stared at the constellations painted on the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer until we\u2019re off this monstrosity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be over Warsaw tomorrow. Just a few more days. Can you handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle anything that will get me back to Freesia.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned over me, upside down. \u201cI bet you can. Just a little longer, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. And then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cBlast.\u201d I drummed my heels against the side of the bed, feeling cooped up and irritated and anxious to get off the airship and down to the business of killing Ravenna.</p><p>\u201cBlast yourself.\u201d</p><p>I yanked up my bare feet in surprise. The words had come from under the bed, and fabric rustled against the wood as Keen crawled out into the lamplight.</p><p>\u201cI thought you slept in the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed some elbow room.\u201d</p><p>She stood and stretched, and I noticed that she had traded the flimsy white dress for her old layers of ragamuffin gear.</p> <p>\u201cBack to your hoodlum ways?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at me, half angry and half desperate, like a starving dog.</p><p>\u201cYou saw my dress last night. One of those bastards ripped it when I said no. This seemed safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Casper know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout yesterday, but it happened again. That other girl, Milly\u2014the one they call Colette. She likes it. They give her candy and coppers if she lets them touch her. She sent me over with the wine and watched him grope me and laughed when she caught me crying after I ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI punched her smug face.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and I grinned back, glad to know she still had her pluck. Despite my general disdain for anything unbludded, I felt a rush of protectiveness for her. If there was one thing I\u2019d learned in the last week, it was that life outside the palace wasn\u2019t easy for anyone. And I admired her for standing up for herself, refusing to be compromised for a few coins.</p><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019m in my rightful place, you won\u2019t be at the mercy of such villains,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019ll just be a servant and a bludmule. Kept in a posh cage to fatten up.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, aghast. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been told, but royal servants are treasured and pampered. I give you my personal guarantee that no one will drink from you unless you wish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I want to be food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not being food. It\u2019s providing a service, and it\u2019s richly rewarded. Our servants are carefully bred and tended\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stabbed a finger in my face, and I very nearly bit it. \u201cThere! Hear that? Bred? Tended? That\u2019s not a person. That\u2019s cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what else would humans do in Freesia? It\u2019s cold, it\u2019s dangerous, and with a population dominated by Bludmen, there\u2019s no other need for food crops. We treasure our humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough to give them rights, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think you\u2019d be grateful.\u201d I gestured to her outfit. \u201cYou have nothing. You come from nothing. But I have much power, and when I\u2019m reinstated, you\u2019ll have everything you\u2019ve ever wished for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a goddamn lie, and you know it! I have a life, and I don\u2019t want the fake one you think I need. We had it good, me and the Maestro. Everything was fine before you showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to wake up mostly murdered and muck up your happy family,\u201d I shot back without thinking. I instantly regretted it.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t happy. I don\u2019t even remember what happy feels like. But we had a home, and we had each other. It was safe. And now you\u2019ve got us running across the globe, surrounded by handsy jerks, and they keep trying to yank me into their laps, and I hate it.\u201d The last part came out as a desperate growl, and I could see that under her tough mask, she was pushed to her limit, just as I was, by being cooped up.</p><p>\u201cI never meant for any of this to happen, you know. I\u2019m as much a victim as you. On the other side of this journey is a fight I might not win. And I\u2019m not even allowed to leave this wretched little cube of a room.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the stool, legs wide apart like a man in her grubby pants. \u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says you can\u2019t leave? You can walk out the door right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss May made it quite clear. And Casper\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper ain\u2019t here. And he\u2019s not our boss.\u201d</p><p>Keen grinned an evil grin, and so did I. She was right. I would soon be the Tsarina of Freesia. The threats of a madam and a musician couldn\u2019t hold me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI propose we crash dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it in this . . . scrap.\u201d I held out the whispery silk skirt of my dress.</p><p>Keen\u2019s grin widened. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been to the costumer, have you? Come on.\u201d</p><p>She actually grabbed my gloved hand and dragged me out the door and down the hall. I was terrified that we\u2019d see someone, but the halls were empty. Moments later, she shoved me through a nondescript door.</p><p>\u201cBack so soon?\u201d a woman said. She sat on a tuffet, dressed in high fashion and magnifying goggles as she sewed a button onto a ruffled skirt. A clockwork insect buzzed around her head, tied to a brooch on her shoulder. I realized it was the kindly ex-milliner with the beautiful hat whom I had met at dinner my first night on the ship.</p><p>\u201cCan she borrow something, Kitty?\u201d Keen asked. \u201cAnne needs something more . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubstantial?\u201d the woman said with a wink, and I nodded. \u201cHelp yourself, dear.\u201d</p><p>It was a pleasure to choose my own attire again. The room was lined in racks of clothing, and although most of the offerings were the sort of revealing costumes favored by the Maybuck girls, I found a collection of more modest gowns in the corner. I couldn\u2019t help wondering if these were the dresses women wore when they first set foot on the Maybuck, before they learned to show their skin.</p><p>Behind a folding screen, I squeezed into a new corset and slipped on a simple dress of dark blue velvet. Kitty didn\u2019t budge from her work and kept her eyes down, to her credit. As I laced up the waist and tied a bow by the modest neckline, I was all the more aware of the low cut of the older woman\u2019s gown. Inhaling deeply, I caught the delicious, spicy scent of blood rising from her skin. As if sensing my attention, she looked up.</p><p>\u201cThat blue does lovely things for you. What creamy skin you have! Almost translucent. But you look so familiar. Have we met before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt dinner the other night,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cNo, before then. Perhaps in London? Or Manchester? I traveled as an actress for several years there and enjoyed a good bit of notoriety. Although that was probably before you were born, young as you are. Seventeen, by my guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen,\u201d I said quickly, grateful for the ageless face of a Bludman. I wouldn\u2019t have Kitty\u2019s wrinkles and soft chin until I was at least a hundred and fifty, if then.</p><p>She set down her sewing and stepped closer to arrange my dress just right. I tugged down my gloves and held my breath, and Keen skulked in a corner, fidgeting with that gold sphere of hers. Up close, I could see that Kitty\u2019s clockwork insect was a bumblebee, and it buzzed in lazy circles around her head, occasionally landing on her hat or shoulder. She reached down once to stroke it briefly, making its metal wings shiver.</p><p>\u201cI remember being eighteen. Miss May and I came up together, you know,\u201d she said, retying my sash. \u201cWe met in Manchester. It was innocent back then. We just wanted to be onstage. But we learned that we could earn four times as much if we wore less clothing. We made enough money to keep a town house and a salon, and other girls joined us one by one. I was so young and naive. I didn\u2019t know what I was until the first one left a purse of silvers by my bedside, after. I thought he loved me, but he just wanted my maidenhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrid,\u201d I said without thinking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Manchester.\u201d She gave a rueful wink. \u201cBut what is lost is lost. We\u2019ve never wanted for food or spending money. We\u2019ve helped damaged girls get off the street. And now look at us, two old ladies on an airship, with more money than we can ever spend in one lifetime. It\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head. \u201cAre you trying to convince me or yourself?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re quicker than you look. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve dressed a thousand girls for dinner and more, and I can tell right off that you don\u2019t belong. And didn\u2019t Miss May tell you to stay in your room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not our boss,\u201d Keen said.</p><p>\u201cShe is if you\u2019re on her ship without paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to stand up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did once, and she stabbed me in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe betrayed you?\u201d Keen asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, darling. She stabbed me in the back. With a knife. Said if I ever left her, she\u2019d spend every copper she had hunting me down. So I try to enjoy my golden cage. Have you ever taken a bath in champagne? It\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, the gentle smile never leaving her face as she watched the bee twirl in circles at the end of its shining tether.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll never be me,\u201d Keen muttered.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do what I did and sell yourself too cheaply, darling.\u201d Kitty smoothed my hair and gave me a pointed look. \u201cYou\u2019re worth more than diamonds, no matter what anyone tells you.\u201d</p><p>But of course, I already knew that. And I wasn\u2019t planning on selling myself at all.</p><p>\u201cSame goes to you, lass.\u201d She chucked Keen under her chin. \u201cIf they won\u2019t leave you alone, claim to have a stomachache and come find me. I\u2019ll keep you hidden. At the very least, keep busy with fetching food, and don\u2019t trust a single one of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never do,\u201d Keen said, her steely resolve winning a smile from me.</p><p>Kitty got up to open the door for us, but something made her pause. She stooped and rummaged under her dress, then held up a small dagger.</p><p>\u201cTake this, and if anyone tries to force you, use it,\u201d she said to Keen. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t hear that from me.\u201d</p><p>Keen fit the dagger into the top of her boot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear nothing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d Keen paused at the bottom of the stairs. Beyond, I could see a razor\u2019s edge of the night sky. The last time I\u2019d been up on deck, I\u2019d been covered with blood and helping to dispose of an unconscious pirate. Quite frankly, I was more scared of the dinner party. I could hear Casper\u2019s music playing as backdrop to conversation and giggling and the clink of glasses. In an unusual show of solidarity, I linked my arm through Keen\u2019s and ascended the stairs to the windy deck.</p><p>For some reason, I had expected a banquet like the ones at the Ice Palace. That was foolish of me, of course. Dinner on the deck of the Maybuck was a messy, tawdry affair, and no amount of sequins would make it anything other than an excuse for brazen misbehavior.</p><p>\u201cAnd so the Maestro\u2019s niece finally decides to join us.\u201d Miss May ambushed us at the door, engulfing us in a lavender-scented and ample-bosomed squeeze. The leather cups of her corset dug into me painfully. \u201cHow are you enjoying your room, Miss Carol?\u201d</p> <p>After a moment of confusion, I remembered that she was speaking to me.</p><p>\u201cI find myself wishing for more windows,\u201d I answered, pretending that I hadn\u2019t been caught breaking her main rule. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s my maiden voyage by airship, I\u2019m surprised to find it doesn\u2019t feel as if my feet have left the ground.\u201d</p><p>Miss May threw her head back and cackled. \u201cOh, bless you. Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 maiden about this old boat, and never was. But the Maestro says he\u2019s shown you the library. If that\u2019s not enough freedom for you, you\u2019ll have to take on some passengers of your own, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy niece is all booked up.\u201d Casper\u2019s arm clamped around me like an iron vise.</p><p>Miss May waggled her eyebrows at us. \u201cBeing on the Maybuck is sure to loosen her up a bit, one way or the other. Now, be sure to dance with some of the gents, girl, and maybe you\u2019ll get a tip or two.\u201d She waved a hand at the men sprawled around the deck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dancing with any of them,\u201d Casper growled in my ear, his hand tightening over mine.</p><p>He swung me away from Miss May, and I took in the full view of the deck for the first time since we\u2019d embarked. It was dressed like the stage for a play, with painted mermaids and sea monsters and coral hiding the rigging and forming niches to shield writhing bodies from prying eyes. Instead of one big table, there were a few small ones around the rails, leaving plenty of room for couples to entwine. And on the far side of the deck stood a long glass tank, about waist-high, filled with rocks and the flash of fins. Beside it, an aged gramophone played a wobbling waltz that didn\u2019t hold a candle to Casper\u2019s talents.</p><p>The deck was beautiful, but it seemed like a useless gesture when the wealthy customers were clearly just there for the women. As my mother often said, \u201cWhy buy the maid when you can get the blood for free?\u201d</p><p>I was just about to ask Casper about it when a familiar voice said, \u201cEnjoying yourself, Anne?\u201d</p><p>Cora\u2019s cool hand slid down my shoulder and squeezed my arm. I recoiled with a snarl.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Casper\u2019s arm cinched tighter around me as we faced her side by side.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t afford the professionals, so you have to go for the free wares, eh, Maestro?\u201d Leaning close, she whispered, \u201cYou get what you pay for, you know.\u201d She smoothed her black bob and ran her hands knowingly down her dress.</p><p>\u201cDiamonds and glass look a lot alike, Miss Pearl,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cFortunately, I can tell the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell things, too, you know.\u201d With a significant glance at Miss May, she sashayed across the deck to the waiting gentleman who\u2019d been eyeing her appreciatively. So she hadn\u2019t told. Yet.</p><p>\u201cPlaytime\u2019s over,\u201d Casper whispered, pulling me toward the door.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I dug in my heels and snatched my hand back. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being pushed and pulled and moved around like a doll. I\u2019m not leaving until I\u2019m satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of gentlemen here who would be willing to accommodate you,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good. Please, Anne. Let me escort you back downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly after I have a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>Standing close, facing me, he was a tempest, a wall, a statue. Implacable, hard, and angry. And yet, somewhere underneath, amused.</p><p>\u201cFine. One glass of wine,\u201d Casper said. \u201cLord knows I need it, and you need to explain to me exactly why you\u2019re up here, dressed like that.\u201d</p><p>There was an odd fire in his eyes as he bowed me toward the refreshment table. He walked just a shade too close, and I was aware of every minor movement of our bodies. The velvet of the dress clung to my skin, moving with me, vastly different from the complex and revealing costumes of all the other girls in the room. But no one was looking at me. They were all too busy with one another. Except for Casper.</p><p>At the table, I reached for a slender glass goblet and nearly knocked it over with a shaking hand. Casper caught it deftly and poured it half full of deep red wine. I fidgeted with the stem as he poured his own. Without blood mixed in, it didn\u2019t smell remotely appetizing, but I could pretend if it would buy me a few rare moments of fresh air.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He reached for the flask in his waistcoat and poured a dollop of something red into both of our glasses. \u201cNow you can actually drink it.\u201d</p><p>I took a sip, and that\u2019s when I finally realized what he was.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it had taken me so long to figure it out, but the blud in my glass could mean only one thing.</p><p>Casper was a halfblud, too.</p><p>17</p><p>It finally made sense. His odd, musky smell, his strength, his recklessness, the way he stayed alive barely eating anything. And now I knew why he wasn\u2019t scared of me. And why he\u2019d laughed when I\u2019d tried to kill him in my first, desperate moments of rebirth.</p><p>He was a halfblud. Just like Cora.</p><p>Great Aztarte, how had I been so blind?</p><p>All this time, and he had never mentioned it. He must have wanted my blud as badly as Cora did, yet he\u2019d said nothing. He hadn\u2019t really hidden his true self, but it had probably taken me much longer than it should have to understand.</p><p>I tried to ignore my shaking hand as I sipped the wine, tasting the blud of my own species for the second time. It was heady, thick, and deep. As it slipped down my throat, something in me untangled, like a knot unraveling and trailing ribbons down my spine. I relaxed a little, felt my mouth slide into a slow smile.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Casper asked me.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I said. And I meant it.</p><p>He watched me for a moment, then took a step closer. \u201cAhna\u2014Anne\u2014are you okay? Your eyes are strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d I lifted the glass back to my lips. I needed more.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d When he tried to take the glass from me, I fought him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give me the goblet now.\u201d His whisper came in a rush, his breath hot on my neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay on your toes here. We\u2019re surrounded by . . . people. And enemies. Now, give over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath through his nose. As I opened my mouth to say that he looked like an angry bludmare, he dashed the top of the goblet to the ground, leaving the jagged stem in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I nearly shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, darlin\u2019. And mine.\u201d</p><p>He took the stem from me and set it on the table, then whistled to Colette and Victoire. They ran over with cloths to mop up the mess as he put an arm around my shoulders to move me away from the thick red puddle.</p><p>\u201cAnne, you mustn\u2019t drink that again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, but I want to,\u201d I breathed, mesmerized by his smoldering blue eyes. Every detail of his face called to me, and I reached a finger toward his cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack to the cabin. And I\u2019m locking you in, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>As he turned to lead me back down the hatch and into the halls of the airship, Miss May\u2019s voice rang out over the burbling sound of water, calling, \u201cMaestro! Our bargain!\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a spot between his eyebrows and shook his head as if trying to clear it. \u201cKeen!\u201d he shouted, and when she ran over, he said, \u201cTake Anne to the cabin. Lock her in. Wait outside. If anyone asks, say she\u2019s ill. And if she wants something to drink, tell her no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye-aye, Maestro.\u201d She was clearly delighted to be escaping our adventure on the deck.</p><p>I balked against her tugging. I wanted to watch Casper play. With an impudent bow to Miss May on her throne, he walked to the harpsichord and sat, flipping out the tails on his coat. After cracking his fingers, he began to play a song I hadn\u2019t heard before, and people lined up to dance. Keen pulled on my arm, but I was entranced.</p> <p>Not by the pageantry of the Maybuck in full swing.</p><p>By Casper.</p><p>Watching him play the harpsichord was magical. His posture. His single-minded focus on the keyboard. His boots pounding time on the ground, making his thighs flex in a fascinating sort of way. And most of all, his fingers, free of their gloves, flying over the keys with a sensuous familiarity that made me tingle in a way I\u2019d never tingled. Both of Keen\u2019s shoving hands couldn\u2019t budge me from where I stood, watching Casper become an entirely different creature, transformed by his art.</p><p>\u201cAh, my dear. You\u2019re even more beautiful than the music. Glowing.\u201d</p><p>I tore my eyes away from Casper and gaped into the smoky-red glasses of a man I hadn\u2019t seen at our first dinner on the Maybuck. He must have come on in Barlin. I couldn\u2019t help staring at his odd burnished-leather waistcoat, which buckled twice under his neck and around his chest, almost like armor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d I said, coming to my senses now that I wasn\u2019t ogling Casper. I had been in a fog for a moment, mesmerized by his peculiar magic. But my thoughts sharpened, and I took a step back from the man, who stood just a little too close for my comfort.</p> <p>\u201cAnd are you enjoying the festivities?\u201d The man\u2019s accent was thick, his voice cruel. He stepped closer. Even from behind the smoky lenses of his glasses, his eyes were piercing in their fervor.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m feeling poorly and will be returning to my room.\u201d I tried to sidestep him and reached for Keen.</p><p>With the sparse movements of a fencer, he snagged my outstretched arm, tucking it into his, and propelled me across the deck. I couldn\u2019t exert my full force to escape him but resisted as much as I thought I could. He was as hard as stone, and I began to panic. My eyes flew to Casper, but he was focused on his harpsichord, utterly lost in his music. Behind us, Keen tugged on the man\u2019s coat, calling, \u201cSir! Sir! Beg pardon, sir!\u201d over and over. He ignored her.</p><p>\u201cEverything to your liking, Van Helsing?\u201d Miss May called in her most obsequious voice. \u201cMiss Anne is an obliging creature, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I heard the threat implicit in her little speech. One look at the decorated rail of the deck, one inhaled breath of cloud-crisp air, told me that I wasn\u2019t giving anyone any reason to find fault with me.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d he answered genially, but I could hear the steel underneath.</p><p>He steered me toward the low glass tank. My steps grew short as my body instinctively shrank from the salt water within. What was he playing at?</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know why you glow, my dear?\u201d he said in my ear, his thick glove squeezing my arm hard enough to leave a bruise on a normal woman. I flinched for effect.</p> <p>\u201cIt must be the fresh air,\u201d I answered, trying to play my part.</p><p>He leaned close. I saw one of the whores watching us from across the deck, her smile tilting up in the corner. She nodded knowingly, as if she knew what was happening. But she couldn\u2019t have imagined what he was saying to me.</p><p>\u201cTsk. That\u2019s not the reason. You glow because you\u2019re a Bludman. The glass of my spectacles was especially made to reveal your vile kind to my eyes. I\u2019m a sort of trophy hunter, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mistake me,\u201d I said, but I heard my own voice waver.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mistake you at all. Ahnastasia.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened another notch. The pressure would have broken a Pinky\u2019s arm at that point, and I would surely have bruises for at least a few hours. I clenched my teeth and held in the hiss fighting to escape.</p><p>By then, we were standing over the tank. I could smell the horrid salt of it, and I turned my head and closed my eyes as the light spray from the fountain caught on the breeze and blew against my cheek. It burned.</p><p>\u201cDo you know much about the creatures of the sea, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of the sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a touch tank. Within are the golden jewels of the ocean. Bright corals, waving anemones, tiny crabs, toothless sharks, harmless fish, even a baby Kraken, if Miss May isn\u2019t lying, although she probably is. It\u2019s considered greatly sensual to touch the soft, fleshy body of a Kraken. Would you like to try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and forcefully unclenched my fist, gently tugging at my satin glove. My fingers sprang closed like a trap.</p><p>\u201cI want you to feel the Kraken, princess. Put your hand in the tank and touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone will know you for what you are. I\u2019ll kill you and collect the reward and your fangs. And you\u2019ll be the ninety-seventh bloodsucker I\u2019ve destroyed.\u201d</p><p>My hand hovered over the water, shaking in his unforgiving grasp. Behind me, Keen gasped. Casper\u2019s playing didn\u2019t skip a beat. He had moved into a rousing quadrille, and everyone\u2019s feet were pounding on the floor.</p><p>Over the merry sounds of the dance, Miss May\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Miss Carol. Van Helsing will take care of you. The Kraken doesn\u2019t bite!\u201d</p><p>I looked at Keen. She knew what would happen if I touched the water. My skin would burn, and everyone would know what I was. Either way, I was doomed.</p><p>\u201cNow, princess,\u201d Van Helsing hissed in my ear.</p><p>I took a deep breath and fought to keep the beast down. When the blud took me over, I was all brawn and no brains. And I needed an intelligent solution more than I needed a bloodbath.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, and I\u2019d be glad to touch the Kraken.\u201d</p><p>He released me. I pulled my glove back up over my wrist and shook my arm, trying to get the feeling to return to my fingertips. Taking a step back, he gave me a slow, vicious smile.</p><p>I scanned the deck, barely containing my panic but ready to take a desperate chance. No one was watching us. I reached for the edge of the tank, grabbed it with both hands, and pushed it as hard as I could. The glass rocked for a moment, the water spilling away from us and splattering over the deck. Then, in one fluid movement, I yanked the glass back toward us as hard as I could and leaped away. The tank fell in slow motion, the water sloshing in a graceful, slopping wave. Van Helsing was but a simple human, of course\u2014he hadn\u2019t moved quickly enough and fell with the tank.</p><p>I was already halfway across the deck. I turned to watch as the tank shattered over the man\u2019s fallen form, raining broken shards of glass, bits of coral, and flapping fish all over the wood of the deck. Crabs skittered drunkenly over the boards, their claws snapping. Panic broke out, the women shrieking and the men running about drunkenly.</p><p>I was down the steps before the salt water could touch the hem of my dress.</p><p>18</p><p>I huddled in the closet, waiting for a flood of seawater or an angry Miss May to claim me. When the door banged open, I cringed only a little. The blud in my wine had sharpened my senses. I could tell by the smell that it was Casper, and he was alone.</p><p>\u201cAhna, where are you?\u201d</p><p>I unfolded myself and crept out of the closet. \u201cAre they coming for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everyone\u2019s too busy cleaning up. No one saw what happened. Including me.\u201d He watched me, waiting for answers.</p><p>\u201cHe knew me.\u201d I checked the floor for seawater before slipping off my boots and gloves and curling up on the bed, my arms wrapped around my knees. \u201cHe knew what I was. Who I was. He called me Ahnastasia, and he tried to make me touch the water. So I pushed it over on him.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat worked out well, then.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him, heart racing. \u201cWell?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. Van Helsing wants me dead! He tried to force me to touch salt water. He hunts my people. He\u2019s a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas a monster,\u201d Casper said softly, crossing the room to sit on the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cSurely the tank didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d I said, confused.</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Five hundred gallons of water and a ton of glass is a lot for one Pinky. But that didn\u2019t kill him. I did.\u201d</p><p>His gloved fingers unfurled to reveal the jagged stem from the goblet he\u2019d broken earlier. Droplets of blood clung to it, and I unconsciously licked my lips. Casper placed it gently on the bedside table, just out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone before. And he probably would have died on his own before the night was over. But he was trying to say your name. To say \u2018Ahnastasia.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Hearing my name on his lips drew my attention away from the bloody glass and back to his face. He seemed different to me somehow.</p><p>We stared into each other\u2019s eyes for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>I took inventory and rubbed the place on my arm where Van Helsing had held me. \u201cI feel shaken. A little bruised. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a drink.\u201d He reached for the bottle on the bedside table, knocking the goblet stem to the ground with a growl. Sitting back, he uncorked it and took a long swig as his eyes captured mine. I held out a hand for the bottle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure you want more?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt had a strange effect on you earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made me feel relaxed. I just had a big scare. I could use some relaxation.\u201d</p><p>He handed it over, his fingers reluctant to leave the bottle until I tugged. \u201cHave you never had bludwine before?\u201d</p> <p>I took several swallows and passed the bottle back. \u201cCora gave me a sip. And I\u2019ve had bloodwine, with human blood. But not this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed a little like you were drunk, the way you were behaving on deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get drunk.\u201d I could already feel the warm, pleasant uncoiling in the pit of my stomach. I licked my lips and smiled, slow and wide. The world grew fuzzy around the edges. For someone as tightly in control as I normally was, it was a delicious sort of release. Before he could stop me, I snagged the bottle back and had another sip.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, there, speed demon.\u201d He tried to take the bottle back. But the taste was growing on me. I craved it. It was richer than the richest blood I\u2019d ever had. If normal blood was a tributary, this was the river.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a daimon, silly,\u201d I said with a giggle.</p> <p>I covered my mouth to burp, and he snagged the bottle, tipped it back, and drained it.</p><p>\u201cThat was mine!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hungry little thing.\u201d His voice slurred, just a little.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>The slow smile on his face matched mine as he pushed back to sit against the bed\u2019s headboard, just a few feet away from me. He crossed his boots on the velvet coverlet and leaned back contentedly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, eyes on the ceiling. \u201cThis is much better. I\u2019ve never drunk so much at once. I\u2019m going to feel like hell in the morning. Prolly go mad. But I just killed a guy, so I guess I deserve a little oblivion.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my head over to look at him, and the room spun with me. I could barely move, but I managed to maneuver onto my side, smoothing his long hair out of my way. Up close, it was the color of burnished maple and smelled impossibly of fir trees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never killed anyone before?\u201d I absentmindedly twirled a lock of his hair around my finger.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course not.\u201d He rolled over likewise to face me. I felt his knees graze mine but was too melty and fuzzy to react. Our eyes met with a sizzle, and part of me woke up a little bit, just enough to appreciate the fine blue of his irises, the knowing curve of his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhere I come from, killing is a serious crime. I\u2019ve punched a few guys, but I\u2019ve never drawn blood.\u201d He paused to move a sand-colored curl that had fallen over my cheek. His fingers barely grazed my skin, but I felt his touch like trails of fire. It took everything I had not to purr under his fingers like the cat, yearning shamelessly toward his touch. Instead, I shook my head just the tiniest bit, to see if another curl would oblige.</p><p>It did. He moved that one, too, this time more slowly. I grinned at him, and he echoed it, complete with dimples. Somewhere inside me, the beast stirred. But instead of rising in a fury, hissing and spitting and fighting from the dark depths, it seemed to curl and stretch and unfurl, as Tommy Pain did when he found a nice sunbeam.</p><p>For the first time in my life, my beast didn\u2019t want blood.</p><p>\u201cYou good, sugarplum?\u201d Casper drew a finger down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDo we have more wine?\u201d I asked, trying to cover my confusion.</p> <p>\u201cOne more bottle.\u201d He rolled over to rummage in his bag. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to hold me until Minks. But you can have another sip if you need it. Considering the current circumstances.\u201d</p><p>He popped out the cork and handed me the full bottle. I took a moment to sniff it, drawing in the strange combination of aged fruit and blud. I took a deep whiff, trying to detect what might have gone into the brew, whether it held the blud of one Bludman or many. I wanted to know how he had found it, how much it cost, whether the blud had been obtained by fair trade or stolen. But I wanted the oblivion more. I wanted the lack of control, a liquor I\u2019d never before tasted.</p><p>Knowing that it was precious to him, still I drank deeply, wanted to drink it forever. But he gently took it from me, recorked it, and stowed it back in his bag. I could feel his eyes on my face, his gaze sharper than usual but also warm. Was he actually looking at me as if I was the prey?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it I see in your eyes?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cLong enough have I dreamed contemptible dreams,\u201d he replied softly, as if reciting something. \u201cYou are a dazzle of light, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Faster than I could follow, his hand cupped my jaw as his thumb stroked under my lip. I shut my eyes and let the effects of the bludwine wash over me in a haze of red velvet and sweetness. When I opened them again, he was biting his lip, and I saw that his teeth were sharper than I had thought, almost fangs like mine.</p><p>\u201cWas that a song?\u201d I asked, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAhna,\u201d he said, his voice husky and rough.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lips parted, I held my breath.</p><p>His face angled toward me, and I closed my eyes, waiting. The kiss never came.</p><p>\u201cAhna. I should probably go. I\u2019ve never had this much bludwine, and I can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t control it. It\u2019s like there\u2019s some mad beast inside me, trying to take over. I should lock myself in the library and sleep it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I leaned forward to put my hand on his sleeve. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t have to go. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m half panther, half drunk.\u201d He looked down. His fingers idly stroked my own where they lay on his blood-spattered shirt, making me shiver. \u201cI\u2019m not fit for company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I feel?\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He looked up from our hands, gazing into my eyes as if searching for something there. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never speak of your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same as you. Muddled and drunk and not sure whether or not to let the beast out. It\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a beast?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my beast. She tried to kill you once. I think you laughed at her before you sliced her open. Tasted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. I remember.\u201d He reached out to touch my wrist. A thin pink scar crossed the white skin, and he lifted my arm to kiss it. \u201cShe tasted good. But I\u2019ll make amends.\u201d</p><p>When his lips touched my skin, I nearly melted. But not like ice. No, like mercury, like metal sizzling, as if my veins were filled with molten fire. I gasped and closed my eyes, and I felt him smile against my skin, kissing his way up my arm, every touch burned into memory with a hot iron.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your blud now,\u201d he said, his voice dark. \u201cRight here, so close to the skin, beating like a tiny bird thrashing against a cage.\u201d</p><p>His tongue shot out, and a little thrill rippled through me. It was a struggle to hold still, to keep the beast from attacking him in a thousand different ways that I myself didn\u2019t understand. For just a split second, his teeth scraped against the tender skin there, and I felt a thrum of fear and indignation and furious demand, but then his kisses turned harmless again and moved down to my hand, and I relaxed.</p><p>He kissed my palm and each finger, then released me. For a moment, my hand hovered in midair, my eyes closed. Then I went boneless and let my hand drop to the bed, the little thrills still running up and down, echoes of his touch. I opened my eyes and licked my lips. My breath was coming fast, the same feeling I would get on a hunt, watching the prey, waiting for the right moment to pounce.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t the hunter this time. My eyes met his, and I saw his beast there, roiling beneath the surface, dark and hungry. I could see the tension in his broad shoulders, his hands curling and uncurling against the blanket as if testing claws.</p><p>\u201cCome on, beast,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His lips crashed against mine, his body driving me back into the soft pillows with a passion just one notch above fury.</p><p>I had never imagined that a kiss could be like that, like a live thing, like lightning. The hasty, awkward fumbling of the salesman on the tank and the press of the pirate, even that earlier searing brand from Casper himself, were as different from this as a drop of rain was from a hurricane. His mouth moved against mine, hungry and seeking and offering no quarter, no escape. As he parted my lips with his tongue, I tangled my hands in his hair, pinning him to me and daring him to leave me wanting.</p><p>In response, he pressed his body against mine, cupping my jaw and settling over me possessively. It was delicious, the strength and purpose in him, the tension in his muscles against the thick velvet of my dress. Barely knowing what I was doing, I growled softly into his kiss and hooked a leg over one of his boots. Heedless of all my training as a predator and a princess, I wanted him right where he was, and damn the rest.</p><p>He pulled away to chuckle against my mouth, and I nipped his lip, tasting just the tiniest hint of blood. He growled as I sucked his lip and moaned, trying to draw in more of the marvelous, wild taste of him. No wonder I\u2019d tried to kill him when I\u2019d first woken up. Under that odd, musky odor, he was just a step below the bludwine. Casper was intoxicating.</p><p>He pulled back, eyes afire. Trailing a finger down my face, he ran his thumb between my lips. Remembering the sensual dance of his fingers over the harpsichord\u2019s keys, I wrapped my mouth around his thumb and sucked until he pulled it out with a tortured groan.</p><p>\u201cNo more blood,\u201d he said, his voice as ragged as I\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cTit for tat,\u201d I said with a brazen smile. Now that I\u2019d had a taste of him, I wanted more.</p><p>\u201cIs that how it works? You try to kill me, so I cut you; I make amends and you kiss me until I bleed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do without the first two parts,\u201d I purred.</p><p>\u201cCould you, now?\u201d</p><p>I just smiled, my eyes focused on his lip and the single bead of blood there. I shifted under him a little, noticing his weight now that we weren\u2019t kissing, wanting more kisses. When I tried to move my leg, he caught it against his side. \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d he muttered, stopping my wiggling by pressing up against me in a way that made me gasp and then settling his lips over my open mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart was thumping against my corset, and I lost myself in the kiss. I didn\u2019t know where I ended and he began, whose tongue was whose, how much of the beast took me over. I wrapped my other leg around him, and he pressed against me with the rhythm of a spring river crashing against rocks. I found myself moving with him, my hands fumbling with his cravat.</p><p>He caught my throat in one hand, and I hissed on principle. He laughed and kissed his way down my neck, making me squirm and pant. He paused between kisses, and the hunger when his hot mouth wasn\u2019t on my skin was interminable. When his teeth grazed my jaw, I leaned my head farther back. My beast didn\u2019t care if my throat was ripped out, so long as his hands stayed on me.</p><p>I was lost in sensation, feeling things I\u2019d never felt, never considered. The fire arcing down my spine, settling in my belly like lava, trickling deeper to a need I\u2019d never known, a deep ache between my legs worse than any hunger for blood. I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted, but I\u2019d never wanted anything so badly. When he reached down to unlace the front of my dress, I caught his ear in my teeth and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to.\u201d He unpicked the ribbons with nimble fingers. I surged toward him, needing his hands on my skin, responding to his body on instinct.</p><p>He jerked my dress open and found the corset instead.</p><p>\u201cFucking corsets!\u201d he growled.</p><p>I went for the first hook and eye, to show him how it was done. Instead, he caught my hands and pinned them over my head, running his tongue down my neck and over the tops of my breasts, crushed as they were against the corset. I moaned and bucked, and he ran one hand down my side and over my hip, to the place where my dress and petticoats puddled in velvet and lace. As his hand plunged into the mess of fabric, hunting for my skin, he caught my mouth again in a kiss barely less fierce and somehow more intimate for its control.</p><p>I pressed myself against him, ablaze inside as his hand stroked closer and closer to the place where I knew I truly wanted him. I kissed him as if he was air, as if there was nothing but him and me and blood and blud and tongues and claiming.</p> <p>He finally stroked me in a place I hadn\u2019t dared to think about, a single finger slicked between my thighs, and I cried out in amazement and passion and fierce joy.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I heard the door open and Keen howl, \u201cGoddammit!\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>Her boots clomped away down the hall as I sat up, trying to put my skirts to rights, my face flushed to have been seen in such a state. Was it so wrong, what we had done? Did Casper hate me now that Keen had seen? I pulled up my knees, tucking my skirts tightly under my legs. I was looking down, but I could hear Casper putting himself to rights, too.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said, his voice half growl and half whisper.</p><p>When I didn\u2019t look up, he put a gentle hand under my chin and forced me to meet his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t blush,\u201d he said, as serious as I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me what to do?\u201d I said, trying to muster my usual arrogance. The quiver in my lip betrayed me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe I am.\u201d He sat down on the bed beside me.</p><p>Everything was hazy, like the dregs of a dream. The bludwine, what had passed between us\u2014it was like waking up suddenly, cold and confused in harsh daylight, not sure what was real. I fidgeted, not knowing what to do with my hands. A single, shiny chestnut hair was caught in one of my fingernails. I picked it out and watched it fall to the ground.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going after her?\u201d I finally asked.</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be chased. She needs to sulk alone. She\u2019ll come back when she\u2019s ready. Believe me\u2014it\u2019s happened plenty of times before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I mean\u2014oh,\u201d I said, feeling more silly and pathetic than ever.</p><p>Of course, I was just one in a long line of girls he\u2019d seduced. No wonder Keen was always angry at me. She seemed to think of Casper as a father; she must have felt about his women the same way I felt about my mother\u2019s string of disposable lovers. Disgusted and hateful.</p> <p>What little rapport I had recently found with the girl would be gone. Strangely enough, that made me . . . sad. Thousands of miles from home, surrounded by strangers, it had been nice to talk to someone who didn\u2019t want me dead.</p><p>Casper paced the small room, his fingers drumming hard against his thighs. I couldn\u2019t imagine what the song might be, but it was hard and pounding. His breathing was fast, and when he stopped to look at me, his pupils were pinpricks in the darkened blue of his eyes. As much as I had liked meeting his beast, what I saw in him now was madness of a different sort, and it worried me.</p><p>\u201cAhna.\u201d It came out ragged, harsh. Tortured.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go,\u201d I said. I realized that my dress was unlaced, showing the white corset underneath. I held the velvet together over my chest and struggled to lace it, sure that my face was redder than blood.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back, hiding my shame and the damning tears that I couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cAhnastasia, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me Anne,\u201d I answered quietly. \u201cIt will be easier that way.\u201d</p><p>For one long moment, he stood there. I imagined his hand held out, something holding him back from touching me, comforting me. But I didn\u2019t let myself look to see if it was true. Maybe he was counting his money to see if he could afford one of the courtesans tonight instead. Maybe he had a deal with Miss May. I just wanted him to leave so I could cry in peace.</p><p>\u201cJust go, Casper.\u201d</p><p>He sighed sadly, and I heard his boot turn on the wood. Just then, the airship shuddered, throwing him onto the bed with me. I stifled my protest with a hand over my mouth at my sudden nausea. Screams erupted overhead, and the Maybuck bucked again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I croaked, bloody bile rising in my throat.</p><p>Casper went into a defensive crouch. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Feet thundered above us, and I stared at the ceiling, quite positive that there shouldn\u2019t have been that many heavy boots on the ship. Casper opened the door to look out, and the sounds of screams and clashing metal rang down the hall.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d He tossed something onto the bed, and I picked it up. A dagger, barely more than a letter opener. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but lock the door, and be ready. I\u2019ve got to find Keen.\u201d</p><p>I turned the blade over in my hands and slipped it beneath my leg. Casper held the empty bottle like a club and staggered toward the hallway as the ship tilted again. Something dark flew through the open door and thunked heavily against his bare head, and he crumpled to the ground. The form that filled the doorway was wild, with matted hair and a single eye that gleamed in the lamplight like Tommy Pain\u2019s.</p><p>With a hiss, I was on my feet on the bed, Casper\u2019s knife clutched in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding that all wrong, missy,\u201d the man said with unexpected humor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got other weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t your weapons I\u2019m wanting to see.\u201d</p><p>As the pirate stepped closer, somehow both menacing and tentative, my predator\u2019s eyes scanned his every detail. His hair was dark and fell in long, tangled locks down his back, wrapped with bits of rope and shell and bone. He was built like a bear, with huge arms and callused paws. One of his eyes was the color of honey, and the other was covered with a black leather patch. Weapons hung from every inch of him, swaying with each step. A strange C-shaped piece of wood was in his hand, matching the one that had clattered to the floor beside Casper.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked, voice low.</p><p>In answer, he smiled slowly, showing a mouth filled with metal. \u201cThis here\u2019s the Maybuck,\u201d he said before spitting on the plush rug. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m here for, poppet?\u201d</p><p>I started to whimper and turned it into a growl. He chuckled and stepped closer, and two more figures shoved each other through the door like pups on the heels of a big dog, hoping for his leftovers.</p><p>\u201cYou try to touch me, and I\u2019ll rip your throat out, I swear it.\u201d I had to raise my voice to be heard over the shouting, stamping, and fighting from overhead and spilling down from the deck. A quick glance at Casper proved that he was still unconscious and breathing but unable to save me yet again. Not that I needed to be saved.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this, eh?\u201d one of the new pirates asked, his voice high and excited. He was small and as twitchy as a mad bludlemming.</p><p>The third man was silent and slight, holding a crossbow and wearing a Freesian coat with a high, funnel-like neck and a bowler pulled down low over leather goggles. Something about him tugged at my memory. I breathed deep, hoping for clues.</p><p>\u201cMcHale, you fool. Shut the door.\u201d I\u2019d barely noticed the big pirate getting close, but he was near enough that his thick legs pressed against the bed frame with a creak. \u201cGandy, get ready to catch her if she bolts.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my back against the wall, waving my knife, seconds away from showing my teeth and revealing myself as a Bludwoman.</p><p>The door shut gently, and the air went still. While I studied McHale, the first pirate reached for my ankle and yanked me down hard. I landed on my back on the bed, the air bursting from my lungs. One of his big hands plucked the knife from mine as if it were a child\u2019s toy, and I realized that I wasn\u2019t wearing my gloves, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice or care. With a shriek of fury, I twisted away from him, trying to claw my way off my back and out of a helpless position. The big pirate laughed and pulled me back with sure hands, inch by inch toward him.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d It was McHale, his hand on his crossbow.</p><p>\u201cYou forget yourself, Bluddy,\u201d the big pirate barked. \u201cYou\u2019ll get thirds and be glad of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see she\u2019s not a whore? She\u2019s terrified, man.\u201d</p><p>With one meaty mitt wrapped around my ankle, the big pirate slowly turned to face McHale.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t in here because she\u2019s a whore. I\u2019m in here because she\u2019s a woman. You want in on this, or you and Gandy want to go belowdecks and blow each other\u2019s bilges?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI ain\u2019t a poof!\u201d Gandy shouted, unbuckling his belt and trying to shove himself closer to me. \u201cLet me in, and I\u2019ll prove it! I\u2019m smaller than you, anyway. I\u2019ll get her started for you.\u201d</p><p>With a leisurely swing of his fist, the big pirate sent Gandy into the wall and to the ground beside Casper.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u201d\u2014he pulled lips back over teeth of glinting gold\u2014\u201cis mine.\u201d</p> <p>With animal quickness, McHale launched himself at the big pirate, driving him into the bed across my legs. I smelled the blood before I saw it, and the beast took me over. I had slipped my legs out from under the big pirate\u2019s body and pressed my face to his wrist before I noticed McHale poised over the pirate\u2019s red-splattered neck. The body danced beneath us as the big man screamed and fought for his life. Together, we held him easily.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cEat first,\u201d he said with just a hint of a Freesian accent. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>My eyes held him for one moment, not trusting my good luck. My savior was a Bludman, and one more than willing to share, which was a prize rarer than rubies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re generous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am honored to share the kill.\u201d He took one long pull and bowed his head to me, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. \u201cMy princess.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>It was oddly intimate, sharing someone\u2019s kill for the first time. The room was a warm cocoon of comforting sounds. The polite slurping of blood rose gently over the rhythmic breaths of the still-living men, and I sighed in contentment to feel my hunger sated for the first time in days. The big pirate was fantastically full of blood.</p><p>I left the last pull for my host, as it seemed the polite thing to do. But he sat back, too.</p><p>\u201cPlease, my lady. It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>I paused, considering. But the princess in me won out, and I drew the last of the hot blood down my throat and wiped my mouth off on the dead pirate\u2019s sleeve.</p> <p>With a nod, McHale tidily looted the big pirate\u2019s body. When he held out a handful of coins, trinkets, gems, and pearls to me, I shook my head. Not because I didn\u2019t need money but because now that he was dead and bloodless, everything about him struck me as disgusting.</p><p>Kneeling across from each other over the deflated body of the pirate, we were both seized by a sudden awkward shyness. McHale flipped the goggles on top of his head to gaze at me with ice-blue eyes and concerned curiosity. I was at a loss for how to behave. He knew who I was and showed proper respect. Did I address him as I would address a Bludman in my country, with total majesty and arrogance? Or did I respect the fact that he had just protected me from a larger predator and shared his meal with me, putting us on more equal footing?</p><p>Yet again, he swooped in with perfect courtesy. \u201cMy princess, you are weak. Have they been keeping you on this filthy tub for long?\u201d His Freesian accent was more pronounced now that we were alone, and his eyes were anxious. But that didn\u2019t mean he could be trusted. He could easily be a spy or someone under Ravenna\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201cI am not here against my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are not . . . one of the . . . Maybuck\u2019s offerings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled and ran a hand down the sparse dark stubble of a beard. \u201cThen I don\u2019t have to kill everyone. That\u2019s a relief.\u201d I chuckled, and he added, \u201cExcept these two, I suppose.\u201d He stood and curled his gloves into fists, eyes latching onto Casper.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>His eyes darted to me. \u201cMy princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill the pirate, if you wish, but leave the other.\u201d</p><p>He nudged Casper with a toe, contemplating the fineness of his coat and watch chain, I suppose, and the careful shine on his boots.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? He would be the cleanest thing I\u2019ve eaten in weeks. And you need blood, my liege. As much as possible.\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cSo thin. So wan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man is my servant, and I\u2019ll not have him harmed.\u201d The mantle of royalty fell back over me, my spine going sharp and straight at his slight insult. \u201cThe other I will allow you.\u201d</p><p>He bowed briefly before kneeling over Gandy with a formal sort of precision lacking in his attack on the bigger pirate. Rolling down the man\u2019s collar, he wrinkled his nose. \u201cI won\u2019t be sorry to see this one go.\u201d</p><p>He ripped the jugular gently, as if trying to show me his good breeding. With a question in his eyes, he held up Gandy\u2019s arm, and I gladly took it. Together, we held the body down as it fought senselessly against oblivion. This time, I insisted he take the last pull and went to check on Casper.</p><p>I crouched beside his unconscious form, picking up the weapon that had knocked him out.</p><p>\u201cBoomerang,\u201d McHale said, taking it from my hand. \u201cHe should be unharmed.\u201d</p><p>I traced the purple bruise on Casper\u2019s temple, where the burnished wood had slammed into him. It was strange, seeing my black-scaled hands and white talons against his golden skin. He was halfway between Bludman and Pinky, predator and prey, and I was curious to know what would happen to his hands were he ever bludded. Was the transition sudden, or would the fine fingers slowly fade to dark? At least he would still have the harpsichord, if it came to that. So long as the talons were kept trimmed, a Bludman could play just as well as any Pinky, if not faster and better.</p><p>Without meaning to, I found myself brushing the hair back from his sleeping face, remembering the feeling of copper-colored tendrils curling around my fingers like unanswered question marks. If only he had more bludwine in his bottle. I wanted to taste it again. I had enjoyed that looseness, that release, more than I wanted to admit.</p><p>Tall, buckled boots stepped close, and I pulled my hand back guiltily.</p><p>\u201cHe should be awake soon,\u201d McHale said. He nudged Casper in the side with the toe of his boot, and Casper\u2019s eyes jerked open.</p><p>\u201cAhna!\u201d</p><p>He scrambled upright and shoved me behind him. Still dizzy and wobbling, it struck me to the heart that his instinct, even damaged and uncertain, was to protect me. McHale just laughed, a distinctly Freesian sound, and clapped him on the shoulder as if he was an unruly hound.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good servant, your highness. Jumping in front of you like that.\u201d</p><p>Casper shrugged off the pirate\u2019s hand and bristled as he took in the room. Two dead bodies, a minimum of blood spilled. And me, standing behind him, one step away from fretting, my cheeks pink with blood and feeling bad for a reason I couldn\u2019t name.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Ah\u2014\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAnne. Did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved me. The big one on the bed knocked you out and came after me, but McHale stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Casper looked from my mouth to McHale\u2019s, both stained with red. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>I pushed past Casper to stand between them. The air was cloudy with the scent of blood, and I could sense each man\u2019s hackles rising as if they both wanted nothing more than a fight. It was an awfully small room for two bristling males, and it was left to me to defuse the tension before I lost one or more of my allies.</p><p>\u201cMcHale, you\u2019ve been so kind. Can you tell us what\u2019s happening on the ship?\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle, the pirate\u2019s stance relaxed. \u201cPlease call me Mikhail, princess. And what\u2019s happening is an act of piracy. Captain Corvus of the Bludeagle has invaded the Maybuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all the girls are being . . .\u201d I gulped. What the big pirate had planned for me might have been their usual way of business, but I hated the thought of all the women on board being forced.</p><p>But Mikhail shook his head. \u201cThe Maybuck is famous, and not for the coin. I suspect my captain and your Miss May had a deal that would benefit both parties. We sent a scout several days ago to make the arrangements. Although he didn\u2019t return, Miss May must have accepted. It was far too easy, the way your ship sat, waiting for us. You were unlucky that Big Gar found you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you move among these barbarians?\u201d I asked, for he seemed polite, cultured, and clean for a pirate.</p><p>Mikhail\u2019s eyes narrowed at Casper. \u201cCan this one be trusted?\u201d</p><p>I nodded once. \u201cI trust him with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Ravenna needed room on the Blud Council for her pawns, so many of the ancient barons were deposed or executed. I am a bastard son, and when my father was thrown out, I had nothing left. We formed a group and fought against her, and we lost. With Ravenna\u2019s mark, there\u2019s no way to prosper in what\u2019s become of Freesia.\u201d He pulled back his glove to show a stark red symbol burned into his wrist, an X inside a circle.</p><p>\u201cSo this mark means . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo succor. No blood. No trade. In a grand feat of irony, she has turned Freesia\u2019s own royal sons into gypsies. Piracy seemed a safe enough option. There\u2019s plenty of blood, in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your captain doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the rage among air pirates, keeping pet Bludmen. Like dogs on a chain. I brought a few of my fellows with me, but they\u2019re always careful to break us up on little runs like this. I won\u2019t miss Big Gar.\u201d He spat, and the red glob clung to the big pirate\u2019s sunken cheek.</p><p>As I watched it slowly slide to the carpet, Casper exhaled in a burst and grabbed Mikhail by the arm, taking us all by surprise.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get off this boat before Ahna is discovered. Three of us. In Minks.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail jerked his arm out of Casper\u2019s grasp and gave him a look of grudging measure. \u201cWe\u2019re a day away, at this pace. But the captain will want to know what happened to Gar and Gandy. He\u2019ll blame me. If he finds you, you won\u2019t live to see Minks at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how can we get to the ground?\u201d</p><p>Mikhail\u2019s eyes sharpened as he looked us over. \u201cParachutes, if you know where they are. The princess must be protected at all costs. Where is the third person?\u201d</p><p>I looked to Casper and saw my own desperation mirrored. We two had been lucky, but what had become of Keen? The screaming above deck had stopped, and I could only hope that meant the girls had found a way to calm their new clients. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to go look for her,\u201d Casper said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go unarmed. You look enough like a woman from the back, and the pirates are animals.\u201d</p><p>Casper grimaced, and I scoffed. There was nothing remotely feminine about him, except possibly his hair, and even that was wilder than any woman\u2019s hair had a right to be. He stretched his shoulders and stooped to pluck a wicked machete off the big pirate.</p> <p>\u201cI had hoped I wouldn\u2019t ever have to find out how bad I am with a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hurry. Your only hope is to find your friend while the men are still busy with swiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere could she be? Where would she run?\u201d I would have paced, but the already small room was cluttered with bodies, their stench rising in the tight space. My heart jolted with an uncomfortable tightness as I thought of Big Gar reaching for his pants. What would a man like him do to a tiny thing like Keen?</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d Mikhail said, and then I heard the boots pounding down the hall.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, girly,\u201d a man shouted just outside, and Keen bolted into the room with a pirate grabbing for her jacket. With a casual flick of his arm, Mikhail drove a knife into the old man\u2019s belly.</p> <p>Keen hid behind Casper, shivering and panting as another dead pirate fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one problem solved, then,\u201d Mikhail said, absorbing Keen\u2019s appearance with ease, his head to one side.</p><p>\u201cPirates,\u201d Keen panted, eyes wide with terror.</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d I added, holding out my hand to her.</p><p>Much to my surprise, she actually came to me, nervous as a colt. I held her close as she shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the . . .\u201d I gulped. I couldn\u2019t say it.</p> <p>\u201cParachutes,\u201d Casper supplied.</p><p>I shot him a dark look.</p><p>\u201cI know where they are. I can be there and back in a few minutes.\u201d With Keen returned, his attitude went from worried to confident, as if jumping off an airship was nothing. For once, I envied his recklessness.</p><p>He quickly stripped the long duster from Gandy\u2019s body and buckled it across his chest, before tucking his hair up under the dead pirate\u2019s disreputable-looking bowler. The coat was too small and tugged across the shoulders, but Casper looked piratical enough.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t talk to anyone and they don\u2019t look too closely, that should do,\u201d Mikhail said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the princess safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure that you do.\u201d</p><p>Casper looked at me, and the strangest feeling took me over. There was possession there, and concern, and warning, and I found myself stepping forward, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll be fine. Go.\u201d</p><p>Not until he was out the door did it occur to me to wish him luck.</p> <p>Not until Mikhail turned to me, his smile wide and sharp and his eyes fever-bright, did it occur to me that we might not, in fact, be fine.</p><p>Mikhail turned to Keen where she sat on the bed. I went on alert as he reached into his coat, but he withdrew a fist, not a weapon. His arm snapped out, dusting Keen with powder, and he muttered, \u201cSleep, child.\u201d</p><p>Keen\u2019s eyes drooped closed, her head falling gently to the side and her mouth going slack. I hissed. Magic set my teeth on edge after Ravenna, but now I knew how Criminy Stain had arranged our private meeting in Dover.</p><p>Mikhail turned back to me, lit with energy and stepping too close. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from me, princess. I want the same thing you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe safety of our people. The return of the land to her ancient rulers. A world free of them, except as cattle.\u201d He glared at Keen\u2019s sleeping form, so childlike and soft. His eyes shone feverishly when he looked at me, and I leaned back against the closet door, trying to get my bearings. In a heartbeat, he was on his knees, my bare hand clutched to his lips.</p><p>\u201cMy princess. My queen. The throne is yours for the taking. Come back with me to Freesia. Together we can gather the deposed barons, the forgotten sons, the dukes shivering in the forest. They\u2019ll rally to our cause, to your cause. My queen, we can take it back. We can make it better.\u201d</p><p>The message was more than welcome, and yet his words, his fervor, his magic repelled me. It was my mission, to be sure. Everything I\u2019d done, from visiting the tasseinist to enlisting Casper and Keen to ignoring my fear of heights and impropriety to board the Maybuck, had been in service to that goal. I had decided from the very first that nothing would stop me, that I would use every advantage to attain my throne.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>There was something in his disdain for Keen, something cruel behind his eyes, that twisted my stomach.</p><p>He was a zealot, and zealots were dangerous.</p><p>As gently as I could, I extricated my hand. Mikhail moved just a fraction of an inch, tilting his head in a way that was cold and calculating, like a snake I\u2019d seen once at the zoo. He was all sharp lines and warning as he stood. With great control, I pulled my lip back to expose a single fang and let out a soft hiss of warning.</p><p>\u201cIs this not what you wish?\u201d Hearing the threat in his words, I showed more fang.</p><p>\u201cI have my own plans.\u201d I clutched the ring of succession where it rested, hidden in a pocket of my dress.</p><p>\u201cAre they . . . soft plans?\u201d He glanced at Keen, one eyebrow cutting upward. \u201cBecause Freesia is not a land of softness.\u201d</p><p>With a speed even he couldn\u2019t match, I slapped Mikhail hard across the face, my fingers curled just so. He held perfectly still, unflinching at the perfectly parallel cuts I\u2019d left on his cheek. My mother had slapped me like that once, and I had worn the shame of it for a week before I\u2019d been allowed to drink enough blood to heal it smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIt is not yours to choose what Freesia will be, little half-baron,\u201d I said in Sanguine, the words falling as heavy as icicles from my chilled lips. I could taste the sharp, sweet bite of the winter wind in every word, and he must have felt it, too. Mikhail dropped to his knees before me and kissed the hem of my dress, a display my mother had always enjoyed but that had always made me squirm.</p><p>\u201cYour word, my life,\u201d he muttered, the traditional pledge of fealty, but it didn\u2019t feel as if his heart was in it.</p><p>He stood and inspected Keen with impersonal curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHow do you stand it, my queen? Trapped in these tight quarters with such tender prey. She smells as pure as the first snow. A delicacy. Have you tasted her?\u201d</p><p>My stomach, so heavy with blood, rebelled at the thought of hurting Keen after what we\u2019d been through together on the Maybuck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my servant. I forbid you to touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo exotic,\u201d he murmured, sniffing the air. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt her. I\u2019ll just have a taste. I would say you owe me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d He gave a significant glance to the hulking corpse of Big Gar.</p><p>\u201cOwe you?\u201d I felt the anger rising, the beast and princess in me demanding his blud. But I heard my mother\u2019s voice in memory, reminding me that the best punishment was turning an enemy into a tool. \u201cVery well. Allow me to repay you.\u201d I reached for the ring of succession, sliding it onto the correct finger. The fervor lit his eyes again when he looked on it, for the thing had a certain magic even for those who didn\u2019t know of its legend. \u201cYou want a true ruler? Give me your wrist.\u201d</p><p>He held out the same arm he\u2019d shown me earlier, the one Ravenna had branded. Grasping his wrist in one hand, I pressed the ring firmly into Ravenna\u2019s mark, and Mikhail hissed as a cloud of cold steam rose from his skin.</p><p>\u201cThat is the Tsarina\u2019s Crest. You are sworn.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the ring away, and my first subject inspected his new sigil. Dark red patches marked the large center stone and the crown of topaz around it. Ravenna\u2019s brand had disappeared.</p><p>Mikhail\u2019s eyes shone with respect and awe, a correct and natural result of the ceremony.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, then,\u201d he breathed, and I nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a knight of the crown now. Betray me, and you buy your own death. But know that I\u2019m taking Freesia back at the first snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word, my life\u2014my queen,\u201d he said again, more sure this time. \u201cI am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, cold and certain. \u201cYou always were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me off this ship. I can\u2019t be discovered. Where is Casper?\u201d</p><p>Mikhail shrugged with a wry smile. \u201cHe is late.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, silent and unblinking, until he bowed his head and said, \u201cSo it begins. I will find him for you or die trying.\u201d</p><p>He slipped out the door before I could respond. His quick acceptance of my rule was gratifying but strange. The enormity of taking control of my country from Ravenna started to sink in. Whether or not I wanted the heavy mantle of responsibility, seeking it was the only acceptable choice. And Mikhail had taught me that even those who professed to be on my side would need to be gathered, rallied, dominated, and commanded.</p><p>On the bed, Keen mumbled and yawned, sitting up and looking around in confusion. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to go. If you have valuables, stow them.\u201d</p><p>Keen had to nudge Gandy aside to open the closet, but she must have seen enough of the pirates by then not to resent his fate. I knew where she hid her golden ball, but I didn\u2019t know what else she might have that she cared about.</p><p>Taking my own advice, I made sure that the ring, the necklace, and the mysterious paper packet from Criminy were all firmly lodged in my corset. I tightened the laces even further and checked the mirror and smoothed down my hair. By the time male laughter sounded in the hall, I had decided that there was nothing more I needed from the Maybuck.</p><p>Keen sidled into the blind corner behind the door, Kitty\u2019s knife in hand. Mikhail entered first, looking vexed. Behind him, Casper appeared with his arm around another man, a pirate and a stranger.</p><p>\u201cWhat about pizza? And chicken wings?\u201d the man said.</p><p>Casper laughed, an easy and mellow sound. \u201cOh, law. You could just pick up the phone, and they would deliver it to your door. With Coke and those little cheesy things and cinnamon bread. And what about TV game shows?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus, man. I don\u2019t miss that a bit. My girlfriend loved that shi\u2014\u201d His eyes met my disapproving glare, and the man dropped his arm off Casper and nodded warily. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>His accent was even more golden and mellow than Casper\u2019s. He was smaller and older, with shaggy blond hair graying at the temples, his face leathery with sun except for white rings around his eyes that matched the shape of the goggles perched on his hat.</p><p>I nodded primly, and Casper said, \u201cThis is my niece, Anne. And that\u2019s Keen. Y\u2019all\u2014I mean, ladies\u2014this is Teddy. He\u2019s from Almanica, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLand of the free and home of the brave,\u201d Teddy said genially, pantomiming the tip of a hat without actually moving his hat.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Keen asked anxiously, and Teddy answered, \u201cTwenty years, little lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t even know about Google, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoggles, yes. Googles, no. But I miss Def Leppard most of all.\u201d</p><p>Keen wrinkled her nose and said, \u201cLame.\u201d</p> <p>The three of them all laughed together, and Mikhail and I shared a skeptical look. I had always heard that things were strange in the wild country across the ocean, but there was something definitely off about these Almanicans.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Keen asked.</p><p>\u201cSan Antonio. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaleigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re all from the right side of the Mason-Dixon, at least.\u201d Teddy held out his hand, and Keen shook it. Then they just all stood there like idiots, grinning.</p><p>\u201cThe parachutes?\u201d I barked, and Keen rolled her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMy bad,\u201d Teddy said. He clapped Casper on the shoulder and went for the door. \u201cBack in two shakes, friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t approve.\u201d Mikhail sneered at the door. \u201cThat man is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot of that going around,\u201d Keen said, returning Mikhail\u2019s sneer.</p><p>Casper chuckled to himself. \u201cOh, man. I thought I was a goner. I was grabbing the parachutes, and the door opened. I knew I was caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled, dimples and all. \u201cThen he said \u2018y\u2019all.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it that\u2019s Almanican?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Southern.\u201d</p> <p>Teddy barged in through the door with three large packs. Dumping them onto the floor at my feet, he said, \u201cGood luck, y\u2019all. I\u2019ve got to skedaddle before the captain wonders where I got off to, but good luck with whatever you\u2019re up to.\u201d He looked pointedly at the parachutes. \u201cI\u2019d count to ten and start praying, folks.\u201d</p><p>Casper jerked him into a hug, and they beat each other on the back like brothers.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, man,\u201d Casper said. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve seen a face from home.\u201d</p><p>Keen cleared her throat loudly, and Casper rumpled her hair affectionately.</p><p>\u201cNot many make it,\u201d Teddy agreed, pumping Casper\u2019s hand again. \u201cAt least you got her. I had a kid about that age. Samantha. She\u2019s grown by now, I guess. You\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d He dashed tears out of his eyes, rubbing the network of wrinkles at their corners tiredly. \u201cTake care of that girl, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Casper put an arm around the shorter man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBe careful out there, Ted.\u201d</p><p>It was one of the longest good-byes I\u2019d ever seen, and they had just met.</p><p>\u201cBaseball. Harleys. Convertibles,\u201d Teddy said wistfully at the door.</p><p>\u201cMovie theaters. Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups,\u201d Casper answered.</p><p>\u201cCell phones and french fries and prom,\u201d Keen muttered, and Casper pulled her into a hug and said, \u201cYou would have hated it, kid,\u201d into the top of her head. She sniffled and hugged him back for just a second before pushing away from him and picking up one of the parachutes.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure these things are functional?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Casper wiped at his eyes. Without a word, he went to the closet and put on his leather traveling coat and his sturdiest top hat. He handed me one parachute and pulled the other one over his shoulders, tightening and buckling the straps across his chest.</p><p>\u201cToo late to worry about that, darlin\u2019. If it comes down to getting thrown off or jumping, I\u2019ll jump every time.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>The last thing Mikhail said to me was, \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>All I could answer was, \u201cPray that you are,\u201d in Sanguine and hope that he wouldn\u2019t do anything rash in his fervor to serve me. And then he was gone, whispering with Teddy in unexpected camaraderie as they planned the disruption that would cover our escape.</p><p>We waited a few moments, nervous and alert in the doorway. A loud boom rocked the ship with a sickening lurch, followed by shouting. Casper held up a finger to his lips and ran. Keen followed, and I took the rear.</p><p>The straps of the parachute dug into my corset, the string that would open it bouncing against my stomach. I could taste the blood seeping up my throat, Big Gar and Gandy going sour in my belly. Getting onto the airship had taken every ounce of courage I possessed, but getting off of it was going to be exponentially worse.</p><p>The route Casper took was a familiar one, and I wasn\u2019t surprised when he led us into the library and locked the door from the inside.</p><p>As he unlatched the breast-shaped window, I groaned. \u201cPlease, not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big window off the back of the ship. It\u2019s the best shot we have of getting out of here alive and not in chains. How much do you want to win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough to jump through a nipple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d</p><p>He opened the window all the way, and a chill breeze rustled the pages of a book left open on the seat. I breathed in deeply, grateful to find no taste of salt on the air. With a sudden bout of inspiration, Casper took down a coiled rope, a long satin thing with tassels. I didn\u2019t really want to think about why it was resting on a shelf in the library, but he didn\u2019t offer me the chance to reject it. After stepping up onto the window seat, he helped me and Keen up and threaded the rope through the harness of first his parachute and then each of ours. He knotted the ends together and pulled it tight, forcing us into closer quarters than was comfortable or safe.</p><p>My nose was buried in his chest, and Keen\u2019s cheek was turned to my shoulder. Hunger trilled in the back of my throat, but I was still full enough of pirate blood that being so near didn\u2019t send me into a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d With every word, I took in a lungful of Keen\u2019s young, innocent edibility and Casper\u2019s scent, masculine and spiced with sweat.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Keen said, her voice muffled by my shoulder. \u201cShe smells like hot pennies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we get separated in the forest, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s pretty necessary,\u201d he said.</p><p>For a moment, we simply stood there, breathing fresh air and feeling the slight, sucking breeze. It was early morning, the clouds a sickly purple rimmed with red. At least it wasn\u2019t raining.</p><p>\u201cOn three?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d already leaned backward out the round window, curling his arms around us like a shield and carrying us with him into the emptiness of the sky. My mouth opened in a scream as we tumbled, weightless, but Casper\u2019s hand sealed my lips, and the sound died. Everything was happening both too quickly and with infinite slowness as the wind rushed around us. Up and down had no meaning, and my heart thumped against my corset. I fought to keep the blood down and the scream in and the tears at bay. We spun, and I caught a brief glimpse of the airship, her bronze balloon reflecting the morning sun with a fierce vengeance. The reclining woman on the gondola, which I now recognized as an optimistic portrayal of Miss May, seemed to be winking at me upside down.</p><p>And then Casper was laughing, and despite my terror and fear and utter confusion, I managed to glare at him. His face gave me something to focus on, as opposed to the nothingness of the sky, and the manic joy and wonder I saw there was startling.</p><p>\u201cWoooooooohooooo!\u201d he yelled, throwing his arms into the air. After a moment, Keen followed suit.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to pull the string and not die?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cHold on, baby! It\u2019s gonna be a bumpy ride!\u201d</p><p>I clutched the front of his jacket with one hand, curling my head against his chest and trying to prepare myself for something for which one couldn\u2019t really prepare.</p><p>\u201cOne . . . two . . . three!\u201d</p><p>I pulled my string and nearly bit my tongue off as our bodies jolted against the tight straps of the parachutes. When I dared to pull my face away and look up, I saw two white pillows poofed out against the violet clouds.</p><p>\u201cCasper! It didn\u2019t go! Mine didn\u2019t go!\u201d</p><p>Keen pulled frantically at the string, but her pack was still contained. Although we\u2019d slowed down a great deal, it felt as if we were moving too fast. With an ominous creak, the silky rope lashing us together slipped a few inches, and Keen grabbed Casper\u2019s coat and my sleeve in a death grip.</p><p>Casper looked down, his face going ashen. \u201cJust hold on, girl,\u201d he said. \u201cKeen, look at me. Hold on. You can do this. You\u2019ve done worse. We\u2019re going to get through it.\u201d</p><p>The rope creaked again, a few more inches sneaking out past Casper\u2019s careful knot. Keen screamed and clawed at us as if she could climb our bodies and get to a safer place. Casper wrapped both arms around her waist and held her close with visible effort, the sweat starting to bead up on his forehead.</p><p>I looked down. A sea of dark green trees rose to meet us, fast and furious. Crows exploded from the pines just below us, their feathers left to drift in the air. One floated past my face, and I reached up in wonder to grab it, but we were falling too swiftly, and I knew it.</p><p>\u201cAhna!\u201d</p><p>I looked up, startled out of my reverie by the urgency of Casper\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYou can take the most damage. Can you slow our fall somehow? I have to hold Keen.\u201d</p><p>The words ripped past my ears, stolen by the wind. I looked down, flexing my toes. There wasn\u2019t much time before we tumbled into the trees. From high up, they had looked like moss or the cover on a bed, but as we got closer, the danger was thrown in stark relief. Sharp black branches, broken and ragged, reached toward us. It was so surreal, the falling, that I had forgotten to be afraid. But he was right\u2014my body was much harder to injure and easier to heal than theirs were. My fear of heights was considered unusual among Bludmen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d I started, and he edged an arm up around Keen\u2019s ears and shouted, \u201cThen figure it out!\u201d</p><p>I tugged at the rope lashing us together, but it refused to slip any farther. With a sigh of frustration, I felt around the inside of Casper\u2019s coat. He twitched away at first, but he understood as soon as my fingers wrapped around the hilt of the knife on his belt. I pulled it out, yelled, \u201cHold her!\u201d and slit the slender cord with one upward thrust.</p><p>Keen squealed as her body jerked downward, but Casper caught her up. I quickly handed myself down, crawling along his body until my arms were wrapped around his knees and my skirts were free and billowing upward. The trees were mere seconds away as I aimed for a sturdy-looking branch and braced myself for impact.</p> <p>My boots struck wood, the shock reverberating throughout my body. I tried to buffer Casper and Keen with my arms and save them the worst of the hit. They knocked me sideways, and my heels skidded off the bark, and we were falling again, Keen\u2019s scream heavy in my ears. I fell into a trunk sideways, smashed in by Casper, and then we all tumbled downward in a confusing, bruising jumble of parachute strings, leather, and limbs.</p><p>I hit the ground first. Someone\u2019s foot found my head, and I slumped over gratefully into the dew-wet pine scree. It was an old forest with a thick floor of needles, and I sank in, breathing the sharp sap and rich black dirt. It wasn\u2019t my home, but it was close enough.</p><p>Groaning and grunting, Casper and Keen rolled off my aching, battered body. Keen bolted off into the forest, her parachute unopened on her back, calling \u201cBathroom!\u201d over her shoulder. Casper and I were tangled together, my parachute caught in the trees and his flopped low on the ground. He gently unwound my fingers from the knife I still held, forgotten, in a white-knuckle grip. Thank Aztarte I hadn\u2019t cut anyone on the way down.</p><p>But wait. I smelled it. Casper\u2019s blood, on the knife and beading a small slash in the thigh of his pants. I leaned toward him, avid, mouth open, already imagining the hot press of it on my tongue. Fear always made me hungry afterward.</p><p>\u201cAhna.\u201d The words were loaded with exhaustion and warning.</p> <p>\u201cI only need a little.\u201d I swallowed, feeling desperate. \u201cYou\u2019re already losing the blood. You might as well put it to good use.\u201d</p><p>He flopped onto his back, slicing the parachute off his chest. \u201cFine. I don\u2019t care anymore. No teeth.\u201d</p><p>Still caught by my chute, I had enough room to kneel and shift his leather coat aside, settling my mouth over the slice in his breeches. It wasn\u2019t bad or deep, just a graze. But blood was blood, and I gently pressed the wound open and ran my tongue along it. He twitched and moaned, and I savored the strange taste of his blood. At first, the smell had repelled me, but now it called to me, an acquired taste.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ on the cross!\u201d Keen shouted.</p><p>She stood, half behind a tree, her face frozen in disgust and hatred and her shirt speckled with vomit.</p><p>\u201cEnough of the act, Keen,\u201d Casper said tiredly without sitting up. \u201cYou know very well how things are headed for me, even if you try to ignore it. This isn\u2019t the most horrible thing you\u2019ve seen this week, and it\u2019s bound to get a lot worse. She needs to eat if we\u2019re going to get her home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScrew getting her home! Screw things getting worse! I don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s a suicide mission. You\u2019ve lasted this long. Don\u2019t give in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of line.\u201d He rubbed his eyes in that way he had, when he was tired of thinking. \u201cNobody made you come along. I gave you a choice, and you made it.\u201d</p><p>She stomped, but her foot just sank into the needles. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were serious. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually see it through. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d let her . . . let her drink from you like a fricking Renfield!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t a movie, kid. This is life or death. She\u2019s not Dracula; she\u2019s just a lost girl. We\u2019ve still got to get through the forest, into Minks, and onto a train. If letting Ahna drink from an already open wound will give us a leg up, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>She looked at my hands pressing around his thigh, and we all suddenly noticed the effect it was having on his body. I jerked back. He sat up and flipped his coat over his lap, but she was already stomping into the forest, muttering to herself, her breath hitching.</p><p>\u201cYou like it, you asshole. You\u2019re just like the rest of them. You effing like it!\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my heels and wiped my lips on the back of my hand. His blood didn\u2019t drive me to a frenzy, but seeing it and smelling it had temporarily clouded my judgment. I was mortified, not that I had drunk from him but that I had done so from such a tender, personal place on his body.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to . . .\u201d I trailed off. There was no good way to end that sentence.</p> <p>Casper scooted back, settling against a tree trunk. The morning sun backlit him, limning his hair like liquid gold. \u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing I had imagined him saying, and I managed to shrug. \u201cWhom would I tell? You know my secret, and you\u2019ve kept it well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeen and I aren\u2019t from Almanica.\u201d He took a deep breath and gazed into the branches overhead. \u201cWe\u2019re Strangers, and we\u2019re from America, which is like Almanica in another world.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and shook my head. \u201cDid you hit your head on the way down? That\u2019s not a secret; it\u2019s a myth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, all dimples and madness. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the facts. I know things you can\u2019t know. I can play songs you\u2019ve never heard of, things way more complicated than anything I could ever compose.\u201d He held out his arm and rolled up the sleeve to show me the black mark I remembered on his forearm. A raven holding a key.</p><p>\u201cI have a tattoo. You ever seen a Pinky who would let a needle pierce his skin again and again and then walk around with an open wound for a week? Did you know what I was talking about with Teddy and Keen? This is not the world I was born in, darlin\u2019, and it ain\u2019t been kind to me.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the mark on his arm. It was true\u2014I\u2019d never seen anything like it except in pictures of Bludmen from exotic lands. When he held out his earlobe and wiggled it back and forth, showing a tiny hole, I just shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d I finally asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I need you to understand Keen. She\u2019s a Stranger, too. I found her in London, living on the streets, eating trash and bludrats and singing for coins. She\u2019s got a decent enough voice, but she didn\u2019t remember all the words to \u2018Yellow Submarine,\u2019 so I started singing, too. I took her under my wing. I was already in a downward spiral by then, but I hid my life from her. I had gotten too deep into the bludwine, but no one ever told me that it would take me over, drive me mad. I kept her safe and fed but always held her at arm\u2019s length, because I knew one day I\u2019d either die or get bludded. I\u2019m realizing now that I did her a disservice. I never really saw her as she was; I just saw a helpless kid from my homeland. And now she\u2019s doing what all teenagers do in America\u2014she\u2019s rebelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what teenagers do in Freesia, too,\u201d I said, cocking my head as I studied him. There were certain things about him that had always seemed foreign and exotic. The shade of his skin, the shape of his face. His strange accent, which he was using now instead of the cultured, clipped tones of Sangland. Could he really be from another world? Of course, I\u2019d heard stories of Strangers, who supposedly showed up out of nowhere, naked and helpless. But they weren\u2019t as common in Freesia as they were in Sangland, and I\u2019d never actually seen one. What Strangers were to us, unicorns were to them\u2014charming tales that were nothing like the reality, apparently.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s rebelling. So she doesn\u2019t like me. So what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you. It\u2019s me. I\u2019ve mostly kept it from her, the fact that I\u2019m a halfblud and starting to suffer from it. I\u2019ve hidden the bludwine, kept her from following me when I went to Darkside to buy vials of blud or have my own drawn in exchange. Whenever I\u2019ve been close to going into a rage, I\u2019ve locked myself in my room and gotten drunk. Only now that we\u2019ve been forced into that tiny cabin on the ship and since she talked to the other girls on the Maybuck has she realized what it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it means. You heard Cora. It means that soon I\u2019ll either have to be bludded or go mad.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and flicked my fingers. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine it. You wake up naked in another world where everything is different. You\u2019re just a kid, you\u2019re scared, you\u2019re almost eaten by giant red rats. You manage to cobble together a life on the streets, just this side of starvation, and then a rich and glamorous countryman takes you under his wing, becomes your only attachment to the life you loved. And then that person grows distant, dangerous, unpredictable. Starts making bad decisions, choices that feel like betrayals. What does that kid have in the entire world but me? And again and again, I\u2019ve chosen blud over her, shoved her aside, given her the bare minimum.\u201d</p><p>He drove a fist into the soft ground. When he knocked his hat back and ran a hand through his hair, he left clods of dirt and leaf mold among the sweat-streaked copper.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d My voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cIn my daydreams, she found a place in your magnificent castle. She had her own room, fine clothes, healthy food. I made her so happy that she didn\u2019t need me anymore. And that\u2019s the worst betrayal of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanting to take care of someone, wanting the best for them, isn\u2019t a betrayal.\u201d</p><p>He was across the space in seconds, so close I could see his eyes jumping madly. \u201cAhna, I don\u2019t want the best for her. I want the best for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe her. Don\u2019t you see? She\u2019s my responsibility. I don\u2019t know how to keep her safe without giving up my own needs, and I\u2019m no longer willing to make that trade.\u201d He reached into his coat and pulled out the feather I\u2019d found in the box under his bed. It felt like a lifetime ago, and the princess scrabbling cheerfully and viciously for a stranger\u2019s treasures had been invariably altered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis feather. It fell off a turban. A fortune-teller\u2019s turban in a caravan. She was a Stranger, too, and I thought I loved her. I thought she was going to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she betrayed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe chose a Bludman over me, took the fortune she saw when she held his hand. I know there was something more than what she told me. I saw her face, and I know she held something back.\u201d He stroked the feather back and forth over my hand as if painting a secret message there. \u201c \u2018Your loss will be your salvation,\u2019 she told me. Well, I lost her, and it didn\u2019t save me. I lost my riches and fame, and it didn\u2019t save me. So what\u2019s the next loss? Keen? My humanity? My mind?\u201d He stared straight into my eyes, and I swallowed at his bald desperation. \u201cIs it you?\u201d</p> <p>I looked down, taking the feather from him and twirling it back and forth between my fingers. \u201cMy mother once told me that fortune-tellers see what they want to see and tell what they want to tell.\u201d I watched the feather, considering how very carefully I had to choose my next words. \u201cI was always told that the fortune I chose for myself was the truest one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what fortune did you choose after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I wouldn\u2019t be forced into doing anything ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet here you are. Are we all just victims, then, Ahna? Just puppets?\u201d</p><p>I stood and shook my head defiantly, letting pine bits flutter to the earth. \u201cOnly if we allow ourselves to become so. I choose to meet life as a powerful conquerer. Nothing will ever take command of me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>A scream cut through the woods, silencing us both.</p><p>22</p><p>Casper was up and running beside me faster than I would have expected him to move. He must have been right about becoming more like a Bludman and less like a Pinky. After a few short steps, the strings of my chute trapped me like a spider in a web, and I howled in animal frustration, ripping through the heavy lines with my teeth and pounding through the trees in Casper\u2019s wake.</p><p>The forest was thick and heavy, old and cold. I dashed through the branches, flinging them out of my way in pieces when necessary. I threw out my senses but didn\u2019t hear Keen. The scream\u2014it hadn\u2019t actually sounded like her. The scent of bludbears clung to the earth and trees, but that was expected. This part of the country was known for the shaggy monsters, which grew large and lazy on bludlemmings and the foolish pioneers perpetually tromping into the woods, expecting to make new Pinky cities outside the harsh blud rule of Minks and Muscovy. But bludbears weren\u2019t the problem. Something else was wrong. The forest was too quiet.</p><p>Another scream echoed through the air, and I put on a burst of speed as I recognized its source. I had to hurry, before they lured her closer.</p> <p>Scrabbling under branches and past fans of sharp green needles, I let the beast go free, abandoning all pretense of royalty. In a fierce gallop, I caught up with Casper and pulled ahead, my nose aimed straight for Keen.</p><p>We burst into a small clearing, the sort of green-lit hollow my mother had called a fairy dun. Keen stood there, a look of wonder and joy on her face. Her hand stretched out toward a magnificent peacock, a male in full splendor. His tail was set wide, shivering back and forth and throwing sunlight off the vibrant feathers. His head cocked to the side as he danced closer to her, and she laughed.</p><p>Looking beyond her into the forest, I saw what I feared: the red spark of an eye.</p><p>\u201cDrag her into the underbrush,\u201d I whispered to Casper. \u201cHave your knife ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>But I had already launched myself across the clearing, darting past Keen and diving into the shadows of the forest. The creature had already seen me and wheeled to escape, but I dug my talons into its flanks and ripped a gash in the dingy white fur of its rump.</p><p>Fear for Keen melted into fierce joy. I had always loved unicorn blood.</p><p>The beast bucked, trying to throw me off and keep me from tearing the wound bigger. Without weapons or hunting partners, I couldn\u2019t take it down, but I held on as long as I could. I would teach this creature to tangle with virgins.</p> <p>As I lapped up as much blood as I could, feeling it shift into my throat like sunshine, the unicorn snorted and squealed, its hooves knocking against the ground and trees as it tried to fight me off. Somewhere far away, the peacock screamed again and again, warning the unicorn that danger was near. Its pure call finally ended in a gurgle and silence, the scavenger dying before its master.</p><p>Spinning on two hooves, the unicorn tried to skewer me, but I dodged its gnarled horn easily and leaped away, sliding behind a thick tree. I licked my lips, sated, as the unicorn blew air through its lips and galloped off into the forest. Its blood spread through me, leaving me warm and satisfied like nothing else.</p><p>\u201cAhna!\u201d Casper called, his voice high and frantic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d I struggled to compose myself and tried not to skip on my way back to the clearing.</p><p>I saw Keen first; she was trembling, eyes huge, with rips down her sleeves. Her arms were wrapped around her skinny middle as she breathed through her nose like a spooked bludmare. The peacock lay battered and bloody on the ground, and Casper soon appeared from between the trees with a dead pirate\u2019s machete in his hand. He dropped it when he saw me.</p><p>\u201cAhna. Thank God. Are you hurt?\u201d He rushed to take my shoulders in firm hands as he checked me up and down. With unicorn blood in my belly, it was hard not to giggle at his unnecessary concern.</p><p>\u201cI saw it,\u201d Keen said, barely an awed whisper. \u201cThe unicorn.\u201d</p><p>Casper gazed down at me in confusion. \u201cA unicorn?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe won\u2019t be back. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re real?\u201d Keen breathed.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThey\u2019re just animals. Big, bloodthirsty monsters. But animals. Welcome to my world.\u201d Seeing their dropped jaws and the mist of magic still swirling in Keen\u2019s eyes, I sighed. \u201cUnicorns aren\u2019t magical and beautiful. They\u2019re just predatory horses that have horns and love to eat virgins.\u201d Casper pointed at the peacock carcass and raised his eyebrows, and I nodded. \u201cUnicorns and peacocks work together. The peacocks are bludded scavengers that scout for prey. While the peacock dances, the unicorn is sneaking up behind you to run you through with his horn. And then they gorge and drag your carcass home to their harems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place,\u201d Keen said slowly, shaking her head, \u201cis wack.\u201d</p><p>Casper knelt to run a finger along the peacock\u2019s sharp beak.</p><p>\u201cJesus. It\u2019s like one big tooth.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re the only bludded birds in all of Sang, and they originate in Freesia. The Mad Tsar bludded them centuries ago, and they escaped the Ice Palace and managed to breed in the wild. No one knows the source of their partnership with the unicorns. An elegant friendship, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I reached down to pluck a plume from the dead peacock\u2019s tail and stuck it through the band of Casper\u2019s hat. It didn\u2019t escape me that we\u2019d dropped his old feather in the forest when we heard the peacock\u2019s scream. A jay called, and another bird answered, and then the forest finally came back to life, with the unicorn out of range.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I was almost eaten by a unicorn,\u201d Keen muttered. She shook her head as if the magic had finally fled, and her hands went to her pockets. \u201cDonatello! He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>She fell to her knees and rustled through the leaf litter, and Casper gave me a pained look.</p><p>\u201cThat gold ball she\u2019s always playing with. It\u2019s . . . the only thing she really cares about, but she won\u2019t tell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, asshole, and I\u2019m not deaf. I\u2019m not leaving until we find him.\u201d</p><p>I spun slowly in a circle, breathing deep until I caught a scent that stood out from the ancient greenery and earth. I followed the metallic tang and dug around in the forest floor near the peacock until I found it\u2014the brass sphere I\u2019d seen Keen playing with again and again. I turned, holding it out to her, and her face lit up with that brilliant smile.</p><p>\u201cDonatello!\u201d She snatched it from me and nuzzled it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d I asked, trying to rub the oily scent of clockwork off on my skirt.</p><p>Keen held the sphere up to the light with a radiant grin. \u201cI guess we\u2019re far enough away now that I can show y\u2019all. Not like anyone in London is ever going to find me, right?\u201d</p><p>Casper shrugged, and I watched her little fingers reach in to turn a nearly invisible brass switch. The sphere opened up smoothly, the parts unfolding and twisting until a brass tortoise sat on her hand with the subtle whisper of ticking gears.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Casper said, stepping closer with a smile. \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a tortoise,\u201d I started, and she cut me off.</p><p>\u201cShut up. There\u2019s no cool names for tortoises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when did you pickpocket that little gem?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>\u201cNicked him from Sweeting,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cHe owed me.\u201d</p><p>Casper groaned and rubbed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re suicidal, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You\u2019re the one who just yanked me out of a window with a broken parachute.\u201d</p><p>With things somewhat back to normal, I scanned our surroundings, but the forest all looked the same to me. Although I had been taught to hunt, no one had ever bothered to teach me how to survive outside of the Ice Palace and its grounds. I knew geography but not how to navigate. My entire life had been meant to unfold in the halls of grand castles.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to Minks,\u201d I said. \u201cThen we can take the train directly into Muscovy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Keen\u2019s attitude and accent were back, and I tried to hide my smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd then we find an old acquaintance of mine and decide the best way to approach the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re in disguise and we have no money, how do you think we\u2019re going to get on the train? They don\u2019t need famous pianists to drive a steam engine,\u201d Casper said with a bitter shake of his leaf-strewn hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cold, manipulative smile curled across my features, familiar and welcome. It felt good, having some power again. Surprising someone. Showing my cunning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping a little secret of my own,\u201d I said.</p><p>23</p> <p>With a wink, I plunged a hand down the front of my corset to draw out the necklace I\u2019d been carrying, warm and heavy, since London. The silver links were tarnished, but the stones danced in the dappled light of morning. The birds went still in the trees, and I imagined their wise and hungry eyes captured by the glittering diamonds and topazes that so resembled the heart of the glacier that was rumored to have spat it forth like the will of the ice gods.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth before a crow flies in, darling. It\u2019s a necklace.\u201d I smiled, showing Keen the sharpness of my fangs. It was gratifying, giving her yet another reminder that while I\u2019d been tame enough on the ship, we were in my world now.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had that?\u201d Casper asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI pulled it out of the suitcase on the way to Reve\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd when were you going to tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I had to.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, he was across the clearing and in my face, lips pulled back and exposed teeth mirroring mine. \u201cAll this time. All these stupid risks. We could have bought our berth on a safer ship. We could have kept Keen away from those lechers and you away from danger and me . . .\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, and I noticed that his nails were sharp and going narrow. \u201cDammit, Ahna! I sold my harpsichord for you. I played an out-of-tune box on a ship while old men nailed whores beside me on the bench. You could have fixed it with one damn stone off your fancy-ass necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a last resort,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe for you.\u201d One finger poked me in the chest, right over my heart. \u201cMaybe the rest of us already gave everything we had. You wouldn\u2019t be here without us. And you\u2019ve never apologized for any of it. Not once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p> <p>I faltered. What could I say to that? He was right, of course. Part of me wanted to screech at him, the spoiled princess so sure of herself and her place. The necklace was mine, my birthright. What was the point of risking it before absolutely necessary? And wasn\u2019t it the saving grace now, the one sure thing we had left? And who was he to judge me? Every step toward Minks, whichever direction it was, was a step further into my world and closer to the country I planned to rule.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>I shifted uncomfortably. In my hand, the necklace was too heavy, and I let my arm drop to my side. Without really meaning to, I let the chain slip from my fingers to dangle in the air above the ground.</p><p>Dear Aztarte. This feeling. This awful, heavy, suffocating feeling. This sensation that made me want to run, to hide, to crawl away. Could it be . . . guilt?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The unfamiliar words tasted heavy in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSorry doesn\u2019t begin to cover it,\u201d Casper said.</p><p>I held up my hands with a bitter laugh, one harsh note. \u201cI\u2019ll only say it once. Look around you, Casper. We\u2019re in a forest, surrounded by hidden enemies, creatures of blud and monsters on two feet. We can\u2019t tarry here. We must march, my darling. To Muscovy and to Ravenna\u2019s blud. The faster the better.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, as he sometimes did, as if gears were turning in his head. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust when I think I\u2019m going to tell you off, you go and say something extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p>I could read him now. The way he was rubbing his eyes, his sigh. I was winning him over, so I pressed harder. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. We have what we need now. Can we just put all that behind us and start from here?\u201d I pulled the necklace back up and let it run through my fingers, the big stones catching the sun and sending sparkles over the tree trunks. \u201cI bet one of the little stones could get us separate sleeping cars on the train to Muscovy.\u201d</p><p>Keen watched, her eyes gone sharp. I could almost see her tallying figures as she thought of what even the daintiest gems could buy for us now. Here in the forest, surrounded by giant trees and bloodthirsty unicorns, we were still closer than we\u2019d ever been to our main goal.</p><p>\u201cI get my own room, a new shirt, and all the hot food I can eat,\u201d she finally said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re the queen, I get a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I held out my hand and was glad when she shook it without wincing.</p><p>Before I knew what had happened, Casper had swept us both into a tight, messy hug. The swoop in my heart wasn\u2019t all that different from the one I\u2019d felt the last time we\u2019d been this close\u2014when we\u2019d jumped out of a moving airship. I realized he had let go of Keen and was hugging me even closer. I surged toward the crush of skin, the press of cloth, and a mouthful of his unruly hair.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys done?\u201d Keen asked, voice flat.</p><p>I pulled away, breathless. My eyes met Casper\u2019s, and I could sense his response, so similar to mine, in the dancing fire of his blue eyes. We were on the ground, we were alive, and we were on the road to victory.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d I said, turning to hide the blush in my cheeks. I supposed that meant I was forgiven, and my heart felt oddly lighter for it.</p><p>Casper took the lead, and we hurried to match his stride.</p><p>\u201cI saw Minks when we were in the air, and I\u2019m pretty sure we can make it there in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>I looked from tree to identical tree. \u201cHow can you possibly know where it is? Where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not completely incompetent, you know.\u201d He held up a compass with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThere go my dreams of wandering the woods until you and Keen collapse from exhaustion so I could drain you without complaint.\u201d I tried to put some of my old viciousness into the words, but even I could hear that I\u2019d failed. It was strange, liking Pinkies for reasons other than the availability of their blood. I hoped the train and our arrival in Muscovy would reignite the predator within. This soft, this easily affected, I\u2019d never be able to face off with Ravenna and survive.</p><p>\u201cCheer up, princess. There are worse things than not eating your friends.\u201d</p><p>He nudged my shoulder with a dimpled grin, keeping pace with me as we wove among the old trees. Keen had disappeared from sight, but I could still smell her, lingering behind us. The unicorn fight and its heady blood had worn off, and I was on edge. It made me excited but nervous, being near the blud world and my people. I couldn\u2019t help getting in at least a little bit of teeth.</p><p>\u201cDo you two have any idea what we\u2019re walking into? Minks and then Muscovy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen all of Sangland, a bit of Franchia, and the big cities of the mainland. But never this far east.\u201d</p><p>The low chuckle I gave then was meant to warn. \u201cIn Sangland, there\u2019s balance between Bludman and human. In Franchia and the mainland, the daimons keep things light and playful. But over here, once things get cold . . . you\u2019ll be nothing more than at best a servant and at worst a midnight snack. Outside the palace, your kind has less footing than pet hounds. Staying on my good side is your only hope for getting out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t it help that I\u2019m a halfblud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an abomination. They\u2019ll want to murder you in ugly ways before they eat you. Out of spite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Keen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an appetizer. Hardly enough for two to share. But that won\u2019t stop them.\u201d</p><p>I could feel the anger rising in him, smell the heat of his blood boiling. I smiled. Finally, he was taking me seriously.</p><p>\u201cFunny that you failed to mention any of these circumstances when we were planning this trip,\u201d he said. \u201cNever once did you say, \u2018Oh, hey, by the way? You\u2019re going into a very dangerous country where unicorns will stab you and barons will suck your blood.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never asked. And you never requested permission to bring Keen along. She wasn\u2019t part of the deal, you know. Besides, I assumed that everyone has had lessons in history and geography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but my lessons were on Russia and the USSR,\u201d he growled.</p><p>I caught the smell of meat and spun around. Keen ambled behind us on the trail, chewing on a shred of dried animal flesh.</p><p>\u201cPut that away. The smell carries.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, bits of brown stuff stuck in her teeth. \u201cCan\u2019t you just kill anything that comes after us? Even the unicorn was scared of you.\u201d</p><p>I snatched the meat out of her hand and stuffed it into her jacket with a stern look. There was so much that these two soft little Pinkies didn\u2019t know about my world, and I wanted them to come out on the other side mostly alive.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out of the forest and into the city in time to catch the train at dusk. Fighting bludbears takes up valuable time. That food of yours reeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if we don\u2019t make it by nightfall?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t make it,\u201d I answered. \u201cSomething worse than unicorns will find us, if we don\u2019t freeze to death first. This is an unforgiving land.\u201d</p><p>Casper took the lead of our party, checking the compass every so often. There were no paths, just thick trees that barely let in golden fingers of sunshine. Keen was already shivering, and it wasn\u2019t even noon yet by my counting. I was grateful for my natural resistance to cold, and I supposed Casper felt something similar, as he shrugged out of his big coat and wrapped it around her. She was far too short, and the hem scraped the ground, but at least she stopped trembling and throwing off more scent than was necessary.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak much, and I was grateful for the silence. Noise would draw undue attention, and I was too confused in my own feelings to stay alert to our surroundings. I couldn\u2019t get over Casper\u2019s admission about the fairy-tale land from which they had come. Could it be true that there were other worlds than Sang? That Casper wasn\u2019t just a debauched musician and a halfblud fallen to ruin but also a traveler from another world entirely? I was growing used to the idea. My curiosity was piqued by the thought that he could be something more than he seemed. I had been taught to look for value in others only as related to politics, court intrigue, and the price of a throne or a favor. Liking him was the worst kind of rebellion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grinned to myself. I\u2019d always liked rebellion.</p><p>We trudged along for hours. For the longest time, nothing changed. The same trees, the same brief snatches of sky or patches of brittle brown grass. Whatever blud creatures might have been hiding scented me and took off, and I grinned whenever I heard branches breaking or hooves pounding through the woods ahead of us. The animals of the forest knew well enough when a bigger predator was about, and I basked in the return of myself. I was born to be dangerous, to rule, and holding myself in check on the airship had cost me deeply.</p><p>I smelled the tundra before I saw it, the thick, syrupy sting of the pines interwoven with the faintest breath of frosted, faded grasses and wild winds. I sighed and smiled. That same scent clung to the Ice Palace, where we held the forest at bay with wide fields that would leave our enemies exposed should they ever attempt to come for us. There was very little that could threaten me in a field.</p> <p>Not so for Casper and Keen. They huddled closer together, looking all around as if unicorns might burst from the knee-high grasses and spear them through. Casper looked back at me once, but seeing the grin of avid triumph and confidence on my face, he seemed reassured that I could take care of myself.</p><p>He checked his compass again and again, slightly correcting our path. Not that we needed it, not really. I could already smell Minks, a grand city spread out over an old river heavy with ice and majesty. Unlike the crowded filth and tumbling randomness of London, Minks was a Blud city ruled with careful planning, beauty, and thoughtful regard for the needs of Bludmen. I remembered seeing drawings of the broad parks, the statuary gardens, and the grand church of Aztarte, which rose, airy and beautiful, to settle over the city like the wings of a grand black swan. Provided I could successfully sell some of the stones from my necklace, life would get much easier and more comfortable quite soon.</p><p>A low grumble drew our attention to a conveyance rumbling down a wide dirt road, a plume of grayish-green smoke in its wake. Casper threw an arm across Keen in an entirely useless gesture of protection, and I pushed past them both, saying only, \u201cFollow my lead. We\u2019re on dangerous ground here.\u201d</p><p>I changed our angle and sped up, aiming for just the right place to meet the slowly trundling wagon, its bed piled high with green things from the Pinky farms. When I planted myself in the road, one black-scaled hand held out, talons splayed, I was gratified to see the machine slow and roll to a stop almost close enough for me to touch.</p><p>We were in luck. A wary Pinky sat in the contained driver\u2019s cabin, and I grinned wickedly when I saw him check the lock on his door. Bludmen had no need of vegetables and other Pinky foodstuffs, other than to keep our food source as healthy and robust as possible. It was a common practice, using humans to tend our farms according to carefully drawn plans by their superiors. This wagon would be headed straight to Minks.</p> <p>\u201cMistress, I am at your service, but please forgive me. I am on a timetable,\u201d the man said through a speaker, his voice tinny and heavily accented with the broad strokes of the country.</p><p>Raising my voice and injecting it with the proper amount of authority, I mimicked his accent. \u201cI and my servants will require conveyance to the city proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe back is filled with cabbages, but you are more than welcome to ride there,\u201d the man said. I could hear the fear in his voice; the country Pinkies never really felt safe around their masters. Even though it was at my command, he was aghast at offering a highly placed Bludwoman a seat among rotting foodstuffs.</p><p>\u201cThat will suffice,\u201d I said with a firm nod, and the conveyance chugged in place as we walked around back. The smell nearly gagged me, as my sensitive nose could detect the moment a plant stopped living and began dying, and all of his cabbages were dying. Casper helped me up, gave Keen a boost, and leaped up to sit on the edge, his legs dangling over the metal lip. I knocked a fist on the metal, and with a belch of green smoke, the conveyance scraped and scuttled toward the city on treads much like those of the bank we\u2019d taken to Dover. A short ride later, the wagon stopped at the city gates, where we slid from the truck and waited our turn in the road.</p><p>\u201cGet behind me, and look properly awed,\u201d I hissed, and Casper and Keen obeyed.</p><p>They had probably never seen a Blud city, and it was made to impress. The shining white wall was well maintained, the guards friendly and obsequious when they saw my hands. They bowed me through the gates and kindly gave directions to the train station without asking a single question about my name or plans. A Bludwoman didn\u2019t need papers to enter, and neither did her chosen servants. It was so very unlike the cities of Sangland, and I was glad to have my feet firmly on carefully bricked roads, surrounded by smiling faces and polite nods.</p> <p>As we moved into the city, Keen sidled close, skittish and wild, saying, \u201cWant me to sell a stone? I know my way around a city\u2019s back streets, no mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t London, darling,\u201d I said, patting her on the head and making her scowl. \u201cI\u2019m the only one with whom anyone here will do business. You they\u2019d probably kill on principle.\u201d</p><p>She was right, though\u2014we did have to sell a few stones if we wanted to get on the train. I could see the station a few streets over, the fa\u00e7ade shining like sunlight on snow. I pulled the necklace back out of my corset and used my pinkie talon to pry out a smaller stone, a diamond. It hurt my heart to see the setting empty, the prongs clutching for riches lost, but I could always have it fixed if I succeeded. If I didn\u2019t succeed, a faulty necklace would be the least of my problems, as I would most likely be without a neck to hang it on.</p><p>I pried out two more stones for good measure, leaving twelve behind. Jiggling them in my hand like the bone dice the Pinkies used for their betting games, I scanned the street for the right sort of place before remembering that I didn\u2019t have to hide anymore.</p><p>\u201cPardon me,\u201d I said, approaching a dapper old Bludman on the street, \u201cbut could you be so kind as to point me toward a jewelry shop?\u201d After a polite but curious look askance, he bowed and sent us to a reputable dealer who offered me a fine price with no questions asked.</p><p>When I stopped outside a dressmaker\u2019s shop, Casper sighed and Keen snorted. \u201cStopping to get gussied up, eh? Figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but my people would never be caught dead in such a get-up.\u201d I brushed hands down my skirt, ragged now with pine sap and blood droplets. \u201cThe object is to blend in, and as it stands, I\u2019m attracting undue attention. Oh, and put up that clockwork before someone sees it and drains you for theft. I\u2019ll just be a moment.\u201d</p><p>With that, I slipped into the store and shut the door in Keen\u2019s surprised face. If she thought I was being cruel and haughty now, it was going to get a lot worse. Let her stew on the sidewalk for a while, awaiting her mistress like a dog tied to a post. Casper was silent and stoic, facing some interior struggle that I couldn\u2019t comprehend.</p> <p>When I walked back outside a half hour later, I handed Keen a paper-wrapped package and couldn\u2019t help curtsying to Casper. Even with my hair still short and mousy, I knew well enough that I was back in my element. The fashionable gown of subdued rose was as splashy as I could risk, not too bright but just bright enough, and had luckily fit with no alterations. I had also purchased a hat with a discreet veil, but even hidden, I felt more like Princess Ahnastasia than I had since that long-ago ill-fated day by the fountain behind the castle.</p><p>Casper had rebuckled his top hat and dusted off his coat, and he almost looked genteel for a Pinky. Still, there was something wild about his eyes that made me peer close. He was right on the edge of something, alert and frantic but trying to hide it. I put the back of my hand to his cheek and found it strikingly hot.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He leaned closer, much closer than a Pinky servant was allowed. \u201cI\u2019ve gone too long without blud.\u201d He licked his lips nervously, his eyes darting about the everyday bustle of the orderly street. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to me. I can smell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>Something would have to be done, and soon, if blud madness was anything like blood madness. Misbehavior wasn\u2019t tolerated in Blud cities, and he could get us all in trouble if his beast rose to the surface.</p><p>\u201cCan you make it to the train?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to lock me in when we get there, I think. I\u2019m losing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>24</p><p>After placing my train ticket on the bedside table, I held my arms out wide and flopped backward onto the bed. It billowed underneath me like a cloud, and I rolled around and giggled. The most expensive cars had been booked in advance, but I couldn\u2019t summon a single complaint about this room, purchased with the proceeds of one stone with plenty left over. The bed was my own, soft and luxurious. Two vials were soon to be delivered by the carhop, and all was well with the world for the next sixteen hours. Once we arrived in Muscovy, things were bound to get more complicated, but I would relish comfort for as long as I could.</p><p>Keen and Casper had to share a tiny servants\u2019 room with two bunks, unfortunately. We had barely made it to the station in time, and it was either that or the common car, which was impossible. Without my presence, they would have been gobbled up by the general populace in mere moments. Keen had been furious, but it wasn\u2019t as if they would have allowed her to enjoy a Bludman\u2019s room, anyway. She had made me well aware that I still owed her from our earlier bargain.</p><p>I had been fascinated by trains as a child and had even seen this very one arrive in Muscovy from the other side of the iron gates. I remembered well the strange color of the locomotive\u2019s clouds as they puffed backward in a greenish-gray haze, melding the power of steam with some strange liquid a scientist had dreamed up. I had been told that trains were for the rabble, for simple folk visiting families or seeking a greater fortune elsewhere, perpetually believing that the blood was redder on the other side of the wall. Royals were meant to travel in state in great conveyances or velvet-appointed carriages pulled by the grandest of snow-white bludmares with long plumes bobbing back from high brows. To sleep in a bed where strangers had slept before, in a bed where one\u2019s ancestors hadn\u2019t died or given birth\u2014that was not the way I had been reared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So this would be another of my rebellions, then. I would sleep alone in this narrow room, all of its appointments carefully screwed to the polished wood walls. I lay back and stared up at the elegant black chandelier, its red crystals catching and reflecting the warm orange light of the lamps. When the train lurched suddenly forward, I laughed, my heart light.</p><p>I had pulled it off.</p><p>I had come back from the brink of death and befriended the most unlikely of creatures. Disguised as my enemy, I had traveled from the smoky alleys of London\u2019s Darkside, across the channel and over the Continent beneath a giant metal envelope of gas. I had jumped out of a breast-shaped window and into the great unknown and floated down into a frozen forest and tasted a unicorn. And now here I was, spread out in a second-rate room on Sang\u2019s third-best train, chugging faster and faster toward my destiny. In a few short days, I would hold Ravenna\u2019s slender neck in my talons. I would set my people free.</p> <p>When the knock sounded at my door, I didn\u2019t think twice.</p><p>\u201cCome in. Leave it on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave what?\u201d</p><p>I sat up quickly and readjusted my skirts as Casper walked in, his fingers drumming nervously against his hips. Casper\u2019s eyes were even more bright and desperate than before, with a mad sort of glitter about them. On the airship, sipping and even gulping his wine, I hadn\u2019t seriously considered how pressing his problem had become. The way he was looking at me now\u2014for the first time, I began to feel uneasy.</p><p>\u201cBlood. I ordered some blood. Did you order food? You can, you know.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t looking at me, though. He was staring around the room with twitchy curiosity, as if he could hear someone speaking just out of reach and kept trying to find the source of the voice.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry.\u201d When he did focus on me, it was like staring into a black pit. Or an oubliette. His eyes shone with madness, the color of twilight and deep water, hungry and soul-sucking, but the intelligence lurked still, under the hunger. \u201cHonestly. Have you ever seen me eat? There\u2019s only one thing I need right now. And I can\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it start?\u201d I asked, anxious to keep him distracted.</p><p>He chuckled ruefully and paced the tiny room. \u201cIt started out\u2014it was innocent. I didn\u2019t know any better. I was a Stranger. I thought I was goddamn brilliant. Criminy mentioned once that if a human drank a Bludman\u2019s blud, even a drop, that Bludman wouldn\u2019t want to feed on him. It was the gloves, you see.\u201d He held up his bare hands, which were shaded just the slightest gray, as if with dust. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand playing the harpsichord in gloves. It was so impersonal. So cold. So I asked him for a drop of his blud. He gave it to me, of course. Thought it was pretty funny, because he thought everything was funny. As I moved through the caravan, I persuaded each of the Bludmen to give me a drop. It made their lives that much easier, not seeing me as food. And I got to swagger around, gloves off and shirt open and barefoot, the smart lad who\u2019d bested the Bludmen.\u201d He cracked each finger, as I\u2019d seen him do before. \u201cHe called me a clever boots. I thought it was a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never told you that it would . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddict me? Engulf me? Take me over until food tasted like dirt and my vision swirled with red?\u201d He clinched his fists and stared hard into my eyes as if pleading. \u201cHe never told me, the bastard. As if he knew Tish was going to show up and choose him and leave me on the precipice of a downward fucking spiral. As if he was the one who could see the future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever ask anyone about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, I never thought to ask someone, \u2018Oh, say, if I drink your blud, will I start to go insane and dream about ripping out a pretty girl\u2019s throat? Will I see spots dancing on the walls and hear cold hearts pumping across the room and compose songs about the vein I can see fluttering against your collarbone?\u2019 \u201d He reached out one finger, so quick, and stroked the exposed edge of my neck, and I shivered and pulled away from him. \u201cNo, darlin\u2019, no one ever mentioned that part. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter it was too late to save myself. After I was too far gone, addicted and debauched and drunk in London. It\u2019s all the rage in some of the cabarets. Absinthe is the Green Fairy. Bludwine is the Red Siren. You wouldn\u2019t believe the things girls will do for a sip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d I said with a frosty glare.</p><p>\u201cLook, Ahna. If I can forgive you for hiding the diamonds and throwing that dead kid off the bank, you can forgive me for trying to lose myself in a string of girls I never cared about. We\u2019ve both had our vices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed hard and looked down. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>With a feral growl that surprised even me with its ferocity, he threw himself onto the bed and wrapped his arms around a pillow as if it were a life vest and he were about to drown in a river.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so far from myself,\u201d he said wonderingly. He scooted back against the cloth-covered headboard, hugging the pillow to his chest. He looked so lost and hopeless and wild that I sat down beside him, close enough to feel the warmth of his body.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to have wine?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThe wine\u2019s no good without the blud, but the blud\u2019s no good without the wine. At least, it didn\u2019t used to be.\u201d</p><p>When he looked up at me again, the lines of his face had gone rigid, as if he barely kept himself from flying apart at the seams. He breathed in deep and breathed out a long, slow, painful sound halfway between a groan and a growl. That sound\u2014it was as if it had been designed just for me, and I leaned forward, avid and intense.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to do this,\u201d I said to myself.</p><p>\u201cDo wha\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t let him finish. The act was as swift and strange as the impulse. I grabbed his head with both hands and pulled him close while biting my tongue with sharp fangs. As the hot blud filled my mouth, I kissed him.</p><p>His body thudded in shock, but his mouth knew what to do well enough. His tongue lapped at mine, pulling hard at the wound as if he would swallow all of me in one fell swoop. I made to pull away, but his hands caught my face, hard but tender. His thumbs made a token stroke down my jaw, and he looped one arm around my waist and dragged me into his lap.</p><p>The bite on my tongue was already healing, but I couldn\u2019t pull away from him. He was strong, and I was surprised when the struggle turned real. With one concentrated push, I wrested my face away from his, panting in the sudden silence. We were both breathless, and his pupils were pinpricks in a much lighter shade of blue than they\u2019d been before. He absentmindedly wiped a dribble of blud off his cheek with one finger and licked it clean. I was stunned, fascinated, and caught by his gaze. He was himself again.</p><p>Perhaps I should have feared him then. But I had seen his beast, and something in me had liked it, and I couldn\u2019t make myself move a single inch farther away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d He chuckled in that familiar way of his. \u201cNot that I mind.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t blink, couldn\u2019t find words. I\u2019d had enough of pretending to be human. Fragile, soft, lying with pretty words. I would tell him the truth, and his response would determine whether or not the die had been cast. Did he see me as what I was or what I had been?</p><p>\u201cI did it because I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have pegged you as merciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t mercy. It was selfish. I wanted to kiss you, so I did. I wanted you to be one step closer to me. I understand the beast in you better than the human.\u201d</p><p>I held his gaze as I said it, the words spiced with ferocity as if daring him to question me. With a simple turn of his head, he seemed more focused and Bluddish.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different since we landed here,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cMore yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t have to pretend. It\u2019s not in a Bludman to hide. I know you can feel it taking you over. So why do you persist in pretending?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been human my whole life. It\u2019s frightening, becoming something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not becoming something new. Maybe you\u2019re becoming what you\u2019ve been all along.\u201d I grinned, knowing that my teeth would be shining with warm light. \u201cIs the beast really so bad? Were you ever really fit for a conventional life? All these things you\u2019ve done before\u2014were you happy?\u201d</p><p>He sat forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cI wanted to be. I tried. But it never felt right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Keen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know the bit about how if you\u2019re not bludded, you\u2019ll go mad? Because someone who truly cares for you will want what\u2019s best for you, even if it means that things change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen there was something worth knowing. I was well trained in diplomacy, you see. And the beast is wise. The beast is placid and self-contained. It doesn\u2019t whine or think of sin. I\u2019d rather make peace with my beast. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled for real, then, dimples and all. \u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected in a murderous princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t meet under the best circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we know you fit in a suitcase.\u201d</p><p>It caught me off guard, and I laughed brightly. The train had reached its speed, and the movement was soothing and exciting at the same time. I felt on track, as if I was where I was supposed to be for the first time in forever. And I realized that it felt right, having Casper with me. I had been raised to trust no one, and yet here I was\u2014trusting someone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected, either,\u201d I said.</p><p>After an awkward pause, he leaned toward me. \u201cWant to play Truth or Dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a Pinky game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Stranger game. You have to choose whether you want to be asked a question you have to answer or whether you\u2019d rather take a dare. But whatever it is, you have to do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I scooted to sit beside him, my back against the headboard and my legs stretched out before me under the shimmering ripples of my dress.</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell Mr. Sweeting that your name was Anne Carol?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sneaky little creature!\u201d I smacked his arm. I had taken the game for fun, but now he\u2019d all but bound me to reveal secrets I wasn\u2019t ready to share. I\u2019d underestimated him again. But I had my honor.</p><p>\u201cAnne is the Sanglish version of Ahnastasia, so that part is true. As for Carol, it\u2019s the Sanglish version of Charles, which is the name of the Svedish king. Many people in my home country say that I\u2019m his bastard daughter through my mother, who spent much time with the king in Stock-helm on a diplomatic mission that lasted longer than expected. As I\u2019m the only person in my family with this coloring and without the Tsar\u2019s trademark nose, I have always wondered if it was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweeting would have killed you if you had been wrong. I guess you have your answer now.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows went up. \u201cYou\u2019ve dealt with him?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cSelling blud is the tamest of his pastimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you to kiss me.\u201d I licked my lips and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play around, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why should I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I guess I\u2019ve got no choice, do I, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned toward me with infinite slowness, his mouth curling in a smile and his eyes falling closed with a sweep of auburn lashes. I breathed him in, contented to find that my scent was highest in his blood, as if I\u2019d marked him as my own. Long ago, when I\u2019d first smelled him, I\u2019d recognized the blud of other predators. Now I smelled only him and me, and it was a pleasant and heady mix. Just before his lips found mine, I leaned over to meet him.</p><p>It was agonizing, the slowness with which he took my mouth. The ferocity of him roiled underneath, waiting. I parted my lips, wanting more, and his hand came up to cup my jaw and hold me in place. I was surely caught, but not by his hand, and I sighed when his tongue finally found mine, sweetly seeking and intense.</p><p>I had little experience with kissing, but he had plenty, and he used it well. Hot and sweet, firm and unyielding, he tasted me and teased me and made me hungry for more. He kissed me so carefully that my beast never rose; I felt all of the power with none of the frenzy, and, like a banked fire, the heat only grew the deeper it got. When he finally pulled away, I realized that I\u2019d slid down the bed onto my back, my talons sunk in the pillowy coverlet and shredding the fluffy white.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he said, his voice dusky with promise.</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d</p><p>The grin he gave me was so masculine, so confident, so seductive, that I stopped breathing. \u201cNow you kiss me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled coquettishly and licked my lips. Bolstering myself on an elbow, I leaned over with the same casual slowness he had used to torture me and licked a searing line up his jugular vein, ending with a chaste kiss behind his ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, you little minx,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say what kind of kiss or where,\u201d I said blithely, putting my hands behind my head and my elbows out as I leaned back against the pillows. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do right this moment, Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many things, darlin\u2019. So many things.\u201d The look he gave me then\u2014it burned right through me.</p><p>\u201cThat answer doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, leaning possessively over me. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we are.\u201d</p><p>He caught my chin in deft fingers, his lips so close I could feel their warmth against mine. \u201cAre you trying to make me crazy, woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to stop that from happening, but I think I\u2019ve changed my mind. I like you better wild.\u201d</p><p>Something twisted in the air between us, a breathless pause that reminded me of that moment when the first snowflake falls, giving the sky permission to erupt in flurries of blinding white. He was kissing me before I\u2019d even noticed him moving, and I took it as permission to let go of the control I\u2019d kept around him until then. My hands caught in his hair, and he pressed me back, deep into white blankets that billowed around us like clouds.</p><p>I laughed fiercely into his mouth, and he whispered, \u201cThis is serious, girl,\u201d and licked a searing trail up my neck to the same place where I\u2019d kissed him earlier, right behind my ear. It ran tingles of fire down my spine, and I gasped and made fists in his hair. No wonder he\u2019d called me a minx. That place was like liquid gold. He was halfway on top of me, and I curled one leg over his leg, keeping him there. He made me feel small and dainty, and I liked the weight of him, pressing against me in the most wonderful ways.</p><p>He took my mouth again, his tongue dipping between my lips with ferocious purpose. I was learning, and I kissed him back, loving the taste of him. Pulling away and licking my lips, he murmured, \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing me around the waist, he pulled me down until I was stretched out the full length of the bed. He placed one hand on my neck, trailing it down my chest and stomach.</p><p>\u201cAnd your very flesh will be a great poem,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have me laid out before you, and you speak of poetry?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cIs that how things are done in your world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me remember things I thought were lost forever,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThings I needed. Things I\u2019m glad to have back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day you can scrawl poems on me with a brush,\u201d I purred. \u201cStarting at my ankles, with black ink winding ever upward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, woman. It\u2019s like you want to kill what\u2019s left of the gentleman inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him dead. Just quiet. Kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>I pulled him down to me and nipped his lip. Words were pretty, but I didn\u2019t want words. I wanted his body, his mouth, his growls. I wanted the fire behind his eyes to consume us both. I wanted the flame he had kindled in me to catch and burn. I wanted him to make me forget everything else.</p><p>He kissed down my neck and along my collarbone, his lips and tongue searing against my skin. It was as if I\u2019d never felt anything before, as if every inch of my body was waking up, and waking up hungry. He kissed along the neckline of my gown, following it to the V and licking deep in the line between my breasts. I moaned underneath him, pressing upward, aching to rub against him as I\u2019d once seen a cat do.</p><p>His hand slipped under me to fiddle with the buttons down my back, and I rolled to my side to accommodate him. If his deftness with buttons was any indication, those nimble fingers were going to be delicious on my skin.</p><p>He was running his tongue across the tops of my breasts when the lights winked out, leaving us in complete darkness. I gasped and pulled back, for there wasn\u2019t even the faintest hint of light to see by. I was lost without all my senses.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tunnel,\u201d Casper murmured into my skin. \u201cUnder the mountains.\u201d</p><p>I felt the kiss of skin on my back and sighed as he pulled the strings of my corset, releasing the bow. His mouth was still busy with the mounds of my breasts pushed up by the corset, and he found one nipple and teased it with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cBut, Casper, the lights . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shadows will fall behind you.\u201d</p><p>When his lips slanted again over mine, messy and rough in the dark, I thought perhaps he kissed me just to shut me up, and I obliged him by unbuttoning his collar, down and down, until his chest was laid bare to my hands.</p><p>Just then, a sound rang out over the throbbing hum of the train. Metal scraping against metal\u2014in the door\u2019s lock. With a hiss and reflexes long honed by the threat of assassins, I grabbed Casper\u2019s shirt and yanked him to me, rolling us both onto the ground beside the bed. Before he could ask me why, I put a hand over his mouth. Even without a Bludman\u2019s perfect hearing, he should have recognized the sound of a heavy boot on the floor of my room.</p><p>25</p><p>The door opened on silent hinges. Casper froze for the barest moment before lurching to his feet and springing away. I couldn\u2019t see anything, but I heard a strange man\u2019s yelp of surprise. After a quick tussle, liquid splashed over the ground, and I crawled up on the bed before the salt-reeking water could reach me. The smell was sharp and painful, biting at my nose. The fight continued, and an unfamiliar voice shrieked in wordless fury. The scent of burning flesh filled the room, and Casper called, \u201cAre you hurt? Did the bastard get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unharmed. What\u2019s happening? I can\u2019t see anything!\u201d</p><p>Three quick thumps, then the heavy smack of a big form landing on the ground, all of it overlaid with shrieking and growling and an unsettling hiss.</p><p>\u201cHow do you kill a Bludman?\u201d Casper grunted with effort. \u201cQuick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him yet. We have to question him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew questioning him!\u201d Casper shouted between the sounds of a struggle. \u201cHe\u2019s big, and he\u2019s already been hit with his own seawater, and he\u2019s still not cooperating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle bitch, I hear you!\u201d the man called between grunts. He had a thick Svedish accent, and I breathed in deeply, trying to get a sense of him. A Bludman, and one strong enough to fight while soaked in seawater.</p><p>And then I knew the answer to Casper\u2019s question about killing him.</p><p>Without saying a word, I crept forward, one hand out in front of me and my boots splashing in the puddle.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the ground. I\u2019m on top of him. But stay back; he\u2019s covered with salt water.\u201d</p><p>I scooted one foot ahead of me until I nudged a heavy boot. It struck out at my leg, and I jerked back before he could bruise me. Carefully and quietly, I nudged my way up his body. He tried to grab my boot at one point, and I stepped on his hand and ground the bones under my heel.</p><p>\u201cI can see you, ice bitch,\u201d he growled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I can smell you, fool. Who sent you?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, low and deep. \u201cYour father.\u201d</p><p>I reached out until I found Casper and traced down his arm until I found his hand on the assassin\u2019s shoulder, pinning the larger man down. Before he could ask me what I was up to, I felt down Casper\u2019s half-dressed torso for the knife he wore always on his hip. Once I had it in hand, I knocked him off and straddled the man in his place, ignoring the damp water that stung my knees.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s a message for my father,\u201d I said in Sanguine, and I plunged the knife into his chest, right where I could hear his heart beating. He struggled for just a moment, but the strike was swift and sure, the knife lodged firmly in his breast.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat I had to.\u201d</p><p>The man shuddered and bucked under me for a moment longer before going still and cold.</p><p>\u201cGet me a light,\u201d I said, suddenly overcome with a grand idea. \u201cAnd a cup or a bottle. Hurry.\u201d</p> <p>Casper sighed and stood. \u201cDo I even want to know what you\u2019re doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have to,\u201d I said. He left the room before he could hear me whisper, \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>He returned with an antiquated lantern, a teacup, and an empty wine bottle.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have the lights back on soon. He took out the whole car, and everyone\u2019s raising a big stink over it. The carhop was handing out lanterns.\u201d He reached into his waistcoat, now smooth again over his buttoned shirt. \u201cAnd he sent these, with his apologies.\u201d</p><p>The two vials of blood were heavy and cool in my hand, but I had other priorities. We had to hurry.</p><p>\u201cDrag him into the bathroom. There\u2019s a narrow tub.\u201d Because I\u2019d paid extra for it, of course.</p> <p>In the light, the man was revealed to be tall but wiry and wrapped entirely in black leather. He wore strange goggles and carried dozens of knives and an instrument that squirted seawater when a trigger was pulled. Together we dumped the body into the tub. Casper didn\u2019t understand what was happening until I sliced the assassin\u2019s black sleeve with his own knife and slit the crease in his elbow by the sparse light of the lantern.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ahna. God. Do we have to . . .\u201d</p><p>And then he smelled the blud. His eyes went to pinpricks, his breathing speeding up.</p><p>\u201cSo much of it. I\u2019ve never seen so much at once.\u201d</p><p>I handed him the assassin\u2019s arm and quickly tipped the full teacup into the wine bottle. Casper\u2019s mouth sealed over the wound in the man\u2019s elbow. When I couldn\u2019t pry him off that cut, I made a new cut in the other elbow and kept going until the flow got sluggish and the wine bottle was half full. Between his feeding and my tidiness, we hadn\u2019t spilled a drip of blud.</p><p>Casper finally dropped the arm in the assassin\u2019s lap, licking his lips in bliss. I held up the bottle, and he whooped and grabbed me up into a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou beautiful, clever girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have you going mad when we\u2019re this close to Freesia, now, can we?\u201d</p> <p>The lights buzzed back on just as he was about to kiss me, and the previously shadow-hidden form of the mercenary in the bathtub was suddenly the biggest thing in the tiny closet of a room.</p><p>\u201cOut the window, do you think?\u201d Casper asked, and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to . . . how would Keen say it? Loot him first. But why is he wearing dark goggles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight vision,\u201d Casper said with a shrug. \u201cSo he could see once the lights were out.\u201d</p><p>I handed him the bottle and gingerly unbuttoned the assassin\u2019s jacket. The fellow was dressed for dastardly deeds, his leathers the color of shadows. I pulled off his cap and goggles to reveal ice-white hair and eyes the same color as mine. The knife, it turned out, was lodged so deeply that the hilt had sunk into his flesh, which made it difficult to search his jacket. Still, I took a fierce pride in the evidence of my strength and righteous anger.</p><p>Finally, I found what I was looking for. I slipped the packet of papers out of his pocket and opened the little book with trembling hands.</p><p>\u201cThese are fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d Casper leaned close to inspect the aged papers with their proper seals and signatures.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was raised to topple kings, and an assassin never carries his true papers. I don\u2019t even know what I was hoping to find. I already know the truth. The Svedish king wants me dead and most likely has a network of spies and assassins spread all over the Blud world, hoping to catch a glimpse of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? If he\u2019s your father, why would he want you dead?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a wry smile. \u201cI may be his daughter, but he can\u2019t claim me or use me. Ravenna\u2019s Freesia is a weak thing, and Charles would love nothing more than to march on Muscovy and claim her for Sveden. I\u2019m his only real impediment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this sort of thing happen often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey plague the palace like bludlemmings, but it\u2019s rare that one makes it so close to royalty. It\u2019s fortunate you\u2019re still immune to seawater. There\u2019s nothing more to gain from him. Help me get him out the window, will you?\u201d</p><p>With the determination and quiet strength I\u2019d come to expect from him, Casper tugged open the window and leaned out to make sure no one else happened to be looking about at the same time. It was pitch black outside, the light from our lantern the only thing flashing on the rock wall of the tunnel. Together we hefted the rubbery body out the window and dropped it into the darkness, and the train chugged on as if nothing had happened.</p><p>I kept my head out of the window for a moment, enjoying the smell of ice-frosted stone deep within the mountain. Revenge felt good.</p><p>Casper pulled me back from the window and into his arms.</p><p>\u201cAt first, I thought it was impossible. But now I\u2019m starting to think you can do it. You\u2019re just full of surprises, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>In answer, I buried my head in his shirt. Breathing in, I could smell the change the blud had wrought in him. If I looked at his hands in the sunlight, I was sure they would be duller and a shade grayer. As little as I knew about halfbluds now, I could only assume that the more blud he drank, the closer he came to being like me. With the assassin\u2019s blud corked in the bottle, he could stave off madness a while longer, but we both knew that every sip brought him one step closer to the bludding he so feared. I wanted him for my own purposes, and I wanted him soon, but I knew that I would have to wait until he was ready. I only hoped he wouldn\u2019t hate me once the deed was done.</p><p>Keen knocked on the door shortly thereafter to tell him their food had been delivered. He was still pretending to eat in front of her. She threw me a dark look before the door closed, and I realized my dress was still mostly unbuttoned. With businesslike tenderness, Casper rebuttoned me, dropping one warm kiss between my shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cAlways an interruption,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo one knocks on the queen\u2019s door when it\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour door doesn\u2019t lock anymore, thanks to Captain Clumsy Assassin. Will you be safe? I need to go, and I don\u2019t know much about political intrigue. Are there more of them?\u201d</p><p>I could tell he didn\u2019t want to leave me, but I understood now that Keen was his family, his tie to the part of himself that was slipping away. If I wanted him, I would have to share him with her. And so I would let him go. For now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe. If there were two assassins on this train, we would probably be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . not very comforting.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a gentle smile. \u201cSleep well, Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I was more than sorry to see him go. Not only because I had grown used to his company but also because I wanted to see what would happen if we continued our little game. Truth or Dare. What charming inventions they had in his world! The things that could be accomplished with such a game were limitless.</p><p>I leaned against the shut door, imagining the way he had kissed me, the touch of his hands. They were just as clever as I\u2019d imagined but warmer. What a vast difference between the boy on the bank, the pirate, and the Maestro, yet they\u2019d all approached me with the same goal in mind. If only the assassin hadn\u2019t intervened. I stepped in the puddle of seawater as I crossed to the bed and pinched my nose at the smell. I would have killed anyone who had interrupted us just then. Finally, a head that deserved a platter, and I\u2019d just tossed him off the train.</p><p>I unlaced my boots and curled up in bed. What had happened with Casper had left me cross and anxious. Unfinished. But I was too proud to call him back, and I didn\u2019t have the words to say what I wanted anyway.</p><p>I thought of the dozens of knives that had fallen into the darkness with the assassin, wishing I had thought to keep at least one. After his intrusion, I didn\u2019t feel safe anymore. With a huff of annoyance, I rolled out of bed and went to the bathroom to see if I\u2019d missed anything, but the only thing left was his goggles, which made everything glow a spooky green. Between this \u201cnight vision,\u201d as Casper had called it, and the goggles that Van Helsing said revealed Bludmen, I would never trust eyewear again. The artificers were getting too good. And I needed one in the palace, on my side and working for the Bludmen.</p><p>I tossed and turned, growling at the uncomfortable buttons up the back of my dress and wishing for something, anything, to soothe me. Not until I smelled Casper on the other side of my door and heard him singing that song about Jude did I relax enough to let sleep finally take me, knowing that he would keep me safe.</p><p>If only I had been brave enough to invite him back in.</p><p>The train\u2019s brakes squealed, and I jerked awake. We were slowing down. That meant we were finally back in my homeland. I was at the window in seconds, gazing out at the ice-glazed city of Muscovy, the gem-shaped turrets rising into the deep blue sky to pierce the clouds. A rush of joy washed over me, little ripples swirling over my skin and making the tiny hairs rise on my arms. I was home. I was still far from the Ice Palace, but I was at least in a city that I knew and loved. One step closer to my goal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I went into the water closet to freshen up and couldn\u2019t help noticing a few drops of blud on the tub. I washed them away with the strangest feeling, the copper cold under my fingers. So Charles of Sveden was my father, and I was worth more to him dead. The man who had raised me was gone, killed at my mother\u2019s side by Ravenna herself. He had loved me as much as a king was allowed, although he had probably known the truth. Palace politics were strange, and I would be sure to bear no bastards when I was queen. Of course, that meant I would need to distance myself from Casper, even if it pained me. Duty to country came first, and dealing with Ravenna came before that. No matter how I longed for him in the night, no matter how I loved the heat of his lips, my feet would soon be in Muscovy, and playtime would be over.</p><p>But not quite yet.</p><p>I fluffed my hair and smoothed down my dress before slipping outside and counting the cars and doors to the one I\u2019d reserved for Casper and Keen. Before I could talk myself out of it, I knocked. The door opened just wide enough to show me Casper\u2019s bare chest.</p> <p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d he said, slamming the door in my face.</p><p>He was back shortly in proper attire, with a blush riding his cheeks. I smiled at the warm, lazy hunger I felt, which I blamed on his embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . need to talk to someone. About something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that someone me, by any chance?\u201d His teasing smile made me blush in return.</p> <p>He held the door open for me, and I slipped in with a frisson of mischief. Whatever noble Bludwomen did on trains, entering the quarters of their Pinky servants probably wasn\u2019t considered conventional.</p><p>Their room was a little shabby, compared with mine, but not shameful. Two bunks nestled one over the other by a low table and a lamp. Casper\u2019s wine bottle sat on the table, and the journal I\u2019d seen in his room at the Seven Scars lay open on the lower bed beside a pencil. The pages were covered in feverish scrawling, much as I remembered seeing before, but fewer lines were angrily crossed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d I asked, realizing as I said it how very rude it was.</p><p>And yet a grin lit up his face, and he flopped onto the bed and started reading. \u201cWhat is it that you express in your eyes? It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\u201d</p><p>Something fluttered in my stomach. \u201cOh. That\u2019s . . . quite pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . insulting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s flat-out bizarre. Is it supposed to be poetry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a favorite book in my old world. I was obsessed with it, really. Owned several copies of it, one of them very special and expensive, a gift to myself. It was called Leaves of Grass, and it was written by a man named Walt Whitman. It didn\u2019t always make sense, but most of the time it did, especially one poem called Song of Myself. And while lots of books from my old world are in your world, if slightly different, I\u2019ve never found evidence that there\u2019s anything like Leaves of Grass or Song of Myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have Bolstoy, and Dostoevskin and the other major writers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough. But it doesn\u2019t appear that there was ever a version of Walt Whitman writing in Sang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you\u2019re . . . trying to write the book yourself?\u201d</p><p>He rolled over onto his back and laughed, a wild sound that marked how close he was to my world. \u201cExactly that. Something about you helps me remember. It\u2019s all coming back to me. I\u2019ll never have all of it, but I\u2019m starting to think I might have enough.\u201d His smile was warm and dimpled. \u201cYou\u2019re becoming my muse. Or Walt\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feigned interest in a painting on the wall to cover how very much it sounded as if we were flirting, despite the fact that I knew I needed to distance myself from him. It was odd that the dance of bodies should feel primal and natural but compliments from him were hard for me to swallow. And yet I liked all the things his mouth did, and so I had to learn this dance, too. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding the unfound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He scribbled something in his book, his face alight. I looked more closely at his wine bottle and found that its level was lower than I would have expected. He must have been busy last night.</p><p>\u201cSo was there something you wanted to talk about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Where\u2019s Keen?\u201d I leaned against the wall, opposite him but close enough to touch, for it was a very narrow room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s annoyed with me. Well, she\u2019s always annoyed with me. But more than usual just now. Said she would hang about the dining car and see if she could pick up any gossip from the local Pinkies. What did you need?\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open as I searched for an answer. \u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>I had never felt so helpless and caught out. Why had I come to him? It was an impulse, one that I hadn\u2019t given much consideration. All my thoughts on assassins, Muscovy, Sveden, and Ravenna, all my determination to distance myself\u2014and yet here I was. He stood and took a single step to my side. His arm went around me, and I was helpless to keep myself from leaning into him, savoring the warm bulk of his body.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted with the laces on my dress. \u201cIt\u2019s just that . . . once my feet touch down in Muscovy, everything changes. I must be hard and cruel and merciless. I must focus on my goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhna, honey, are you scared?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I was stronger.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re strong enough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got us this far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of help.\u201d</p><p>His dimples came out in full force, and he brushed my hair back behind my ears, sending shivers all over me. \u201cI thought you wanted my head on a platter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more useful to me where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, now?\u201d</p><p>It was a short distance from his lips to mine, and I relished the soft tug of his hand behind my neck as he pulled me close. This time, I met him with open lips and a feverish wanting. He fell back onto the bed, taking me with him and holding me tighter as I squirmed sinuously against him. I couldn\u2019t tell him how I felt, that I was scared for me, for him and Keen. That I felt guilty for putting them in danger and even guiltier for knowing that I would have to put him aside later. That I was selfish and had wanted, all along, for him to touch me again like this and make me forget everything else.</p><p>One of his hands went back to my buttons as if it had never left, and I pulled away just far enough to murmur into his mouth, \u201cYou can\u2019t undress me now. The train is stopped. We must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nowhere close to finished,\u201d he murmured back into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAlthough I can be hard to catch. Keep trying.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back with a grin. \u201cFailing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged. Missing me one place, search another. I stop somewhere waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>With a wild laugh, he tumbled me onto my back, kissed my nose, and leaped up to scribble in his book. I sighed and hitched myself up on an elbow.</p><p>\u201cYour priorities,\u201d I said slowly, \u201ccould use some work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an artist, darlin\u2019, and the muse is a fickle bitch. I\u2019ll make it up to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider that a promise,\u201d I whispered in his ear as he scribbled.</p><p>I could hear the crowd outside, the doors opening and closing, and voices raised in laughter, annoyance, and greeting. As I stood to smooth my dress again, Keen burst in through the door and gave me a dirty look that I more or less deserved.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by your room, but you were gone,\u201d she said. \u201cBeen busy again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d Casper started, standing to glower at her. \u201cKeen, you need to remember that we\u2019re consenting adults, and what we do is our own business. I\u2019m not your dad, as you keep reminding me. But I\u2019m your friend, and any feelings I might have for Ahna don\u2019t change that.\u201d He looked from her to me, his eyes pleading.</p><p>Deadly assassins I could handle with aplomb, but the drama of teenage girls was beyond me. And Casper had just admitted to having feelings for me. I was a mess of emotions, all of them distracting me from our goal.</p><p>\u201cI want us to be friends, Keen,\u201d I finally said, realizing that, oddly enough, I meant it.</p><p>\u201cWell, friend, would you like to explain why I found night-vision goggles on your bed?\u201d</p><p>Casper rubbed his eyes, smearing ink across his forehead. \u201cWe were attacked by an assassin last night. We took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you took care of it,\u201d Keen said, and it was easy to see that the \u201cit\u201d in question wasn\u2019t the assassin.</p><p>I held up a hand, done with her games. \u201cI extend my friendship to you, but I also give a warning. We\u2019re in Muscovy now. Do you know what they say in my country about nosy bludlemmings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey lose their noses. Followed by their lives. Be careful in Freesia, little lemming, or you\u2019ll never get that pony.\u201d</p><p>She actually had the gall to stick her tongue out at me, and I nearly smiled. She had heart and guts, as my father would say of his best hounds. I was actually starting to admire the creature. To imagine a child waking up naked and alone in Sang and managing to live long enough to find food and clothes\u2014it was impressive. And I suspected she would soon have much more vitriol to lay at my feet, and for genuine reasons.</p><p>Over her head, Casper mouthed the words Thank you, and I smiled and nodded.</p><p>He would have little reason to thank me once we were in the city.</p><p>26</p><p>As soon as my feet hit the streets, I was filled with purpose. Finally, things were familiar. The grand fa\u00e7ade of the train station sparkled in a thousand shades of white and blue, the edges of every window picked out in solid gold. The city of Muscovy was the jewel of the Freesian empire, a hub of history and energy and art. From the beautifully laid-out parks with their ice sculptures and topiaries to the grand library to the museums and theaters, everything had been planned to impress and delight. I still remembered my first trip there as a child, how I had kept my hands hidden in a white fur muff for fear that I would get in trouble for touching something and smudging its magnificence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had to stop and wait for Keen and Casper. They were so fascinated by their surroundings that they were acting more like country-bred food slaves and less like respectable servants.</p><p>\u201cMy little snacks, do keep up,\u201d I said in my most cultured voice. One of the militsiya was approaching, tapping his billy club against the many medals on his elegant uniform jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s their first time in our grand city,\u201d I said to him coquettishly, as if we shared a great joke. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeashes might be preferable, my lady,\u201d he said politely, eyeing Keen\u2019s scruffy outfit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into that, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I probably enjoyed myself too much, hauling her off by her collar and tsking in her ear.</p><p>\u201cBehave, or they\u2019ll impound you,\u201d I said, and the look on her face was priceless. It was a very real threat, but only for free Pinkies, of course, and only on the more elegant streets.</p><p>I moved faster after that, urging them to hurry as well. It had been too long since I had looked at a Freesian calendar, and I didn\u2019t know how close we might be to the Sugar Snow Ball. We hadn\u2019t missed it yet, as the air didn\u2019t smell properly of snow and the streets were dry and still warm under my boots. But it was close, and one never knew how the weather would go. The sooner I found my old nursemaid, the better. Verusha saw and heard more than anyone alive.</p><p>It was difficult following the grand avenues without indulging in the many beauties of the White City. We had spent the summers there most years, and I knew well which shops kept the prettiest hats in stock and the softest dancing shoes and the finest feathered hair combs. Outside one of my favorite boutiques, we passed a grand lady with a precious little Pinky girl on a jeweled leash, pretty as could be, and I took in a deep and appreciative breath. Cleanliness, good breeding, and an understanding of one\u2019s place were hallmarks of a royal servant.</p> <p>But when I looked closer, I saw the leash\u2019s collar digging into the child\u2019s tender white neck, leaving a red mark behind. It should have inspired hunger, but now I just felt pity. I could see in the child a reflection of Keen, but broken and tamed. The child\u2019s smile faded when her mistress turned her away from the sparkling window of a toy store, where she\u2019d been gazing as if in a dream. Scurrying behind the grand dame\u2019s skirt, I saw the child for what she was: a slave and a prisoner, held against her will.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d I muttered, turning down the staircase to the underground trains that connected all of Muscovy with minimal grit and ugliness. I would have once considered the walk to Verusha\u2019s flat a pleasure, but I was too concerned about encountering something that would cause Keen to say the wrong thing to the wrong Bludman or Casper to release his beast in a suicidal fashion. Time was of the essence.</p><p>Once we were down the marble staircase and in the station, I turned into a corner to fetch the coins and necklace from my corset. The coins were there. The necklace was gone.</p><p>\u201cLooking for this?\u201d Keen held out the glistening trinket with a smug smirk, and I snatched it from her before anyone in the crowd noticed a Pinky carrying something so valuable.</p><p>\u201cYou could be staked for touching that, little fool.\u201d</p><p>As I smoothed out the chain to tuck it back into hiding, I noticed that there were five gems missing instead of the three I\u2019d removed myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou vile little thief!\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cI figure you owe me,\u201d she said, putting her gloved hands in her pockets and rocking back on her heels. I began to see why she caused Casper such problems\u2014just when I thought I was getting anywhere with her, she went and did something so ridiculous that I wanted her head right back on that platter. One step forward, two steps back, and now she was in deeper water than she knew.</p><p>\u201cGive them back now, and I\u2019ll try not to drain you.\u201d I fought for composure, and Casper\u2019s hand subtly brushed my waist, a reminder of the slender wire I walked.</p><p>\u201cOnly got one left, but I\u2019ll make it up to you by paying for the tube.\u201d She held out a hand brimming with coins, and I cursed myself for leaving her alone outside the dress shop. She was lucky she hadn\u2019t been arrested. But we\u2019d already attracted enough attention, so I just said, \u201cFine,\u201d and picked three coins out of her glove, careful not to touch the stained leather.</p><p>We were silent through the turnstiles and onto the car, aside from Keen\u2019s whispered \u201cHoly crow!\u201d as we sat on the tufted velvet bench seat. I\u2019d been impressed the first time I\u2019d seen it, too. The tunnels looked like catacombs, old brick and stone with skulls and bones mortared into complex patterns. But the train itself was as elegant as the one that had brought us from Minks, with beautiful details and glittering glass edged in gilt. A violinist in the corner took up her bow, swaying with the music, and Casper went still all over as plaintive music filled the air.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Muscovy,\u201d I murmured back.</p><p>We sped through several stops, changed trains at a grand station with soaring skylights, enormous chandeliers, and glittering mosaics, and disembarked at the stop where Verusha had lived ever since retiring as my maid.</p> <p>\u201cI will die here, darlink,\u201d she had told me once, settling back into her favorite chaise, surrounded by rich silks and soft furs, \u201cbut I think there will be many years before that happens.\u201d</p><p>She had been well over two hundred then. And yet something told me that she still reclined in the same divan, doing the needlepoint for which she was so famous, ordering around a fleet of daughters-in-law and grandchildren. If not\u2014well, I would cross that bridge when I came to it.</p><p>I was blinded for a moment by the noon sun reflected on the marble outside the station. Shielding my eyes with a hand, I soon understood why so few people had gotten off the train with us. The once-grand block of retirement flats had become something I had been taught to dread: a tenement. Lines strung between the buildings carried all manner of unmentionable laundry, and small children and dogs ran about uncontained. Trash blew along the avenues, something I\u2019d never seen before, mainly because my people ate nothing that required wrapping. The graffiti on the grimy walls was the nail in the coffin of my dreams of finding Verusha easily and swiftly.</p><p>Pinko District</p><p>Get your blud off our streets!</p><p>The people will rise!</p><p>And so I wasn\u2019t surprised when the first stone stung against my back. I spun, but there was no way to know where it had come from. The children had disappeared, and the dogs were on alert, hackles up and tails stiff. How had my city fallen so far in just four years? And why had Ravenna allowed it?</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d I walked back toward the station as quickly as I could without showing fear. \u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, friend! You don\u2019t have to bow to her no more!\u201d someone called from behind closed shutters, and Casper subtly moved to cover my retreat.</p><p>\u201cSounds like they got the right idea around here,\u201d Keen muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf you like them, you\u2019re welcome to stay.\u201d I didn\u2019t look back, but I could hear her boots scraping along the stones behind me. The girl had a fantastic survival instinct, if nothing else. She slipped three more coins into my hand at the train-station gates.</p><p>Back on the train, Casper said, \u201cI hate to say it, but humans can ruin anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must agree. It used to be so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom\u2019s prettier than fancy marble,\u201d Keen said.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re starving to death.\u201d</p><p>She just shrugged, and I let it go. As we moved away from the newly claimed Pinky district and back into the familiar areas of parks and walks near the central Basilica of Aztarte, the train car began to fill, and my nerves calmed. I understood how my people functioned, according to thoughtful rules, years of superiority, and wealth. I knew what to expect among Bludmen. But humans\u2014they were unpredictable, wild, dangerous. I found myself taking an interest in them for the first time in my life. Perhaps the people throwing garbage at me had once been that little girl in the collar. Perhaps they were her parents.</p><p>At the correct station, I watched carefully to be sure that many well-dressed passengers also disembarked. Surely this part of the city still belonged to the upper crust.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d I whispered to Casper and Keen, and we plunged into the colorful and cheerful crowd.</p><p>The stop had always been a popular one, as the area around the Tsarina\u2019s Park included public gardens, statuary, fountains, the ballet, and several prominent museums. There was also a fantastic clockwork carousel that I\u2019d loved since I was a child. I had heard that the Magistrate of Sangland had commissioned a similar one in London, but it had malfunctioned on opening day and nearly killed people. I turned to ask Casper about it before remembering that women of my status wouldn\u2019t be seen arm in arm with their servants, discussing carousels.</p><p>Much to my satisfaction, the park was just as beautiful as ever, clean and bright and glowing in the sun. A large crowd had collected around a gazebo, and I could see flashes of the famous Bolshoi ballerinas practicing in feathery white swan costumes. I scurried around the edges of the crowd, keeping my face down and hoping no one would recognize me through my new hat\u2019s veil. We skirted the shadows around to the servants\u2019 entrance of the Tsarina\u2019s Palace, where my family stayed during the uncomfortable warmth of summer. A fleet of Pinkies worked outside, trimming bushes into careful spirals and washing already-sparkling windows, and royal peacocks danced on the brick wall and called from the trees. Keen shuddered, but I felt a glad rush of pride and familiarity.</p><p>Instead of going through the front door, as would have been my right, I sneaked around the corner and hid behind a topiary in the shape of a bludmare.</p><p>\u201cCasper, go knock on that door. Tell them you need to find Lady Verusha. Tell them nothing else, even if they pry. Keep a straight face, and do not back down, but above all, be polite.\u201d</p><p>I stood on tiptoe to dust off his shoulders and straighten his hat. He grinned at me, all dimples and dancing eyes, and I tightened the laces that connected his hat to his collar. It was a gamble, sending a halfblud to the door of the royal family, but I trusted him more than I trusted Keen. When I nodded my approval, he walked briskly to the door and knocked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a few moments, the door opened just a crack, and I had never been happier to be in hiding. The housekeeper had never liked me to begin with and had probably danced when she heard of my disappearance and supposed demise. Her eyes narrowed at Casper, and she looked him up and down with an air of superiority that had been cultivated at my mother\u2019s right hand. I couldn\u2019t hear what was said between them, and I held my breath. It was the royal housekeeper\u2019s right to absorb local servants at her request, and I could only hope she found him good enough to dispense information to and shabby enough to send away.</p><p>He finally bowed, the door slamming inches from the top of his hat.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I said, and he grinned.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s living with a daughter-in-law on Belila Avenue, running a groomery. Do I even want to know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough. Come along.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, we stood before a grand storefront filled with ribbons and giant wheels of soap. I could smell the lavender and clementines and cloves even from the street, the familiar work of the Tsarina\u2019s former maid. A bell tinkled over the door as we entered, and a young girl in a fancy dress minced forward to meet me.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, welcome. Have you an appointment?\u201d She looked Keen over with professional disdain, probably calculating what it would take to make the child presentable.</p><p>\u201cI have a standing appointment with Verusha. Please tell her the pup has returned.\u201d</p> <p>Her nose wrinkled up in confusion, but she knew better than to contradict a customer, which was a wise practice in a city as big and small as Muscovy. She curtsied and scurried through a filmy curtain and into the back room, and I smiled to see her hair done in the fancy braids that I remembered from my own childhood at Verusha\u2019s patient but implacable claws.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Who dares to come into my groomery and claim\u2014!\u201d</p><p>She pushed the curtain aside and stopped mid-rant. I put back my veil. She looked me up and down before holding out her arms, dripping with suds, her eyes rimmed with blud tears.</p><p>\u201cMy little ermine pup, you are returned?\u201d</p><p>I threw myself into her embrace. She had always been shorter than me and twice as wide, and it was like hugging a boulder.</p><p>She pulled away and caught a twisted claw in my curls. \u201cOh, tut, darleenk! Your hair. What have you done?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you know a disguise when you see it. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>She drew back to inspect me and murmured, \u201cOh, I see that you do. Much help. But come back into the parlor for a dram, and we will discuss. Do they need grooming, those two?\u201d She stared skeptically at Casper and Keen and clicked her tongue. Keen put a hand on her hip as if daring the old Bludwoman to say anything else, and Verusha barked out a laugh. \u201cThat one needs to be dipped for fleas, I think, maybe left under a bit too long, eh?\u201d</p><p>We laughed together, the wild laugh of Bludmen, and the world began to turn as it should. I was home, I was understood, and now I had a friend.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk of important things at first, of course. That would have been terribly impolite. Against her protests, I handed Keen off to Verusha\u2019s daughter-in-law for a good grooming, but Casper I kept with me. My excuse was that he was actually capable of keeping himself clean and relatively dapper, but in reality, I wanted him close. And I hoped Verusha would break the news to him that I myself had been dreading.</p><p>Verusha put a chunk of bread in Casper\u2019s hands and patted him on top of his hat. He couldn\u2019t eat it, of course, but he thanked her with tolerant bemusement. I could only imagine how Keen would react to the treatment of Freesia\u2019s Bludmen toward a messy and rebellious servant. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she would find herself trussed up and dangling upside down while they shaved her head for nits.</p><p>I sat in one of the indulgently cushioned chairs that Verusha had always favored, glad to sink back into the embroidered pillows. She put a dainty teacup in my hands, the porcelain so thin that it glowed pink with the blood within.</p><p>Sitting across from me and settled likewise with her matching cup, she took a sip and said, \u201cNow, darleenk, my pup, tell old Verusha what you have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done?\u201d I resisted the urge to throw the cup at her head like the spoiled child I\u2019d been when last under her care. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here, old woman! I was kidnapped, nearly drained, and shipped all over Sang in a used valise.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded slowly and said, \u201cThere were suspicions, of course. Your sister, too?\u201d</p><p>My head dropped. \u201cI found her in London. Her head, at least. We were both shipped to the same destination, but she actually arrived there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d She sipped her tea as if I hadn\u2019t just announced Olgha\u2019s murder.</p><p>\u201cI woke up in a blud bar because of him.\u201d I nodded at Casper.</p><p>Verusha\u2019s sharp eyes narrowed at Casper, who was busily turning the bread over and over in his hands as if trying to remember its purpose.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who found the lost . . .\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cYoung lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows who I am, Verusha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTut, darleenk! Will you tell all the world your secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the world. Just him. And the other one, the girl. They brought me here, all the way from London.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cAnd what are they wanting as a reward, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I am queen, Casper will be court composer.\u201d I took a slow sip, feeling the strength of the blood seep in, daring Verusha to contradict me.</p><p>She cackled, just as she had when I had been small and made wild assertions about riding a bludbear or running away to join the caravan.</p><p>\u201cAnd what a miracle that will take, my pup! That Ravenna, she is a demon.\u201d She turned her head, gathering her cheeks to spit blood. When she couldn\u2019t find a square inch of her own floor not dominated by expensive carpets, she cleared her throat and swallowed it back down. \u201cYour poor mother and father, executed. My little Alex, ensorcelled. The barons thrown out and hungry as the humans riot in my old home.\u201d She rose and came to me, taking my empty cup and setting it on a table. Holding both of my hands in her twisted talons, she looked square into my eyes and said, \u201cDarleenk, you are our only hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would say that. But I need your help.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, showing sharp teeth. \u201cI was hoping you would say that. What can Verusha do for you, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must kill Ravenna. At the Sugar Snow Ball. It\u2019s our only chance. Casper will go with me. We must blend in completely with the nobles. And when she begins the dance, I\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bold plan, my pup, a bold plan.\u201d She sat back down, leaning deep into the pillows, with a crafty look on her face. \u201cMy invitation to the ball is yours, of course. But there is one other problem, and well you know it.\u201d She pointed one claw at Casper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the problem?\u201d Casper asked, setting the bread down to lean forward in warning.</p><p>\u201cIn many ways, I think.\u201d She jabbed a claw at him knowingly. \u201cPinkies are not allowed at the Sugar Snow Ball, not unless they are on the table. And I suspect that she is not so ready to give you up.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and took back my cup, gazing into the streaks of blood swirling around the porcelain. She was all too sharp, my old nursemaid.</p><p>Verusha stood, not that she was much taller standing. Walking close to Casper, she put her cheek almost against his forehead and inhaled deeply. When she exhaled again, it came out as a growl.</p><p>\u201cYou would take an abomination to the most holy and secret rite of your people? I raised you better than that, Ahnastasia!\u201d She sat, trembling with fury. \u201cHow dare you put royal blud in the veins of a . . . a . . . whatever he is!\u201d This time, she did spit, and it left a splatter of red on the cream-colored carpet, almost blending in with the woven roses.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame her. She didn\u2019t do this. I did this to myself in ignorance, and believe me when I say I regret it more every day,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAt least you have the good sense to be ashamed,\u201d she snapped. \u201cBut do not lie to me. I know the smell of her lineage, and it sings to me from your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen if I went to the ball?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould they notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout the fetters of Pinky clothes, younger noses and sharper teeth would notice, my boy, and you would quickly become the scapegrace for everyone\u2019s fury. Staked out at four points and eaten whole by the company of dancers. It would be a long, slow death and not one that would help my poor pup regain her throne.\u201d</p><p>The silence was ungainly, and they both looked to me. For once, I didn\u2019t feel bold. I sipped at the distasteful dregs of my cup, keeping my face carefully blank.</p><p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Casper finally asked.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t go alone. We must find another patriot to accompany her. One of my sons might have a friend who can be trusted.\u201d Casper bristled, his posture changing subtly to indicate a threat.</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOr you ascend to a grander life, my boy. You\u2019re halfway there already. One might think it would be a relief, after the blud madness.\u201d</p><p>Casper went still with rage. \u201cSo I either send her into danger with another man, or I give up my humanity completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly that, yes,\u201d Verusha said, settling back into the cushions to sip her blood thoughtfully. \u201cIs not so bad, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how it could be worse,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cEasy, little snack. The Sugar Snow Ball is in two days. So there is enough time to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d he said to himself.</p><p>I shifted against the cushion, dress suddenly feeling too tight, and his head snapped to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d he asked simply. \u201cAhna, did you know all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you never mentioned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the point in worrying you unduly. It would end the same either way. The future is no more uncertain than the present.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Head in his hands, he chuckled, on the verge of tears. \u201cMy God, woman. How do you keep doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking everything from me and giving it back in one breath?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be sorry, Casper. For a princess, I\u2019m not a bit tamed.\u201d Nothing I said or did could change that.</p><p>He was on the verge of laughing, on the verge of crying, as if he were standing at the edge of a great precipice and deciding whether to jump or not. Which, I had to suppose, was exactly what was happening in his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re untranslatable, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is, lad, that she is,\u201d Verusha said, pulling out the little Turkish cigarettes she favored and lighting one with a clockwork lighter. The silence spread out, broken only by Casper\u2019s mad giggles and the puffing of Verusha\u2019s smoke rings.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cSound my barbaric yawp, I suppose,\u201d he answered. With sudden violence, he stood and yelled, \u201cGoddammit!\u201d before lunging out the door and slamming it in his wake.</p><p>\u201cIs he always this mad?\u201d Verusha asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cAren\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>When I couldn\u2019t hide among the cushions anymore, I followed Casper\u2019s scent into the alley outside. Verusha didn\u2019t have to say a word. Her heavy silence, her disappointed glare, was sufficient. She hadn\u2019t raised me to cower from anyone, especially not halfblud abominations. I thought I heard her chuckle behind the closed door, but I was too embarrassed to check.</p><p>I was half terrified that Casper had run out into the streets alone, where he would surely have caused trouble of one kind or another. According to the laws of Muscovy, a lone servant could suffer anything from the merciless teasing of children to impounding or corporal punishment. Fortunately, he was simply sitting against the brick wall of the lane behind the shop, his hat still firmly laced under his chin.</p> <p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d I asked. If the words were to be said, I wanted them to be mine and not his.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI want to. But I can\u2019t. I did this to myself. The universe is pointing me to the answer, and I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t blame you for that. It\u2019s a journey, I suppose. I can\u2019t stay in the same place forever.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sit beside him on the ground, where someone might see. So I slumped against the wall, my gown\u2019s shoulder catching on the bricks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about this life?\u201d I gestured to the grand city around us and, more subtly, to myself.</p><p>\u201cWould you want to become a Pinky, Ahna?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but shudder. \u201cUgh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so that\u2019s how I feel about becoming a Bludman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? Your position is untenable. You can\u2019t be human anymore. You can\u2019t be a halfblud for much longer. Why not accept what\u2019s inevitable? Why not choose it before something else chooses for you? It\u2019s better to be curious than judgmental. Compare this place with London. The dark streets, the fear riding the wind, the bludrats and Coppers. There\u2019s an elegance, a simplicity, to life as a predator. It\u2019s well ordered, calm. We celebrate the arts as the humans cannot and care for the individual as they won\u2019t. The only strife you\u2019ve seen in this city was caused by the Pinkies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a case of who is better or who is right. It\u2019s a case of giving up who I am, what I am. I exist as I am; that is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt very well is not. You\u2019re in the midst of a metamorphosis, and hiding from it is flat-out cowardly. Butterflies don\u2019t hide in cocoons; they bite their way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cButterflies are extinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He stood in one fluid motion that was more predatorial than he would have cared to know. Towering a foot over me, he forced me to look up at him, and warmth rushed over my cheeks as I realized how very close we were standing and how very incorrect it was for us to be looking at each other that way in the alley behind a prominent groomery.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a coward, Ahna?\u201d</p><p>I poked him in the chest with a talon. \u201cOnly on this topic. The one that matters most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay I went through with it, then. How would it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. But I\u2019ll find out. And I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize the truth of it until I said it, but I couldn\u2019t imagine allowing anyone else to share so intimate an experience with him.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s painful. I don\u2019t want to cause you pain.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him. \u201cSilly boy. It doesn\u2019t matter if it hurts. Agonies are one of my changes of garment.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cDo you believe in destiny and reincarnation and . . . No, don\u2019t answer. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His smile was gentle, tentative. He traced a line along my jaw with one finger and murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re a mystic, baffling wonder, woman.\u201d</p><p>I beamed. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, gentle and swift.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a great poet, at least I have a great audience.\u201d</p><p>Back inside, Verusha shooed him into the groomery proper to wash off the grime of our long journey. I bristled momentarily, watching two pretty girls lead him off, petting him and offering him cookies, but I quickly remember that to them, he wasn\u2019t a man, much less an equal. He was a lapdog, a mindless creature to be cosseted and primped and displayed. After the bludding, I suspected I would be much more possessive of him.</p><p>\u201cShow me what you have, darleenk,\u201d Verusha said, motioning me over to an open window where the sun puddled through filmy curtains.</p><p>I had already plucked out a stone, the tear-shaped aquamarine heavy in my hand and as warm as a beating heart. When I held it in the sunlight, it winked as if snowflakes danced within. I tipped it into Verusha\u2019s claws, and it rattled around as she inspected it.</p><p>\u201cWill it buy everything we need?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe yes. Maybe no.\u201d She prodded it with a clipped white talon. \u201cHard to say, these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the best. I want to be beautiful when I kill Ravenna. And he needs to match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know these things.\u201d She raised one eyebrow at me, but I didn\u2019t blink or apologize. The trick with Verusha was showing respect but not obedience or doubt. \u201cThere is also a charm you might want. It makes the bludding easier. For you both. But very, very expensive and hard to find.\u201d</p><p>Without a second thought, I pried another stone from the necklace, a diamond. It was cold in my hand, as sharp and hard as the ice it resembled.</p><p>\u201cThat, too, then.\u201d</p><p>She curled her hand around the stones, and they disappeared. The old woman nodded once, sharply, and withdrew a folded note from her shawl. The paper was thick and creamy, sealed with Verusha\u2019s crest, the bastard signet of the House of Muscovy.</p><p>\u201cGo read it. Prepare yourself as much as you can. It\u2019s an ugly business, to be sure, but he\u2019s worth more bludded than dead or mad, yes?\u201d</p><p>My face carefully blank, I said, \u201cYes. But where should it happen?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed, wrinkling under the bright red paint. \u201cSomewhere noisy,\u201d she finally said. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>After a pointed look at the ravaged necklace in my hand, she turned and hobbled back toward the parlor and the sunny prospect of business as usual. For just a moment, I thought about Keen, wondering if she had survived her grooming without embarrassing restraints and, if so, how she was enjoying the waiting room, where the polite servants of local Blud families would spend their afternoons sitting contentedly on benches, eating sweets and waiting to be retrieved. The little creature was probably inciting a rebellion.</p><p>I settled myself in the big chair. With my feet up and a belly full of blood that tasted like home, I was as ready as I could be for bad news. I broke Verusha\u2019s wax seal, slipped the note open, unfolded it, and began to read. Halfway through, I took a hard look at the remains of my necklace and popped out three more small diamonds. We were going to need them to pay off whichever unfortunate innkeeper ended up scrubbing away the bloodstains and losing custom on account of the screaming.</p><p>28</p><p>I decided upon the Moravian district. Not only because it was far from Verusha\u2019s shop and my family\u2019s ancient palace but also because the Moravians were known for being loud, messy, and mysterious. Their wild parties to celebrate the coming snow started early and ended late. And their traditional costume was handy, too. No one looked twice at us as we slipped down the avenue wrapped in long shawls and turbans, all but our eyes well hidden.</p><p>I\u2019d never been to this part of Muscovy, as my parents had been prejudiced against anyone not of proven, pure-blud stock. I hadn\u2019t seen any of the other foreign districts, either, although our carriage had passed by a New Year\u2019s parade in the Dragon district when I was little, and I had sworn I\u2019d seen a real dragon billowing white smoke into the sky. Once we had crossed under the exotically arched sign with \u201cLittle Moravia\u201d picked out in bloodred and gilt, it was almost as if we were in another country.</p><p>The lights were gold like the sun, rather than the orange that my folk favored. The stone was white and creamy, with accents in vibrant jewel tones that recalled the sea and palm trees and exotic fruits I\u2019d only seen in paintings. Brightly colored cloth flags and pennants fluttered on strings strung between the buildings, giving everything a festive look that made me feel as if I was on an adventure instead of skulking around in disguise to all but kill a man for my own sinister purposes.</p><p>The first inn we passed looked too shoddy, and the second was far too rich for the stones I\u2019d chosen to part with. Fortunately, the third one seemed both reasonable and pretty, with a large mosaic of a camel picked out in glittering tile.</p><p>\u201cLa Jamala,\u201d Casper said, rolling the word around in his mouth. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cCamels are fascinating creatures. They can travel great distances, surviving on the blud stored in their humps. And when that runs out, they find another camel and eat its hump. Very resourceful creatures, camels.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked through the arched door ahead of Casper and secured a room, paying extra for \u201cprivacy and considerations.\u201d The way the old Bludman at the desk waggled his tangled eyebrows at me, I had to assume he thought we would be indulging in the most sordid brand of perversion. He saw nothing of me but my eyes swathed in burgundy cloth. To him, I was a twisted Bludwoman indulging myself with a lowly servant, but I had paid him well not to care. He put the skeleton key in my hand, the room number dangling from a faded leather tassel. I grabbed Casper\u2019s hand and pulled him into the inn, unsurprised to feel him trembling.</p><p>The stairs blended perfectly with the walls and had no handholds, and we went up and up in strange diamond patterns until I feared we would topple off the roof into the streets below. But no. Our room was at the very top, a converted attic garret. That was good\u2014the floor would be thick, and there were no neighbors to either side, separated from our fracas by mere wood. The extra gems had served their purpose. I unlocked the door and pressed the button inside. A sky\u2019s worth of star-shaped lanterns buzzed into light, glowing with the glimmer of sun on desert sand.</p><p>I set down the bag I\u2019d been carrying under my cloak with a clank. Casper pressed the door closed and locked it, his eyes on the bag.</p> <p>\u201cThat what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me. We\u2019re going to need it.\u201d I pulled out the bottle and handed it to him.</p><p>He uncorked it and breathed it in. \u201cEssence of assassin,\u201d he murmured, and with a shrug, he took a swig. I liked the fact that he was feeling bold. It would make the night easier for us both. After a couple of swallows, he grimaced. \u201cStrong stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI added some extra ingredients.\u201d</p><p>Verusha had been unable to find the charm she had mentioned, the one that would make the bludding easier for us both. As an apology, she had given me a bottle of her finest bloodwine, from the same winery the royal family used. But I wasn\u2019t going to tell him that. I had a feeling he was going to have enough problems drinking human blood once he had no other options. What he didn\u2019t know now wouldn\u2019t kill him.</p> <p>That was my job.</p><p>Bottle in hand, Casper pushed the shawl off his head and shook out his hair. He walked across the room, ducking under the star-shaped lanterns and stepping over the sultan\u2019s pillows and sheepskins. When he pushed open the door to the next chamber, he whistled low, an eerie sound that vibrated like some strange, free bird.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, and he turned back with a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cCome see.\u201d</p><p>I knew a little of Moravian culture, thanks to my tutors, and so I unlaced my boots and left them by the door before picking my way across the pillows to where he stood. The room on the other side was dark except for one brilliant rectangle of light, a stained-glass window that threw shimmering squares of color to glitter all over the floor. A wide, flat bed hung in the shifting rainbow, a rope at each corner tethering it to the ceiling and a pile of pillows waiting beside a single tasseled blanket, its corner turned back invitingly. Another thing about the Moravians\u2014they liked to sleep off the ground.</p><p>I cleared my throat and looked away. \u201cWe should probably stick to the outer room. You\u2019re going to want to be on the floor for this.\u201d I unwrapped my shawl and let it drop to the tile in a puddle of rusty red.</p> <p>He snorted and set down the bottle, its contents noticeably depleted. As he shucked off his knee-high boots, I took a few gulps myself, trying to pick apart the strange m\u00e9lange of flavors as it went down. Blood, blud, wine, and the secret ingredients of the palace sommelier tickled the back of my throat and set my fingers and toes tingling.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s going to hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I smiled grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be \u2018a whole new world of pain,\u2019 to quote Verusha.\u201d</p><p>He slipped off his stockings and took a step toward me before hissing and holding up his foot. I could smell the drop of blood on his skin as he plucked something out and tossed it to the floor with a wry chuckle.</p><p>\u201cStraw. Of course. Our inn is bedeviled with straw. The straw that broke the jamala\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>Everything that had just happened\u2014I\u2019d heard it before. I rummaged in my bag for the mysterious packet I\u2019d carried all the way from the docks of Dover. The folded paper still wore Criminy\u2019s seal, although the ends were battered from being carried in my corset for so long. I held it up to my nose, breathing deep.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Casper asked, leaning close.</p> <p>I broke the wax and unfolded the paper, careful not to spill the contents. The powder inside was the deep red of dried blood yet iridescent, as fine as ash. Written on the paper was, \u201cMix with the wine. It\u2019ll hurt less. Love, Criminy and Tish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. But I trust her. Add it.\u201d</p><p>I folded the paper and tipped the powder into the remaining wine, putting a thumb over the bottle to mix it. As I was more invulnerable, I took the first swig to test it. The wine, already heavy and deep, now carried the airy tang of magic.</p><p>I felt lighter after that and offered him the bottle. With his usual recklessness, he drank deeply before handing it back. I sipped again, watching as he took off his coat, folded it, and set it aside. After a moment of contemplation, he lost his waistcoat and shirt, too. When he turned to me, hair loose and wild and wearing nothing but breeches, his torso outlined by the glittering sun dancing through the glass, I took another long gulp and felt the magic coat my lips.</p><p>My body was sending me so many signals that I couldn\u2019t tease them apart, and it seemed only natural to set down the empty bottle, launch myself at him, and push him to the ground, hunger surging and humming in my veins. I licked a long swath from his shoulder to his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, now,\u201d he said, and the tinge of fear in his voice was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cToo late for that.\u201d I straddled him, pinned his arms down, and nicked the vein pulsing in his neck. The first taste of his blood, straight from the source and drenched in wine and magic, sent a jolt of heat through my body. In between gulps, I murmured, \u201cI thought it would be easier this way. Without deliberation.\u201d</p><p>He moaned and whimpered, then gritted his teeth and said, \u201cDo it, then.\u201d</p><p>It was a simple process, from the outside, and almost exactly what Casper himself had said would have to happen in order to transform a human or halfblud into a full-on Bludman. There wasn\u2019t much new in the world, after all. I had to drink him nearly dry, then get enough of my blud into him to keep him going while he nearly drained me dry. We would go, give and take, back and forth, until the deed was complete. The hardest part was finding equilibrium between the two of us, each one controlling the predator within to keep from ripping the other apart or drinking too deeply, unto death.</p><p>The main ingredient may have been the mixture of blood and blud, but the secondary ingredient was trust, and I thought it better to hope for the best than to share my fears. My feelings toward him were muddled, as I suspected his were toward me, a push and pull of what the animal, mind, and heart wanted and needed and were willing to risk. Soon we would know the true balance between us, come what may.</p><p>For the moment, it was enough finally, finally, after so many weeks, to be sunk to the corners of my smile in his neck, gulping down the warm lifeblood of him, tasting him as no one else had. He trembled beneath me, muscles taut and hands curled into fists.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I whispered, \u201cif you want to touch me.\u201d</p><p>His hands ran up and down my legs and hips, then gripped my ankles, grinding the bones together, and I pulled hard on his neck, drinking and drinking and drinking. When his hands finally fell from my legs, I woke up enough to know that for me, the easy part was over.</p><p>I pulled back and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. \u201cCasper? Casper, come along. It\u2019s your turn now. Drink. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were open and unfocused, glazed and staring. I traced his cheekbones, wishing for dimples that weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. What is it you call me? Darlin\u2019. Darlin\u2019, wake up now. You have to drink.\u201d</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t rouse him. I hadn\u2019t paid enough attention to his state and had drunk too deeply. I panicked, grabbing the bottle and slopping its contents into his mouth, hoping that what was left of the mixture would wake him up enough to take the blud I was more than ready to give him. There was barely any wine left. At first, the thick red stuff just dribbled down the side of his face and onto the black sheepskin beneath him. When almost all of the bottle was gone, though, I saw his throat move, his eyes blinking and focusing with a sudden ferocity I recognized all too well.</p><p>I shoved up the sleeve of my dress, rubbing the thin skin of my wrist over his lips. His eyes caught me, mad and desperate, but he didn\u2019t even try to bite me.</p><p>\u201cI said, come on!\u201d I growled. \u201cWake up! Take it! Rip me open, damn you!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and turned away from me, and with a feral howl, I shoved a finger into his mouth and caught it on one of his incisors, hoping the tiny nick would be enough to call him to task.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to,\u201d he muttered around my finger. \u201cTrying so hard not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must.\u201d After a few moments of him refusing the tiny bit of blud he might get before my finger healed, I said, \u201cPlease. I\u2019m waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>His teeth bit down, testing just the tiniest bit, and he sighed. When I was one step away from ripping a hole in my own neck with a talon, I felt his teeth scissor sharply, opening up the cut again. He sucked my finger, and shivers raced down to my toes. His body came awake beneath me, bucking as he clamped down around my ankles once more. I could feel the thread of blud connecting us, feel his breathing speed up as the chest beneath me pumped harder and harder, sucking. When I didn\u2019t think I could take another moment of waiting for him to really drink, he groaned, a long and drawn-out sound. His leg snaked around my calf, and he rolled me over suddenly, the insistent suction on my finger never lessening.</p><p>His face rose over me, a sharp moon framed by wild hair and fading rays of sunlight. He released my finger with one last lick and bit his lip, panting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, God, Ahna.

It began as a kiss, tender and warm, and then, at the last possible moment, there were teeth. One sharp nip, and his lips settled around my throat with a moan of bliss. It was much gentler than I had expected, much gentler than I could have been, than I had been. His teeth weren\u2019t yet as sharp as mine.</p> <p>His hand came up to stroke my face and draw my hair back, and it was my turn to clench my fists and buck and writhe, doing my pitiful best not to fight him off when he was still so new and weak.</p><p>It was a tender time, and the least little mistake could have been the end of either of us. I felt every heartbeat, every pump of blud flowing from me into him. The magic still glittered in me, the headiness of the wine making it somewhat easier to let him drain my life out through the thinnest skin of my body.</p><p>And then it hit me, for one perfect, clear moment.</p><p>This must be what it felt like to be a Pinky. To spend your life hiding your true desires and feelings, feigning politeness and manners, always waiting for the moment when your neck either bent for your master or was snapped in her hand with one flick of angry fingers. For the first time in my entire life, ever, I realized that the threat of death from blud loss was a very real thing, that I wasn\u2019t invincible. The euphoria turned into panic.</p><p>I started flailing and bucking, and Casper\u2019s hands moved from cupping my jaw to pinning down my arms so I couldn\u2019t scrabble at him. His weight held me to the rugs and sheepskins, his mouth working against my throat and his ankles heavy on my legs. I whimpered softly, but I had no hope that he heard me.</p><p>\u201cCasper?\u201d I rasped, but he didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t move, but I had to get his attention, and I didn\u2019t have long. My thoughts went back to the book I had found under his bed, long before I knew him and even before I learned that the sentiments weren\u2019t his own. But I couldn\u2019t remember the words written there, only scribbles and scratches. I was getting weaker and weaker, my mind growing sluggish. My mouth opened and closed wordlessly, until I finally recalled the first sound I had heard from him, even before I had seen him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jude,\u201d I whispered, voice cracking. I went through as many lyrics as I could scrape together, certain that the song made no sense. And yet it was there in my subconscious, as if it had become a part of me and I couldn\u2019t quite escape it. I told him not to be afraid, to make things better. When I got to the part about skin, he pulled back, and I felt his breath whistle cold over the rip in my throat.</p><p>\u201cAhna? What . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He moved to my side, touching my face. I could feel blud puddled in my hair, sticking it to my neck and ear. He had fed like a child, fast and messy, and I myself felt very much like a broken doll forgotten on the floor. I tried to move my arm and couldn\u2019t. My mouth opened, but I was finished singing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do? Oh, God, Ahna. I can\u2019t believe I . . . what do I do?\u201d</p><p>I moaned and rolled my eyes toward the scrap of paper that had fallen from my hand to the floor. He didn\u2019t understand at first, but then he picked it up and scanned it. I knew he\u2019d found the right part when he sighed and said, \u201cIs there no end to it?\u201d</p><p>In response, I mewled like a kitten, my entire being focused on his wrist, where the tiny blue veins fluttered like leaves in a chill autumn wind. He grimaced and looked at his arm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can. I mean, not my wrist. Try this.\u201d</p> <p>He picked me up, one arm under my knees and one around my shoulder. Emptied of blud, I weighed no more than an empty dress, and he carried me over to the wall and slid down until he sat with his back against a pillow. My mouth opened and closed uselessly, inches away from his neck. He pulled me close, cradling me as he smoothed back his hair with one hand to expose the golden skin underneath.</p><p>\u201cCan you bite?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you strong enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser,\u201d I managed to whisper, and when he obliged, I used every bit of strength I had to scrape him with a fang, just enough to start a dribble of red. As full as he was, it didn\u2019t take much to get the wound flowing and me drinking. Within moments, I was strong enough to wrap my arms around his neck and latch on for real. The more I drank, the tighter he held me. But this time, it didn\u2019t take so much. I was able to stop long before there was any danger to him. That had to mean it was working.</p><p>I pulled away, licking my lips and feeling suddenly ladylike. It was one thing being taken over by the beast, especially when on the verge of draining. But it had always been important among my people to show control and restraint whenever possible. My hair was plastered to the nape of my neck, the back of my gown sodden and sticky.</p><p>\u201cI brought towels and rose water,\u201d I said, suddenly self-conscious. \u201cFor after.\u201d</p><p>His face was dark, shadowed with a beard and dominated by eyes gone cloudy and glittering like crushed sapphires. \u201cHow much longer?\u201d he whispered. \u201cHow much more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil it\u2019s done.\u201d I looked him up and down, as much as I could see from within the cage of his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. You\u2019re still hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the strangest hunger I\u2019ve ever felt. Not in my stomach . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like in your heart?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, brow drawn down.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is. Because what you need now isn\u2019t food.\u201d He stared past me, focusing on the sparkling Moravian lamps. In the darkness of the windowless room, they held their glow close, the deep indigo of the corners as fathomless as the night sky. It was a beautiful scene, peaceful and magical, a moment stolen out of time. I moved my hair aside and bent my head, saying only, \u201cGo on, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered. And it\u2019s getting easier, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel strange. Not weak, like I did before.\u201d His voice was ragged and deeper than it had been. He swallowed hard and went still, and I knew that he had noticed the vein in my neck, thumping so close that there was no way he could avoid smelling it, no way he could stop the hunger.</p><p>\u201cWhen will I want blood? Instead of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say. What do you want now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen have me.\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>He sighed, a long and heartbreaking sound. His lips found my neck, kissing first, almost nibbling, as if he didn\u2019t quite know how to break the skin or was trying to fight the beast within. Then, as I had, he nipped just the tiniest bit. I jerked in his arms, surprised by the feeling it woke in me. His lips, the bite. The way he was sucking gently. It felt . . . good.</p><p>There was a primal rhythm to it, to the warm, wet pull of his mouth. I was still in his lap. One of his hands was splayed across my lower back, his other cupping my jaw and holding me in place. He moaned and shifted underneath me, and I realized that he felt it, too. He felt it and liked it . . . very much. Tingles shot down my spine, and I let my head fall back a little more. The blud he was taking\u2014it made me feel lightheaded and weightless, as if I were floating. When he pulled away, a whimper escaped me. Before I could even open my eyes, his lips were sealed over mine.</p><p>His mouth tasted of home and hunger and wine and the spice of lingering magic. I kissed him back, my body uncaring whether I craved his blood or his blud or his hot, probing tongue. He tasted me, drank me in, growled into my mouth as if upset that he couldn\u2019t eat me in one big bite. I could feel the sharpness of his fangs with the tip of my tongue, and I reveled in the fact that he was no longer some weak prey animal, waiting for a tragedy or a stupid mistake to take him away, possibly at my hands. He was more substantial now, more real, more solid, tethering me to my body and the moment with the surety of the moon acting on the tides.</p><p>I felt him pulling away from me, and I sucked on his lip as he left, reluctant to be without him.</p><p>\u201cAhna, I feel so . . .\u201d He trailed off, and I nipped his lip again.</p><p>\u201cYou feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange. Hungry but full. Powerful.\u201d</p><p>His arms held me loosely, and I liked how light I felt, how empty and malleable and open. Carefree and drunk on what little blud I had left, I swooned a little, and he caught me tighter against his bare chest, his skin so hot it felt like liquid flame.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kiss you. You need blood. And I can\u2019t control myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d My voice slurred a little.</p><p>\u201cThe things I want to do . . . they scare me. It\u2019s like everything\u2019s washed over in red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive in to it, Maestro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>I tried to kiss him again, but he held back as if afraid he might break me. The beast in me rose to the surface, furious at being denied. With that extra burst of ferocity, I pulled myself to his neck and latched on to the same place where I\u2019d bitten him before. He was almost bludded but not quite finished, and he hadn\u2019t healed yet. I sucked hard, blissful at the heated rush of satisfaction, of blud and blood perfectly mixed. Old Verusha had never hinted that it would be anything like this. Bloody and messy and hideously painful for us both, yes, but delicious and sweet? I could not have imagined it. The charm was strong, the spell well cast. Whoever that Criminy fellow was, we had cause to thank him.</p><p>As I drank, savoring the rhythm of his heartbeat, his wide palm made circles on the small of my back. I couldn\u2019t escape knowing that he was enjoying it, too, his body\u2019s readiness apparent under the tangle of my dress. But it wasn\u2019t enough, being gathered in his lap like a child or a favorite dog. I had told him to give in to it, and bit by bit, as his hand inched around to caress the curve of my hip, I found that I couldn\u2019t escape giving in myself. With one last swallow, I pulled myself away from the blud, its call dampened by new urges. I licked my way up his neck, found his lips, and kissed him the way I wanted to be kissed. When his hands fastened around my waist, I turned to straddle him, my knees on either side of his legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need more,\u201d he murmured into my mouth, and I answered, \u201cI\u2019ll take what I need.\u201d</p><p>When he tried to pull back again, I settled my hips against him, rocking from side to side as I kissed him, hard and demanding. His grip on my waist slid down, settling possessively on my hipbones. He jerked me closer and pulled up his knees behind my back. We were lined up in the most primal way, and I found that in this sense, at least, I liked being trapped.</p><p>\u201cI need more,\u201d he whispered in my ear, and I turned my neck for him, anxious for the sharp pain that preceded the strange euphoria of him feeding on me.</p> <p>He bit down harder this time, as if testing his fangs. I gasped as he latched on, and he moved against me, hip to hip, rubbing sensuously through the layers of fabric to reach the most secret part of me. Tentatively at first, then more pointedly, I moved with him, his thrusts matching the pulse of his lips sucking at my neck. It all moved together like the waves I\u2019d seen at the ocean and never, ever dared touch. They were dangerous, those swells and crests, and I knew that they held the power to destroy me instantly. But this\u2014these waves\u2014they felt right, and if there was any threat of me flying apart, it was from pleasure.</p><p>The rhythm was timeless, and I caught on fast, my breathing and heartbeat a high counterpoint. I wanted something, something more, something I couldn\u2019t describe. My hands found his bare shoulders, broad and muscled and warm, my nails digging in with urgency. I began to understand what could inevitably unfold between two people, but at the same time, I was somewhere else entirely, floating again. And hungry, so hungry. For him.</p><p>With one last, wild lick, he pulled back from me, his hips still moving, his mouth wet with my blud.</p><p>\u201cDo you need more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . I need . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d And I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me, Ahnastasia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want, but if I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m going to rip you to shreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he barked, and when he stopped moving against me, I hissed and focused on him, our eyes but inches away. He chuckled and drew back, holding my face in both hands as if daring me to look away, his smile kind and dimpled but his eyes stern. \u201cNo, darlin\u2019. No. We\u2019re way past that adorable little vicious act of yours. If we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re doing it as equals. I\u2019m not your pet anymore.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered and tried to kiss him, but he was stronger than he had been and kept me at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you need it, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, not it. And I\u2019m done being used. If you\u2019re going to take from me, you\u2019re going to start giving back, and I\u2019ll start with your heart.\u201d</p> <p>For that second, I swear my heart stopped beating. All the want and hunger and desperation faded in the face of his demand. Could it be possible that Casper . . . loved me?</p><p>I had been raised in wealth and coldness, receiving more warmth from Verusha than from my own family. Personal greetings were mannerly and swift, a polite peck on the cheek. Hugs were almost unknown, for how could my mother draw me close when her dress was encrusted with diamonds and weighed more than she did? Love and affection were things you felt for your country, for your favorite hat, for the wolfhound that greeted you without fail at the door. But to expect love from a royal match\u2014it was laughable. Almost unheard of. I had never considered, in all my life, if my parents loved each other. I knew for a fact that they didn\u2019t.</p><p>And here we were, tangled up and blood-spattered on the floor of a Moravian inn, and this man, this Stranger, wanted my heart. He wanted my mouth to say words I had never heard spoken. He wanted me to declare myself just for the privilege of rutting with him as I\u2019d seen the passengers of the Maybuck meet, flesh to flesh. The day before my final stand, before I planned to murder a dictator at a holy rite in front of my people, he wanted me to make a commitment that no princess, no Tsarina, could make. A Tsarina\u2019s heart belonged to her country.</p><p>The feelings he had awakened in me were tempting, and I was curious. But those feelings, that satisfaction\u2014they weren\u2019t worth lying to him, making promises I couldn\u2019t keep. Maybe the intimacy I felt was part of the bludding process, part of the powder\u2019s magic. Maybe I had to admit to myself that my beast had desires, and blood was apparently not the only one.</p><p>Or maybe . . .</p><p>I swallowed hard and sought my answer in his eyes.</p><p>It hit me like an arrow, thudding in my chest. In Casper\u2019s eyes, I saw more than pleas and lust. I found recognition, acceptance, and dedication. It was all written there for me to read, in the shadows dancing against the blue. This man, this new Bludman, had feelings for me. Fierce ones that couldn\u2019t be denied. And he was no longer confused, lost within himself. He was strong like me, powerful like me. And he wanted me, he loved me, as sure as his blood beat in my veins.</p><p>In that moment, it went from impossible to simple.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t asked for a commitment, hadn\u2019t asked me to love him or marry him or pledge myself to him eternally. He wanted my heart, but he hadn\u2019t demanded it. He had asked me, quite simply, if I wanted him. And that was an easy question to answer.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d I said, and a wicked smile lit his face.</p><p>In one smooth swoop, he stood, holding me tight against his bare chest, his hands under my thighs. I wrapped my arms around his neck, and he carried me as if I weighed nothing. Before I knew what had happened, he had shoved through the door into the next room and spread me out on the bed. It swung under me slightly, the ropes that tied it to the ceiling creaking. I felt more weightless, more pure and groundless and free, than ever. Even though it was past the last rays of sunset, the lantern light from outside was bright enough to shimmer through the stained-glass window and paint me in a rainbow of colors.</p><p>Casper walked around the bed. Stalking me. I stretched and arched my back for him, lifting one leg to let the silk dress slide up one calf.</p><p>\u201cEverything about you is just so . . . delicious.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, showing him my teeth. \u201cTaste me, then.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped long fingers around the rope, his eyes tracing it to the ceiling in curiosity. Apparently satisfied by what he saw, he leaped lightly onto the bed, which barely swayed, thanks to his newfound dexterity, the balance and litheness of a predator already taking root. With the same care I\u2019d seen Tommy Pain use when the cat walked a ledge, Casper prowled around the outside of the bed, drinking in every inch of me. When he wound around the ropes and stepped over my feet, his shadow blocked the window, and for just a moment, he looked rampant and wild as a timber wolf, his eyes glowing in the darkness.</p><p>There was a new confidence there, too, whether because of my admission or the fundamental change in his body. He appeared by my side on his knees, so quick and smooth that it seemed as if he\u2019d melted, the bed barely swaying. The squares of light flowed over his bare shoulders like liquid, lighting his hair like the halos I\u2019d seen in old-fashioned Pinky paintings of saints and angels.</p><p>\u201cI have wanted you since the first moment I saw you. Even half-dead, you were more alive than any woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He stretched out, half beside me, half on me, one hand tugging my curls. \u201cAnd that hair. It\u2019s like I can still see it sometimes, the color of butter. Like I can feel it pulling through my fingers when I\u2019m asleep and dreaming of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll grow back,\u201d I said, almost apologetically, and he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHush, sugarplum,\u201d he said, his accent strange and mellow.</p><p>He kissed me, long and slow, taking his time. The anticipation built, my body crying for his touch and rabid for satisfaction as he refused to hurry. The wine had made it easy the first time. Sharing blud had made it even easier, the excuse of feeding and hunger melding with the physical desire for the body around the need for sustenance. But now there was only him and me and the knowledge that we wanted each other, whatever that meant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to kiss you now that I don\u2019t want to eat you,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cFor me, it\u2019s harder. Because now I want to eat you, too.\u201d</p><p>I gasped as he kissed down my jaw, tracing a line along the vulnerable skin there, the veins close to the surface where he\u2019d already bitten. When he found the hollow of my throat, I moaned and ran my nails down the back of his neck, his hair soft on my wrist. He kept going, sliding his tongue along my collarbones and into the V of my silk dress. With a growl of frustration, he grasped the sides of the bodice as if to rip it in half, and I covered his hands with my own.</p><p>\u201cPatience, Maestro.\u201d I slid his hands to my hips. \u201cYou\u2019ve waited this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>I rolled over onto my stomach, and he gently bit the nape of my neck. Kissing down my spine, he unbuttoned the dress, one flick of fabric at a time. His lips followed his fingers, and I quivered as he hit the spot that was usually covered in corset. I had left it with Verusha, knowing that we were in for a messy and painful business. But now its absence gave me cause to purr, feeling the soft heat of Casper\u2019s lips trailing on skin tender with unaccustomed freedom. He undid the final button and ran his tongue all the way up my back, and something inside me melted, heavy and sweet as puddled wax.</p><p>He rolled me onto my back again, rough and slightly playful, the bed swaying. One after the other, he slid my arms from the fitted sleeves, kissing the curves of my shoulders, the tender insides of my elbows, and the pale white dip of each wrist. I closed my eyes, savoring the anticipation, wanting him to get back to kissing me or feeding on me or something less ticklish, more real, more demanding.</p><p>\u201cI will never get used to all this damn fabric,\u201d he murmured into the curve of my neck.</p><p>He kissed me hard as his hands slid the gown down to my waist, and I pressed against him, skin to skin and hotter than the sun. When he pushed it down farther, past my hips, I arched up against him, glad to be free of the blood-soaked silk. My foamy petticoats and his breeches were the only things left between us once he tossed my dress onto the floor, and I wanted more than ever to be completely unfettered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bed creaked and swayed as he rolled onto his side, taking me with him. One hand traced the swoops and valleys down my side, which had matured while I slept in the suitcase and filled out further with a week of good blood. When he found the swell of my hip, he groaned and pulled me closer, right up against him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. I growled, slipping out of my petticoats and tossing them off the bed, finally free.</p><p>His hands were suddenly everywhere, hot and greedy and grasping. On my hips, pulling me closer against the swell in his breeches. Scratching lightly up my spine, making me squirm and bare my teeth. Cupping my breasts, teasing the nipples with his thumbs, squeezing and gently pinching. Eyes closed, I felt everything, my entire body awake and open and willing.</p> <p>He rolled me onto my back, his cheek rasping as his lips found my nipple and sucked. I moaned, unprepared for the hunger it would raise in me. My back arched, my other breast crying out to be touched, and his hand obliged, the fingers as nimble and skilled as I had imagined. Every time I\u2019d watched him play the harpsichord, whether I knew it or not, I had thought of this, or something like it, of cunning fingers and warmth and that same cocky ease applied to coaxing music from my body.</p><p>The way his hands and mouth roved over me\u2014it was intoxicating, better than the bludwine. I couldn\u2019t tell where one hand touched and another stroked, where his mouth would go next with wet tongue and clever lips. He kissed between my breasts and licked a line down my ribs, dipping briefly into my navel and making me quiver. When he went farther down, I thought about stopping him, asking what, exactly, he was doing. Because surely he wasn\u2019t going to . . .</p><p>Oh, holy mother. He was.</p><p>Tongue wide and wet, he licked a long swath right where I wanted it most, right where I\u2019d been aching for his touch, and I bucked and moaned as he found other ways to lick and taste. He seemed to savor it, and as I had no basis for comparison, I just closed my eyes, arched my back, and loved every second of it. The sweetest, warmest feeling started to bloom deep in my middle, and when he slid one finger in gently, moving it in time with his tongue, I thought I was going to die on the spot.</p><p>This feeling was better than the blud, better than anything I\u2019d ever known. I didn\u2019t know how his harpsichord kept from bursting into flames under his hands. The loveliest sensation was building in me, and I could barely breathe, barely stop myself from screaming. One hand twisted in the bed sheets, one caught in his hair, I was riding a wave that I could barely contain.</p> <p>With one last, deep taste, he pulled away. I wanted to rip his neck open in frustrated fury. He caught my open mouth with his before I could protest, all but swallowing my tongue with the same rhythm he\u2019d used far below. One finger continued rubbing me, gentle and unceasing, and he kissed me deeply and unsnapped his breeches with his other hand. Somewhere far off, I heard his pants hit the ground, and then his body pressed against me from shoulder to foot, hot silk that smelled of pride and hunger and triumphant alpha male.</p><p>Aztarte help me, I purred and rubbed against him, shameless to resist my own nature.</p><p>His\u2014I didn\u2019t even know what to call it, and I wasn\u2019t about to stop kissing him to look down\u2014pressed against me, rubbing in the wetness he\u2019d created and all but driving me into madness.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>He pressed tighter, just the tip inside, one finger circling my flesh just above.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He kissed me gently. \u201cThen we should go slow, make sure you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p> <p>With a rugged growl, I rolled over on top of him and settled down, taking all of him and claiming what was mine in a savage thrust. There was a quick burst of pain, but it didn\u2019t stop me, and it didn\u2019t last. He sighed and groaned, hands grasping my hips firmly. Oh, it was lovely, so satisfying, and I moved up and down experimentally until I found what felt best. He obliged, guiding my hips until I had the rhythm just right and then finding that lovely spot again with a finger and rubbing and rubbing, faster and perfectly.</p><p>It was like dancing, but better, better than anything I\u2019d ever known, moving together with him, feeling the delicious fullness and pressure building. I ran my hands through his hair, down over the muscles of his shoulders, and spread my fingers wide over his chest, which was lightly dusted with auburn hair that matched his eyelashes. When I sat up, I saw that a line of similar hair trailed down his flat belly.</p><p>With the angle changed, so did the feeling, and I rocked back with a little sigh of pleasure. One of his hands found my nipple, pinching and rolling it, and I let my head fall back, one hand on his stomach for balance. He surged underneath me, moving in delectable circles, his finger never ceasing, caressing me again and again. As I moved faster, breathing in frantic gulps between moans and sighs, he moved with me, making the most deliciously masculine noises deep in his throat. I was so close, so close, and I looked down into his eyes, and they were full of love and wonder and murder and the deep blue of the sapphire in my ring, mysterious as the night sky and dark and warm as the stars, and then it struck me, that feeling, radiating from the place where we joined out through my heart and blud and bones and body, and I arched and bucked and screamed, an animal howl of triumph and joy that must have surely shaken the world.</p><p>He kept with me, stroke for stroke, and just as I began to melt and fall, he caught me close and rolled me over to my back and battered against me, harder and harder and deeper than deep. I took it, teeth bared, swallowing down the little echoes of my release as his own trembling howl built and erupted. Heat and silk and sweetness filled me, and I went stiff and taut as the last notes held, a song unending.</p><p>Rolling sideways, he ran one sweaty hand over me, a companionable and possessive gesture that ended with the scratch of a fingernail already growing sharp.</p><p>\u201cOh, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said, voice as sweet as blood oranges. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already was,\u201d I answered, one hand likewise claiming, splayed over his thigh. \u201cNow you start living for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love\u2014\u201d he began, but before he could finish, someone knocked on the door in the outer room. Casper lurched to his feet, naked, and charged the door with the full fury of a Bludman\u2019s beast unchained.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d I shouted. But I was too late.</p><p>30</p><p>I held my breath as the bed jerked beneath me, the sturdy ropes creaking in protest. Casper ripped the door open with a growl, and I smirked at his naked back, knowing what was on the doorstep. His entire posture and energy went from murderous and bestial to baffled and embarrassed. By the light of the star-shaped lanterns, I admired his bum as he knelt to get something off the ground.</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an inn,\u201d I called. \u201cRoom fees include two vials a day. It\u2019s customary.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the tray and shook his head, bemused. \u201cIf the knock had come five minutes earlier, that would be one dead innkeeper.\u201d</p><p>His feet slapped the tile briefly between the two rooms, his gait easy and confident. Setting the tray on the bed, he held out a vial to me, and I popped the cork and poured it into one of the two teacups. Casper fumbled with his cork, trying to pop it out with his thumb as I had. I smiled indulgently as I traced the skillfully painted Moravian designs in bright red and light blue on the thin porcelain. One of my geography tutors had been a world traveler, and I recalled her story of how Moravians used paint to reimagine the spray of fresh blood against the desert sky.</p><p>Casper finally managed to dislodge the cork, blood spattering his chest lightly. I had forgotten we were naked.</p><p>\u201cBetter than ruining your waistcoat, eh?\u201d I caught the blood on a finger and sucked it off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to learn, it seems.\u201d He poured the remaining blood into the other teacup and swirled it around, fascinated and bemused.</p><p>\u201cDrink it fast, or it will coagulate. If you must take your time, keep swirling it. In warmer places, it stays fresh longer, but in Muscovy, with the cold, it thickens quickly when exposed to air.\u201d I took a dainty sip from my cup.</p><p>He tried a sip, rolling the blood around in his mouth. \u201cDamn. That\u2019s bizarre. Salty and sweet. Almost syrupy. But with cinnamon.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cLocal flavor.\u201d</p><p>As the blood slid down my throat, I couldn\u2019t help wondering what it would be like to try it for the first time, when one had no catalog of tastes to help recognize the flavors. Human food came in so many varieties, with different textures and shapes and colors. Blood mostly looked the same, no matter what the outside package had looked like. And yet everyone had a different palate, most Bludmen enjoying whatever blood had been most handy when they were young. I\u2019d had Moravian before, although I was more accustomed to the stolid, hearty taste of well-bred Freesian servants. I hadn\u2019t tasted a Stranger or an Almanican before, so far as I knew, and I couldn\u2019t help being curious about what Casper had tasted like, before the blud had seeped into his body and started changing him. Now I would never know.</p><p>That made me think of Keen, and I almost asked about her. I hadn\u2019t seen her since handing her over to the groomers. Had they discussed his transition, or would he ask her forgiveness later? She was sure to hate me either way, but I hoped there would be some way to find resolution. Even if I didn\u2019t want to talk about her just then, I was forced to admit that I cared for the little urchin. She would have a place in the palace no matter what\u2014that much I promised myself.</p><p>He placed his empty cup back on the enameled tray carefully, as if worried that he might smash it. I set mine down, too, unwrapping one of the swan-folded napkins to dab daintily at my lips, even though I knew very well that I hadn\u2019t spilled a drop. The mess from the bludding was still sticky in my hair, but my mouth was spotless.</p><p>\u201cI feel so strange,\u201d Casper said, holding out his hands and flexing the long fingers. \u201cLike I\u2019m tight all over, like I\u2019m ready to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a predator now. You are ready to run. Did you feel how the beast carried you to the door when you sensed a threat? Your entire body is constantly waiting for exactly that. It\u2019s important that you drink two vials of blood a day, or that\u2019ll happen more and more easily. Your body wants to feed, and control takes time to develop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled on his breeches and walked over to an ornate mirror that hung on the plaster wall.</p><p>\u201cDo I look different? Am I . . . I don\u2019t know. Prettier? Paler?\u201d</p><p>I considered him. \u201cYour eyes are different. Your smell is different. You move differently. But it isn\u2019t like going to the groomery a complete mess and coming out fixed up with a new hairstyle.\u201d Watching him stare at his hands by lantern light, I added, \u201cAnd your hands, I think, will take some time to darken fully. We\u2019ll have to think of a way to hide them at the ball.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ball.\u201d He sighed, staring intently into his own eyes as if looking for something that had fled. \u201cThat gives me a day to learn everything I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout being a Bludman?\u201d I snorted. \u201cYou already know everything. Drink blood, be proud, fight to the death, and laugh loudly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Freesia. About your people and family and customs. About why this Sugar Snow Ball is so damned important. About how to speak to people, how to bow. How to fake an accent. How to kill Ravenna if she murders you in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>I stretched luxuriously and flicked my fingers at his reflection.</p><p>\u201cPsh. You can learn all that in the carriage. So long as you know how to dance and be quiet, you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p> <p>His posture changed, and in an instant, he was elegantly waltzing around the room with his shadow, shoulders back and feet nimble, elegantly muscled arms locked in a cage that held nothing. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find me a more than adequate dance partner. Being quiet, though\u2014I find myself more outspoken than ever. I don\u2019t know if silence is an option anymore. I feel like nothing and no one can hold me back. It\u2019s freeing, really.\u201d With a final spin, he dipped his invisible partner. His hair fell forward, glimmering in the rainbow light from the stained-glass window, and I couldn\u2019t stop staring. He was the most attractive creature I\u2019d ever encountered, and it was somewhat unsettling to see him so different and yet unchanged.</p><p>When he stood up, laughing and pushing his hair back, I realized how very well his dimples went with his pointier smile. I looked down when I felt myself blushing.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shifted uncomfortably, finding that the aftereffects of our lovemaking were a bit disconcerting and messy. \u201cIt\u2019s an inn. We\u2019ve paid through the night. So we\u2019ll stay the night, have a vial in the morning, and return to Verusha\u2019s to prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasant night of sleep and a makeover,\u201d he said with another chuckle. \u201cFair enough. I guess that somewhere under the power and hunger and elation, I\u2019m dog-tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe process is supposed to be very taxing. I think sleep will be good for us both.\u201d</p> <p>I stood, my feet a little wobbly, keeping the sheet wrapped around my body. In the heat of the moment, clothes had seemed very inconvenient indeed, and I had come close to ripping them off myself at a few points. But now, with him staring at me with a mixture of curiosity, tenderness, and, somehow, still more hunger, the sheet was a blessing. It trailed behind me to the narrow door in the far wall.</p><p>\u201cSo we still have to . . . use the . . . um . . .\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re predators, you fool. Not statues.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face as I dropped the sheet and slammed the door was utterly priceless.</p><p>When I was done in the bathroom, I found him relaxing in the bed, which had been tidied up, the covers straightened and pillows added to make a cozy nest. He\u2019d pulled the curtain across the stained glass, and the room was mostly shadows. The darkness was warm and velvety, with Casper at its heart. Forgetting my sheet, I padded across the room and climbed onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cThe swaying reminds me of the Maybuck a little,\u201d Casper said, stretching one arm out invitingly. I slid in beside him, turning to face him. His arm curled around me, his hair brushing my collarbone. I nestled against him, breathing in his scent, which no longer sang to me of food. He reminded me of a summer day in the fields, of golden grass and heavy trees swaying in the breeze and sweet flowers and the manly odor of sweat and strength. Like sleeping in the sunshine, a brief respite.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I smell like to you?\u201d I asked suddenly.</p><p>He buried his cheek in my hair. I felt his chest expand beneath me, his breath warm against my ear. \u201cFrozen flowers. Wind and ice. Something purple and beautiful, a bloom unfurling under the moon, in the snow.\u201d</p> <p>I shivered and sighed and settled myself more firmly against him. It felt . . . right. As if I was exactly where I was supposed to be. I had no map for where I was going with him, no history for understanding how a man and a woman shared themselves. My parents had been the king and queen in a game of chess, always apart and moving in separate, incalculable ways. No wonder I didn\u2019t miss them more. I\u2019d never seen a relationship built on trust and attraction, never seen passing touches and two creatures curled around each other in sleep. But my beast understood that Casper was powerful now and would defend me with his life and that I could do much worse for myself than settle close in his arms and find some peace before everything went to hell.</p><p>But something was bothering Casper. He shifted against me as if he couldn\u2019t get comfortable and exhaled into my shoulder, and I turned to put a hand on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What could possibly be wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . it would just be an inconvenient time for you to . . .\u201d He sighed deeply and swallowed. \u201cFor you to be with child. I wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>When he trailed off, I kissed him lightly and chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s what troubles you? Never fear. Now\u2019s not the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a body. I always know when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a Bludman thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Bludwoman thing. Any other concerns?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed my back, sleepy and warm, and I relaxed a little. \u201cWe were together. I forget the rest,\u201d he said.</p><p>Contented, I fell asleep, swaying gently in his arms.</p><p>The next morning was filled with tiny awkwardnesses. I woke up with his body tangled sweetly around me, except for the bit that was unintentionally prodding me. When I shot out of the bed in sleepy surprise, Casper tried to roll out while it was swaying, and he landed on the floor in a lump of blankets. It was challenging, finding all of our clothes and catching sneaky glances at each other, little snippets of bodies we\u2019d already seen in all their glory but couldn\u2019t help being curious about. He almost murdered the vial delivery boy again, but at least he was clothed this time.</p><p>Once we were dressed and fed, he was as suave and collected as any Bludman I\u2019d ever seen. Confidence was key for a predator\u2014lesser creatures were naturally suspicious. He had been cocky before, but now he was dangerously dauntless. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he was going to come across as a threat. A tricky line to walk, to be sure.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d I asked, straightening my Moravian shawl in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cLike I could take down a moose and drink it dry.\u201d He bounced on the balls of his feet, radiating energy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve never tasted one.\u201d I turned to face him, looking him up and down. He cut a fine figure, to be sure, and for a brief moment, I thought about launching myself at him and kissing him until he threw me back onto the bed. But no. I had a country to save. I picked up his shawl and draped it over him, hiding his long hair, his broad shoulders, everything but the toes of his boots. His old Pinky hat would go into a rubbish bin. \u201cMost blud animals are gamey and thin compared with humans. Unless you take one in a fight to flavor it with victory, you\u2019d find the taste repellent.\u201d I watched him move for a moment and added, \u201cYou might want to tone it down a bit, though. You\u2019ll attract unwanted attention from dangerous males, walking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I have vampire swagger,\u201d he said.</p><p>I raised one eyebrow at him, and he raised one back at me, and then he broke out in loud laughter. It was a welcome sound. After all our time together, I\u2019d seen him drunk, conflicted, angry, scared, lusty, and nearly suicidal. But I\u2019d never seen him happy. Not before just now.</p><p>My boots waited by the door, and I savored how easy it was to lace them when not wearing a corset. At home in the palace, I had never laced my own boots, and therefore the order of corsetry had never mattered. But I had learned on the Maybuck that smart girls put on shoes, then corset, then took off corset, then shoes. The first few times lacing either item by myself had been nearly impossible, but now I\u2019d gotten used to it.</p><p>My mother would have fainted, to think of me tying my own boots or fixing my own hair. She had been well over a hundred and had never cut her own hair. The mass of it had fallen nearly to the floor, and the servants had always complained behind her back about the trouble it took to wash it, dry it, and put it up in ever more complicated styles that would set the fashion for all of Freesia. It was painful, thinking of how Ravenna must have defiled the Tsarina\u2019s beloved hair, not to mention her body.</p><p>My mother\u2019s idea of good leadership had been just like her hair\u2014ornamental and vexing. I had been raised to rule, but ruling mostly meant dwelling in various palaces, reclining, complaining, and being vicious. It seemed quite petty, from where I stood now. And even if I didn\u2019t agree with her outdated and overly cruel style of monarchy, she had been better than Ravenna. The upstart gypsy snake had begun her reign with murder, deposed the barons, and let the Pinkies run unchecked. Although I didn\u2019t understand her ultimate goal, from what I could see, she wanted to destroy everything that Freesia stood for.</p><p>And what had become of poor Alex, my nearly feral younger brother? He had been born growling and nipping and hadn\u2019t really stopped since. While everyone else in the palace drank two or three vials a day or sometimes a few measured gulps from a willing servant, Alex was ravenous and required ten times as much blood to keep from going mad. When he had enough blood and was in a good patch, he was overly polite and given to intelligent pursuits. He wrote rambling letters to pen pals in Constantinoble and Melburn, took great interest in the hounds, and enjoyed falconry. We played chess together and planned imaginary trips. Olgha and I had always been rivals, but Alex and I got on fine, so long as he was fed. Without enough blood, he became dangerously savage and had to be chained up and forced to guzzle animal blood until he quit screaming. Chirurgeons and herbalists and mystics had been called in to cure him, but none had succeeded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Ravenna had found an ally in Alex, if she had found a way to calm him, if not cure him, then it was easy enough to see how she had won her way into the palace. A son who couldn\u2019t make an advantageous match for the royal house\u2014a son who, much worse, couldn\u2019t even be taken out in public and might attack newspaper reporters\u2014was a liability and a tragedy. My mother had first coddled him, then sent him away, then kept him close like a muzzled bludmare, hoping every day that a solution would present itself.</p><p>If what Casper had told me and what I had read in the newspapers was correct, Ravenna had found a way to subdue Alex. And that was one more problem with killing her. What if she was the only one who knew the secret to a normal life for my brother?</p><p>A hand landed on my shoulder. \u201cAhna? You\u2019re a thousand miles away. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>My fists were clenched around my bootlaces, which were tied in triple knots. I let go of the laces and stood, flexing my fingers to get the blud flowing through them once more.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about Freesia. About my brother. There are just so many variables.\u201d</p><p>He chucked me under the chin, and I wrenched my face away in annoyance. \u201cA glancer once told me that I would have a happily ever after. I think that means we\u2019re going to succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I don\u2019t believe in omens.\u201d I picked up my bag and stood by the door, not yet ready to leave the comfort of our little aerie. \u201cI was taught to believe that fortune-telling was the lowest form of chicanery, people telling you what you want, what you need to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have thought so once, if the fortune-teller hadn\u2019t broken my heart. Everything she said has come true so far. Why can\u2019t the good part be as true as the bad?\u201d</p> <p>He stepped close enough that had he been anyone else, it would have raised my hackles. Instead, I felt a strange ripple shimmy down my body. It reminded me of the way my father\u2019s favorite wolfhound had always greeted him, wiggling as if she were so full of joy she could shake it off like water. I cocked my head at him, considering. Was this lust? Or love? Or just fellow feeling tangled up with a hunger for his body? Before I could consider further, his lips brushed over mine, warm and swift as a breeze in summer.</p><p>Would there be time to understand these feelings fully by the time I stood before Ravenna, my entire country\u2019s future riding on my shoulders? There was no way to know. Maybe she would kill one or both of us, and I would never have to consider it further. With a sudden urgency, I leaned forward to kiss him back, my lips firm against his.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take over this cold-ass country,\u201d he said with a dimpled grin. We pulled up the hoods of our Moravian disguises and disappeared among the morning crowd, two Bludmen in something a little like love.</p><p>31</p><p>When we arrived at the groomery, Verusha looked Casper up and down through her monocle and nodded, as close as she would come to congratulations. As for Keen, she had escaped after her grooming and hadn\u2019t been seen since. Casper was worried, especially since he hadn\u2019t had a chance to warn her of our grim outing, but he knew her well enough to know that looking for her would be futile. I was worried, too, and I realized that we needed a diversion to keep us from going crazy as we waited for tomorrow and the Sugar Snow Ball. All of my plans were about to come to fruition, but for the next few hours, there was nothing to do but fret, which Verusha wouldn\u2019t tolerate. I borrowed a clean dress from Verusha\u2019s daughter-in-law and returned to the parlor to find an entirely new version of Casper.</p><p>As a Pinky, Casper had been a major liability to me, and the slightest wrong word or gesture from him toward me\u2014or anyone on the street\u2014might have ended in him being impounded or beaten. Dressed in appropriate clothing, with his hair brushed and his cravat hanging loose, he was a fitting companion. I wanted him to see my homeland with a Bludman\u2019s eyes, and we left the groomery arm-in-arm as if we hadn\u2019t a care.</p> <p>I took him first to the park where the ballerinas practiced, and we caught them at their midmorning encore, stretching toward the sun like bright flowers. Casper strolled over to the quartet playing in full parade dress on the bandstand, inspecting the instruments with a polite smile. I could see the calculations in his eyes as he realized that Blud musicians could play faster than Pinkies, their movements sharper and more complex. His gloved fingers flexed against his breeches, and I grinned to myself. I couldn\u2019t wait to see him at a harpsichord, discovering the true breadth of his skills.</p><p>Next we walked the topiary gardens, remarking on the impossible shapes carved into the bushes. He recognized several of the more famous statues, murmuring the names of the artists in his world who had created them and telling me their subtle differences, such as the fact that a reclining nude wasn\u2019t crushing a tiger\u2019s throat where he came from but was just, in fact, lying there.</p><p>At the Natural History Museum, he marveled at the stuffed exhibits of animals he\u2019d never seen alive. The dodo, the roc, the sea goats, and the unicorn especially drew him close, and I found that I savored his amazement. I had not spent much time around children, and surely this was how a parent felt, watching a young creature reel at the possibilities of the wide world. When he stood under the dragon\u2019s yellowed skeleton, gawking, I outright laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s huge!\u201d He held his arms out wide but was still dwarfed by its wingspan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen bigger,\u201d I said with a smirk.</p><p>He grew quiet in the art museum, tears springing to his eyes as he stood before a strange little painting that I\u2019d never really given any thought. The poor woman had no eyebrows, but her smile was rather enigmatic.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to see it, in my world. But I never got around to it. I had a tour planned for Paris for the next summer, and the Mona Lisa was at the top of my list.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close, and the docent in the corner cleared her throat and wagged a finger. I grabbed his arm and pulled him away before they investigated us too closely. As different as I looked, this was my home country. Being recognized was all too real a possibility, and I had been careless to let him call attention to us.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m Tsarina,\u201d I whispered, leaning close, \u201cI\u2019ll shut down the museum and send the guards home. You can lick it to taste the paint, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at me as if I were silly and adorable, a child playing make-believe. Anger rippled over me. Did he think I was telling idle lies? I latched my arm more firmly around his and dragged him down the long hallway under the glittering curves of giant crystal chandeliers shaped like Krakens. Up a spiraling staircase we went, our boots hushed by thick carpets woven with designs of snowflakes and icicles. He went along with me as he had all morning, bemused and indulgent, and I growled under my breath. What I was about to show him\u2014he needed to see it, and now.</p><p>We passed door after door down the long hallway, not stopping to admire the world-renowned collection of decorative enameled emu and ostrich eggs. When I darted through the last door on the right, he followed. I moved to the side, and he stopped and muttered, \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you see now?\u201d</p><p>The room was decorated in white and blue and dominated by a giant painting, twice as large as life. The artist had captured me perfectly, seventeen forever. I gazed out of the gilt frame, somehow both haughty and innocent. My face still held the vaguest curve of childhood, but my neck was already graceful and long. My hair was piled high in the fashion of the time, except for one long elegant braid that trailed over my shoulder and down to my waist, tied with a velvet ribbon and sprinkled with dark gray pearls. My dress was in a style already abandoned, heavy with beading in the shape of iridescent peacock feathers. I still remembered the thrill of trying it on, how heavy and adult it felt, the train sweeping the floor. I had spun in place and then hugged Verusha for giving the dressmaker instructions to let the neckline dip perfectly, just like my mother\u2019s.</p><p>It was clearly me, and I clearly sat in a throne, wearing a heavy crown set with a sapphire the size of my fist. The necklace draped around my neck was currently in Verusha\u2019s care, missing half of the stones that glittered larger than life in the painting. The engraved plaque screwed into the painting read, \u201cPrincess Ahnastasia Feodor.\u201d</p><p>The way he looked at me then\u2014it was as if he finally realized that I wasn\u2019t just some foundling from a suitcase. He might have believed it, in theory, before then. We might have been working toward the same goal, moving together among my people. He called me Ahna, and princess, though only to tease. And my story may have added up. But in that moment, I saw it strike him in the heart, the enormity of who I was and what we were up against.</p><p>It may have also been a little unsettling to realize he had recently made love to a national treasure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful painting,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI was considered a great beauty back then. Very promising. I was receiving marriage proposals by age twelve, but none was good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were breathtaking then, it\u2019s true.\u201d He squeezed my arm. \u201cBut I like you even better now.\u201d</p><p>I felt the warmth rush into my cheeks, a little thrill rippling over me. He pulled me close, a firm hand on my back, and kissed me gently. I stood on my tiptoes to kiss him back, my fingers light on his shoulders and my hips pressed against him in a way that would have been innocent just yesterday. He deepened the kiss, and things were just starting to get good when a docent I hadn\u2019t noticed cleared his throat. We broke apart, and I hid my face in Casper\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShow some respect to the Blud Princess,\u201d the old Bludman said gruffly, his hat in his hand.</p><p>I risked a glance at the old man, peeking through Casper\u2019s hair. I couldn\u2019t ignore the bald sadness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever find her?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>\u201cI pray every day that it will happen,\u201d the docent said. \u201cPoor girl.\u201d</p><p>Casper nodded, his face grave. \u201cMay your hope be answered,\u201d he said formally, with the respect one would expect of a born Bludman. We left the room quietly, his arm shielding my face. I heard the old man\u2019s sigh, long and sad. When I turned back briefly at the door, the docent stood before the painting of me, wiping away a blud tear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were silent as we walked slowly down the hall. Casper glanced briefly through the other doors, taking in the paintings of Olgha, Alex, and my parents, captured in a rare and planned moment together, stiff and wooden even considering the kindness of the artist\u2019s brush. Mounds of tiny crystal vials rested on every flat surface of the room\u2014one blud tear in each, the formal show of mourning. My eyes squeezed shut in pain. I should have brought a vial and left a tear of my own, one drop of royal blud among thousands.</p><p>As if reading my mind, he squeezed my arm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to kick that bitch\u2019s ass,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat we are,\u201d I answered, squeezing back.</p> <p>32</p><p>Our afternoon passed in the sweet haze of stolen indulgence. Browsing in shops, strolling down streets lined with tinkling snowdrops, visiting the world\u2019s largest collection of blud creatures in the Muscovy Zoo and laughing at the camels. We kissed in the highest belfry of the Basilica of Aztarte as I sat in a window, my hair rustled by a breeze that smelled of the coming snow. I found that I was no longer frightened of heights. Afterward, Casper stood in the window himself, leaning outward over the whole city, and yelled something barbaric that sounded very much like \u201cYawp.\u201d It brought him such strange joy that I found it bizarrely endearing.</p><p>Remembering Verusha\u2019s favorite treat, I stopped at a vendor in the Franchian district and bought a painted box of sugared liver. What were a few more coppers when soon I would be either dead or the reigning monarch? And it was worth it, seeing her face light up when we walked through the door of the groomery.</p><p>\u201cAh, darleenk, you remembered!\u201d She snatched the box and popped a sliver into her mouth, sucking blissfully as she ushered us into her sitting room. Casper moved toward the divan, but she plucked at his jacket and tugged him into the last rays of afternoon sun by the window. She walked around him, old eyes narrow and calculating. \u201cTell me, now. Was it as horrible as they say?\u201d</p><p>Casper managed to keep a straight face, and I merely inclined my head and said, \u201cWe managed to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Verusha slapped Casper in the ribs, and he stood up straighter. She ran his hair through her talons and slid a hand down his arm, squeezing his muscles. She held his fingers up to the light, saying, \u201cInteresting. It\u2019s coming on quite fast. But I can smell it on you, the vestiges of your humanity. You\u2019ll need a good bathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother grooming?\u201d He grimaced and glanced at the door to the groomery.</p><p>Verusha drew back, one hand to her chest in affront. \u201cA Bludman? In my groomery? How obscene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might as well drag you out to the trough with the bludmares,\u201d I added with a grin. I swiped a bit of liver from the open box and savored the tartness of the sour sugar against the rich tang of blood.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m just suddenly . . . different to you?\u201d Casper asked. His face was guarded, a strange mixture of anger and bemusement.</p><p>\u201cMy boy, you have gone from stew to stud,\u201d Verusha said, popping another bit of candy into her mouth. \u201cIt is not often one changes species overnight. We should celebrate. You are hungry?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded silently, as if it pained him to admit it. Verusha opened the warming cube that hummed gently on a shelf and withdrew two vials of blood. She took down two teacups, poured for us, and served, bowing her head slightly to him and greatly to me in the proper show of deference.</p><p>Casper sat, rigid, on the edge of the sofa. He took a sip of blood, tentative and with great concentration, as if every time he tasted it, he was afraid to find it repellent. After a few more sips, he relaxed all over and settled back against the cushions.</p><p>\u201cI told you hunger would make you peevish,\u201d I said, and he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cFunny how it loosens you up a little. Almost like alcohol but without the fuzziness. I feel just as sharp, just not like everything you say is a challenge. Much better.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, one boot on his knee, savoring his blood as if trying to puzzle out a rare vintage.</p><p>\u201cI would swear it tastes like butter,\u201d he said between sips. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerusha prefers good country stock,\u201d I supplied. \u201cThese Pinkies would have access to fresh dairy and butter, and perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re tasting. I sense cream and sunshine and freshness. Quite round and full-bodied.\u201d</p><p>Verusha settled back into her pillows with a handful of liver candy perched on her prodigious bosom. An easy life indoors, extra vials of country blood, and plenty of sweetmeats had made her cushy, and she was enjoying it.</p> <p>\u201cGood for the constitution,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that, in the box?\u201d Casper asked, setting down his empty teacup and leaning forward to pluck a bit of liver from the box on the table.</p><p>She hissed and made as if to swat him. \u201cStay out of an old woman\u2019s sweets,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive to waste on someone with no taste for riches.\u201d</p><p>He dodged her hand and sniffed the bit of deep red liver, coated with crystallized sugar and resembling a bright jewel. He had just opened his mouth when the door swung in to reveal a cleaner-than-usual Keen, her hair pulled back under the traditional kerchief of low-ranking Pinky servants.</p><p>\u201cIs that candy?\u201d She grinned as if she\u2019d never been gone, skittering to his side and plunking herself down on the divan. \u201cAll the food here is dull. No salt. What\u2019s the point?\u201d Before she could dig her gloved fingers into the box, he snapped it shut.</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to Verusha,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease try to have some manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Maestro? Who died and made you God?\u201d She slung her booted feet up onto the small table and took out her clockwork tortoise, still in sphere form, tossing it from hand to hand. Casper quivered beside her and began breathing through his mouth, and I realized that it was the first time he\u2019d been trapped in a small, airless room with a Pinky since being bludded.</p><p>\u201cWe should go.\u201d I stood and held out a hand to Casper, unsure of what I would do if he rejected the offer. But he took my hand and hurried around the table, away from Keen, who smelled less repulsive after a good grooming.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she said, clearly puzzled. \u201cAnd where were you guys last night? And where have you been all day?\u201d Her eyes narrowed as she looked at the open neck of Casper\u2019s shirt, and then she looked him up and down. \u201cSmile,\u201d she commanded, glaring.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>She threw her tortoise down and rounded on me, hands balled into fists, as vicious and small as the bludweasel we\u2019d seen at the zoo. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d She stepped close enough for me to smell the scent of violets from Verusha\u2019s shampoo. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat had to be done,\u201d Casper said tiredly, pulling her back by the shoulders while keeping his face firmly turned away. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry? You\u2019re frigging sorry?\u201d Keen backed away from us, one step after another toward the door. She was fighting tears, shoulders heaving. \u201cYou were fine, Casper. Why\u2019d you have to ruin everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you. I couldn\u2019t. But it was getting bad in London. Worse on the Maybuck. I was starting to lose it. You don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand? Why you\u2019d let her turn you into one of them? Jesus, Casper. You\u2019re not even a person anymore. You\u2019re a monster.\u201d She whipped the kerchief off her head and wiped her eyes angrily. \u201cI read your frigging journal, you whiny sack. I can\u2019t believe that after that chick at the caravan chose a Blud over you, you kept drinking. You\u2019re such a goddamn addict. You\u2019re so sad. And weak. You\u2019re just like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, Keen?\u201d A deadly calm had come over him. \u201cLike whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I just expected better from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lost long before you showed up. There was no escaping my past. You can\u2019t undo that much bludwine. It was this or madness.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and leaned back against the wall beside the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? This is madness. You\u2019re totally bugshit. You\u2019re always supposed to fight it, Casper. Dracula, the bad guys in Blade, the Lost Boys. Even Colin Farrell. They\u2019re bad guys. They kill people. You\u2019re always supposed to fight the vampires!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut vampires are cool. I thought it was zombies that you were always supposed to fight?\u201d The corner of his mouth quirked up hopefully, his dimples flashing with a Bludman\u2019s killer charm, and she shut her eyes and beat her fist against Verusha\u2019s damask wallpaper.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is a joke? Awesome. I guess I\u2019m the punch line.\u201d She pointed at me, right at my heart. \u201cAnd I hope that gypsy bitch rips you in half. You\u2019d make a suckass queen, anyway, considering you don\u2019t care about anyone but yourself.\u201d</p><p>One hand on the doorknob, she glared at him. He looked away, and she was gone. When the door slammed behind her, Casper finally inhaled. Verusha was already fetching another vial for him. He took the teacup and drank it down in several gulps, desperately and without testing or savoring it this time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShe always is.\u201d</p><p>Verusha and I nodded, but I wasn\u2019t so sure. That last look she\u2019d given us had burned like a slap across the face. Somewhere deep inside me, the old version of Ahnastasia snarled and envisioned a slender head on a pike in the snow, the short brown hair dark against the hills and dripping blood. But the new version of me ached painfully and wished there had been some way to make her see the truth of it.</p><p>I picked the brass sphere off the couch and turned it over in my hands.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted a pet,\u201d Casper said. \u201cI always said I would buy her a clockwork, but I just never got around to it. She\u2019d be hanged for stealing that. I guess I didn\u2019t realize how much she needed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>When I looked down, I found Casper\u2019s hand in mine, but I couldn\u2019t recall when it had happened or who had reached for whom. I squeezed back anyway. I couldn\u2019t explain it, but I had lost something, too, and I already missed the little urchin. I could only hope that we all survived long enough for me to find her and fix the mess I\u2019d made of a fellow victim\u2019s life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d never had friends before, either.</p><p>We sat in silence for some time. Verusha finally broke the dark pall of the room by standing up and exclaiming, \u201cThis. This is why we don\u2019t allow Pinkies to think for themselves. Poor little fool!\u201d She hurried out the door as if anxious to be away from us, calling, \u201cThere are beds made upstairs, the open doors. My darleenk, it is not silk and gold, but it is better than a valise. Sleep well. Tomorrow morning, we begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Casper\u2019s hand left mine, and he settled back to watch me. He looked haggard but handsome, the lines of his face sharper than they had been, as if an artist had gone over a sketch with a firmer hand, perfecting it.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sugar Snow Ball is tomorrow night. Tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll prepare and dress. We\u2019ll board the carriage at dusk and ride through the forest to the Ice Palace. We\u2019ll dance to bring down the snow, and then I\u2019ll kill Ravenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, sinister and sweet. \u201cAfter that, I make the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many things, darling. So many things.\u201d</p> <p>I breathed in deeply, dreamily. I would fix things. I would clean up Ravenna\u2019s mess. I would send some very precious valises to the Svedish king with the heads of his ambassadors and spies tied up like holiday gifts inside. I would send dangerous men to visit Mr. Sweeting on Ruby Lane and fetch my sister\u2019s remains home. I would even put Keen\u2019s picture in the papers and see if we could find her with a reward large enough that she would come claim it herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about me, Ahna. What will you do about me?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the court composer for all of Muscovy. I keep my promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d</p><p>The turn of his head, the way his throat moved\u2014he was all Bludman now. And I might have been able to wiggle out of his clutches before, but I could already feel the sharpened force of him. Before, I could have run. Now he could catch me. He was stronger, and it didn\u2019t matter that I was royal, a princess. I couldn\u2019t escape the reality of his physical presence, and especially not its pull on me. Especially not when he demanded it.</p><p>He waited, quiet but alert, as the emotions roiled in me. He was bigger, stronger, and the beast in me wanted to submit, to roll belly up and lick his throat as wolves did in the wild. I liked him. I cared about him. But I didn\u2019t know if we would survive tomorrow night and, if we did, if he would survive a single day in the Snow Court. He wasn\u2019t the only one who would wish to stand by my side, although the others would do it for political power. Was it kinder to tell him now or later that the only way we could ever be together during my reign was with me as the stoic, married royal and him as the court composer who warmed my bed in secret?</p> <p>\u201cAhna. Ahnastasia.\u201d</p><p>He tried to touch my face, but I pulled back with a hiss and a blush. He smiled, lazy and slow. Leaning back with his arm across the sofa behind my head, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you running scared before, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He could sense it, the bastard! I had been so eager to turn him into an ally I could use, someone like me, that I had forgotten the powers of an alpha-male Bludman in his prime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d I stood, smoothing down my dress and hunting for something more useful to do. I couldn\u2019t sit on the sofa beside him just then, with him so attuned to my feelings. I couldn\u2019t find the words for how I felt, and the longer and closer I lingered, the faster he would decide for himself. What I wanted to say to him would be my choice, and I wouldn\u2019t let his blud take that away from me. \u201cBut Verusha is right. We need sleep. Tomorrow will be long. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back as I slipped into the hall and scurried up the stairs. The first open room was done up in burgundy, but the second room was appointed in sky blue and antiqued gold, as if Verusha had kept it waiting for me all these years. Once inside behind the locked door, I undressed quickly to slip into a bed firmly rooted to the floor, neither rolling nor floating over the ground.</p><p>His eyes in that last moment had been warm and sure and filled with dancing shadows. He had seen me, seen right through me. And he had let me go, although we both knew he could have kept me there. Whether with his body or his words, I would have been helpless if he had truly wanted me to stay. I had taken him, bribed him, turned him, kept him for my own uses. It had all been for one purpose: to save Freesia and be queen, powerful over all.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t admit to myself that one man now had power over me.</p><p>Tomorrow would be bad enough without admitting how much I had to lose.</p> <p>33</p><p>I woke up to the sound of Verusha humming. Always the same song, since I had first left my mother\u2019s bed to sleep, cold and alone, in the nursery. I smiled and muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re off key, old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re an ungrateful little creature who deserves to be drowned in the river,\u201d she said in turn. \u201cSleeping past noon. Lazy beast!\u201d</p><p>The warm familiarity of the ritual was soothing, but only until I realized that today was the day that would determine everything. Life or death, queen or pawn. Casper or . . . the emptiness where he should have been by my side.</p><p>I sat up as Verusha plumped the pillows behind my back and put a teacup of warm blood and bludmare\u2019s milk in my hands. As I sipped it, I was flooded with memories. The first time I\u2019d been beaten for showing weakness. All the times Olgha had locked me in a trunk or smeared my face in the snow, telling me I would never be anything but a pretty brood mare. The time I had stolen into the Pinky kitchens and played with the children there, trying their food and spitting it out to our mutual amusement, and later, when I\u2019d been punished. My mother had forced me to drink from one of the children, a little boy. She had held him rigid, his black hair in one hand and his shoulder pinched in the other.</p><p>\u201cNever forget what they are to us,\u201d she had said as I paused, conflicted, clumsy teeth scraping his neck. \u201cThey are food. Servants. Chattel. To be used and bred and thrown away as we will it. Once they have laughed at you, they will always wait for their next chance.\u201d</p><p>The tears had slid down my cheeks and blurred with the boy\u2019s blood to smear across my lips. I had never returned to the kitchens, and that boy had avoided me for the rest of my time at the palace.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought about him for years, but now I wondered where he was and how my future would run. Would I change everything or nothing? Would I drive the Pinkies from their stolen district in the city proper or allow them to flourish? Did I really want to continue treating people the way Keen and Casper had been treated, as less than bludmares and hunting dogs? And if I chose not to do that, how would my people react? I\u2019d seen evidence in print and in real life that Ravenna was letting the humans run wild. Before, I had hated her for it. But now, with my feelings changing, I couldn\u2019t help wondering how it would look when I deposed her and showed further sympathy to the Pinkies.</p><p>\u201cI see you fussing, my darleenk,\u201d Verusha said. \u201cPerhaps this will soothe you.\u201d She opened the closet and brought out a magnificent dress that was more than familiar to me, although its color was changed from the original cream to a cool aquamarine. I could imagine Verusha stealing it from the summer palace and dyeing it in secret, looking at it wistfully from time to time, as if she had known that I would one day return to claim it.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that will still fit? I\u2019m taller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut thinner. We\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p><p>The beaded peacock feathers cascaded to the floor, shimmering iridescent against the heavy silk like the diamonds they were. Aquamarines and sapphires winked in the eyes of the feathers, and I was already anxious to feel the rich fabric slide over my skin. Wearing that dress to sit for the painting had made me feel queenly at seventeen; what would it do for me now?</p><p>\u201cThe bath is ready.\u201d She tipped her head to the door in the corner. \u201cSoak a while, and Verusha will make you as beautiful as ever.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d always loved relaxing in big copper tubs full of perfumed water and rose-tinged mare\u2019s milk. But I\u2019d never had cares before, never had problems weighing me down. I wanted to leap out onto the tile floor, dripping pinkish liquid, and rush out into the streets to fight or conquer something or at least get into an argument with someone of lesser wit. But I could hear Verusha in the outer room, humming lullabies to herself as she prepared to dress me as she had always wished, as the crowning beauty of the Feodor family, the future Tsarina. Even had I wanted to run away, she could have stopped me with one harsh word and a reminder of my destiny.</p><p>I slid down into the dark, warm silence of the tub, and brown swirled into the milky water. I closed my eyes and scrubbed soap into my scalp, wishing to wash out the dye along with the dirt of the last week\u2019s journey. I wasn\u2019t the same girl who had burst from the suitcase\u2014that much was true. In some ways, I\u2019d become harder. But in others, I was already too soft. First Casper and Keen and now even Verusha\u2014they had all gotten to me. I would have to find my backbone as the carriage bumped through the forest toward the palace, or I\u2019d end up pledging my allegiance to Ravenna and being married off or murdered within a fortnight.</p><p>\u201cDry off now, leetle fish,\u201d Verusha called, and I obeyed, my mind too busy planning rebellion to actually rebel.</p><p>She was fussing with me before I was out of my towel, rubbing rich creams into my skin. I let her bend me and move me as necessary, just as she always had. I was nearly hairless, and much of my youth had been spent holding back screams as she spread me with wax and ripped the bits of paper off in cruel jerks. She must have been thinking about the same thing, as she nodded with great authority and said, \u201cYou see? I told you it would be worth it. Smooth as glass, you are.\u201d</p><p>I just sighed. The fire that had kept me running for so long was burning low, buffeted by too many other emotions to flare brightly. Casper had been right last night; I was scared. Scared to tell him how I felt and scared to feel that way at all. And yet I couldn\u2019t wait to see him, kept looking at the closed door as if he might swagger in and grin at me with his new fangs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Verusha helped me into an embroidered chemise and sat me gently on a stool before the vanity mirror, picking up a brush and running it through my wet curls. My hair was drying lighter than it had been, much of the dye having swirled out of the tub along with the bludmilk and water. It wasn\u2019t back to ice-white yet, more of a warm gold. But it was enough. I smiled as she arranged my curls, stabbing silver pins in to hold it tightly in place.</p><p>\u201cYou are bothered, little lemming. Verusha can tell. Do you worry that you will not best Ravenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d I looked up into the mirror, pulling back my lips to show sharp teeth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, then? Your parents? Or Alex?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cMy parents are gone. I can handle Alex. And I have plans for the king of Sveden as well.\u201d</p><p>She threw her head back and laughed, bosom heaving. \u201cYou are my same little princess, all teeth and pride. And yet something is changed. Have you recovered fully from your draining? Do you feel weak or muddled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuddled perhaps.\u201d I paused meaningfully, meeting her dark eyes in the mirror. She had always known whatever troubled me, even the things I didn\u2019t know myself. I had to hope that she could offer guidance now, when I needed it most and could speak it least.</p><p>\u201cDid you know they had planned to marry you off to a Svedish prince?\u201d she said blandly, and I flinched. \u201cIt\u2019s true, darleenk. The papers were almost drawn up when you disappeared. At first, they thought you had run away, but a Pinky in the stables swore a blood oath that he saw you snatched by terrifying figures in bear cloaks, stolen away into the woods behind the castle. That little one from the kitchen, with the black hair, you recall.\u201d I shuddered. In the back of my throat, I could still taste his blood and my own childish terror and shame. \u201cIn any case, when they realized Olgha had also been taken, the betrothal papers were lost. Your parents were executed. And then the rumors began that you had killed your own sister. But I knew they were false.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy Sveden?\u201d I asked, once I had found my voice. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing Charles wanted to cement an alliance, and he has so many bastards littering the palace that it made sense. That man\u2014he is insatiable, they say. After you disappeared, once he couldn\u2019t use you for his own ends, he swore you an enemy. Assassins waiting everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s one fewer now.\u201d</p><p>She patted my head. \u201cAnd your mother was hot for the union, of course. It has been many years since the Feodors had outside blud. Some have said your father . . . is not the hot-bludded sort. He always preferred the hunt to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more of your mother in you, of course. You may not take after her in looks, but your heart, many have said, beats with the glacier\u2019s heart of Freesia. An ice princess, a throwback to better times. The winters have been uneasy these past few years. Many of the people say the dance and the music have not been up to expectation, a proper offering to Aztarte and Hades. There are shrines to you in secret places, snowdrops and white roses and little cups of blud mixed with milk and pomegranate seeds and, of course, the tears. Some are calling you Proserpina, saying you\u2019re waiting in the darkness to lead us back into a proper winter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe rabble are fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rabble are your reason for existing, darleenk. They are the earth that supports your feet.\u201d</p><p>My hair was twisted back in braids and pin curls in a way that led the eye down my cheekbones to my lips, which she\u2019d painted the traditional bright red. With dark kohl and glittering silver around my eyes, my face was foreign to me. In bright light, clean and fresh and no longer framed by dirt-colored waves, I saw a living doll, a creature of lines and curves fashioned of frozen milk, with eyes the color of aquamarines. I blinked, and the face blinked back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame you must hide.\u201d</p><p>Before I could ask her what she meant, what she knew, she held a porcelain mask over my face, hiding everything but eyes and lips. It was white and silver, a stylized peacock\u2019s face, the nose a dainty beak. White plumes erupted from the top. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of the peacocks at the Ice Palace, calling to one another with the sound of dying children. Although the wild peacocks were rarely seen without unicorns, the birds of the palace were proud things fed blood from dishes of hammered silver. The ruling family of birds were all white, and their more colorful brethren bowed to them or hung limply from sharp beaks. It was fitting, this mask, and I wondered how she would dress Casper to walk beside me.</p><p>Verusha held out a hand, and I stood, waiting. First, she brought layers of petticoats, filmy with lace. Then dancing slippers. Then the corset from Kitty\u2019s shop, and I took a few last deep breaths before my old maid worked her magic with the laces. The dress wasn\u2019t as heavy as I remembered, or maybe I was stronger. I stepped into it, and Verusha helped lift it onto my shoulders. The thick silk skimmed my curves and clung in all the right places, the deeply cut neck perfectly accenting flesh that had bloomed in four years of maturity and a week of good feeding.</p><p>Standing before the full-length mirror beside a very smug groomer, I did indeed look like some magical, mythical bird goddess. When I cocked my head to the side, the illusion was complete. My only sadness was that the matching necklace was destroyed, a plain twist of metal with a few lone stones still winking from tarnished silver.</p><p>My painted nails brushed my collarbone, and Verusha nodded sadly in understanding. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t take it, anyway, my sweet. Too recognizable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the dress isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThe peacock has changed its spots, darleenk. They will think it a clever forgery. They will laugh before you destroy them.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my hand and wished for some occupation, something to do besides be beautiful and wait and worry. The carriage ride was starting to feel more terrifying than the ascent to the Maybuck had been, but there was no hope of throwing myself onto the ground and begging someone to sit on me. From here on out, my chin was up, my eyes were open, and my claws were clenched to fight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I said, more to myself than anyone else.</p><p>Verusha nodded, her eyes narrowing to slits. \u201cGood girl. If anyone can triumph, my darleenk, my princess, it is you. And if you go to Hades, take that gypsy cur with you, yes? For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rip her throat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Blud in the first snow is a happy omen. Aztarte will be pleased.\u201d</p><p>I turned back, stalling. \u201cDo you actually believe in her, Verusha?\u201d</p><p>Her wizened hand went to a pendant that disappeared into her cleavage. I knew well enough that it held a tiny splinter of bone, supposedly from Aztarte, the Bludman\u2019s goddess. I had never really believed in her, at least as a divine ruler. Not any more than I believed in Proserpina and Hades and all the old pagan relics that predated the monarchy at the heart of Freesia. We were supposedly descended from Aztarte herself, although there hadn\u2019t been red hair in the royal family in ten generations. The ferocity was telling enough, they said.</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t believe, my girl, I would never be foolish enough to admit it out loud.\u201d</p><p>Weighed down as I was by the mask, I couldn\u2019t throw back my head. But I did laugh, my lips pressing against the cold porcelain.</p><p>\u201cYou have always been wise,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat is why I am still alive\u2014diplomacy and the ability to keep secrets.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cAlso, I am good with hair.\u201d</p><p>My hand was glued to the doorknob, the scales dark against the bright brass. And yet I couldn\u2019t turn it.</p><p>\u201cVerusha. Can I do this?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t, no one else can. No one else will. And Freesia will fade into legend, as forgotten as melted snow.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe her. I wanted to believe I could do it. But in that moment, in all my finery, I couldn\u2019t even open the door.</p><p>\u201cThe first step is always the hardest,\u201d Verusha said with a slightly impish grin. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Ravenna who worries you now. Go to him, darleenk.\u201d</p><p>She reached past me to turn the knob, and the door swung open.</p><p>34</p><p>Casper was waiting for me in the parlor, just as I knew he would be. But the former man looked like a god, and I was thrown off kilter by the look in his eyes as he regarded me in turn.</p><p>Verusha had done her work well, kitting him out as the peacock to my hen. His tailcoat was a brilliant teal, shimmering with embroidered feathers. A hint of gold brocade waistcoat and snowy jabot peeked out, making me wish to flick the heavy buttons and see what else lay beneath. His breeches were molded to his body in a most beguiling way, his boots high and shiny.</p><p>But his face, to me, was even more beautiful than his costume. He looked the part of a royal Bludman, his face shaved smooth and his eyes outlined in kohl as was the Freesian tradition, dating back to a time when hunters cut down on the snow glare by rubbing ashes under their eyes. It made the blue pop, bright as sapphires and snapping like flame on a windy day. His hair was down, framing sharper features with a golden glow. There was something exotic and rare about him, something different. Perhaps it was his hands, which were finally dark, as a Bludman\u2019s should be. Or perhaps it was the way he was looking at me, like I was the most edible thing in the city.</p><p>He knew how good he looked; I could read it in his proud posture and cocky grin. I subtly shifted, angling out a hip, unable to resist responding to the signals he sent. When I had first met him, he\u2019d given off an air of suicidal amusement, a drunkard\u2019s bravado mixed with a thinking man\u2019s awareness of inescapable doom. There had always been a bit of intriguing madness about him, an insidious consequence of his blud habit.</p><p>But now I realized that all the versions of Casper I\u2019d seen before had been incomplete, shades of who he truly was. This creature before me, this fine predator of such proud bearing\u2014this was who he was meant to be. And I wondered what he saw in me now. Was I a Bludwoman in her prime, a queen ready to fight cunningly and viciously for her bludright? Or was I still the lost princess, a little girl with kitten teeth playing dress-up and hiding behind the safety of a mask? It was damned uncomfortable, not knowing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So instead of asking him, I made the decision myself. I drew up taller, raised my chin, took a slinky step closer to him, and said, \u201cMaestro, where is your mask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d He smirked, beautifully.</p><p>Verusha rushed forward to hand him a half-mask with a pointed beak over the nose, muttering, \u201cDo you know how hard it is to find such things the day before the ball? Ah, but you two make a troublesome pair. Old Verusha will be glad to see the backs of you, that is certain.\u201d</p> <p>He tied the mask on and turned back to me, and I was startled anew by his eyes. Their blue was lighter than the shimmering indigo of the mask, and with the black kohl, he was otherworldly. We regarded each other, bird to bird, solemn and silent. I ached to kiss him, but it was impossible. Both in front of Verusha and with two beaks in the way. The only problem with looking so mutually ravishing was that we couldn\u2019t do a damned thing about it.</p><p>\u201cUngrateful creatures,\u201d Verusha muttered, dusting his coat off in a way that was transparently all about getting her hands on his rump. \u201cNot a single thank you. Not a word about how lovely anyone looks. What is the world coming to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, madam,\u201d Casper said, tossing out the tails of his coat and cutting a grand bow. His hair slid down around his mask, and Verusha simpered like a girl when he kissed her hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of you, my little ermine pup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueens don\u2019t thank their servants,\u201d I said, my voice frosty.</p> <p>She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. \u201cI have never been prouder, my Ahnastasia. You are everything I ever hoped you would be. The day you thank me is the day I will stop serving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the strangest old woman I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Casper said, and she swatted him in faux annoyance.</p><p>\u201cA queen does not thank servants, boy. You have much to learn about a world that runs on blood. You must teach him, darleenk. In the carriage. He cannot go thanking the servants at the ball, or they\u2019ll know him for what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, exactly, am I? An abomination?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at him impishly. \u201cA secret weapon. Your senses will be just a little sharper, your vision just a little clearer. As if nature knows you need advantages as you adjust. You will help my Ahnastasia take what is hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a bumbling old fool, you haven\u2019t utterly failed,\u201d I said, and Verusha beamed with pride.</p> <p>\u201cThe carriage is waiting, and time is short. You know the rest. Now go, my dear. Save us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have fun?\u201d Casper added.</p><p>\u201cHarrumph. Fun is for later, once the snow falls on Ravenna\u2019s corpse,\u201d Verusha said.</p><p>\u201cThe fun begins once I\u2019m Tsarina.\u201d</p><p>I laid a careful hand along Casper\u2019s arm, and Verusha followed us to the front door of the shop. Two white bludmares danced in place outside, red froth dripping from their mouths where the harsh bits cut into their lips, giving them wicked smiles. A footman opened the carriage door for us, and Casper helped me up.</p><p>I let down the curtains and removed my mask, grateful finally to feel air on my face. Verusha had done well with the carriage. It wasn\u2019t so large or so small that it would draw attention, nor was it the newest or the oldest. It had been recently painted outside, with bright blue appointments and gilt where gilt should be. And the comfortable and roomy interior could have easily fit four people. I tried to settle my dress under me comfortably, but it seemed an impossible task. No matter where I put my weight, the tiny beads dug into my flesh. I remembered now that I had sat on the fluffiest of down pillows for the painting in the museum. Sugar Snow Ball dresses were for dancing, not sitting.</p><p>Across from me on an identical cushion, Casper fidgeted and leaned, likewise uncomfortable. Living at the palace, I had never considered the misfortune of the city barons riding to the ball in what should have been grand comfort. It was but a short walk from the palace, through the field and into the forest and the ancient clearing where snow fell but didn\u2019t stick. I attended my first dance at age sixteen and had never once sat down in one of the specially made gowns, nor had I felt the heels of my dancing slippers catch in the carpet of a carriage.</p><p>Remembering my responsibilities and suddenly aware of the press of time, I rapped on the plush ceiling. Outside, leather reins slapped against curried flanks, and the bludmares screamed and leaped into a run. Casper lurched out of his seat and barely missed landing on me.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d He settled back onto the bench, hands clutching the velvet, and I laughed.</p><p>I\u2019d heard that long ago, the horses had been as benign and harmless as Pinkies, great prey animals that could be coaxed into various gaits besides balk and gallop. Now every Bludman grew up knowing that carriages started with a jerk, and there were even handles built into the walls for those who needed extra bolstering. Verusha had been right; Casper did indeed have a lot to learn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be twisty in the city, so you might want to hold on.\u201d I pointed to the handle. \u201cBut once we\u2019re on the road to the palace, things will be rather boring for a while. It takes several hours, and we may be hampered by other carriages and various mishaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMishaps?\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand and leaned with the carriage as we went around a corner. \u201cBroken axles, mired wheels, raging horses, random bears. The usual.\u201d</p><p>With a huff of annoyance, he took off his fine jacket and folded it, showing the brilliant gold within that very nearly matched his hair. I was just about to point out the hook on the wall when he hung the jacket neatly from it and slumped down into the seat, his waistcoat rumpling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the hang of it,\u201d he said peevishly, sitting up again to pull back the curtain and look out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rather twitchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBludmen aren\u2019t, generally.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, and I smiled with great calm, letting the carriage sway me and generally exhibiting the smug grace and tranquility of a sated predator.</p><p>I expected his usual saucy, dimpled riposte. Instead, he put his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t stop worrying about Keen. Like maybe if I stare out the window at just the right time, I\u2019ll see her dart by. Or maybe she\u2019s riding on the roof of the carriage, playing at being a stowaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe footmen would truss her up for a snack,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. She\u2019s got this fantastic survival instinct. She managed okay in our world, and she was scraping by in London. But in Muscovy . . .\u201d He heaved a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cI never got to explain it to her, how I didn\u2019t know what the bludwine would do until it was too late. I was so afraid to disappoint her. It was bad enough that she thought I was a drunk womanizer, and maybe I was. But I kept her safe, at least. And she deserves an explanation. She deserves to hear me say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and met his eyes. He was looking for forgiveness, but he\u2019d come to the wrong person. \u201cNever be sorry.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and stared at me, half angry and half curious. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I considered him. He was slumped over, dark hands running through his hair with a very un-Bludman sort of melancholy. It was time for his lessons to begin. \u201cHere is the heart of it, Casper. I\u2019m sorry that she chose to run away instead of listening to sense, and I\u2019m sorry that she didn\u2019t come back so that you would rest easier. But that\u2019s all I\u2019m sorry for. You can apologize for how things happened. You can apologize for how she feels. But you should never apologize for being what you are. At the core of you, in your secret heart, you are an animal. Feelings will not change what is. Do not contradict what you are.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled ruefully, fell to his side, and rolled over onto his back, lying on the long bench with his hair falling over the edge. But he didn\u2019t see me; he was looking beyond, fighting with himself.</p><p>Finally, he exhaled.</p><p>\u201cDo I contradict myself? Fine. Then I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\u201d And then he burst out laughing, one fist beating the side of the bench as if it were the funniest thing he\u2019d ever heard. \u201cDamn, woman. The things you drag out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious. I think perhaps you misunderstand\u2014\u201d I started, but he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps I\u2019m finally starting to understand. The thing is, you\u2019ve only ever been one thing. You might have pretended to be human for a while on that airship, but you didn\u2019t really know how, and you didn\u2019t really try to understand. But I\u2019ve been a lot of things, and I\u2019m on my third life now, and I\u2019m starting to realize that the rules are different for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules of Bludmen are unyielding.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close, intent and sharp. \u201cYou keep saying that, but you keep forgetting you\u2019re about to be the queen of the goddamn Bludmen. Doesn\u2019t the queen make the unyielding rules? Isn\u2019t that the whole point of having a queen?\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open, and my mind spun. In all my wisdom and ferocity, I\u2019d never stopped to consider that once Ravenna was dead, I would have complete control\u2014in all things. I had been so worried that someone would smell my blud in Casper\u2019s veins or disgrace me for keeping a commoner close at hand that it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I could elevate him myself. I could give him land, make him a baron, or spin a tale of his mysterious beginnings. Just as I was what I had made of myself on this journey, he could also be whatever I wished him to be.</p><p>The people couldn\u2019t stop me if they tried.</p><p>My parents and tutors had raised me to believe that our family had been chosen by the gods, by Aztarte herself, to rule. They had raised me to be bloodthirsty, proud, and intractable. They had promised to keep me safe, and they had failed. I was alive only because Casper had saved me, again and again. He had, in effect, become my family.</p><p>From that moment on, I refused to worry further about being accepted by my own people. In bludding Casper, I had given myself more than a servant or a companion. I had given myself an equal and a partner. Whatever he had been when he was born and when he had found me, the blud of Freesian royalty now flowed in his veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallowed, on the verge of a great understanding. \u201cCasper, your book. The poem. What is it called again?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Leaves of Grass\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the other thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Song of Myself\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Just a chuckle at first, but it built to a crescendo. He watched me, charmed and amused but confused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. \u2018Song of Myself.\u2019 I write my own song. The words, and the music. We all do. Every one of us. Bludmen and Pinkies. And I will write the rules.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhatever satisfies the soul is truth.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and wiped my eyes. \u201cIn philosophy, perhaps. But we have to best Ravenna before I can start writing that song. Until she\u2019s gone, your truth will get you staked and drained amid laughter and the trills of a harpsichord, and then all our dreams are lost. You\u2019ll have to learn the rules and play by them tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me your rules, then, darlin\u2019, and I\u2019ll see if I want to play.\u201d</p><p>I sat back to consider him, the beads and buttons digging into my shoulders. How to distill thousands of years of heritage into one lecture?</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, Bludmen of the court are rarely silly. You must give no one any reason to single you out, to bait you, or to fight you. Think of a pack of hunting dogs or a pack of wolves. With posture and words, the men will jockey for position in the pack. They may try to goad you away, but don\u2019t rise to it. I need you at my back. Strong, silent, serious. That\u2019s what you must be until the deed is done. After that, be as loose of limits and artificial lines as you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to follow you around with a pen and paper and just write down every word you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Stop staring at me like I\u2019m edible. This is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s poetry.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at him and went on. \u201cDon\u2019t take off your mask, even if someone tells you to. And most important of all, once the Dance of the Sugar Snow has started, don\u2019t stop dancing for any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more important than killing Ravenna? A dance?\u201d</p><p>I pinched the bridge of my nose. \u201cThis is not just a ball. This is a holy rite of the goddess Aztarte, a ritual that ensures the prosperity of the blud monarchy of Freesia. The playing of the music and the grace of the dancers will determine the course of the next year. Should the musicians\u2019 fingers stutter or the dancers stumble, the snow might not fall. At the very, very least, word would spread that something had gone amiss, and the people of the city would begin to search for faults in their world. Verusha told us that the snow had not fallen heavily last year, and that means that the people are already suspecting that something is wrong in the palace. In the 1700s, two couples collided and knocked over a punch bowl of bludwine. That summer, there was a drought, and the crops wilted, and the Pinkies died, and blood became scarce. The people of Muscovy rioted outside the summer palace, dragged out the Tsarina, and disemboweled her in the square to appease the goddess. This dance is very, very serious.\u201d</p><p>Casper sat up, his playfulness fled, and thank heavens. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that when you offered me the job of court composer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, that if you didn\u2019t play perfectly once a year, you\u2019d be drained into the fountain? Oops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and shifted uncomfortably in my dress. \u201cTo be quite honest, I didn\u2019t think we would make it this far. It was the sort of dream that starts optimistic, far off and beautiful. I also thought that I would eventually lose patience and murder you in your bed.\u201d</p><p>He flicked the hair out of his face, and when his eyes met mine, something in my middle flipped sweetly. \u201cIt\u2019s endearing how often you threaten to kill me. That\u2019s practically flirting to you, isn\u2019t it, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>I leaned closer, wiggling just a little and lowering my lashes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll threaten anyone. But I only bite the pretty boys.\u201d</p><p>There suddenly wasn\u2019t enough air in the carriage, and I knew before he had even moved that he was going to attack me in the loveliest way. I jerked back out of reach.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kiss me. You can\u2019t touch me. I have to look perfect.\u201d</p><p>He hissed for the first time, long and low, shifting in his seat. \u201cOnly from the neck up,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut my dress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t necessary for what I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>35</p><p>\u201cCasper\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Something inside me thrilled to hear him say it, to hear him taking control, using his power. He was giving off heat and heaven only knows what else, and the beast inside me wanted to roll naked at his feet, belly up and arms stretched over head, begging for his mouth. I wanted to make myself open and pliant for him, let him take me over with the fury of a storm.</p><p>And I realized that he was right. No one would see the vast territories of flesh that stayed hidden under my heavy dress. We had at least two hours of privacy. Before I knew it, I had my back to him, my fingers digging into the top of the bench as he carefully but quickly undid the row of buttons down my back.</p><p>I turned my head and met the hungry fire of his eyes over my shoulder. He looked down at my mouth, his intention clear.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t muss my lipstick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held me, stealing my breath. Ever so slowly, I opened my mouth. With one hand on the smooth plane of my back just above my corset, he leaned closer. His tongue darted in to caress mine, sweet and wet and hot, and it was all I could do to stay still. Part of me wanted to attack him, to drive him back into the cushioned bench. But my beast knew who held the power, who was in charge. I squirmed in place, wishing to press against him, begging him to press against me. But instead of answering my unspoken plea, he said, \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the dress carefully down over my arms and slipped them one by one from under the long, heavy sleeves.</p><p>I stood, bent over awkwardly, and he sat back like a king and watched me step out of the dress, the fabric whispering as it slid to the carriage floor. I folded it reverently and draped it across the other bench. Before I could shift to a more attractive and comfortable position, his hands grasped the waist of my corset and dragged me to my knees. I gasped as he buried his mouth in the cleft between my breasts, his teeth scraping lightly as if he still wasn\u2019t accustomed to their sharpness. He settled me between his knees, and I ran my hands up the hard planes of his thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to rumple your waistcoat,\u201d I whispered breathily in his ear.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he growled into my skin.</p><p>His tongue found my nipple with a searing heat, lapping hungrily under the edge of my corset. I moaned into his hair and ran my hands up the taut suede of his thighs. Careful not to muss my lipstick, I licked the edge of his ear, slow and breathy, until he shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about enough out of you, princess.\u201d</p><p>He moved faster than I had expected, catching my wrists and transferring them both into one hand. I caught my breath, feeling dainty and exposed and highly anticipating what he would do next, with me completely in his power. It was highly erotic, not being the most dangerous creature in the very small room. When he snatched a twisted silk tassel from the curtains, I smiled, slow and sweet, and tugged experimentally at my wrists. It was gratifying, the strength of his grip.</p><p>\u201cFront or back?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo with me what you will,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He held my captured wrists against my back and nibbled my neck as he tied them together with the rope and tested the knot. I could feel the tassels hanging lower, dusting my ankles where they peeked out from the long petticoats. I entwined my fingers and gave myself up to him completely.</p><p>He slipped off the bench and behind me, his knees just outside mine and his hips pressed urgently against me.</p><p>\u201cBend over,\u201d he said in my ear, and I turned my face and set my cheek against the satin cushion of the bench. A little shiver ran over me, followed by his hands. He started at the nape of my neck, raising the hairs along my spine as he brushed down my shoulders, down the sides of my corset, down my hips, feeling the curves of me like a painter sketching. One finger slipped under the edge of my corset, tracing a line across my hips. I caught my breath as he tugged down my petticoats, just enough to run his tongue along the strip of revealed skin and make me moan. With another savage tug, the layers of ruffles fell to the ground around my knees, and his breeches pressed up against the skin of my rump. Hot and wanting and wet, I pressed back, ready for more.</p><p>I had just started to rub against him when he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d I started.</p><p>He smacked my bottom lightly, making me gasp. \u201cHush. I\u2019ve been told not to ruin my costume.\u201d</p><p>Buttons hurriedly whispered through fabric, and then he pressed against me, skin to skin. With my hands bound and my face against the cushion, I had never been so vulnerable in my entire life, at least not while I was awake and outside the suitcase. I was very well aware that he could do anything to me, hurt me in a thousand ways only a Bludman could devise, or take me in a hundred ways that a man could imagine. It only made me want him all the more, and I bit my lip to hold in a whimper.</p><p>Hot and hard, he pressed against the cleft of me, testing, rubbing. I wiggled shamelessly, aching for more, and he pulled away and slapped my rump again, a little harder this time, making me squeal.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how long I\u2019ve wanted to rule you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cSince the beginning. Since I tasted your blud. It was the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hid it well.\u201d He smacked me again, the sting heating my skin and making me bite my painted lip. My entire body was alive, alert, thrilling, tingling. I arched my spine, reaching for him, opening for him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t truly see me until now, Ahnastasia. I was just prey before. But I\u2019m beginning to understand. The need to dominate. I never did before, but now . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow you have teeth.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over my back, his lips warm against my ear. \u201cYou may be a princess, but you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>My insides quivered, a flare of heat below where a finger dipped in to tease me. I could barely breathe. I was helpless against my body, against my senses, against the knowledge that the mad human had become an alpha Bludman commanding physical strength and power that I couldn\u2019t possess. My beast purred for him, longed to touch him, stroke him, hold him close. I flexed my hands and tested the rope, but it was tied tightly. Seeing me struggle, he chuckled low, pressed his finger lazily in and out as I strained to meet him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trapped, darlin\u2019. I can do any damn thing I want to you.\u201d</p><p>His teeth dragged across the nape of my neck, and I shivered. He bit down just a little, just enough to make me pant and gnash my teeth, too.</p><p>His lips brushing my spine, he muttered, \u201cI could snap your neck if I wanted to. I could rip you to pretty ribbons. You\u2019re still the best thing I\u2019ve ever tasted, you know.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away, and I quivered, waiting, knowing, until he dragged his tongue up my cleft, deep and slow, just to prove he could.</p><p>In response, I whimpered and struggled for more. He straightened and chuckled his mastery, and I backed up to press my rump more firmly against the hard ridge of him, nothing left of me but a beggar, a beast. I wanted it, so badly. And everything he\u2019d said was true. No matter what happened at the ball, no matter what happened tomorrow, at that moment, we were nothing more than animals, and I was completely in his power, and it was exquisite.</p> <p>He grabbed my hips, pulling me hard against him with a grunt. I shoved forward a little on the bench, but he pulled me back again. As the carriage rattled along the mostly smooth road, a gentle swaying friction moved between us, a subtle rumble that added to the tension. We were always moving. I panted, unquiet and yearning, knowing what a fine line I rode between the ferocity and hunger of the heart and flesh.</p><p>One hand caught my neck, my skin still wet from his teeth. I arched my back and spread my legs further, unembarrassed by my eagerness. He rubbed against me, teasing me, nudging me gently open, out and in just the littlest bit, holding back, holding me in place with the beginnings of claws on my nape. But he didn\u2019t fully take me, not yet. I wanted so much more, and I whimpered and tried to toss my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, princess?\u201d His voice was dark and heavy, commanding. He withdrew, and I ached for more.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Ahnastasia. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cTake me now. Do it, Casper.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled and nudged me again, just the tip pushing in, hot and sweet. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to give in so easily, darlin\u2019. I wanted to torture you for a while, like you\u2019ve been torturing me all along. I want to make you ache like your heart\u2019s going to burst in your chest. I want to be the only thing in the goddamn world for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. It does. Oh, goddess, just claim what\u2019s yours!\u201d I thrashed and pulled against the ropes on my wrists, and he pulled back. \u201cCasper!\u201d I growled, and in answer, he grabbed my hips with both hands and plunged in, hard and sure.</p><p>I felt him so deep, sliding in and out with a furious pounding that matched my heart. There was something exquisite about my helplessness, about being the object, the lesser of the beasts. I was hot and slippery, and he struck some place deep inside that felt sweeter than blood, sweeter than anything else I\u2019d ever known. I wanted to move with him, to grasp and grapple and growl, but all I could do was turn my cheek to the cushion and take what he gave me.</p><p>With every thrust, my breasts pressed into the bench, the velvet raking my hard nipples, making each breath a gasp. When Casper grasped my corset strings and pulled them tighter, I went dizzy for a moment, my eyes rolling up and stars dancing in my vision. I reeled from the pull, the push, his thrusting, the velvet, the wheels grinding below us. I felt like a bludmare running away with the reins pulled taut by a masterly rider.</p><p>I turned my head to the other side, and the glittering fall of my dress filled my vision. I was lightheaded, furious, hungry, dizzy, pulsing with sweetness inside, and building again to that same tumultuous crescendo we had found the last time. For a moment, my eyes saw beyond to a snow-covered hill glittering in the moonlight, and I imagined Casper by my side, taking me on the blood altar in the clearing, the most ancient and primal rite of my people and the way it was said the strongest Tsarinas were spawned. For the space of a few frantic heartbeats, I smelled victory, the sugar snow falling like stars, cold and sparkling against the velvet darkness, and then I was there, hot and wet and desperate, taken over with the sweetness, thrumming deep inside, crying out, pulsing in time with Casper\u2019s ferocious thrusts as I shuddered beneath him.</p><p>His hand clutched my wrists where they lay limp, pressing them possessively and intimately into my back as he growled and bucked along with my release. When he finally exhaled and fell across me, I was breathing deep, heavy, and slow, my eyes glazed over as I tried to float back to earth. I felt sated and limp and tranquil. And he was damned heavy.</p><p>\u201cLet me get that for you,\u201d he said, and I sighed as he untied the knot and freed my hands.</p><p>I sat up on my knees, still reeling, and flexed the feeling back into my fingers. With a shy smile, he handed me a fine handkerchief that matched his coat, and I felt only a little guilty as I cleaned myself off and let it flutter out the carriage window. My necklace had bought it, after all.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need help with your dress?\u201d I turned to look at him. He sat on the opposite bench, his pants back to rights. It was a little fascinating, how he was an entirely different creature from what he had been a few short moments ago. The tenderness and humor had returned to his eyes, the dimples back in his smile. He was still powerful and confident\u2014that would never go away. But there was just something lazy and calm about a sated hunter. One can\u2019t hold on to the ferocity forever. I slipped my petticoats on and settled back into the cushion to put my feet in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care to put it on yet.\u201d I stretched as far as the carriage would allow. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? There\u2019s time enough.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, one hand on my ankle. \u201cI like the way you think, sugarplum.\u201d</p><p>I grinned lazily and looked down, and that\u2019s when I noticed that my white corset was covered all over in black smears. I found similar stains on my wrists and hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip and tried really hard not to laugh, and I felt my first rumble of anger.</p><p>\u201cIt was Verusha\u2019s idea. She said my hands weren\u2019t dark enough, that someone might notice. So she rubbed ink into them. And I guess, with the sweat, it . . . rubbed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInk. I\u2019m on the way to the Sugar Snow Ball covered in ink?\u201d</p><p>He covered a snort of laughter, badly, in a cough. \u201cIsn\u2019t there some way to clean it off? I don\u2019t have another handkerchief. Maybe some snow?\u201d</p><p>I shook his hand off my foot and gave him a halfhearted kick. \u201cIdiot. There\u2019s no snow. The first snow comes tonight. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d I spat on my finger and rubbed at the stains that might actually show, the ones on my wrists. \u201cInk on your hands. Ink that will rub off. Fools. This is too important to mess up. This is\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught my wrist. I hissed and tried to yank it away, but his grip was stronger than I remembered. His voice was soft and deadly. \u201cI may not have you tied up and whimpering, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m your subject, princess.\u201d</p><p>I went still all over. I had to. Damn him.</p><p>I swallowed hard and snatched my hand away, but we both knew it was only because he let me. We glared at each other, the air still between us, the crunching of stones under the carriage wheels the only sound. I rubbed my wrist and narrowed my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning into a damned fine Bludman,\u201d I finally said.</p><p>He grinned again, ruining the image. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good teacher,\u201d he said.</p><p>36</p><p>The next time I pulled back the carriage\u2019s curtain, I was surprised to see that it was dark and we were nearly to our destination. It was odd, how it seemed as if we\u2019d been riding together forever, but also as if we\u2019d had only a few stolen minutes. The forest was the last step of the journey. We\u2019d be there soon, provided nothing tragic happened. There was a carriage ahead of us and another behind, so at least we would arrive in a crowd. The less we stood out, the better. Which meant, I supposed, that I needed to put on my dress.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost time.\u201d I checked my wrists for more of his damnable ink and started hitching up my dress to step in. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch your coat. Do you know any magic?\u201d</p><p>He wiggled his black-streaked hands. \u201cOnly with the piano and your body.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes as I stepped into my gown and gently pulled it over my arms. The long sleeves would cover most of his mess, thank heavens. I tried to think about what I remembered of the Sugar Snow Ball, of the accommodations made for the city guests. There would have to be toilets, of course, and someplace with mirrors and water. I also knew that there was a way for couples to disappear discreetly, so at least we would have excuses if our behavior was strange or conspiratorial. Still . . .</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something about your hands.\u201d I wiggled in my dress, unable to reach the tiny buttons running up my spine. \u201cAnd quickly.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, a perfect merging of his old recklessness and his new self-possessed smugness. \u201cI took a lesson from my old rival and stocked my waistcoat.\u201d Barely brushing the fabric, he pulled a bit of cloth from the pocket of his vest, a pair of black kid gloves that I remembered from his room at the Seven Scars. \u201cI hate the damn things, but at least they\u2019re the right color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to keep your hands hidden, then. A country rube in gloves is better than an abomination with dirty hands.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his eyes searing me. \u201cI\u2019m not an abomination. I\u2019m a Bludman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I inclined my head. \u201cJust so.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on the gloves, and I turned my back to him. With a minimum of fumbling, he buttoned up my dress, ending with a searing kiss on the nape of my neck. And it was a good thing, too, as the carriage jolted to a stop, knocking us both over. Casper pulled on his peacock jacket as the bludmares outside screamed in greeting and challenge, their calls answered from nearby rivals. Peeking past the curtains, I was met with the curious face of an unfamiliar girl just a few feet away, leaning out her own lamplit carriage window. With a gasp, she popped back behind her curtain. It had to be her first ball, and I smiled to myself, remembering how excited I had been finally to see what it was that made the adults\u2019 eyes twinkle every year when the air began to turn cold and smell like excitement.</p><p>\u201cYour mask,\u201d Casper said, and I growled to myself for being so foolish. I hoped the girl was too young to be as obsessed with my family as the old Muscovy barons had been. I slipped the cool porcelain back over my face and adjusted the feathers above. My best strategy was not to take it off again until I needed my teeth for murder.</p> <p>Before I could likewise remind Casper, he hissed. He reached beyond me, his arm brushing the heavy beading of my dress with the sound of rustling leaves as he held out his own peacock mask, broken into three pieces.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t yell at me,\u201d he said with a rueful chuckle. \u201cAfter all, you were on this bench, so it\u2019s your fault, not mine.\u201d</p><p>With a finger under his chin, I turned his head this way and that. \u201cDo you look different now to yourself?\u201d I asked. \u201cWould someone remember your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell. I stopped looking about a year ago. Every time I did, I saw a new person there whom I hated with various levels of regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now? Do you hate yourself now?\u201d</p> <p>He shook my finger off, pretending to snap at it. \u201cNope. Feels good. Do I look different to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways and never the same. I would know better if I\u2019d been awake for the last four years.\u201d</p><p>The pieces of ceramic dropped from his gloved hands, and my fingers roved to my own mask, feeling the impersonal smoothness. I had never been one to hide, and I almost envied him his sudden but unwelcome freedom. It was unheard of to arrive at the Sugar Snow Ball without a mask, even if some of the revelers favored dainty lace strips or modified eye patches. We would have to find something before he made a fool of himself or was refused entry.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, my lady! Will you descend?\u201d</p><p>The voice from outside startled us, and in a fit of inspiration, I said, \u201cQuick. Rub the ink over your eyes where a mask would go. It will have to do. You can\u2019t be seen with your face fully bare. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>He took off his gloves, licked his fingers, and grimaced at the taste. Rubbing across his temples, over his eyes, and over the top of his nose produced a raw, primitive mask shape in dark hunter green. It made his blue eyes pop, brighter, wilder, and more shadowy than ever.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I fought the urge to kiss him again and unlocked the carriage door. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to do,\u201d I said.</p><p>It was easy enough to blend in with the crowd that strolled leisurely down the paved path and into the shadow of the Ice Forest. The women rustled like birds, their dresses reflecting the shining lanterns and moonlight in startling shimmers that left spots dancing in my eyes. The men were likewise resplendent, if more tame, their waistcoats and cravats shouting with color from staid jackets and breeches of chocolate, navy, and olive. Casper was one of a few dandies, outshone in brightness and glitter only by a tall, thin pair of gentlemen with dashing tailcoats and carefully tended facial hair under their half-masks. I recognized them from past balls, as they were much-celebrated dancers and fashion trend-setters in the city. Feeling their black-painted eyes on me, I turned my mask to Casper, clutching his arm harder than I meant to. It was a credit to him that he didn\u2019t complain.</p><p>I had never walked this walk, had never heard the women chatting and gossiping about last year\u2019s ball and how Ravenna\u2019s gown had taken half a year to embroider. If the whispers were correct, Ravenna\u2019s mask had been tatted from a unicorn\u2019s tail hairs, and my brother, Alex, was well enough to attend, which had never happened during my time in the palace. Casper tried to speak to me, but I shushed him and tried not to breathe. Every word I heard was another weapon in my arsenal, another tiny talon to take down my prey. These bright creatures would know things the papers did not.</p><p>The forest closed overhead, the ancient trees climbing as tall as the basilica in the city where we\u2019d kissed yesterday, back when things had been easy and before we had lost Keen. The way Casper was scanning the crowd, I could tell he was thinking about her, too. As if maybe she was still trailing us, as she always had, skulking in the shadows and waiting to accost us with her strange accent and odder words. But had she been there, we would have smelled her, as every other Bludman would have. The girl would have been a moment\u2019s work to drain as fortification before the party, much as the gentlemen on the Maybuck had taken a shot of whiskey before claiming their women.</p><p>The night was even darker under the canopy of boughs. Lanterns hung from the trees, providing an ethereal, bobbing light that reminded me of childhood fairy tales. Some of them were pierced tin, some paper globes, some little braziers on chains. There were even a few Moravian stars that made me smile to myself, thinking of my time with Casper in the inn. I would never look at a glowing star the same way again. He squeezed my arm, and I realized that we shared that memory, that it might possibly mean as much to him as it did to me. It had been his rebirth, sure. But it had changed me, too, which I came to realize more and more. As if in taking in so much of his blood, I had taken in part of his humanity. My lack of fury at being an object of change was itself telling. His smile told me that perhaps he didn\u2019t regret it so much as he had before.</p><p>Ahead, the trail forked, the ladies taking the lefthand route and the gentlemen carrying on to the right. I had only a moment to glance desperately at Casper before we were forced apart around a stone fountain bubbling with blood-tinged champagne. I was caught in a group of about twenty other ladies, but it felt twice as crowded because of the giant bell-like skirts that were fashionable just then. I didn\u2019t see another dress in the clingy fishtail style I wore. Even if they didn\u2019t recognize me immediately, they would one day remember my dress, were I successful.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the snow will even fall this year?\u201d a tall lady clad in wine red asked a matron in indigo.</p> <p>The grand dame bit her lip and sighed, eyes rolled heavenward. \u201cWe can only hope Aztarte hears our prayers,\u201d she answered ambiguously, leaving the woman in red sorely vexed.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, there\u2019s something underhanded going on,\u201d a dark-skinned girl in canary yellow said, nudging her skirts aside to walk side-by-side with the tall girl in red. \u201cNothing adds up. Someone should speak up and ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you, then?\u201d</p><p>The girl in yellow let loose a bright, high laugh as fake as the diamonds in her earbobs. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious, not suicidal.\u201d She patted her companion\u2019s hand and moved away, deeper into the crowd.</p><p>I looked from face to face, searching for someone familiar. The masks could only hide so much, and I had danced among the Freesian court for years. But I saw very few faces I knew, and I lost track of the mental list of acquaintances who should have been there but weren\u2019t. Mikhail had been telling the truth on the Maybuck; Ravenna had chased the old blood out and brought new faces to the Sugar Snow Ball. That meant that I was less likely to be recognized but also that I would have fewer allies. My only sworn follower was Mikhail, and there was no way to know when I would see him again. He had pledged himself and promised to help me, but with a parachute on my back and pirates on my tail, I hadn\u2019t bothered to ask how.</p><p>The walkway under my slippers was formed of the same smooth, carefully cut and fitted stone as the clearing where the Sugar Snow Ball took place. It had been crafted thousands of years ago\u2014no one knew by whom or how they had made the stone both exquisitely danceable and yet never slippery. For my first ball, I had worn satin slippers, and at the end of the night, they had been entirely worn through, my blisters poking out through holes, but still I had not stopped dancing.</p><p>We entered another clearing ringed by ancient trees. Several elegant privies waited in a line, and farther on, a vast tent hung from the branches above. Inside, couches and vanities and lanterns were placed for maximum beauty and comfort. I went straight for an empty vanity to check my appearance by the light of a white paper lantern. Of course, I couldn\u2019t remove my mask, so I was limited to patting down stray hairs and adjusting the shoulder of my dress over one of Casper\u2019s inky smears.</p><p>A subtle glance confirmed that even if I was wearing an unusual dress and an overly mysterious mask, no one was paying me any mind. The women chattered and primped and reapplied their bloodred paint as silent servants circulated with trays of bloodwine and pink champagne. I explored the rest of the tent, which floated a few feet off the ground over the stone. In one corner, a small shrine was set up. Red candles and cut roses surrounded a painting of Ravenna with my brother, Alex, sitting at her feet like a dog. But in front of the painting, someone had placed a newspaper clipping with a sketch of Olgha and me. The headline read, \u201cWill the Missing Blud Princesses Ever Be Found?\u201d There was no date, but the newsprint was yellowed with age and curling around the edges.</p><p>\u201cBless them,\u201d a woman murmured, and a hand deposited a vial of tears and disappeared before I could determine its owner.</p><p>I turned to watch the room. Hundreds of Bludwomen of all ages and types chattered together. All were rich, of course. A few had the traditional Freesian look, with milk-white skin and dark hair and light eyes. Even more had Ravenna\u2019s gypsy type, and some had my icy hair and blue eyes. There were even a few dark-skinned girls and one redhead, the very image of Aztarte and full of herself over it. Among these women, there were people who believed in me. Who hoped and prayed for me every day. People who would risk their necks by honoring me with roses and candles and scraps of paper they\u2019d carried for years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was close enough to feel the brush of their skirts and smell the oil in their hair, and they didn\u2019t even recognize me. But they loved me, and for now, that was enough.</p><p>A chime sounded, and the group moved out the other side of the tent and continued along the walkway. The talk was still bright but more quiet now, excited but respectful. When our path angled in again, I all but ran to Casper\u2019s side and took his arm.</p><p>\u201cAll well?\u201d I murmured.</p> <p>He nodded, but his eyes were guarded, his expression anxious. Being around me held its own dangers, but we had found our equilibrium. Being in a large crowd of his sudden peers for the first time, crowded with puffed-up males trying to find their place in Ravenna\u2019s court, would have been uncomfortable even for a born Bludman. But his unsullied costume and face paint told me he at least hadn\u2019t found himself in any fights, and that was a fine start.</p><p>We were in pairs now, a long line traversing the white stone through the high, silent forest. It felt like a cathedral, like something bigger than hands and hearts, something old and ancient that watched from afar. That was the way of the Sugar Snow Ball: you came only in pairs, although you were free to dance with anyone you chose. I had been accompanied by a string of boring, stuffy, inbred lords strategically selected by my parents, but I had infuriated each of them by night\u2019s end and had therefore never had a repeat date, much less a steady beau. I could dance gracefully enough to bring the snow, but I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut or allow some young upstart to think himself superior for even a moment. Casper was my first agreeable partner, and I could only hope we would live to have an encore.</p><p>The forest was so thick around us that it was like walking down a dark hallway. Past the lanterns, the shadows between the trees became an impenetrable wall of sinister green gloom, with subtle rustlings and the eerie growl of wood rubbing on wood. The small creatures would all be in hiding, cowering from such a display of predatory power. But larger blud creatures had occasionally been seen lurking beyond the dance floor, their eyes flashing yellow or green from the darkness as they paid homage to our ancient ritual.</p><p>The path ended at a simple staircase climbing upward in the same white stone, and the whispering quieted. I loosed Casper\u2019s arm to hold up my dress and kept my eyes on the steps and the grand skirt of the lady before me. When I ran out of stairs at the top of the hill, I looked down on a scene both familiar and yet utterly new.</p><p>The Sugar Snow Ball was held in an ancient clearing in the bottom of a bowl-shaped impression, almost as if a mountain had been hollowed out just for that purpose. The forest rose infinitely tall around the wide circle of flat white stone, a ballroom nearly as large as the palace itself. The staircase up the hill had been simple, but the one that led to the dancing floor was grand and twisting. I had watched, bored but too well bred to fidget, as the couples paraded down that staircase every year. The ladies put on the brightest smiles. The gentlemen kept their backs straight, their chins high. Casper\u2019s gloved hand gave mine a squeeze, and then we were separated again, step after step in time down the curling, twining staircase, twisting in and out like another dance. At the bottom, the staircases came together by an old carved statue of Aztarte that rose from the earth, glistening as if made of moonstone. Casper and I met, taking the last steps in tandem, and I let go of my skirts and took his arm again, anxious for the connection and glad to feel his strength at my side.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know the way of things, so I guided him subtly to the back of the crowd, ensuring that there was no way Alex could see me. The wealthiest and highest-ranking couples would be at the front, with the next ring of hopefuls jockeying for position behind them. Most of the people in back would be elders, troublemakers, or foreign semiroyals who knew they would have more fun if they avoided local politics. Here, there was no jostling, just bemused smiles and patience and an occasional nip of something strongly alcoholic.</p><p>The orchestra hidden under the twining staircases began with the same sudden frenzy as the bludmares pulling our carriage, with the galloping crescendo of \u201cAztarte Smiles on Bloodshed,\u201d our national song. Hands went to hearts, and all eyes focused on a long, straight staircase on the other side of the clearing. A halo of bright lights glittered, and a couple appeared at the top of the staircase, outlined by the jagged silhouette of the Ice Palace. They paused momentarily for effect. My mother had always been the one to set our pace, always knowing exactly how long to stand, head held high, at the top of that staircase.</p><p>This time, the lights shone full on Ravenna.</p><p>37</p><p>She was ageless, the same as that first time I\u2019d encountered her at the Sugar Snow festival. The same bronze skin, eagle\u2019s nose, and sweeping black hair. The same savage grace, as if her spine curved back just a little, like a cobra waiting to strike. Even from the farthest point of the clearing, I could see the magnificence of her costume and the gossamer diamond twinkling of her mask.</p><p>But what struck me most was that she had worn black. Black was considered a color of the oppressed. In the big cities of Sangland, many Bludmen were forced to wear black so that all would know what they were. As if my people wished to hide! But I had never heard of anyone wearing black to the Sugar Snow Ball. After all, it was the opposite color of snow.</p> <p>Just behind her, my brother, Alex, stepped forward to take her arm. He was stiff, proud, alert, his costume done in black and white to coordinate perfectly with hers. He was just the slightest bit taller than she, his eyes shining the bold red that was usual for him and highly strange elsewhere. They descended the staircase, slowly to accommodate Ravenna\u2019s proud skirts, and goose bumps rippled over my arms. There was something deeply disturbing about the ritual, and if the whispers around us were any indication, the people felt it, too.</p><p>It felt like forever until they reached the floor. As Alex\u2019s boots clacked on the stone, a fierce wind began to batter the trees. I looked up to find the green boughs swaying mournfully, straining toward the cold white moon in the center, full and round and perfect and still, untouchable and nearly as bright as the daytime sun. The breeze brought a chill and the welcome and exhilarating scent of snow. I breathed in deeply and looked into Casper\u2019s eyes. I wanted to know if he could smell it, too. His face shone with amazement, and his arm snaked possessively around my waist, pulling me close.</p><p>Across the clearing, Alex trailed Ravenna as she walked along a line of crystalline red stone inlaid in the white. Her hips swayed, the over-wide skirts of her dress seeming to float along gently. The crowd waited, breathless and anxious for a show. The ball always began with a proclamation, and what was said and by whom was always rather telling.</p><p>The orchestra ended the song exactly as they stopped before the circular blud altar in the very center of the clearing. It was smooth and beautifully carved of pure white stone, with a trough down the center that funneled into a hole that supposedly led deep into the earth and to Aztarte herself. Ravenna moved to the fore, her dress blocking the altar entirely. Alex stood to one side, making it clear who ruled here.</p><p>My enemy smiled, bloodred lips parting over sharp teeth. Her mask hugged her face like lace spun of moonlight, highlighting her dark brows, black kohl, blacker eyes, and eerie smile.</p><p>The wind whipped past her, the feathers of her cape stirring with the iridescent inky shimmer of a raven\u2019s wing.</p><p>\u201cPeople of Freesia,\u201d she called, her dusky-sweet voice carrying and echoing within the curve of the clearing.</p><p>A murmur went through the crowd. Historically, the crowd was to bow, yet . . . no one did. She ignored them.</p> <p>\u201cI welcome you to the Sugar Snow Ball. May your feet be light, your hearts be open, and the blood of your enemies be ever warm.\u201d</p><p>The words were mostly correct, but a tremor of unease ran through the crowd. The speech should have come from a Feodor, from someone carrying the blud of Freesia. Ravenna wasn\u2019t one of our people, much less a creature bonded by blud and birth to the land. She couldn\u2019t even make the traditional offering, just after the Sugar Snow, letting her blud flow into the altar and down into the ground to Aztarte\u2019s bones. She must have had plans to use Alex in her place.</p><p>When Ravenna bowed to the assembly, Alex bowed, too, which gave me an excuse to return the gesture without betraying my country. The crowd waited, holding our collective breath, as Ravenna raised her arms high and then brought them down dramatically. The orchestra began, and with a grand sweep, Ravenna was waltzing with my brother in the traditional first dance. I struggled to see past a sea of people taller than I. Was Alex hungry and feral, or was he drugged, or had the mad gypsy actually succeeded in calming him to something near normal? The air fairly stank of magic, but I had never had the knack and couldn\u2019t tell what exactly Ravenna was using it to accomplish.</p><p>The first dance lasted forever, but it always did. At least this time, I was anonymous, squashed between dresses in a crowd. It was harder when you were the one standing before the blood altar, being ogled and judged and measured by the assembled crowd. A heavy skirt nudged me, and I stepped sideways, annoyed to be in what was clearly the smallest dress. As if he could feel my annoyance, Casper squeezed my hand. Bolstered, I squeezed back.</p><p>Finally, the first dance was over, and the assembled couples quickly spread out to enjoy the next song. I pulled Casper away from the blud altar, where Ravenna and Alex danced, a dark smudge among the bright jewels of the moonlit crowd.</p><p>With a firm and steady hand, Casper twirled me out and drew me near, a cocky smile on his face. His other hand caught my waist in a move both formal and tender, and I let him lead me through the dance, guiding me through the steps with a Bludman\u2019s born grace. With such a large floor, it was easy to stay far from the altar and never brush by another couple. In my mother\u2019s time, everyone had always gravitated toward the Tsarina, hoping for a benevolent word when skirts accidentally brushed or an especially fine gown caught her eye. This time, they hovered around Ravenna, uncertain and fearful but drawn, deep down, to the most dangerous predator in the area. I didn\u2019t want to see it, so I concentrated on Casper.</p><p>He was nothing short of magnificent. Had I seen this man from across this very clearing, I would have sought him like a magnet to true north, like lightning to the tallest tree. The intensity of his gaze coupled with the humor in his mouth. The firm cut of his jaw and the soft waves of his hair. The wide shoulders that made the ridiculous jacket into artwork, and the fine figure that made the tight breeches a study of planes and curves. All I missed was the feel of his hands, his dark gloves the only thing between us and possible discovery. I hoped no one else had looked closely enough to notice they weren\u2019t a Bludman\u2019s claws. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re more beautiful than your portrait,\u201d he murmured in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even see my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p> <p>He spun me out and back, the heavy skirt swirling around my ankles. When he caught me close, I smelled his scent rising with the promise of snow, a strange mix of sun and darkness, sandalwood and fir trees, old wood and new blud. The dancers around us became as inconsequential as ashes in a storm, fluttery bits of nothing. Our eyes were caught and burning, our feet moving like leaves on the wind. I didn\u2019t realize the song was over until he had spun me out and bowed.</p><p>Taking my hand, he led me toward a table of treats tended by low-ranking blud servants. I looked down, hoping they wouldn\u2019t recognize me but knowing that it was expected for us to partake and that every drop of blood made me stronger.</p><p>Casper had no way of knowing all of the clever and indulgent ways to enjoy a Bludman\u2019s feast, so I took up a curl of candied tangerine dipped in blood sugar and held it to his lips. His mouth twitched, and his eyes narrowed, but he knew better than to reject it.</p><p>\u201cThat is so very weird,\u201d he said, chewing. \u201cI like it, and I hate it. But it\u2019s familiar.\u201d</p><p>I popped a piece into my mouth and tried to imagine what it would be like, tasting it for the first time. The tart, bright twist of the orange coupled with the waxy blood and the crystalline coating. But I couldn\u2019t tease it apart. I had always loved this taste, just as I had always lived this life in my body.</p> <p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d I asked him before my brain caught up with my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI exist as I am, and that is enough. If no other in the world be aware I sit content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah. A ball is no place for your philosophies, Master . . .\u201d I trailed off. Sterling was a Pinky name, the sort of overtly pleasant thing they had adopted when they had begun to take over the parts of the world where Bludmen were considered monsters. His name had to be powerful, careless, cruel. \u201cMaster Scathing,\u201d I said, liking the flavor of it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t . . . I\u2019m not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSniveling? Strafing? Starving? Savage?\u201d</p><p>For just a moment there, he was human again, and struggling. Then, as if shaking off water, he suddenly seemed a foot taller and a foot wider, his eyes filled with thunder and staring over my shoulder at some new threat.</p> <p>\u201cWould the lady care to dance?\u201d</p><p>I turned, mouth open in surprise, to find one of the two dandies I had recognized earlier. Dancing with him was the last thing on Sang that I wanted to do, and yet to deny him would have caused even more aggravation. I forced a smile and nodded, and he took my hand carefully, as if it might suddenly turn in his grasp like a snake. I tried to recall his name and failed.</p><p>The next dance was, damnably, a slow one. I placed my hand on his shoulder in the correct place, and he looked at it as if I planned on ripping a hole in his perfectly tailored violet jacket. His other hand landed lightly on my hip, as if I were a piece of furniture instead of a person, and he began to move me mechanically around the floor, whisking me ever farther away from my only ally. The last thing I saw as we passed behind the blood altar was the second dandy sidling up to Casper in a coat the same orange as the sick sunset after a storm.</p><p>\u201cYou seem rather familiar, my dear. Have we chanced to meet?\u201d</p><p>His voice was cultured, affected, and soft. I peered into his face as if trying to place him, and the waxed and curled tips of his mustache twitched. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d I said in the clipped accent of Sangland.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to the Sugar Snow Ball, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that dress! Your seamstress is a treat. You must give me her address. In Muscovy, I suppose?\u201d His eyes were quite large behind the slip of the mask, the black around them exaggerated. He was staring at me strangely, not as if I were a woman he found attractive, because that was impossible. And yet there was an odd, anxious hunger that I couldn\u2019t place.</p> <p>\u201cYou have been fooled, sir. It is secondhand, I am ashamed to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a tag? A tailor\u2019s mark? I simply must know. The beading is exquisite. It\u2019s the very image of the debutante gown worn by dear, sweet Princess Ahnastasia, may Aztarte have mercy on her soul. Although the color is just a bit different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured, nearly tripping over his exaggeratedly long shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you hail from, darling? Your accent is rather exotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSangland. London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivine town. I dote upon it severely. Tell me, have you ever been to the opera there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>His hand clenched ever so slightly on my waist, and he looked over my shoulder too quickly. I tried to follow his gaze, but he spun me into a crowd, and I couldn\u2019t see back to where Casper had been, beside the table.</p><p>\u201cAnd is your mask from there as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift from my aunt, for the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiding so much.\u201d The hand on my waist rose between us, the talon on his thumb raking my chin right under the mask. \u201cTell me, snowbird. Is your face as beautiful as your dress?\u201d</p><p>Thank heavens the Sugar Snow hadn\u2019t started yet. My reaction would have plunged the country into anarchy. I jerked back from his claws and stumbled out of his arms, one hand holding the mask to my face before he could pry it off. His mouth curled up slowly, mimicking his mustache, and I spun away to shoulder through the other dancers and return to Casper. The space around the table was empty, with no sign of Casper or the other dandy. The Sugar Snow was close, and the air was tense and expectant, humming with magic. It was almost time.</p><p>With a silent hiss, I accepted a flute of champagne-infused blood from a waiting servant and held it up to my mask. I couldn\u2019t get it down without making a mess of one sort or another, so I set it on the table and selected a chilled vial of blood slush from a waiting cauldron. Shaking with silent fury and fear, I tossed it back through the mouth hole of my mask as I sought Casper in the crowd.</p><p>When I finally found him, the iced blood went heavy in my stomach.</p><p>He was dancing with Ravenna.</p><p>38</p><p>Perhaps Casper led the dance, but it was clear who was in power. They danced slowly, Ravenna\u2019s mouth close enough to rip out his jugular as she whispered into his ear. They spun enough for me to see his face, and he was ashen, pale with barely restrained fury. The song ended, but she didn\u2019t let go of the hand she had held while dancing. Instead, she dragged him toward the blud altar, and they stood before it together.</p><p>\u201cPeople of Freesia!\u201d she shouted, and everyone crowded around. The scent of the coming Sugar Snow was heavy in the air, the moon obscured by misty clouds that swirled against the indigo like milk in blood.</p><p>\u201cMy friends, I have great news. Our Sugar Snow is doubly blessed this year. We have with us the greatest musician in all of Sang. The Maestro himself, Casper Sterling!\u201d Polite applause and whispering broke out, and Casper let out a great, shuddering breath. \u201cHe has been recently bludded, although he won\u2019t reveal the circumstances. For once, an abomination is a welcome member of our ranks. My people, do we wish to hear the Snowsong played by the world\u2019s most talented harpsichordist?\u201d</p><p>The applause after that was deafening. It had been a lean few years, and any advantage was welcome. One famous and talented man commanding the instrument he knew best was a better gamble than an entire orchestra when it came to flawless playing and timing.</p><p>Then again, no one had ever heard the Snowsong, aside from the Bludmen who came to this ball every year. It wasn\u2019t written, it wasn\u2019t public, and it was considered a great secret. How he was going to oblige Ravenna and her court without inciting tragedy was beyond me. At least, he had managed to avoid telling her about me; if she had known, I would have been in a fight for my life already. I focused on uncurling my claws and trying to appear as normal and innocent as possible.</p><p>As I watched Ravenna lead Casper to the grand white harpsichord under the stairs, a cold hand grasped my wrist.</p><p>\u201cMay I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit this one out,\u201d I hissed, trying to snatch my wrist back and failing.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was the dandy. Or dandies. One on either side of me. Their twin smiles, smug and sure, told me they knew more than I wanted them to. They each grasped one of my arms, and when I struggled, the one in violet produced a metal instrument like the one filled with seawater that had been carried by the assassin on the train.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s considered a patriotic duty to dance the Snowsong,\u201d one said, and the other nodded and added, \u201cNot dancing is often repaid with a good beheading.\u201d</p><p>I bared my teeth and felt the rush of the hunt flood my veins. I\u2019d rip out their hearts and stomp on their fancy jackets if they didn\u2019t loose my wrists.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think we want to behead this one, boys.\u201d</p><p>They spun me around, and I was face-to-face with my enemy at last. Ravenna grinned, a mad look in her dark eyes. My brother, Alex, was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>I took a deep breath and held her stare, my wrists caught by the dandies.</p><p>\u201cNothing to say to your queen? Bow to me, then, little peacock.\u201d</p><p>The anger built inside me, but I was as still as a statue, as still as the blud altar, as still as the high white moon.</p><p>Her smile curled up, the bloodred lips mocking me. \u201cRemove her mask.\u201d</p><p>One of the dandies untied the strings, and the proud peacock\u2019s face shattered on the stone. The night air was cool and welcome on my heated skin, but Ravenna\u2019s furious cackle of triumph stole the moment of relief. Her jugular pulsed as she threw back her head, and a rush of hunger and anger made me shiver. Nothing smelled so sweet as the enemy\u2019s blud. With my wrists pinned, I was helpless to exact my revenge. But I was so close.</p><p>I sought Casper across the clearing and found him sitting at the harpsichord. For a fraction of a heartbeat, I smiled to know he was in the place he best belonged, but then reality crushed me again. One of the musicians was scribbling on a piece of paper, and Casper was miming notes on the harpsichord. Should he miss a note or time it wrong, it would mess up the dance, and the company would tear him limb from limb as a sacrifice to Aztarte. It was a clever gamble on Ravenna\u2019s part, as if she had known that worry for Casper was the only thing that could leave me unbalanced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhnastasia,\u201d Ravenna said, one claw tracing my cheek and leaving a hot line behind. \u201cYou\u2019ve run me a pretty chase, princess.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. She silently snarled and stepped closer, close enough for me to smell an unnatural scent rising from her skin, something I couldn\u2019t quite place.</p><p>Across the clearing, a trill rang out from the harpsichord. Four notes. The calling of the dancers.</p> <p>\u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d Ravenna asked with a mocking bow.</p><p>And I had to accept, because as much as I needed to kill her, my country needed a well-danced ritual and a perfectly fallen Sugar Snow. And she knew it, damn her. I inclined my head just the tiniest bit, and she held out her arm, as a man would. The dandies loosed me, and I let her lead me to my place at the head of the line. She stood across from me as we waited among hundreds of others, tense and excited, for the first notes to ring out.</p><p>It was always beautiful, that song. I could so easily picture Casper\u2019s nimble fingers on the keyboard, stroking the ivory keys with an intimacy and strength I knew all too well. As the first notes leaped into the air, I turned to bow to the gentleman on my other side, finding the dandy in the purple coat waiting with a mocking smile. I was trapped among the three of them, but I held my head high and danced with the grace and beauty expected of the crown princess. Whenever it came time to promenade with Ravenna, I had to stop myself from hissing at her damning and flippant power, her grasp stronger than that of any man who had ever led me while dancing. She was all but daring me to ruin my country, her feet stretching to trip me at every opportunity. Keeping up gracefully was a pretty little revenge. Casper played the song perfectly, as if he had written it himself. I was half shocked, half gratified at his success.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, princess?\u201d Ravenna asked, gazing over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAlmanica. Hunting buffalo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>\u201cDoes Olgha live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon with an army of daimons to overthrow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tire of your lies, little tsarling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tire of your meddling, witch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d She sighed and took my arm. When we began the next figure, she blew some sort of powder into my face, making me blink and nearly trip. I was still shaking my head when she whispered some strange musical words. I went dizzy but didn\u2019t misstep.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Ahnastasia. Does Olgha live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was out of my mouth before I could think it.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>I clenched my teeth, but the words leaked out the side of my mouth. \u201cDrained in a valise.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, almost friendly. \u201cThere. That\u2019s better. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill you and take back Freesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re not doing well so far.\u201d</p> <p>I tried to stick my tongue to the roof of my mouth as I looked over her shoulder. Casper was curled over the harpsichord, his face suffused with rapture. It was truly the most beautiful song I had ever known, and hearing him play it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially since Ravenna seemed to have the upper hand. When I looked up at the moon, I could see the clouds starting to swirl in a circle and sparkle as if tiny fairies flew within. The smell was sweet and heavy, like a bush about to blossom at midnight, except that the blooms were snowflakes. If he was playing well enough and we were dancing well enough, the next chorus would bring the first snow.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to Alex?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ensorcelled, of course. That began long before I had your parents executed. Alex is on a steady diet of my blud, which calms him and binds him further to me. I\u2019ll announce our engagement at the end of the dance. The wedding will happen in summer, I think, at the Basilica of Aztarte.\u201d</p><p>It had been said to enrage me, and it worked. My talons bit into her shoulder, drawing blood, and the hand I held made a slight crunching noise. She didn\u2019t flinch, and neither of us missed a step. If she managed to marry Alex and kill me, she would be Tsarina of Freesia until she died, ending my family\u2019s matriarchal reign forever.</p><p>\u201cWhat of the Svedish king?\u201d</p><p>A wicked smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the second act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people will never stand for it,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cThe people are cattle. But tell me, did you turn Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have grounds to drain you, should you live through the dance. Excellent. Ah, the chorus.\u201d</p><p>Casper shifted into the trickiest part of the song. The dancers had formed two circles, the men a smaller ring inside the larger one formed by the women and their grand dresses. I couldn\u2019t see where Ravenna\u2019s claws ended and mine began as we spun, around and around, faster and faster. Her black skirt swung out like a huge bell, a monstrous flower, and mine flared just a little, the iridescent feathers shimmering in the air. The woman on my other side was nothing, just a shadow holding me in place. Across from us, the men\u2019s circle whirled in the opposite direction, a blur of dark coats and bright cravats. Casper\u2019s song built in speed and strength, and the world seemed to hold its breath, and finally, with a heavy sigh, the first fat flakes of snow began to fall in the center of the circles, right above the blud altar.</p><p>The first ones never made it to the ground; you could only see them if you looked up, just right. But then they began to pour, heavy and white and pure, with the scent of hidden flowers and raw wind and wildness. I breathed in deep as we spun, focusing ever upward and sending silent prayers to Aztarte.</p><p>Let me kill Ravenna.</p><p>Let me save my brother, my country.</p><p>Let Casper survive.</p><p>I bit my lip hard enough to draw blud and spat into the wind, hoping to hit some snow and help my prayers find the goddess whom I suddenly, desperately needed to be real and listening.</p><p>As the song built to the last verse, the circles stopped spinning exactly where they\u2019d started, and the dancers moved to the last set. Ravenna pulled me close, jerking my body into position, as the leading dancer was supposed to do. We were both panting and exhilarated with the touch of the first snow, and a heavy one at that.</p><p>\u201cYou see? Aztarte smiles on my future rule,\u201d she all but purred, and I smiled through closed teeth before spitting a big glob of blud in her face. It spattered over her dainty mask, turning the unicorn hair a strange pink.</p><p>Slow and low, she hissed at me. \u201cWe finish this dance, and then you and your pet abomination die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>The dance ended, and we performed the traditional bow, our eyes never unlocking. The entire company clapped and whistled with an unusual enthusiasm. The snow still fell, already gathering in our hair and on the boughs around us, although it never marred the stone of the dancing floor. As I straightened and moved to pounce on Ravenna, the dandies caught my wrists and jerked me painfully back from my leap.</p><p>\u201cAn auspicious omen!\u201d Ravenna shouted, and the people cheered again with real enthusiasm. She raised her arms and led us to the blud altar, and the dancers formed a ring around us. \u201cBring the Maestro and the sacrifice,\u201d she called, disappearing among the guests and leaving me with the dandies.</p><p>As the crowd gathered, the whispering began. They could see my face. Did they recognize me, or were they simply curious about my lack of a mask and the fact that I was being restrained like a criminal?</p><p>\u201cAhna?\u201d My brother appeared, his voice deeper than I remembered but his face still youthful and anxious.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Alex.\u201d I kept my tone even, proud, my chin held high.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I\u2019m better? Where have you been? We\u2019ve been looking forever.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s my baby brother, always worrying about himself first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Mother and Father have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I cocked my head, confused at his lack of sorrow. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA diplomatic mission. Ravenna says they\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they will,\u201d I said gently.</p><p>The crowd parted, and Ravenna marched through with Casper on her arm. His lips were curled back, his teeth bared. But I smelled fear on him, too, which was a surprise. In that moment, anger should have consumed him, as it consumed me.</p><p>A murmur rippled through the party, and I smelled something strange, my hackles rising. An interloper, a non-Blud, at the Sugar Snow Ball? When I breathed in deeper, fear clutched my heart, too, and I understood Casper\u2019s strange reaction. It was no surprise when the crowd parted to reveal a servant carrying a bound Pinky.</p><p>Keen.</p><p>The servant set her on the ground, and she growled around a gag and thrashed in the ropes. Ravenna put one hand on her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what we found in the city, trying to pawn a royal diamond the size of her thumbnail.\u201d</p><p>I groaned and glared at Keen, but her eyes were too wide and terrified for it to have any sort of effect, not even the flippant and dangerous eye rolling I had hoped to see. She knew, with the prey animal\u2019s deep-down fear, that she was doomed.</p><p>\u201cWe have Aztarte\u2019s blessing, my people! And now we will honor her with the blood of retribution!\u201d</p><p>The crowd seemed unsure how to respond, outside of scattered applause and whispering. The clearing went dark for a moment, a cloud passing over the moon. I shivered, and not because of the snow falling like kisses on my hair and shoulders. The very worst had come to pass: she had all three of us in her power and Aztarte\u2019s blessing to rule. I had wished to see Keen again, but never like this.</p><p>Ravenna picked up Keen as if the girl weighed nothing and tossed her roughly onto the blood altar. Keen\u2019s face was as white as the stone, and she fought against the bonds, her eyes pinned on Casper and pleading.</p><p>\u201cThis insignificant creature has told me all your secrets.\u201d Ravenna spoke to me, but her voice was purposefully loud. \u201cFirst, you will give me the ring of succession, and I will wear it as I drain her in the name of Aztarte. When the sacrifice has been made, I will destroy this abomination and punish you for putting the royal blud of Freesia into a commoner. Three is a sacred number, and your blud will seal our victory. Aztarte will bless us above all others as we join with Sveden and march on Sangland to topple the Coppers and rule forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The crowd was silent. I was silent. Ravenna held out her hand. I reached into my corset and withdrew the ring of succession, the sapphire glinting, cold and blue in the moonlight. With a heavy sigh, I placed it in her outstretched palm, her black fingers curling around it and a smile of pure joy spreading over her face. She slipped it over the proper finger and held her hand aloft, and the crowd clapped sadly, as if they had no choice. The empire\u2019s death hung heavy over the clearing, which should have sparkled with music and dancers. And yet no one could protest. I watched my ring twinkle on my enemy\u2019s finger as the dandies yet again captured my wrists.</p><p>\u201cAre you not patriots?\u201d I whispered, and one of them whispered back, \u201cThe winner writes the history, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Ravenna approached Keen and stroked her tear-stained face, turning her cheek away. In a savage strike, she swiped the girl\u2019s throat open with one talon. Blood poured down Keen\u2019s tender neck and into the trough, funneling it straight down into the soil, to Aztarte herself. Casper roared and jumped for Ravenna\u2019s throat, but the strangest thing I could possibly imagine happened. An arrow from nowhere landed to quiver in his shoulder, and he fell to the ground.</p> <p>The crowd went mad, as weapons were strictly forbidden at the Sugar Snow Ball. Some people hissed and got into fighting stances, others ran for cover, and several just stared up at the sky, amazed. I looked up to see the dark hull of an airship hovering just beyond the trees. Ropes unfurled, and bodies slid down, shadows against the moon and light flickering off crossbows.</p><p>I was torn. Go to Casper and remove the arrow, try to help Keen, or kill Ravenna? Instinct took over, and I howled and slammed into the gypsy witch. We rolled over and over on the dancing floor, teeth and claws slashing for exposed skin. All around us, heavy boots struck the hard stone. The scent of unwashed flesh merged with the magic of the Sugar Snow and the hot reek of spilled blud. I glanced away from Ravenna for just a second and saw a familiar smile behind a curving sword.</p><p>It was Mikhail, the pirate.</p><p>All around me, Bludmen in ball gowns and tailcoats grappled and fought with the pirates. Underneath me, Ravenna growled and scratched and bit, slippery in her silk dress, the wide hoops of her skirt making it impossible to hold her down. She tossed me onto my back, and over her shoulder, I saw Keen\u2019s shape on the altar, no longer thrashing. Casper was gone.</p><p>\u201cGive up, little brat,\u201d Ravenna said.</p> <p>\u201cNever!\u201d My shout rang out as sharp as metal on ice.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I saw as your fortune, all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me. Rebellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied. I saw your blud dripping off the altar. I saw this.\u201d</p><p>She caught my wrist in her hand, clenching hard enough to make the bones rub together. With a heavy grunt, I reared back and drove my forehead into her nose with a wet crunch that reminded me all too well of the pirate we\u2019d sent overboard. She shrieked and pulled back, burbling blud, and I saw my moment. I reached for the ring on her hand and twisted the center stone.</p><p>She shuddered, her grip loosening. I flung myself back, dragging my body out from under her skirt and away from her. Touching her skin just then would have been suicide.</p> <p>It was almost beautiful, the way her body danced amid all that fighting. She was on her back, the great bell of her skirt billowing as she writhed. Blud pooled in her eyes and dribbled out her nose and mouth and ears to stain the cracks between the white stones. The fighting slowed, and the people of Freesia moved near, making a wide circle around Ravenna, watching her die in silence.</p><p>A hand found my shoulder, and I stiffened and growled before I realized it was Mikhail.</p><p>\u201cCyanote?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cA hidden compartment. As if the ring had been made for this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you we would be here, my queen. Your word, my life.\u201d</p><p>Alex floundered out of the crowd and across the stone to kneel by Ravenna\u2019s side.</p><p>As he reached for her hand, I barked, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t touch her unless you wish to die.\u201d</p><p>His hand stopped in midair, considering. It fell to his side, and the blud tears began to roll down his pale cheeks. When she gave a final twitch and went still, Alex threw his head back and screamed, a sound that was all too familiar from him.</p> <p>\u201cYour kill, my queen,\u201d Mikhail murmured, pushing me forward just a little.</p><p>One foot in front of the other, I walked to the corpse of my greatest enemy. I knelt on her other side and used the sleeve of my dress to pull the ring from her stiff, already curling finger.</p><p>\u201cA glass of blood,\u201d I called, and with a welcome quickness, one appeared. I set the glass on the stone and dropped in the ring, pulling my skirts back. The blood bubbled and fumed, a little green cloud roiling down the glass and drifting along the stone. When it stilled, the blood had gone thick and chunky. I dumped out the ring and slipped it onto my finger.</p><p>I stood and held up my bloody hand.</p><p>\u201cMy people, Aztarte has spoken. I, Tsarina Ahnastasia Feodor, assume the throne of Freesia, as is my right by blud and by birthright. I shout my challenge over the blud of the enemy and the rime of the Sugar Snow. If you wish to face me, do it now, and I will destroy you!\u201d</p><p>I stood defiant, my eyes meeting face after face. Every single person there cast his or her eyes to the ground, even Alex. No one was willing to challenge me. And that was right, too.</p><p>Mikhail stepped forward. \u201cThree cheers for Tsarina Ahnastasia!\u201d</p><p>After a deafening moment of silence, the crowd erupted, their call loud enough to shake the snow from the boughs of the trees.</p><p>\u201cHurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\u201d</p><p>One fist to the sky, I answered in a primal scream that sealed my monarchy.</p><p>As my howl reverberated through the forest, I heard a quiet cough and a gasp.</p><p>Casper.</p><p>39</p><p>I found him clinging to the altar, a trail of blud marking his path.</p><p>\u201cYou have to help her,\u201d he said.</p><p>I snorted and muttered, \u201cI have to help you first, fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMikhail! Get the arrow out of him!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot him.\u201d Casper drew back and coughed a spray of blud. \u201cDon\u2019t pull out the arrow. I need a doctor.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail appeared beside us, a bemused smile on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t know what a doctor is, comrade, but a little arrow is hardly an impediment. Once the point is out, you\u2019ll heal quickly enough. Lucky you joined the right side, eh?\u201d</p><p>With a grim nod, I turned back to Keen. Her eyelids fluttered, her pulse weak. She was so broken that she barely registered as food. A great chill crept over me, seeing her nearly dead, and I looked up to the cold moon. Would Aztarte forgive me for what I was about to do? And did I really need anyone\u2019s forgiveness anymore?</p><p>\u201cMy people, I hereby adopt this child as a Feodor. The traitor Ravenna made an unpure sacrifice to Aztarte, and I will redeem this creature with the blud of our people. She will replace my sister, Princess Olgha Feodor, murdered by Ravenna\u2019s hand. Blood for blud.\u201d</p><p>A murmur went through the crowd, but no one objected or moved forward. With a silent plea to the moon and her mistress, I pulled back the gem-crusted sleeve of my gown to bite my wrist and let the blud pour into Keen\u2019s open mouth. At first, nothing happened, and the blud slipped from her lips to dribble down the white face of the altar. For just a second, as I watched the bright spatter fall, I was a child in a gypsy tent, staring at a woman with a crocodile\u2019s smile, and then I was back with Keen, willing her to live. My heart stuttered to watch the bright red paint her dry tongue. Then, miracle of miracles, her broken throat moved. After a few moments, she licked her lips, and her eyes popped open.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she said with a gurgle, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re back to yourself, then, urchin?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my wrist and pulled it close, sucking hard. It wasn\u2019t like it had been with Casper\u2014not at all. It hurt, as if she were trying to draw the very soul out of my body with her teeth. But I was determined to show my people that I was untouchable, and I was desperate to keep Keen alive. For me and for Casper. So I held my head high, letting her drink and daring anyone to challenge me. Inside, I was screaming.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to live?\u201d Casper said quietly.</p><p>I turned to give him a wobbling smile. \u201cI know nothing else but miracles,\u201d I said with a half-sobbing chuckle at how everything had turned out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Blud Court, Maestro.\u201d</p><p>40</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy after that. Bludding Keen took time and caused us both excruciating pain. By the end, we were curled together on the hard ground under a mound of capes and jackets, shivering with the cold and the ache of draining and covered in frozen blud. Casper had stayed with us the entire time, guarding us as if I was a bitch with a new pup.</p><p>Keen finally dragged herself out from beneath my arm and stood, as wobbly as a new fawn.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re finally even,\u201d she muttered. She shook herself and grinned with new energy before following her nose to the banquet table.</p><p>Casper pulled me onto his lap, and I tucked my head into his neck and watched Mikhail and his crew clean up the chaos they\u2019d wrought. They had seemed like a multitude, sliding down from the sky in a rain of arrows, but in truth, it was a skeleton crew of fewer than a dozen Bludmen, sons of Freesia who had mutinied under Mikhail\u2019s lead and stolen the pirate airship while Captain Corvus drank himself insensible between Miss May\u2019s thighs.</p><p>My first act as Tsarina was to pardon Mikhail and the rest of the Blud Barons driven out by Ravenna. My second act was to send everyone home to spread the word that the traitor was dead and the true queen returned, along with the heaviest Sugar Snow that had been seen in a century. Alex was still distraught at Ravenna\u2019s death, and I ordered the servants to take him back to his room at the palace and lock him up, if need be, until his ensorcelled attachment could be broken.</p><p>There was so much more work to be done fixing Ravenna\u2019s mess. The weeks to come would take hard days and longs nights of restoring the diplomacy, the pacts, the affairs of state. The rioting Pinkies needed to be dealt with, but not in the cruel way that my people expected. Ravenna had let them run wild to distract the Bludmen from her other sins, but I wanted them to have rights of their own now, which was going to take some tricky footwork in the Blud Council. I would simply have to persuade my people that happy food tasted better. The vials the servants brought me to replenish myself after the bludding hardly seemed to make a dent in my own hunger, but with Casper by my side, I doubted I\u2019d be drinking from live Pinkies again, no matter how much I craved it. The Tsarina would live by example. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the last of the crowd had dispersed, I turned to wrap my arms around Casper\u2019s neck. My limbs were heavy with exhaustion, my dress splattered with blud and torn by Keen\u2019s frantic fingernails, but he didn\u2019t flinch from the gore. The airship bobbed high above us, brushing the highest boughs of the trees and dusting our heads with snow. I could hear the pirates celebrating up there, drinking their grog mixed with blood and singing \u201cAztarte Smiles on Bloodshed.\u201d We were as alone as we had been since the carriage.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d I asked him as his fingers stroked my fallen hair.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlay a song you\u2019d never heard before, a secret song, as if you had written it? How did you play it so well that the snow is still falling?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled into my neck, his entire body shaking with laughter. \u201cI was scared at first. But when I saw the first notes, I knew. It\u2019s the \u2018Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\u2019 from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Nutcracker. It\u2019s one of the most well-known songs ever written in my world. I learned it before I was ten.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop giggling, but I didn\u2019t have enough breath to join in. \u201cOf all the music Sang has never seen, I can\u2019t believe that song\u2019s the Bludmen\u2019s great secret.\u201d</p><p>I smiled weakly and sighed, glad that Aztarte, or fortune, was on our side. Casper pulled me closer, and over his shoulder, I watched Keen pillaging the dessert table, delighting in her first taste of bloodsweets as she tried to fill the emptiness from repeated draining, a feeling I knew all too well.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a tenacious creature, that one,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBah. All in a day\u2019s work for the Tsarina. I\u2019m nearly invulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never felt that way until you came along. Walt Whitman once said that those who love each other shall become invincible. I understand it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything about sleep?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment, one arm idly stroking my back. \u201cHe said that making the best person involves open air and good food and sleeping with the earth.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and stood on shaky feet, holding out a hand to pull him up beside me. \u201cForget the earth. I\u2019ve got an enormous bed, over there in that palace. Let me introduce you.\u201d</p><p>41</p> <p>Some days later, I woke to the sound of the harpsichord. With my ermine robe dragging on the carpet behind me, I padded down the stairs to the parlor. The scene before me was like a dream. All of the people I had fought for at the Sugar Snow Ball were there, together, breakfasting in the golden-warm morning of the Ice Palace.</p><p>Casper sat curled over the keyboard in breeches and open shirt, playing some strange song from his world, a mirror of the first time I met him. Keen lounged on the floor before the fire, taunting a brood of wolfhound puppies with her clockwork tortoise as my brother excitedly tried to explain the dogs\u2019 lineage. Ravenna\u2019s magic was hard to break, which meant that Alex\u2019s ailment was all but cured, yet he still mourned the woman he had believed to be his fianc\u00e9e. Casper had already written to Criminy Stain, requesting his aid in separating the spells so that Alex could live a normal life but give up Ravenna\u2019s ghost.</p><p>As for Keen, she had taken to the bludding better than expected. I had called her tenacious, but it was more than that. She had a fierce will to live and survive against all odds, and even she seemed to recognize that she had little right to complain. Her life in the other world had been a hard one, and her life in London had been harder, and now she was nearly invulnerable and living in the biggest castle on the continent, with all the food, free time, and bludponies she\u2019d ever wanted. She hadn\u2019t shown me any gratitude for saving her life, but I didn\u2019t expect her to. I\u2019d said often enough myself that princesses didn\u2019t say thank you, and she was officially Olgha II of Freesia, as much as she hated the name. She would have several years of freedom before her responsibilities actually became an impediment, but I dreaded the day of her majority, when I would have to force her into a dress and a crown to sit for her portrait. For now, it was enough that she was alive and smiling.</p><p>I curled up in my favorite chaise by the window, and a servant placed a steaming cup of blud tea in my hand, the porcelain painted with tiny violets.</p><p>\u201cNot playing about Jude today?\u201d I called to Casper, and he grinned and ended the song with a little trill. I watched him walk to my chaise, the very picture of a Bludman, confident and beautiful and sure. He moved my feet aside and sat.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s called \u2018And I Love Her,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBy the same band but a little less mournful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come to terms with your miserable little life, then?\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the grandest parlor in the northern hemisphere. \u201cThe world is before me. Although I\u2019ll always regret not taking one more swim in the sea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sea. How revolting.\u201d I sipped my blood-tinged tea.</p><p>He took my bare feet into his lap, tracing my ankles in a way that made shivers run up my legs. \u201cIs there anything you regret, Ahna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI regret not getting to rip out Ravenna\u2019s throat. She died horribly, but I had so looked forward to that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to want my head on a pike,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cMine, too!\u201d Keen called.</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cThat was before you proved yourselves useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not useful,\u201d Keen hollered, and I smiled indulgently. I wasn\u2019t about to tell her how useful a princess could be.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Casper asked.</p><p>I raised my hands. \u201cFor you? This. Just this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting around, sipping blood? Doing nothing? That doesn\u2019t sound like the Ahna I know.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s see. We need to hammer out a new peace accord with the king of Sveden, and we\u2019ll start by sending him some decapitated dandy heads. We need to send thanks to Reve and an assassin to Mr. Sweeting. My sister\u2019s head needs a proper burial on Freesian soil. We must find a way to shift the balance between Bludmen and Pinkies so that Pinkies are servants instead of slaves. I need to call Verusha back to the palace, since no one can do my hair quite like she can. I need to send a bag of silvers to Miss May to pay for the parachutes and the glass tank I broke on the Maybuck. I need to rewrite the laws regarding tsarinas marrying musicians.\u201d I looked to the wolfhounds by the fire. \u201cAnd I think we need to start importing cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what shall I do?\u201d He held out his hand, which had darkened properly, and I took it in mine.</p><p>\u201cYour first act as court composer is to write a song for me. About our adventures. A ballad.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and looked down. \u201cA song of ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to write a book. It\u2019s going to be called Blades of Grass.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over to kiss him. \u201cWhat will it be about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoss. Redemption. Rebirth. Living many lives. Love. Death. Art. Beasts. About how fortunes come true in the strangest ways and not knowing what you need until it finds you. I finally realized why it doesn\u2019t exist here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t written it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was thinking, my Tsarina. Do you approve?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a benign, queenly smile. \u201cDo anything you wish, Maestro, but let it produce joy.\u201d</p><p>With a hasty glance at Keen and Alex, he yanked me onto his lap and stood, carrying me like a child. Pulling me close and ignoring their mortified stares, his breath hot on my ear, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish to do, and I assure you it will produce more than joy.\u201d I struggled to squirm out of his grasp, but he held me tight and set his teeth gently in the curve of my ear.</p><p>I shrieked as he carried me upstairs, glad to know I couldn\u2019t escape him, gladder still to know I didn\u2019t wish to do so. It was good being the one who made the rules.</p><p>Turn the page</p><p>for an exclusive sneak peek</p><p>at the next sexy romance in the BLUD series</p><p>Available from Pocket Books</p><p>Spring 2014</p><p>\u201cCriminy\u2019s going to kill us.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at Cherie and leaned my head against the worn cushion of the jouncing carriage, which was moving across Franchia at a fast clip, spiriting us from Ruin to Paris. My best friend sounded way too much like my conscience. I was fairly certain she would nag me to death long before our ex-boss discovered that we had escaped from our chaperone and taken off on our own. My idea, of course.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to find us before he can kill us. Paris is a big city, mon petit chouchou.\u201d I elbowed her in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, Demi?\u201d She elbowed me right back.</p><p>\u201cIt means I called you a cabbage. It\u2019s a French\u2014I mean, Franchian\u2014term of endearment. And did you know you have seriously pointy elbows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, running out on Mademoiselle Caprice and taking all her coppers. Criminy\u2019s going to kill her, too, for being a bad chaperone. What was so horrible about going to the University of Ruin, anyway?\u201d</p><p>We hit a pothole, and my head was knocked against the wood, loosening a long dark brown curl to dangle in my eyes. I sat up straighter and sighed. \u201cI wanted an adventure. I didn\u2019t want to be a boring contortionist in the boring caravan anymore, and I didn\u2019t want to go back to college, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to college?\u201d</p><p>I put my head on her shoulder, my mouth to her ear behind a curled glove. The other passengers didn\u2019t know we were Bludmen or that I was a Stranger from another world called Earth. We would be in serious trouble if they found out we were bloodsuckers\u2014not the nice, normal, Pinky girls we appeared to be. \u201cI guess I never told you. I was at university when I . . . when I ended up in Sang. When Criminy found me and saved me. Bludded me. I was a student, in my world. I hated it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I scowled behind my hand, but her confusion was genuine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was easy to forget that Cherie had grown up poor and freezing in the forests of Freesia. To her, the caravan was a life of warmth and wealth and security. And I had taken that from her when I decided to leave. Breathing in the scent of pine and vanilla, her favorite shampoo, I felt a rush of love for the first person who\u2019d reached out to me when I arrived in Criminy\u2019s caravan, naked and confused and newly blood-hungry. She\u2019d hugged me and taken me in like a lost duckling, teaching me how to drink blood from vials without staining my clothes and showing me how to line my eyes with kohl like the other girls.</p><p>When I looked at her, I saw only my dear friend, the closest thing I\u2019d ever had to a sister. Golden curls, eyes too innocent for a Bludwoman, pink cheeks, and an upturned nose. She looked like a little shepherdess doll. But to her, the University of Ruin represented untold wealth and opportunity. Most likely, no one in her entire family had ever been to university, much less a woman. I would have to remember, before we hit the city, that women in Sang didn\u2019t have the sort of freedom I had known back home in Greenville, South Carolina.</p><p>\u201cI guess I thought that once I left home and got to a new city, everything would be different. That I would make friends and get a boyfriend and do well in my classes without really trying. I thought life would be as pretty as it looked in the brochures. I thought that just getting away from my parents would suddenly make everything better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Kind of the opposite.\u201d</p><p>The Pinky gentleman across the carriage watched our whispered closeness with an unhealthy fascination, a creepy gleam growing behind his monocle. My instinct was to flash my fangs at him and hiss, but that would get us thrown off the carriage, if not killed. Instead, I pulled my head away from Cherie and locked eyes with the older man. After a few moments of my intense glaring, he cleared his throat juicily and looked away. The prim nursemaid beside him sniffed in disdain and sidled closer to her charge, a girl of about seventeen. The girl gave us an innocent, hopeful smile, which I was sure Cherie would return. We might have looked her age, but I was twenty-six, and Cherie was twenty-seven. There were benefits to being bludded, after all.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s important that we\u2014\u201d</p><p>I never found out what was important. Two sharp thuds set the bludmares screaming as the scent of fire reached my sensitive nose. Cherie\u2019s head whipped around, her eyes wide and alert. The coach shuddered with sudden violence, throwing us against each other and the walls. Flames caught at the curtains, black smoke rolling into the stuffy, airless space. The gentleman who\u2019d ogled us earlier threw open the door and froze, before tumbling out onto the ground, a flaming arrow lodged in his jabot. I leaped out, tugging Cherie behind me, trying to make sense of the chaos, while the young girl behind us clutched at her nurse with one hand and the carriage seat with the other and screamed bloody murder. I forgot myself and turned to hiss at her, which really only made her more annoyingly hysterical.</p> <p>A loud screech outside caught my attention. It was a metal conveyance, shaking and belching smoke. Dark, eyeless figures appeared in the haze, and I tried to run in the opposite direction. Cherie was motionless, stiff with fear.</p><p>\u201cRun, you idiot!\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The figures hovered closer, dark arms up as if to calm us, as if creepy ghost figures with torches could ever calm anyone. Gritting my teeth, I slapped Cherie\u2019s white face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a goddamn predator, Cherie. Act like it. Run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou start. I\u2019ll follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and coughed out black smoke. Springing into action, I vaulted over the thrashing, burning, screaming bodies of the once-white bludmares and charged into the waist-high grass of the moors. Arrows thwacked over my head, and I dived and rolled, clawing through the grass and into a thick pricker bush that would have torn apart anyone not wearing so many layers of city clothes.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Come on come on come on,\u201d I chanted, waiting for Cherie to follow me.</p><p>With the screaming of the girl in the coach and the bludmares dying on the ground, the conveyance\u2019s rattling, the sound of fire, and the thrashing of the grass as the cloaked figures hunted me, I couldn\u2019t hear anything. I didn\u2019t dare peek up or call out for Cherie. I would have to hope that her inner strength had overcome her fear, that she was waiting somewhere, crouched, as I was, hiding under the heavy gray sky. I was one of the few people who understood Cherie\u2019s quiet tenacity and power, and I prayed it wouldn\u2019t fail her now.</p><p>The screaming stopped all at once, leaving only the rumbling of the conveyance and the eerie whispering of the wind in the grass. I took a deep breath, trying to scent Cherie, but only smoke and charred meat reached me. When the conveyance\u2019s rattling quieted, I rubbed my ears. It took me an extra moment to realize the sound was fading as the vehicle moved rapidly away. I stood in a crouch and found only a trail of exhaust lingering over the road. The machine was far off now, low-slung, dark, and mean, like a charred raven\u2019s skull. And faster than anything I\u2019d seen since coming to Sang.</p><p>\u201cCherie?\u201d</p><p>The only sound that reached me was the crackling of the burning coach. And the burning bodies around it. I was about to rush over and hunt for Cherie when I heard the loud, nasal sound of a horn.</p> <p>I dropped to the ground, the adrenaline finally running out and leaving me cold and wobbly. A bludbunny darted past me with a bleeding human finger in its mouth. The next one stopped by my boot to hiss, nearly dropping an ear.</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not that desperate.\u201d I started to sit up and fell back, dizzy.</p><p>What the hell had just happened? We had been attacked. But why? And where was Cherie?</p><p>The horn sounded again, and I put my hands over my ears. My head was pounding\u2014at least, I thought it was. Then the pounding turned into the slamming of hoof-beats against the packed road. A large group of horsemen was coming, and there was no way to know whether they were friends or foes. All I cared about was finding Cherie, and whoever they were, I didn\u2019t want their help. Or their hindrance. I burrowed deeper into the bushes and flopped onto my back, pretending to be unconscious.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Just missed them!\u201d an older man\u2019s gruff voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cNicely done, Vale.\u201d That voice was younger, smug and nasty.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Blame the guy who had to take a piss.\u201d A third voice, sarcastic and dry.</p><p>The horses skidded to a stop somewhere to my left. The way they screamed and pawed at the earth told me that they were bludmares, and lots of them, far more than necessary for the three voices I\u2019d heard. I struggled to hold very, very still. Bludman or not, with a crowd of any males, the likelihood of a lone young woman being raped on the roads of Sang was just as high as at a frat party back home.</p><p>\u201cTen of you\u2014swords out and after the slavers. Three more in each direction, hunting for survivors. Don\u2019t return until you hear the horn. Lorn and Vale, with me.\u201d The old man sighed, and I could imagine him. Paunchy, starting to stoop, a barbarian in decline, wiping his balding head under the Franchian gloom. \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this merde.\u201d</p><p>Even with my eyes closed and my body hidden, I could sense a strange tension in the drawn-out pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look over there, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing over there, Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Soft footsteps spelled anger in the dirt. The sarcastic one was moving toward me, and if he got too close, the pricker bush and grasses wouldn\u2019t conceal my overly bright teal dress. Damn it. Why couldn\u2019t I have just stayed unconscious for this part or dressed in the boring green of the moors? And where was Cherie? I couldn\u2019t smell her. Couldn\u2019t smell any of the bodies I knew so well from our time jostling together in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cOnly the coachman and a gentleman, Father. No women.\u201d The smug voice was far away and muffled, and I could easily picture a swarthy pirate with the arm of his floofy blouse over his mouth and nose to keep out the scent of burning flesh.</p><p>\u201cVale? Anything?\u201d</p><p>Nearer me, Vale struck the bushes with a stick. I could smell him, a strange m\u00e9lange of good and bad and spices. He reminded me a little of Veruca the Abyssinian, the caravan\u2019s sword swallower, and I guessed he was a half-breed of some sort. The overall effect was like a succulent piece of meat under a dusting of herbs that wasn\u2019t exactly to your taste.</p><p>\u201cI found a bush!\u201d The shout was falsely bright, and I struggled not to grin. My teeth clacked together seconds later as his stick poked my thigh through several layers of skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil?\u201d</p><p>I could hear twigs breaking under his hands, and in a moment of panic, I sat straight up and grabbed him by the collar, yanking him dangerously close without time to look at his face. To his credit, he didn\u2019t topple over or shout. Into a golden tan ear with three gleaming rings in the lobe, I whispered, \u201cSilence. I am not in the mood to be identified. Or raped.\u201d</p><p>With a soft laugh, he whispered, \u201cExcellent. I\u2019m not in the mood to rape.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t shout or otherwise broadcast my existence, I let go of his shirt, noting that up close, he smelled like a chai latte mixed with hearth smoke and starlight, a gypsy in ways that Criminy Stain was not. He pulled away gently, no sudden moves, and studied me. I scooted back and wrapped my arms around my trembling knees, realizing how close my lips had been to a seriously hot guy.</p><p>Chardonnay-colored eyes lined in black and set in molten tan skin regarded me with a cat\u2019s mixed disdain and curiosity. He had a two-day beard that framed full lips and matched his recently shorn hair, which wasn\u2019t normally my style but totally worked in his favor. He was dressed all in black, like the Dread Pirate Roberts, sitting back on his haunches with a loose-limbed confidence that made my limbs a little looser, too. His eyes blended in with the moors perfectly, an endless, shifting amber green like a glass of chilled wine that made me feel thirsty all over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnything behind that bush, Vale?\u201d</p><p>I jerked and flailed at his father\u2019s shouted words, and Vale\u2019s lips curled up, revealing white teeth.</p><p>His eyes raked from my mussed hat down to the tall leather boots peeking out from beneath foamy black layers of petticoats, as if he were pondering which end of a Chinese buffet to start at. I\u2019d felt like a stone-cold predator since waking in Sang under Criminy\u2019s bloody wrist, but now my middle went hot and soft.</p> <p>\u201cJust the prettiest girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d My mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cLazy, lying bugger!\u201d</p><p>Something plinked against Vale\u2019s back, and he laughed and held up a river-smooth stone for me to see.</p><p>\u201cGet to work, you worthless ass!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, unaffected. Barely loud enough to be heard, he said, \u201cSometimes I tell the truth. It keeps them guessing.\u201d Another stone thwacked him in the head, and he rubbed it with a black-gloved hand. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Before I could respond, he had disappeared, leaving shivering leaves and skin in his wake.</p> <p>I flopped onto my back, just in case one of the other men should doubt his lie this time. Eyes open, staring at the lavender-gray clouds, I listened for more footsteps. Partly because I wanted to avoid notice and partly because I wanted Vale to come back and look at me as if I were a candy apple waiting to be licked all over. But most of all, I wanted them all to leave so I could find Cherie.</p><p>I didn\u2019t smell her anywhere near, couldn\u2019t smell anything over the smoke and, now, the gypsies. But from the men\u2019s shouts, at least I knew they hadn\u2019t found a body. She was small and agile and clever, and I could only hope she was hiding in another copse or backed into an empty bludbadger den, waiting for the pesky band of gypsies to finish its plundering and go the hell home. Maybe Cherie was a predator, but she was also a beautiful young woman, and all we knew of Franchia was ancient history from our daimon dancing mistress. Who knew what dangers actually lurked here?</p><p>The hooves of a single horse pounded close, the bludmare\u2019s scream protesting her rider\u2019s harsh treatment.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, boss. The same slavers riding hell-bent for Paris in that damnable fast conveyance. Farther along than we thought. But the others might still catch \u2019em before they\u2019re into the underground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat humping Hades!\u201d I could hear echoes of the old man\u2019s greatness in the bellow of his baritone. Bludmare squeals and the squeaks of butts in saddles meant I would soon be alone again. \u201cLorn, you\u2019re with me. Vale, you keep poking around your precious bushes. Dig through the rubble. Bring in at least a silver\u2019s worth of plunder, or don\u2019t bother to come home.\u201d He spit in the dirt, and despite my ambivalence, I flinched. That was some cold shit.</p><p>I barely heard Vale\u2019s muttered \u201cHave fun in the catacombs, arsehole.\u201d</p> <p>The horn sounded, and the horses took off amid the men\u2019s whoops and hollers. I sat up before Vale could pry his way through the bushes, smoothing my bangs and licking my lips and hoping I looked less like a twitterpated girl and more like a sophisticated, exotic, and possibly dangerous lady on a mission gone awry.</p><p>\u201cWe keep meeting like this.\u201d He grinned and held out a hand, and I took it, well aware that the two gloves between us lessened the heat no more than grabbing a hot cast-iron skillet with a paper towel. I stood, but he didn\u2019t let me loose. \u201cI\u2019m Vale Hildebrand, first son of Curse Hildebrand.\u201d He paused as if waiting for a response. \u201cLord of the Infamous Brigands of Ruin . . . ? Nothing? Really?\u201d Dark eyebrows swept up, and he rubbed the stubble on his chin. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re hard to impress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not from around here. Name\u2019s Demi Ward.\u201d Then, before he could derail me, \u201cHave you seen another girl, about my age and size but blond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re the only one today. Maybe I should start setting snares.\u201d</p><p>He released my hand, and I stood tall, but not quite tall enough to look him in the eye. \u201cMy best friend is gone. We were on the coach together\u2014it was just us and another girl and her chaperone and a gentleman. Headed to Paris.\u201d</p><p>He put a hand on the small crossbow on his belt but refused to look away. \u201cWho wore the pumpkin-colored dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chaperone. An old nursemaid.\u201d</p><p>Vale exhaled and jerked his head toward the smoking coach. \u201cThere\u2019s a bloodstained scrap of orange ribbon. Old bat must\u2019ve fought hard. No sign of your friend or the other girl.\u201d His hand landed on the puffed shoulder of my gown, and I took a deep breath to meet it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We try to catch the slavers before they swoop in, but they\u2019re fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSlavers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe call them slavers, although we honestly don\u2019t know what happens to them once they get into the catacombs under Paris. They mostly take young girls, although they\u2019ll sometimes take an older woman or a young man. Probably sell \u2019em as servants or concubines, once they\u2019re into the city.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe, and my back felt more boneless than usual. \u201cDo you never find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once they\u2019re underground.\u201d His eyes went skittery, and I knew he was lying. \u201cSometimes we can catch the slavers at the scene, scare them off before they take down the coach. They wear dark cloaks and masks, favor flaming arrows over a personal attack. They shoot the bludmares, set the carriage aflame, then everyone runs out flapping like chickens. Easy pickings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw. What about my friend?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my shoulder and gave me the warm but useless smile someone might give a child at a funeral. \u201cI know I\u2019m a complete failure, but the rest of \u2019em are sharp as hell and twice as fast. There\u2019s still time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded once and walked to his giant black-and-white-spotted bludmare where she stomped around a picket driven deep into the earth. She tossed her muzzle at me, and I shoved the metal cap away, sending bloody froth flying.</p><p>Vale blanched. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on to your waist really tightly? Yeah, I know. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He allowed himself a smirk. \u201cLook, b\u00e9b\u00e9. Just wait until the rest of the band gets back. We\u2019ll take you to our camp, and the women will feed you and help you wash up. We\u2019re brigands, but we\u2019re honorable, and we can get you home safely in a wagon with a lot less bouncing and biting.\u201d He winked. \u201cNot that I would mind you bumping against me for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re wasting your breath. Nice girls don\u2019t ride into Paris bareback on a brigand\u2019s hellbitch.\u201d</p><p>With a snort, I stepped out of the mare\u2019s reach, took a deep breath, and bent over backward into a C. From the backbend, I walked my hands between my feet, curling under until my forearms were on the ground beneath my skirt. Putting my boots on my own shoulders, I felt the frothy layers of the dress fall down around me, giving him a fine look at the slim-fitting trousers I favored for just such an occasion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that nice. And I\u2019m not a girl.\u201d I grinned, showing fangs.</p><p>To his credit, he didn\u2019t freak out. Just put his head to the side like a crow watching a jewel glint in the sun. For the first time, his tone went serious, quiet. \u201cNow, that I did not expect. Tell me, Demi. What is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d I did a front walkover and turned to face him with a swirl of skirts. \u201cI want you to take me to Paris and help me find my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay we find her. Say we don\u2019t. What\u2019s your endgame, b\u00e9b\u00e9? Why Paris?\u201d</p><p>I windmilled my arms, loosening up. I was a little sore after the crash, not to mention the previous hours I\u2019d spent crammed between Cherie\u2019s shoulder and the wooden wall of the carriage. Just to see what he would do and to stretch out further, I slowly lifted one leg until it was right beside my ear, perfectly pointed straight up.</p><p>\u201cI want to go to Mortmartre and be the star of the cabaret, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no Bludmen in the cabarets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. There will be. After I find Cherie, there will be two. We\u2019re an act.\u201d I dropped my leg\u2014and my smile. \u201cSo are we going or what?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and looked off into the hazy distance where a single dark spear pierced the clouds. The Tower, they called it\u2014some daimon scientist\u2019s clever way to attract and channel lightning into electricity for the City of Light. Paris wasn\u2019t tall and humpbacked like Sanglish cities but sprawled, orderly and leisurely, in neat squares. The daimons weren\u2019t known for leading lives of fear, nor were the humans who had taken up residence alongside them. There was a wall, of course, but they\u2019d given the artists free rein to make it beautiful, from what I\u2019d heard. Daimons made things much nicer than Pinkies, as I was learning since touching down in Franchia.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a hard ride. If you fall off, I\u2019m going to laugh at you. Odalisque is a bitch of a mare, and there\u2019s no room for you on the saddle. And when we get to Paris, sneaking in is going to be messy. But if you\u2019re determined, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t take me now, I\u2019ll start walking.\u201d I realized what I\u2019d said a heartbeat after he did and almost dived back into the bush to die of embarrassment in peace.</p><p>\u201cHow can a gentleman turn down a threat like that?\u201d</p><p>With practiced movements, he snatched out the mare\u2019s tether and slid the picket spike through a slot in the metal muzzle cap to make reins. He threw them over Odalisque\u2019s head as she danced, then leaped onto the saddle and held down an arm for me. I took it, surprised at his strength as he swung me up behind him, his wide, crystal-green eyes showing in turn his own surprise at my strength. The mare screamed and crow-hopped, trying to shake me loose, and he jerked the reins and kicked her.</p><p>I held on for dear life as Odalisque reared and bucked before collecting herself for a pounding gallop. I fastened my arms around Vale\u2019s lean waist and settled my cheek against his muscled back, inhaling deeply and willing the horse beast to run faster toward Cherie, toward a city where I could at least focus on something besides the strange man under the worn black shirt. Back in the caravan, I had ached for a goal, a quest, something to care about. My wish had definitely been answered, but not in the way I had hoped. The adventure wasn\u2019t important, not until I got my best friend back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019m going to rip you to shreds?\u201d I asked, trying to cover the fact that I\u2019d all but nuzzled the hard muscles of his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half Abyssinian.
