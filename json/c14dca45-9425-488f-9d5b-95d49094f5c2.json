Grateful for the end of his shift, Mack McAfee turned the corner onto Evergreen Place and approached his house, the duplex at 1022. He felt an instant sense of peace when he saw Mary Jo Wyse working in the garden, taking advantage of the longer days and the perfection of a Pacific Northwest spring. At six, the sun was still bright and the sky had the clean-washed look of early May. Mack had to smile as he watched Mary Jo. The young single mother was his tenant, his friend\u2014and the woman he\u2019d fallen for. Hard. Lovely as ever, she wore jeans and a pink, long-sleeved top that clung in all the right places. Noelle was asleep in a stroller a few feet away.</p><p>Mack had delivered the baby last Christmas\u2014or assisted in her delivery; that was probably a better way to put it. He\u2019d just joined the Cedar Cove Fire Department and as the most recent hire, he\u2019d pulled duty on Christmas Eve. It\u2019d been a quiet night until the call from the Harding ranch. A woman said she was about to give birth. Mack had taken a medical course and received his emergency medical technician certificate, but nothing he\u2019d learned had prepared him for the exhilaration of being at a delivery. The moment little Noelle drew her first breath she\u2019d completely won him over.</p><p>Noelle and her mother had laid claim to Mack\u2019s heart.</p> <p>Mack parked on his side of the driveway and climbed out of the truck. He was outwardly calm, but his thoughts were in chaos. He hadn\u2019t seen either of them in two days.</p><p>With his help, Mary Jo had planted a small garden, which she tended daily. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, getting up from her knees. She brushed the dirt from her pant legs and glanced at him with a shy smile.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he responded. Afraid that Mary Jo would be able to interpret his feelings, he studied the neat row of green seedlings that had begun to poke through the earth. Mary Jo was still suspicious of men, thanks to her experience with David Rhodes, although Mack was making a serious effort to gain her trust. \u201cThe garden\u2019s starting to take shape, I see.\u201d</p><p>He crouched down and peeked at Noelle, who slept contentedly with one small clenched fist raised above her head. The baby mesmerized him. For that matter, so did Mary Jo....</p><p>\u201cI...missed seeing you the past couple of days,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p> <p>That was encouraging. \u201cYou did?\u201d He hated to sound too eager since he was treading carefully in this relationship. He\u2019d made a big mistake with her and was almost afraid of what would happen next.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. The last time we talked, well...you know.\u201d</p><p>Mack straightened and nervously shoved his hands in his back pockets.</p><p>\u201cYou told me it wasn\u2019t a good idea for us to continue with the engagement,\u201d she said, although he didn\u2019t need any reminder.</p><p>\u201cThat seemed for the best,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could qualify his remark, she broke in. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right, it is for the best, especially if you don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p> <p>Mack couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d actually said that. \u201cNo, I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, cutting him off again. \u201cYou proposed because you were trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Mack studied her through narrowed eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear from David Rhodes again, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head emphatically.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s biological father had threatened, more than once, to take the baby from Mary Jo, which Mack felt was nothing more than a bluff. But it had frightened her so badly that she\u2019d panicked and decided to move back to Seattle. Back to her brothers, who\u2019d look after her and the baby.</p><p>Afraid he was about to lose them both, Mack had suggested marriage. Mary Jo had accepted, with the stipulation that they have a six-month engagement.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only stipulation. She\u2019d insisted there be no physical contact. That was when Mack had realized his mistake. Mary Jo\u2019s sole reason for moving to Cedar Cove had been to escape her domineering older brothers. In offering to marry her, Mack was doing exactly what they\u2019d done. His motive had been to keep a close watch over her, to protect her. Because he loved her, yes, but without recognizing it, he\u2019d assumed the role her brothers had played in her life. No wonder Mary Jo had stalled their relationship.</p><p>A few days after they became engaged, he noticed the shift in her attitude. No longer did she treat him as her friend. No longer could they tease and joke and affectionately kiss. He\u2019d taken control of a situation in her life, squelching Mary Jo\u2019s first tentative efforts toward independence. She\u2019d said yes to his proposal, but it wasn\u2019t because she loved him.</p> <p>A month passed before Mack figured out what was wrong and why he had to break off the engagement. In his eagerness to be with her, to marry her, he\u2019d nearly ruined everything.</p><p>At least neither of them had mentioned the engagement to their families. For his part Mack knew his parents would\u2019ve seen through his reasons immediately. They would\u2019ve said it was too soon, pointing out that Mack and Mary Jo didn\u2019t know each other well enough to make that kind of commitment.</p><p>They would\u2019ve been right.</p><p>Mack had acted on impulse, his desire to protect her overcoming his better judgment. He needed to bide his time and let the relationship progress naturally.</p><p>One problem was his lack of finesse with women. Not that he was totally naive, but none of his relationships prior to meeting Mary Jo had been serious or long-lasting.</p><p>He did have a sister\u2014two sisters, actually. Only he hadn\u2019t known about the second one until a few years ago. He\u2019d always been close to Linnette and had now begun to develop a friendship with Gloria.</p><p>Linnette had often advised him on relationships, but she\u2019d moved to some Podunk town in North Dakota. They managed regular phone conversations; despite that, Mack hadn\u2019t been smart enough to seek her opinion before he proposed to Mary Jo.</p><p>In trying to undo his mistake, Mack had committed another one. He\u2019d broken off the engagement by telling Mary Jo that although he was fond of her, his real love was for Noelle.</p><p>It\u2019d seemed like a reasonable approach at the time. He\u2019d hoped to back out of the engagement and save face as he did\u2014let her save face, too. Instead, he\u2019d further complicated an already complex relationship. If there\u2019d been a worse way to handle the situation, he couldn\u2019t imagine it.</p><p>What he should\u2019ve done was simply be honest. Whoever said honesty was the best policy\u2014Ben Franklin? Mother Teresa? Bill Clinton? Oprah?\u2014was absolutely correct.</p><p>Then the following morning, Mack had been on duty at the fire station. He\u2019d felt uncomfortable and anxious about seeing Mary Jo ever since. This was their first encounter since that day.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect to hear from David again,\u201d Mary Jo was saying. \u201cLike you said, I think it was an empty threat. He only wants Noelle so he can manipulate his father into giving him money.\u201d</p><p>Mack nodded. \u201cIf you do see him, call me and I\u2019ll deal with him.\u201d As soon as the words were out, Mack wished he could take them back. The whole point of breaking off the engagement was to let Mary Jo solve her own problems.</p><p>Instead of responding, she occupied herself with rearranging Noelle\u2019s blanket.</p><p>Mack rocked back on his heels and removed his hands from his pockets. He wanted to groan. Why couldn\u2019t he keep his mouth shut? \u201cI guess I should check the mail,\u201d he said with a sigh. He\u2019d just headed over to the mailbox when Mary Jo called him back.</p><p>\u201cI learned something about those letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetters?\u201d Mack asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThe ones I found under the floorboards in the closet.\u201d</p><p>That box of World War II letters had completely slipped his mind. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come by for dinner?\u201d she asked. She bit her lip, as if she wasn\u2019t confident that inviting him was such a good plan, after all. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel any obligation....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to,\u201d he said with more enthusiasm than he\u2019d intended. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re sure about having me over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Mack checked his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s quarter after six now. Shall we say in an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>His spirits lifted. Maybe he hadn\u2019t ruined everything the way he\u2019d feared. \u201cSee you then,\u201d he said with a relieved smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She smiled back, and he felt a sudden hopefulness.</p><p>Not until he was on his porch steps did it occur to him to ask if there was anything he could contribute. A salad? No, wine was probably better. He turned and, to his surprise, found Mary Jo watching him. Looking guilty, she glanced away.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I bring?\u201d he asked. \u201cFor dinner.\u201d</p><p>She gave a half shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve got chicken-and-vegetable stew in the Crock-Pot and I\u2019m making biscuits. I can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a bottle of wine?\u201d When she nodded, he said, \u201cSee you around seven.\u201d</p><p>After collecting the mail, Mack let himself into his side of the duplex, closed the door and breathed deeply. His sense of excitement was nearly overwhelming. In less than an hour he\u2019d have a chance to make up for the foolish, clumsy way he\u2019d ended the engagement\u2014with a lie. He\u2019d have a chance to start again, to reestablish their relationship on a more equal footing.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Mack had showered, shaved and changed clothes. He threw a load in the washing machine and set the dials. With another half hour to kill, he walked restlessly from room to room. This evening was important, and it could set the tone for many evenings to come.</p><p>In the past he\u2019d often visited Mary Jo and Noelle. She\u2019d regularly invited him over but not, he now suspected, out of any great desire for his company. Mary Jo was simply accustomed to having people around. Until recently she\u2019d lived with her three older brothers.</p><p>She\u2019d cooked for her family, although Mack knew they did their share of household chores. She was used to preparing meals for three hungry men; no wonder she always made enough to feed a family. So it was easy to invite an additional person, Mack told himself. She didn\u2019t make extra with him in mind.</p><p>Not that he was complaining. Far from it. He liked spending time with her, being part of her life. Entertaining Noelle\u2014that was his job most nights. He held and played with the baby while Mary Jo finished dinner preparations, and then later, they sat together and watched television or played cards. She had card sense, as his father would\u2019ve put it. They talked, too, but not about anything deep or too personal. They\u2019d talk about what they\u2019d read or seen on TV, or mutual friends and acquaintances in Cedar Cove. Both were careful to avoid religion and politics, although he guessed they held similar views.</p><p>At the end of the evening, he\u2019d kiss her good-night. After their so-called engagement, those kisses had become more brotherly than playful or passionate. That was what had initially convinced him the engagement was all wrong.</p><p>Considering the way David Rhodes had treated her, he understood that Mary Jo would be wary of entering a new relationship. Her trust in men\u2014and in her own ability to judge them\u2014had been badly shaken. But surely she\u2019d come to recognize that Mack was a man of his word. That he genuinely cared for her and the baby and would never do anything to bring them harm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He worried that he wasn\u2019t as good-looking as Rhodes. He wasn\u2019t as smooth, either, but that probably didn\u2019t attract Mary Jo anymore, not after being involved with a player like David. Unlike Rhodes, Mack wasn\u2019t tall, dark and handsome. He was just under six feet and his brown hair had a hint of auburn in it, which accounted for the sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of his nose. He was an average guy, he supposed. He might work for the fire department, but he doubted anyone would select him for one of those hunk calendars.</p><p>Mary Jo, however, was beautiful. He wasn\u2019t surprised that someone like David Rhodes would notice her. Mack had long decided that her beauty was part of the problem; it put her out of his league. He was sure she could have her pick of any man she wanted. All Mack could hope for was that, given enough time, she\u2019d want him.</p><p>When he knocked at her front door, Mary Jo immediately opened it, almost as if she\u2019d been waiting for him, although that was unlikely to be the case. Noelle cooed from her seat and waved her arms, and he chose to see that as a greeting just for him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d he asked. He handed Mary Jo the bottle of chilled pinot grigio he\u2019d taken from his fridge, then walked into the living room and reached for the baby. As he lifted her in his arms he grinned at Mary Jo. \u201cI\u2019ve only been away a couple of days and I swear she\u2019s grown two inches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe changes every single day,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cI see it, too.\u201d</p><p>He tickled Noelle\u2019s chin and she gurgled back, which made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cThere are those World War II letters,\u201d Mary Jo said, pointing at the coffee table.</p><p>Mack looked away from Noelle long enough to glance at the cigar box sitting there. He could tell it was faded and a little shabby. \u201cHow many letters were inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDozens. It didn\u2019t seem like that many when I found them, but the paper is really thin.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d been enthralled by her discovery. Mack was interested, too\u2014who wouldn\u2019t be? These letters were a direct link to history, a personal connection to some of the most momentous events of the previous century.</p><p>\u201cThe article I read on the internet called this paper onionskin and it said the letters were referred to as V-mail.\u201d She smiled at that. \u201cI think the V stands for victory.\u201d She sat on the sofa and Mack joined her, still holding the baby. He divided his attention between Mary Jo and Noelle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read them twice. They\u2019re addressed to Miss Joan Manry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Mack recalled the recipient\u2019s name, now that she mentioned it, although not the sender\u2019s. He cocked his head but couldn\u2019t read the return address. \u201cWho are they from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Jacob Dennison and he was a major stationed in Europe during the war. Some of his letters have black marks on them, but a lot of them don\u2019t have any at all. I assume those marks were put there by censors. You know, I read that there were over two hundred censorship offices. Their job was to ensure that military personnel didn\u2019t reveal anything sensitive in their letters.\u201d She paused. \u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t explain why these letters were hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that had more to do with Joan\u2019s circumstances than Jacob\u2019s,\u201d Mack said wryly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, even with the black marks, I\u2019ve been able to follow quite a bit. They\u2019re fascinating. I can hardly wait for you to read them.\u201d</p><p>Mack nodded, caught up in her excitement.</p><p>\u201cJoan worked at the Bremerton shipyard,\u201d Mary Jo went on, \u201cand she lived with her older sister. Elaine\u2014that\u2019s her sister\u2014was married and her husband was somewhere in the South Pacific. I gather Joan met the major at a USO dance and they started writing after he shipped out to England.\u201d</p><p>Mack gently bounced the baby, to Noelle\u2019s evident approval. \u201cI\u2019d like to take a look at the letters,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the first one. I put them in chronological order.\u201d She unfolded the letter carefully and handed it to him.</p><p>Maj. Jacob Dennison</p><p>36354187 Hgs. Co.</p><p>Hgs. Cond. 1st</p> <p>Service Platoon.</p><p>U.K. Base APO 413%P&gt;M&gt; N.Y., N.Y.</p><p>January 15, 1944</p><p>Dear Joan,</p><p>How\u2019s my best gal? My only gal! I just got another letter from you. When I was given the envelope and saw the return address it gave me the biggest smile. I read it three times because it made me feel even closer to you. I\u2019m awfully homesick, but I close my eyes and see your face and everything seems better. I think about you a lot; it helps me when I can remember familiar places and people I care about.</p><p>Until I joined the Army I\u2019d never left the state of Washington. My mom and dad write me, too. My brother\u2019s in the South Pacific and is seeing a lot of action. Sometimes I wish I\u2019d joined the Marines instead of the Army because I\u2019m eager to do my part to end this war. No one knows when the invasion\u2019s going to happen. Soon, I hope. They have us training day and night. I\u2019m getting to where I\u2019m almost used to leaping out of an airplane. That sounds nuts, doesn\u2019t it? My mother always said I was a daredevil. I guess she was right.</p><p>I\u2019m glad you got the Christmas gift I mailed you. Sorry it arrived late. I hope that when Christmas rolls around this year I\u2019ll be with you. I thought about that a lot when I heard Bing Crosby on the radio singing \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say about Elaine. I feel bad that she\u2019s causing you problems. I wish I could figure out what she objects to about me. Would it help if I wrote her a letter? I\u2019ll do whatever you say\u2014anything other than not have you as my girl.</p><p>I\u2019ll write more when I can.</p><p>Hugs and kisses,</p><p>Jacob</p><p>Mack finished the letter and set it aside. He read the next two in quick succession.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t these letters wonderful?\u201d Mary Jo was watching his reaction avidly.</p><p>Mack had to agree. \u201cYeah, they are.\u201d He reached for another.</p><p>Maj. Jacob Dennison</p><p>36354187 Hgs. Co.</p><p>Hgs. Cond. 1st</p><p>Service Platoon.</p><p>U.K. Base APO 413%P&gt;M&gt; N.Y., N.Y.</p><p>March 3, 1944</p><p>Dear Joan,</p><p>How\u2019s my best gal? I got a day pass earlier in the week and went to London and ate fish and chips. They were the most delicious I ever tasted, and that\u2019s saying something, since I was born and raised near Puget Sound. My dad loved to fish and my mom fried up the best trout you can imagine. This fish was different and they served it wrapped up in newspaper. I even took the train to Stratford and got to see one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Did you ever see King Lear? I\u2019m not much for that fancy language, but it was a good story and it broke up the monotony. Some of the guys got drunk and didn\u2019t get back to base on time. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I drank my share of brew, but I was smart enough not to overdo it.</p><p>Thank you for writing. I can\u2019t tell you how much your letters mean to me. The instant I see 1022 Evergreen Place on the corner of the envelope, my spirits rise. Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you, Joan. You said it\u2019s too soon for me to tell you that, but I know what I feel. It isn\u2019t just being away from home like you suggested, either. This is real. You said you can\u2019t really get to know a person through letters. I think you can. I feel as though I know you, and can you honestly say you don\u2019t know me? When I get home, God willing, I\u2019ll ask you properly, down on one knee, to be my wife.</p><p>I\u2019ll write again tomorrow. Write me again, too. I\u2019ll keep in touch as much as I can. It\u2019s lights-out so I\u2019ll sign off for now.</p><p>Hugs and kisses,</p><p>Jacob</p><p>Mary Jo leaned forward slightly. \u201cWere you able to find out anything about the previous house owner?\u201d she asked. \u201cI want to learn whatever I can about Joan and Jacob.\u201d</p><p>Mack had forgotten that he\u2019d volunteered to check with \u201cthe landlord\u201d\u2014although it was hardly necessary, since he owned the duplex. He regretted now that he\u2019d lied to Mary Jo about that. He knew she\u2019d be upset at the low rent he was charging her if she realized he was her landlord. She\u2019d feel he was patronizing her or maybe that he expected something in return. Mack suppressed a despairing sigh. He just kept digging himself a deeper hole. One of these days he\u2019d have to tell her the truth\u2014and he would, when the time felt right. Although he wasn\u2019t quite sure how he\u2019d recognize that moment of clarity...</p><p>\u201cI did say I\u2019d look into that, didn\u2019t I? I apologize, but I haven\u2019t got to it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, accepting his answer easily enough. \u201cReady to eat?\u201d</p><p>He saw that the table was set, with the pot of stew and a plate of biscuits placed in the middle of the table, wine and water glasses by each plate.</p><p>\u201cI fed Noelle before you got here,\u201d she told him.</p><p>That was his cue to put the baby back in her seat and sit down at the table, which he did. Mary Jo was an excellent cook\u2014as good as his mother, and that was a real compliment. Her own parents died when she was still in high school, and she\u2019d taken over kitchen duties, more out of necessity than desire. Still, she seemed to enjoy cooking and took pride in putting together meals that were nutritious as well as appealing.</p><p>He was no slouch in the kitchen, if he did say so himself, but until she\u2019d moved in next door, his meals had been haphazard affairs. Other than when it was his turn at the firehouse, he never really bothered with cooking. He usually relied on frozen microwave dinners or the various fast-food choices available in Cedar Cove. He didn\u2019t make a habit of dropping by unannounced at his parents\u2019, but whenever he did, his mother always insisted he stay for dinner. Mack didn\u2019t often refuse.</p><p>\u201cHey, this is great,\u201d he told Mary Jo after the first bite. And it was. Tender chunks of chicken, fresh vegetables that weren\u2019t cooked to mush, lots of flavorful broth. The biscuits that accompanied it melted in his mouth. \u201cA guy could get used to eating like this,\u201d he said jovially.</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>Oh, boy, he\u2019d done it again. Would he never learn? \u201cI, uh, didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded. I just wanted you to know the meal\u2019s delicious.... I\u2019m not suggesting anything else.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo carefully set her fork next to her plate. \u201cI was afraid of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d He swallowed before he\u2019d finished chewing, and the biscuit nearly stuck in his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still awkward between us, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, grabbing his wineglass and gulping down a mouthful.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to work so hard, Mack.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, unsure what she meant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. She seemed satisfied. \u201cFriends are comfortable with each other. We shouldn\u2019t worry that what we say is going to be taken wrong or out of context.\u201d</p><p>He coughed and nodded again.</p><p>\u201cThen relax and enjoy yourself. Stop worrying that I\u2019ll be offended, okay?\u201d She sent him a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. This comment was supposed to put him at ease, and yet her words had the opposite effect. Yes, they were friends, but Mack had hoped they would be so much more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two</p><p>It still felt strange, yet, oh, so wonderful, to wake up every morning with his wife beside him. Linc Wyse had grown accustomed to married life with a speed that astonished him. He\u2019d been caught up in a whirlwind from the moment he met Lori Bellamy.</p><p>Less than two months ago, her car had broken down on the highway. Linc had been in Cedar Cove checking up on his stubborn little sister, who\u2019d moved out of the family home and into a duplex next door to McAfee. The firefighter had delivered Noelle, and next thing Linc knew, the guy was her neighbor. He seemed to be over at Mary Jo\u2019s far too often, and Linc considered it his responsibility\u2014his duty\u2014to make sure nothing untoward was going on. He wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with the situation his sister had gotten herself into now. One man had already taken advantage of her, and Linc wasn\u2019t letting that happen again. He didn\u2019t care how many times Mary Jo told him to butt out and to stop interfering.</p><p>Lori made a faint, waking sound, then yawned and arched her back before snuggling into Linc\u2019s arms. \u201cIs it morning?\u201d she asked, still groggy with sleep.</p> <p>Linc kissed the top of her head. Mornings with Lori were the very best of his life. \u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d She leaned over to turn off the clock radio, cutting off a traffic report in midsentence.</p><p>When she started to toss aside the covers, Linc stopped her. \u201cNo need to get up so soon, is there?\u201d He nuzzled her neck and slipped his arm around her, bringing her closer. She was warm and soft and infinitely lovely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were the sort of man who liked to linger in bed,\u201d Lori teased as she slid her arms around his neck. Her breasts grazed his chest and he briefly closed his eyes at the sensation.</p><p>\u201cI never used to be,\u201d he murmured. \u201cUntil now.\u201d She had no idea how true that was. As the oldest, Linc had held the family together after his parents died\u2014the family and the business.</p> <p>He was the first one at the car repair shop every morning and the last one to leave at night. All he\u2019d done was work and worry. He worried about his family, about the business, about the economy. If there was something to lose sleep over, Linc was ready to take it on.</p><p>Then he\u2019d met Lori.</p><p>His relationships with women had always soured and he\u2019d never been able to figure out where he\u2019d gone wrong. But it was definitely a pattern; he\u2019d meet someone, things would be great for a while and then it was over. He didn\u2019t understand it. Mary Jo claimed he was too \u201cbossy\u201d and \u201ccontrolling\u201d but she wasn\u2019t exactly a relationship expert, so he ignored her opinion\u2014and the cycle of ever-shorter romances had continued. But all of that changed the night he\u2019d stopped to help when Lori\u2019s car had broken down.</p><p>He\u2019d nearly driven past. He\u2019d already put in a long day and he was still annoyed by the heated argument he\u2019d had with his sister. But he\u2019d stopped, because if it was Mary Jo stranded there on the highway Linc would want someone like him to help. So he\u2019d pulled over. Lori\u2019s car had run out of gas and he\u2019d taken her to a service station. They\u2019d ended up having dinner together, and then spent hours talking during the next few days.</p><p>Linc had learned that Lori had recently come out of a broken engagement\u2014to a man who\u2019d gone to prison for theft. Not surprisingly, it had left her disillusioned. Linc knew the feeling well. She was an old-fashioned kind of woman who expected a man to behave honorably. He was an old-fashioned kind of guy who demanded honor from himself and others. On impulse, before they could talk themselves out of it, they decided to get married.</p><p>It was crazy. It was wonderful. Linc had never in his life felt this happy and carefree.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d Lori asked, rising up on one elbow to study his face.</p><p>Just looking at his wife made his chest tighten. \u201cI never in a million years thought I\u2019d sleep in a canopy bed under pink sheets and be okay with it.\u201d He paused. \u201cMore than okay.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Lori\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cI told you it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I remember. What I recall is the promise you made when you lured me to your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLured you?\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cAs I recall, you hauled me into your arms, slammed my bedroom door and carried me across the room caveman-style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaveman? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe-man, then.\u201d</p><p>He-man, he could live with. \u201cAfter that, I didn\u2019t even notice the canopy, which was what you intended all along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mind it now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Linc shrugged. He\u2019d lived with his brothers for so many years, he didn\u2019t pay attention to all the froufrou stuff women had. Mary Jo probably had it, too, but she was his baby sister, so that was different.</p><p>Everything about Lori had his attention from the moment she\u2019d stepped out of her car that first evening. And when she\u2019d emerged from the bedroom in that black silk piece-of-nothing on their wedding night... The memory still excited him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make coffee,\u201d she volunteered again when he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cNot so soon,\u201d he said, kissing her until they were both breathless. He watched as her eyes widened and she realized what he wanted. \u201cLinc! I have to get ready for work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be late,\u201d he promised as he urged her onto her back and brought his mouth to hers.</p><p>Ah, yes, marriage had a lot to recommend it, and Linc was going to enjoy every minute.</p><p>A half hour later, having forgone coffee, Lori was rushing to get dressed when Linc stepped out of the shower. Her makeup\u2014not that he felt she needed it\u2014was done. She wore a business skirt and was pulling on a soft blue sweater. \u201cWhat are you doing today?\u201d she asked as she adjusted the neckline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m signing the closing papers on the garage.\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised. \u201cThe deal went through already?\u201d</p><p>Linc stood in the doorway to the tiny bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist. \u201cIt sat empty for two years and the owner really wanted to sell.\u201d Linc planned to open a branch of the family business, Wyse Men Auto and Body Shop\u2014formerly Three Wyse Men\u2014in Cedar Cove. His brothers were competent enough to handle everything in Seattle. By starting a second shop, he was giving them an opportunity to succeed on their own. Besides, one of the three needed to be close at hand to keep an eye on Mary Jo, although he had to admit that was more of an excuse than a reason. Linc liked living in Cedar Cove.</p><p>Okay, to be honest, he liked living with Lori.</p><p>\u201cI only work until three this afternoon,\u201d Lori said, moving about the room. She slipped her arms into a black jacket that didn\u2019t match the skirt but looked good with it, then pinned a cameo to the lapel. Even Linc, most comfortable in a T-shirt and jeans, recognized that Lori had a real sense of style. He supposed it was why she worked in a high-end dress shop in Silverdale. She dabbled in designing, too, and knew how to sew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get groceries on the way home.\u201d She brushed her hair, slung her purse over her shoulder and was about to leave.</p><p>Linc grabbed her hand. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss me goodbye?\u201d</p><p>A smile made her eyes sparkle mischievously. \u201cNo, kissing leads to other things and I\u2019m already late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne kiss,\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc,\u201d she groaned, but then complied.</p><p>Her kiss left him weak in the knees. He had to clear his throat before he could speak again. \u201cI\u2019ll be back from the title company around four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll pick up a bottle of wine so we can celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d she said, and kissed him again, letting her mouth linger over his. She was well aware of what she was doing to him, and he nearly staggered backward when she abruptly broke away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an evil woman, Lori Wyse,\u201d he called after her.</p><p>Linc headed out fifteen minutes after Lori. He had several stops to make, plus he needed to drive into Seattle and meet with his brothers about the business there. By the time he returned to Cedar Cove, he had to sign the papers for the garage. That all took longer than he\u2019d expected and it was almost five when he\u2019d finished.</p><p>Linc collected the keys to the garage and went home, hoping to pick up Lori and take her down to see the garage. He had a notebook filled with ideas on how to build the business. He wanted to tell her about them, and above all, he wanted to share this moment with her. They\u2019d take the wine over to the property and toast there.</p><p>When Linc arrived home, he saw a black Town Car parked in the very spot where he normally left his truck. Even before he reached their apartment, he heard raised voices.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Daddy!\u201d Lori cried. She sounded close to tears.</p><p>Oh, boy. Lori hadn\u2019t told her family yet that they were married. Linc didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d delayed, but the decision was hers. When he\u2019d asked her about it, Linc could see how uncomfortable the subject made her, so he\u2019d dropped it.</p><p>Now her father was upset, and frankly, Linc didn\u2019t blame him. He\u2019d do his best to set things straight.</p><p>Squaring his shoulders, Linc opened the door and walked into the living room. Lori stood next to the fireplace, her father\u2014a balding, heavyset man\u2014no more than a foot away. One of his hands was raised, as if he\u2019d been wagging his finger at her. The other was clenched at his side. At Linc\u2019s entrance, they both turned to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Linc said, hoping he sounded calm and composed. \u201cYou must be Lori\u2019s father. A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bellamy.\u201d He thrust out his hand, which the older man ignored.</p><p>Instead, Leonard Bellamy turned back to his daughter. \u201cIs that the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, this is my husband, Lincoln Wyse. Linc...this is my father.\u201d</p><p>Linc walked over to Lori\u2019s side and placed his arm protectively around her shoulders.</p><p>Bellamy continued to ignore him. \u201cYou\u2019ve pulled some stupid stunts in your life, but this takes the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bellamy, I realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I want to hear from you, I\u2019ll say so,\u201d the older man shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any sense, Lori Marie? You married this man and you don\u2019t even know him? What about his family? Who are his people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d allow me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Leonard said, pointing an accusing finger at Linc, \u201cmind your own business. This is between me and my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Lori squeezed his arm, indicating that Linc should do as her father said. He didn\u2019t like it, but he clenched his jaw and waited impatiently for the other man to get to the end of his rant.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you were engaged to that...that felon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeoff was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mistake!\u201d Leonard shouted. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re calling him. He was a major embarrassment to the whole family. How do you think your mother and I felt when we had to cancel the wedding? We couldn\u2019t even say it was wedding-day jitters or make up a decent excuse. Oh, no. Geoff\u2019s name was plastered across the front page of every newspaper on the Kitsap Peninsula. Everyone in the entire county knew why the wedding was canceled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t know what kind of man Geoff was,\u201d Lori said, defending herself. Her voice quavered with mortification. \u201cI agree I misjudged Geoff, but you liked him, too, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her father brushed off her comment. \u201cWhat makes you think you have better judgment this time?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHow long did you two know each other, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d Linc said, unable to remain silent.</p><p>\u201cI asked you to stay out of this,\u201d Bellamy shouted. He started pacing, then stopped and glared at Lori. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Briefly he closed his eyes. \u201cWhat on earth possessed you to marry a stranger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaddy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine how your mother felt to have a friend\u2014mind you, a friend\u2014announce that you\u2019d recently married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told us yourself?\u201d he bellowed, refusing to let Lori explain.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bellamy,\u201d Linc said, trying again.</p> <p>Lori covered her face with both hands and began to sob.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really done it this time,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYou\u2019ve consistently shown poor judgment, and worse, you never seem to learn from your mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Linc took a step forward. He understood why Lori\u2019s father was upset, but the man was crossing the line now.</p><p>\u201cNo one in the family has ever done anything like this. Your mother\u2019s beside herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lori sobbed.</p><p>\u201cAs you should be. You made one stupid mistake and then you immediately followed that up with another.\u201d He whirled around and studied Linc through narrowed eyes. \u201cA mechanic, Lori? For heaven\u2019s sake, why would you marry a mechanic? It isn\u2019t embarrassing enough that our daughter elopes without a word to her family, but then you have to marry a man with oil under his fingernails, an uncouth, uneducated...mechanic? What\u2019s the matter with you, girl? Don\u2019t you have a brain in your head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Bellamy,\u201d Linc said, his voice hard. It was one thing to belittle him, but Linc wasn\u2019t going to stand idly by while Lori\u2019s father chastised her as if she were a child. \u201cI can see why you\u2019re upset. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that we rushed into this marriage, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to come to our home and ridicule my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour home?\u201d The other man\u2019s face reddened.</p><p>Lori\u2019s hand tightened around Linc\u2019s forearm and she squeezed hard. \u201cThis building belongs to my parents,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t pay rent.\u201d</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t known that\u2014and wished she\u2019d told him. \u201cIf you want us to move, we\u2019ll be out by the end of the month,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cI want you out, all right,\u201d Bellamy raged, jerking one thumb at the door. \u201cOut of my daughter\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to happen. Rather than argue, Linc shook his head. \u201cLori and I are married.\u201d</p><p>Her father snorted contemptuously. \u201cYou saw a good thing, didn\u2019t you? Lori was easy prey. She was at a low point in her life and you decided to take advantage of her because of her name.\u201d</p><p>The name meant nothing to Linc. \u201cBellamy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLori comes from a wealthy family and you were trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute here!\u201d Despite his efforts, Linc was fast losing his temper. \u201cI don\u2019t need your money or your name.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy scowled back at him, his expression filled with disbelief and disdain. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d His threat hung heavy in the air.</p><p>Linc wouldn\u2019t allow Bellamy to intimidate him. \u201cYou might own this building, but you don\u2019t own your daughter. I suggest you leave now, before we both say or do something we\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy jabbed his index finger at Linc several times, then whirled around and stormed out the door. He slammed it so hard the windows rattled.</p><p>The room seemed to vibrate with tension. Lori burst into tears, and Linc put his arms around her. He held her tight against him, his shirt absorbing her tears as he gently stroked her hair.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s friend Brenda owns the dress shop and...she must\u2019ve told Mom. She promised she wouldn\u2019t say anything until I\u2019d spoken to my parents but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lori,\u201d Linc whispered into her hair. \u201cWe should\u2019ve told them sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I know\u2014but I was afraid of what my father would say, what he might do....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get used to the idea soon enough.\u201d Linc said, hoping that was true.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give him time,\u201d Linc said. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can to prove to your family that I\u2019m going to be a good husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDaddy will never forgive me.... He was still angry about Geoff and\u2014and then I married you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to end the marriage?\u201d he felt obliged to ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, never,\u201d she said, her arms tightening around him.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Linc murmured, and he thought he felt her smile against his shoulder. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, easing her out of his arms. \u201cWe have some celebrating to do.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cI signed the final papers for the garage this afternoon, remember?\u201d</p><p>Lori smiled weakly, then slipped her arms around him again. \u201cI don\u2019t care what my family thinks. I\u2019m grateful I married you.\u201d</p><p>Linc was grateful, too. Swinging her into his arms, he moved toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWill it always be like this?\u201d she asked, sighing as she kissed his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cThis much happiness just might kill me.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Staring at the phone on his desk, Will Jefferson mentally prepared to call Shirley Bliss\u2014again. Twice now she\u2019d come up with a convenient excuse to turn down his invitations. Either the woman had an incredibly active social life or she wasn\u2019t interested. Without being vain, he found that difficult to believe. Okay, he was a little vain. He knew he was a good-looking charmer\u2014smooth but not too smooth. Smart, successful and sexy, the latter according to more than one woman.</p><p>He was also persistent. He hadn\u2019t come this far in life without a healthy dose of good old-fashioned grit. He\u2019d returned to his hometown, purchased a failing art gallery and was determined to make a fresh start.</p><p>Admittedly he\u2019d made his share of mistakes. If he had it to do over again, he would\u2019ve done certain things differently. For one, he would\u2019ve paid a lot more attention to his kid sister\u2019s best friend, Grace.</p><p>Years later Grace did attract his notice, but by then it was too late. They\u2019d reconnected shortly after Will learned of Dan Sherman\u2019s death. He\u2019d sent her a sympathy card and, on a whim, added his email address. Not long after that, they\u2019d begun a friendly correspondence.</p><p>Will hadn\u2019t known about the crush Grace had on him while they were in high school. That information had soothed his ego. His marriage was deteriorating; he and Georgia were just going through the motions. About five years into the marriage he\u2019d stumbled into an affair with one of the women from his office. Naturally he regretted it and begged Georgia to forgive him. She did, and he was grateful. Yet his indiscretion had always been there between them, like a bad break that had never totally healed. A broken limb could remain weak forever after, unable to tolerate pressure or stress.</p><p>Her forgiveness hadn\u2019t been complete, he realized now. It was as if she\u2019d been waiting for him to do it again.</p><p>And he had.</p><p>But Will didn\u2019t blame Georgia. After all, he was the one who\u2019d strayed. Still, his wife had given him the cold shoulder for so long that when a friendly young waitress flirted with him, he\u2019d been flattered and receptive. Sally was young, attractive and impressionable, and he\u2019d responded.</p><p>Georgia knew about it. She had to have known, but she didn\u2019t say a word and neither did he. Sally wanted him to leave Georgia and he might have if not for the fact that Georgia was diagnosed with breast cancer. He couldn\u2019t walk out on his wife when she needed him most. After two years Sally ended the relationship.</p><p>Thankfully Georgia recovered and for a while he thought they might be able to have a successful marriage. He\u2019d tried to make her happy, to recapture what they\u2019d shared in the early days. Each week he brought home flowers and gifts; he\u2019d suggested date nights and made a genuine effort to win back his wife. Yet nothing he did seemed to bring the light of love and affection to her eyes. Apparently it was too late; he\u2019d cheated not once but twice, and she never trusted him again.</p><p>At that point, he was only in his late forties and, except for convenience and companionship, his marriage was dead. In the years that followed he had several other affairs. Georgia no longer seemed to mind and after a while these little flings didn\u2019t bother his conscience, either. As it was, he and Georgia lived more like siblings than husband and wife. And yet they stayed together. He supposed it was easier for both of them than not staying together, particularly since their business and social lives were intertwined.</p><p>He\u2019d misled Grace into thinking he was divorcing Georgia. He didn\u2019t want to lose her the same way he had Sally. He\u2019d fully intended to explain his situation...when the time felt right. Grace was everything he wanted, but Will had blown it. Before he could explain the whole complicated mess, she was out of his life. Nothing he said or did afterward changed her resolve. What she never knew, what he\u2019d never had a chance to tell her, was that if she\u2019d asked he would\u2019ve left Georgia. Not right away but soon. As soon as he\u2019d made the necessary arrangements.</p><p>Will had done more harm than good in his efforts to get her back. By this time Grace had met and fallen in love with Cliff Harding. She wanted nothing more to do with Will. Desperate to prove he cared, Will had acted like a total fool at the farmers\u2019 market and started a fist-fight with Cliff. He must\u2019ve been out of his mind. The incident still made him cringe with embarrassment.</p><p>It was at this stage that Will\u2019s life began to fall apart. Georgia found out about Grace, although they hadn\u2019t done anything more than email and talk on the phone. Still, his online relationship was the crack that broke his marriage wide-open. After all the years, all the extramarital affairs Georgia had purposely ignored, she left him because he\u2019d sent a few emails to an old friend. Ironic, to say the least.</p><p>In retrospect, Will was relieved. His marriage had been over for years. Although he\u2019d never expected to reach retirement age alone, that was his life now. Hard as it was to accept at the time, he and Georgia were better off apart.</p><p>Once the divorce was final, Will had moved home, back to Cedar Cove and the only family he had. Returning to town after all these years hadn\u2019t been easy, especially since he\u2019d arrived with nothing but a rental truck and a few suitcases. He\u2019d sublet an apartment while he searched for some way to fill his time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia was the one who suggested he consider buying the art gallery. Leave it to his sister to steer him toward a worthy purpose. The gallery had been about to close, and he\u2019d bought the business, any remaining stock and the building itself, which was one of the oldest in town and in need of repair. To this day Will wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d thought he could make a success of this. But then, he\u2019d always enjoyed a challenge.</p><p>Drawing a deep breath, he picked up the phone. He knew Shirley Bliss\u2019s number by heart. He\u2019d called so often that his fingers hit the numbers automatically.</p><p>Shirley, a widowed artist whose work he\u2019d displayed, interested him in a way no woman had since Grace Sherman\u2014Grace Harding now. He\u2019d fallen for Grace and come so close to making her part of his life; the fact that it hadn\u2019t happened still depressed him.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Shirley\u2019s teenage daughter, Tanni, answered his call.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Tanni,\u201d Will said cheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard from Shaw lately?\u201d he asked. By pulling a few strings he\u2019d been instrumental in getting Tanni\u2019s boyfriend into the San Francisco Art Institute. He wanted Shirley to be in his debt, although so far she\u2019d shown little appreciation.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s voice tensed. Clearly this was a delicate subject and one he should avoid.</p> <p>\u201cIs your mother home?\u201d he asked next. Not having had children, Will felt at a distinct disadvantage while talking to teenagers.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dungeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basement,\u201d Tanni said. \u201cWhere she works.\u201d</p><p>Oh, her studio. \u201cWould you mind letting her know I\u2019m on the phone?\u201d</p><p>The girl hesitated. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t like to be disturbed when she\u2019s working.\u201d</p> <p>Evidently Tanni was prepared to stand guard over the moat leading to the castle\u2014and the dungeon. \u201cJust tell her I\u2019m on the phone, if you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem pleased about it.</p><p>Will heard Tanni set the phone down and walk away, her shoes tapping against the floor. Then he could hear her shout into the basement. After a few minutes she returned and picked up the receiver. \u201cMom says if you sold another piece, would you please put the check in the mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Tell her I have a question for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Once again Will heard her set the phone down, trot across the room and shout. He didn\u2019t hear anything for another minute or so.</p><p>Then... \u201cThis is Shirley.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d recognized the lack of welcome in Tanni\u2019s voice, it came through even more clearly in her mother\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting you.\u201d Will forced himself to sound his most charming.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Some of the irritation left her voice. \u201cI was in the middle of something but I needed a break, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed a bit. \u201cI called to see if you were available this Saturday night. I have tickets for the Playhouse.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to reject yet another invitation. Instead, he continued in a conversational tone. \u201cPeggy Beldon stopped by earlier in the week. She\u2019s redecorating the master bedroom and bought an original piece\u2014a collage. She mentioned that Bob\u2019s starring in the production of Fiddler on the Roof. That\u2019s a favorite of mine and I like to support our local theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Will, I\u2019m sorry but I promised Miranda I\u2019d attend the fundraiser at the library this Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he\u2019d half expected this kind of response. \u201cI might be able to trade in the tickets for another night.\u201d He wasn\u2019t giving up that easily.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Shirley said, and he heard a hint of regret in her voice\u2014or thought he did. \u201cI read in the Chronicle this morning that the tickets have completely sold out. The theater might add extra shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we can go to one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sunday?\u201d he blurted out, not sure what to suggest. A stroll along the waterfront? A movie? Coffee? He\u2019d tried all those before and gotten nowhere.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work, either. Miranda and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust who is Miranda?\u201d Will asked, gritting his teeth. He\u2019d never heard the other woman\u2019s name before and all of a sudden it was Miranda this and Miranda that. He hadn\u2019t even met the woman and already he had the distinct feeling she was a troublemaker.</p><p>\u201cMiranda\u2019s a good friend. We\u2019ve known each other for years. We drifted apart but after my husband died we reconnected. Miranda lost Hugh, her husband, about five years ago. You might\u2019ve heard of him\u2014Hugh Sullivan, a landscape painter. Anyway, she\u2019s been helping me navigate widowhood.\u201d</p><p>Will wanted to be the one to guide Shirley to new love and a new life. He\u2019d hoped they could find this path to happiness together.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be best if we tried to get together another time,\u201d she said with finality.</p><p>Before he could propose another potential outing, Shirley ended the conversation. \u201cThanks for calling, Will. Bye now.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t come up with anything fast enough to stop her from disconnecting. When he started to sputter something, the telephone droned in his ear. Shaking his head, he hung up.</p><p>Perhaps he was losing his touch. It wasn\u2019t his looks. Even now that he\u2019d grown older, his brown hair with its silver accents gave him the distinguished appearance of a man who was confident and comfortable with himself.</p><p>He routinely worked out; he wasn\u2019t fanatical about exercise but he kept in shape. Although he\u2019d recently purchased the gallery, he\u2019d managed his finances effectively. He wasn\u2019t rich, but he was well off.</p><p>Georgia, being Georgia, had been more than fair in their divorce settlement. Apparently she felt guilty for filing. Another irony, since he was the one who\u2019d cheated on her. He knew his mother and sister kept in touch with his ex. He didn\u2019t. Contact between them would be just too...awkward.</p><p>Will didn\u2019t know what it was about him that scared Shirley Bliss away. So many women fawned over him, and attracting the opposite sex had never been a problem until he met Shirley.</p><p>Despite her skittishness, Will sensed that she was attracted to him, that she wanted to know him better. For whatever reason, Shirley couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t let him get close.</p><p>Then he understood.</p><p>The answer should\u2019ve been obvious. Shirley did want to date him. She felt, just as he did, that they\u2019d be terrific together. She felt the same sparks Will did.</p><p>But Shirley was afraid.</p><p>That was understandable. He should\u2019ve recognized it long ago. After years of being married to the same man, Shirley was terrified of what would happen if she allowed herself to have strong feelings for someone else.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d figured it out, Will decided he could afford to take some time to work on a strategy to convince her....</p><p>Saturday night, after closing, he looked through the gallery windows and caught a glimpse of the flickering lights of the shipyard across the cove. Down at the marina, sailboats bobbed on the gentle swell of the wake created by the Bremerton ferry. From there, his gaze moved toward the library. He\u2019d read about the fundraiser but hadn\u2019t thought much about it until Shirley said she had plans to go with her friend.</p><p>Doubt flickered in his mind. He couldn\u2019t help wondering if what she\u2019d said was true\u2014if she really was at the fundraiser. The only way of confirming it was to show up there himself. He didn\u2019t have any other plans, since he wasn\u2019t willing to attend the theater on his own. So Will made the sudden decision to become a library supporter. He still found it uncomfortable to see Grace, but she needed to know he\u2019d moved on, too, and there was no better way to prove it.</p><p>He shaved and splashed on a light dose of citrusy cologne, then put on a gray vest his mother had knit him on impossibly small needles. He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how many hours this had taken Charlotte. Will tended to wear it on special occasions and this evening, he felt, was special\u2014an opportunity to make a real connection with Shirley.</p><p>With his hands in his pants pockets, Will walked casually down the hill to the library. Even before he reached the end of the block he could hear the music drifting up from the open library doors. Grace had brought in a chamber music group; this event was more formal and elegant than he\u2019d assumed.</p><p>As he entered the library, the first person he saw was his sister, Olivia. Her husband, Jack Griffin, stood attentively by her side, and Will recognized the concern on his face. His sister was recovering from cancer. Just before Christmas they\u2019d nearly lost her to a massive infection with temperatures high enough to make her delirious. The episode had shaken the entire family, as well as her many friends. Like Grace.</p><p>Will had viewed Olivia with fresh eyes after seeing her so ill. The surge of love and protectiveness he\u2019d felt had taken him by surprise. He hadn\u2019t realized how deeply he loved his little sister.</p><p>Will wasn\u2019t aware that he was blocking the doorway until someone politely asked to step past.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled as he went farther into the room.</p><p>Waiters moved among the throng hoisting trays with champagne flutes and tiny hors d\u2019oeuvres. It occurred to Will that he might need a ticket. He saw a woman at a table collecting money and hurried toward her. While he waited in line, he glanced around, hoping to find Shirley. A moment later he did. She stood talking to Grace; the woman beside her must be Miranda.</p><p>As if Shirley\u2019s friend felt his gaze she turned in his direction. Her eyes locked on him and then ever so slowly narrowed. Will stared back.</p><p>Miranda said something to Shirley, who instantly looked at him. Then she nodded.</p><p>So Miranda had asked about him. That was interesting, he thought, as he surreptitiously observed Shirley\u2019s friend. She stood nearly a head taller than Shirley. Will suspected Miranda was close to six feet; he was six-one. By contrast, Shirley was petite, delicate, fine-boned. Miranda was none of those things.</p><p>He paid for his ticket and decided to approach Shirley. Perhaps they could mingle for a while and then ditch her friend and go to dinner. He didn\u2019t see any need to waste a beautiful evening. On his way over to Shirley, he grabbed a flute and took a sip. Not real champagne, but a decent sparkling wine, probably a California label.</p><p>Shirley gave a small wave and started toward him. Miranda came with her. Both women held half-full flutes that they balanced carefully as they walked.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Shirley said, smiling up at him warmly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here. Weren\u2019t you going to the theater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast-minute change of plans,\u201d he said, returning her smile. He flicked a glance at her friend.</p><p>As if suddenly realizing she needed to make introductions, Shirley said, \u201cThis is the friend I mentioned. Miranda Sullivan, Will Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d Miranda said, sounding anything but.</p><p>Her attitude annoyed him. \u201cSame here,\u201d he responded, matching her tone. What was this woman\u2019s problem, anyway? She seemed to disapprove of him for some reason, even though she knew next to nothing about him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shirley appeared to notice because she looked quickly from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cI was just telling Miranda how grateful I am for all your help with Tanni and Shaw.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cI was happy to be of assistance. Shaw is a talented young artist who deserved a hand up.\u201d</p><p>Miranda smiled cynically but didn\u2019t comment.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of Tanni, I see she came, after all,\u201d Shirley said breathlessly. \u201cIf you\u2019ll both excuse me for a moment, I think I should check on her.\u201d She headed toward the door, leaving Will alone with Miranda.</p><p>He didn\u2019t usually take an immediate dislike to anyone, especially a woman. He supposed he was reacting, at least partially, to her dislike of him. He couldn\u2019t understand it, unless she\u2019d heard rumors.... Perhaps his reputation had preceded him. However, he wasn\u2019t particularly worried. Instead, he made up his mind to treat her as a challenge. She was Shirley\u2019s friend, and if he could make her an ally, his chances with Shirley might improve.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a good friend of Shirley\u2019s?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA very good friend,\u201d she told him, and brought the flute to her lips. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>She was direct and, as he\u2019d guessed, didn\u2019t seem too fond of him. Switching tactics, Will decided to be equally direct. \u201cThe look you gave me.\u201d</p> <p>Her dark eyebrows arched slightly. \u201cI gave you a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly and had to admit he was rather amused by this silly game. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThe fact is, Mr. Jefferson, I don\u2019t think I like you.\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve asked why, but the truth was, he didn\u2019t really care. He met her eyes. \u201cActually, the feeling is mutual, but we do have one thing in common\u2014our high regard for Shirley.\u201d</p> <p>Miranda answered with a short nod.</p><p>\u201cSo that gives us common ground, agreed?\u201d</p><p>She studied the bubbly liquid in her glass. \u201cAgreed,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel it would be easier on Shirley if we made an effort to get along?\u201d</p><p>This required more consideration on her part. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a different but related matter, I\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019s knowledgeable about the local art community to pitch in at the gallery when I need it.\u201d He remembered what Shirley had told him about Miranda\u2019s husband. \u201cI gather from Shirley that you\u2019re eminently qualified,\u201d he said. A stretch, perhaps, but whatever worked... \u201cWould you be willing to consider doing that?\u201d He really could use the help, she could probably handle the work and, with her at the gallery, he might be able to gain information about Shirley. In fact, this idea might be impetuous but it was a stroke of genius.</p><p>\u201cMy husband was an artist,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHugh Sullivan, the landscape painter.\u201d He made a mental note to do some quick research on Hugh.</p> <p>She smiled, a smile he found a trifle condescending. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it, Mr. Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He seemed to be winning her over and that pleased him. Now he had the larger task of working his way into Shirley Bliss\u2019s affections.</p><p>With\u2014he hoped\u2014the blessing of her friend Miranda.</p><p>Four</p><p>Sunday afternoon\u2014more glorious weather. As Mack worked in the yard, Mary Jo diligently washed the outside windows. She\u2019d gone to church earlier that morning while Mack was finishing his overnight shift at the fire station. He got home at about the time she returned from services and they\u2019d decided to spend this beautiful afternoon outdoors.</p><p>Mack reveled in the sense of peace and companionship he felt as they both worked quietly; he seeded bare portions of the lawn and she cleaned every window and wiped down every sill. Since Noelle was asleep inside the house, Mary Jo kept her front and back doors ajar so she could hear the baby. When they were done, she and Mack made small talk, complimenting each other\u2019s work, then put away their supplies. The windows gleamed from their washing, the lawn was greening and the garden\u2014vegetables and flowers\u2014now looked like a real garden. The lettuce leaves had started to sprout and Mary Jo had planted pole beans, corn and peas earlier in the week. The bulb flowers had sprung up in vivid color.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to Wal-Mart,\u201d Mary Jo announced at about four o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cDo you want company?\u201d There was nothing he needed himself, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything he\u2019d rather do than spend time with Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cSure, if you want. I have to get diapers and a few other things. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take you out to eat afterward, if you\u2019d like.\u201d He spoke casually, but his heart pounded with anticipation. It seemed that whenever he was making headway in this relationship, something would set the whole thing back. He knew he had to tread lightly with Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take me out, Mack, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d he argued. \u201cTo pay you back for all the dinners you\u2019ve made me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, I\u2019m happy to have your company. Besides, I\u2019m used to cooking for my brothers. I always make far more than one person could eat, anyway. You\u2019re actually doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what he\u2019d told himself earlier in the week, but he didn\u2019t like hearing it now.</p><p>He shrugged, smiling, as if her comment amused him, although what he felt was frustration. How was it that he could fall in love with the one woman in the world who was determined not to venture into romance again? He could only hope she\u2019d eventually start to trust him, eventually return his feelings....</p><p>Noelle was awake and cheerful when Mack, having showered and changed, joined them in the driveway. He picked up the baby seat and made silly noises that delighted Noelle as he fastened the carrier in Mary Jo\u2019s car. She\u2019d suggested they take her vehicle; he offered to drive and she accepted.</p><p>On the way to Wal-Mart, they said very little.</p><p>\u201cHave you found out any more about the letters?\u201d she asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cI thought of something that might help us,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her interest was immediate.</p><p>\u201cIn one of the letters, the one where Jacob mentions eating fish and chips, he wrote about being raised in the Pacific Northwest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember,\u201d Mary Jo murmured. \u201cSo he wasn\u2019t just at a base in this area, it was also his home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So, it should be easy enough to check local high school records from that time\u2014say, the mid-thirties through early forties. Her surname might have changed, but not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can learn his family\u2019s address that way,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ll start checking them out tomorrow. Also, could you talk to your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, our landlord. Maybe he can tell us about the previous owners, or at least the most recent ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Mack quickly recognized that this was a troubled path, one he didn\u2019t want to follow. Lying didn\u2019t come naturally to him but he was afraid to tell her the truth, afraid that if she knew, she\u2019d pack up and move out, angry about being manipulated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he agreed, trying to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m so curious about those letters,\u201d she burbled on. \u201cOh, Mack, I wish you\u2019d read more of them. They\u2019re so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Mary Jo continued, \u201cthat if anyone could tell us about the previous owner it would be Charlotte Rhodes. Maybe she even knew the Manrys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good idea.\u201d He\u2019d ask her, but he\u2019d do it when Mary Jo wasn\u2019t around. He was worried that his mother might have told her friend that he\u2019d bought the duplex.</p><p>\u201cShe knows everyone in town,\u201d Mary Jo was saying.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>Mary Jo sent him an odd look, which he chose to ignore. He pulled into the Wal-Mart parking lot and heaved a sigh of relief, grateful for an opportunity to direct the conversation away from the duplex, the letters and talking to Charlotte Rhodes. He found an empty space not far from the entrance and turned off the engine.</p><p>When Mary Jo had retrieved Noelle from the backseat, the three of them went into the store. Mack grabbed a cart and Mary Jo set Noelle safely inside.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to push?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>This felt good to Mack, almost as if they were a young married couple. Maybe it was foolish, but he liked to pretend they were and hoped to make that vision a reality one day.</p><p>Mary Jo walked toward the baby department with Mack and the cart behind her. He was making vroom-vroom noises, his attention on Noelle, when he suddenly heard Mary Jo say, \u201cLook! There\u2019s Charlotte and Ben.\u201d She pointed at the book and magazine section.</p><p>Mack\u2019s head snapped up. Great. Just his luck. He wondered what Charlotte might know regarding the letters, but he was worried she\u2019d reveal more than he was ready to divulge.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s in a hurry....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Mary Jo bustled after Charlotte, and Mack had no choice but to follow, pushing Noelle in the cart.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte!\u201d Mary Jo called loudly, and the older woman turned around.</p><p>Charlotte was with her husband, Ben Rhodes, Noelle\u2019s grandfather. Her eyes brightened as soon as she saw Mary Jo, Mack and Noelle. \u201cOh, my, this is a pleasant surprise,\u201d she said, moving toward them with her hands extended. After hugging Mary Jo and Mack, she smiled down at Noelle. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much she\u2019s changed since we last saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago,\u201d Ben said mildly. He was leaning forward, chucking Noelle under the chin.</p><p>Ben was still distinguished-looking, and Mack had no difficulty picturing him as an admiral. He knew Ben Rhodes was an honorable man who took his responsibilities seriously. His son David had deeply hurt him by his actions.</p><p>\u201cIf you like, I could bring Noelle by once a week for a short visit,\u201d Mary Jo offered. \u201cYou\u2019re the only grandparents she has.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte and Ben exchanged a glance. \u201cWe\u2019d love that,\u201d Charlotte said enthusiastically. \u201cThank you, Mary Jo. That would mean so much to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesdays would be best for me if that\u2019s okay with you? I can come by when I\u2019ve picked her up from Kelly\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Kelly Jordan was Noelle\u2019s day-care provider.</p><p>Again, the older couple conferred with a single glance. \u201cThat would be perfect,\u201d Ben assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop by after work, then. I won\u2019t stay long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay as long as you like. Ben and I will look forward to seeing our granddaughter\u2014and you, too, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Mack and I were just talking about you,\u201d Mary Jo told Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe discovered the oddest thing in the duplex. I found a box of old letters under the floorboards of my bedroom closet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mack moved closer to Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been there for years,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cThe letters were written in the early 1940s to a woman named Joan Manry, who lived in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoan Manry.\u201d Charlotte slowly repeated the name.</p><p>\u201cDoes that sound the least bit familiar?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p> <p>Charlotte\u2019s forehead wrinkled. \u201cI can\u2019t say it does. I was a young bride myself back then. Clyde and I had just married, against the wishes of my parents, mind you. I was far too young, but these were desperate times and Clyde was about to go off to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been able to decipher, Joan lived at 1022 Evergreen with her sister and worked in the shipyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I did,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the name doesn\u2019t ring a bell. Let me think about it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wrote the letters?\u201d Ben asked. \u201cA soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. His name was Dennison,\u201d Mack supplied. \u201cJacob Dennison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJacob Dennison.\u201d Charlotte frowned thoughtfully. \u201cHis name does sound familiar but I can\u2019t recall why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to find out what happened to those two,\u201d Mary Jo said, her voice full of enthusiasm. \u201cI want to know if Dennison survived the war and if he and Joan ever got married. If so, I\u2019ll bet their children and grandchildren would treasure these letters. They\u2019re beautifully written and very moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHidden away like that, too,\u201d Charlotte commented.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can\u2019t imagine why she\u2019d do that. The only thing I\u2019ve come up with is that, for some reason, Joan\u2019s sister didn\u2019t like Jacob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Charlotte murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can learn about those names for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d Mack felt some of the tension ease from between his shoulder blades.</p> <p>Mary Jo turned to Charlotte again. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know who lived in the duplex in the forties, do you?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cNo, sorry, but I do know it wasn\u2019t originally a duplex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it become one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, I\u2019m not sure. It must\u2019ve been twenty years ago. The previous owner hadn\u2019t kept up the place, but that all changed when Mack bought it. He\u2019s made such a difference.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s heart sank all the way to his feet. He glanced covertly at Mary Jo and was surprised she didn\u2019t react to the news.</p><p>\u201cMack\u2019s made improvements, then?\u201d she asked without letting anything slip.</p><p>\u201cThe difference is like night and day,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Mack stayed quiet, for fear that any remark he made would damn him all the more in Mary Jo\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept you long enough,\u201d Mary Jo said after a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll come by on Wednesday with Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen and I will see you then.\u201d Ben started to push the cart away when Charlotte turned back. \u201cI\u2019ll find out whatever I can about Joan Manry and Jacob Dennison in the next couple of days and tell you what I learn on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo yanked the cart away from him and steered it back to the diaper aisle at a clipped pace. Mack had to hurry to keep up with her. The anger and betrayal she felt seemed to radiate from her rigid back and stiff shoulders. Unsure how best to proceed, Mack trailed silently behind her.</p><p>Not a word passed between them as Mary Jo finished her shopping. He stood, still silent, as she paid for her purchases and exchanged pleasantries with the friendly cashier. The woman\u2019s name tag said Christie Levitt. He thought he\u2019d seen her before, but troubled as he was, Mack couldn\u2019t remember where.</p><p>Mary Jo seemed quite cheerful\u2014until he caught her eye. Her gaze narrowed and Mack knew there\u2019d be no reprieve for him. She was upset and she wasn\u2019t going to forgive his deception easily.</p><p>Once she\u2019d paid and collected her bags, Mack dashed ahead of her and unlocked the car, opening Mary Jo\u2019s door. Usually he put Noelle in her infant seat but this time Mary Jo did it, not giving him a chance. With nothing more to do, Mack slid into the driver\u2019s seat, and simply waited until Mary Jo got in. His hand on the ignition key, he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was stark.</p><p>\u201cUh, can you let me know when we can talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means it won\u2019t be anytime soon?\u201d he asked, attempting a bit of levity.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d She stared out the passenger-side window.</p><p>Mack exhaled slowly, then backed out of the parking space. He drove in silence.</p><p>\u201cJust when I thought I\u2019d met a man I could actually trust,\u201d Mary Jo blurted out five minutes later, \u201cI discover that not only did you outright lie to me but you continued with the fabrication when you had every opportunity to set the record straight. Were we not discussing this very matter no more than thirty minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I trust anything you have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d She looked pointedly out the passenger window again, her arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cWould it help to say I\u2019m sorry?\u201d he asked. And he was. But once he\u2019d told her someone else owned the duplex, he couldn\u2019t ever find a way to introduce the truth. He wished now that he\u2019d tried harder.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty harsh, don\u2019t you think? Okay, I screwed up. I admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, apology accepted.\u201d</p><p>Despite what she said, it certainly didn\u2019t sound as if she meant it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good question. I was afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid you wouldn\u2019t agree to the lower rent payment if you knew I owned the duplex.\u201d</p><p>She threw him an angry look. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I wouldn\u2019t have. What I want to know is why you felt it was so important for me to move next door to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d He didn\u2019t have an answer that would satisfy her. He couldn\u2019t very well say he\u2019d fallen completely and totally in love with her and that he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of losing Noelle. Not that she was really his to lose...</p><p>\u201c\u2018Because\u2019? Oh, that explains everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be nearby in order to protect both of you,\u201d he returned, losing his own patience. \u201cWhat\u2019s so under-handed about that? If David showed up, I wanted him to deal with me, and leave you and Noelle alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of my own problems,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t need a knight in shining armor riding to my rescue.\u201d</p><p>More like tarnished armor, he reflected, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cBesides, David did show up,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cAnd you panicked,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did panic, and then you jumped into hero mode again, asking me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been one of his finer moments.</p><p>\u201cOf all the ridiculous solutions to come up with,\u201d Mary Jo muttered. \u201cAnd I was frightened enough and foolish enough to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came to our senses,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, thankfully.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mary Jo. I was wrong to mislead you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did more than mislead me. You lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I get,\u201d he said drily. \u201cI just want you to know I regret the lie\u2014and the, uh, misguided proposal.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>They arrived at the duplex, but neither seemed ready to get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d Mack finally asked.</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t answer for the longest time. When she did, she turned sideways and looked at him, her eyes wide and imploring. \u201cCan I trust you, Mack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He said it without hesitation. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you and Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rose as he took a deep breath. He was afraid of Mary Jo\u2019s reaction if he confessed his feelings. She\u2019d probably leave, go back to Seattle, uproot the life she\u2019d created here.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d he asked instead.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need someone. You don\u2019t want to admit it but you do, and I want to be that someone.\u201d He\u2019d toned down his feelings and hoped she\u2019d understand\u2014and not take offense.</p><p>\u201cOf all the people I\u2019ve met since Noelle was born, you were the one I felt I could trust the most. I\u2019m devastated to learn otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you give me another chance?\u201d he asked. He wouldn\u2019t plead with her, wouldn\u2019t state his case. The decision was hers; this was make-it-or-break-it time. He\u2019d faltered badly but, God willing, Mary Jo would look past his error in judgment and agree to move forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any promises,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for any.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cJust don\u2019t ever lie to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d The second he spoke, he realized that expression was a poor choice.</p><p>\u201cYour word,\u201d she repeated. \u201cFor what that\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>Mack would need to show her that his word was good and his lie of omission was the wrong thing done for the right reasons.</p><p>\u201cFrom this point forward I\u2019ll pay fair market rent,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t feel he could argue, so he let it go. But he had to acknowledge, if only to himself, that he was relieved the truth had come out.</p><p>Five</p><p>Christie walked out of her sister\u2019s house and slumped against the closed front door. She didn\u2019t know how Teri managed with three tiny infants. Identical triplet sons.</p><p>After a single afternoon of helping Teri with the babies, Christie was completely exhausted. Thankfully Teri\u2019s husband, Bobby, had insisted on a live-in nanny; otherwise, Christie had no idea how the family would\u2019ve coped.</p><p>Nikki, the nanny, was off on Wednesdays, and Christie had arranged to have her afternoons free on the same day so she could come over and assist Teri. To her surprise, she\u2019d discovered that when she focused her attention on others, she was a happier person. She\u2019d learned that lesson over Christmas, which had otherwise been a miserable time for her. James, Bobby\u2019s closest friend and chauffeur, had vanished. In an effort to divert herself from her unhappiness without him, Christie had helped distribute food and gifts to the needy. It turned out to be the best thing she could\u2019ve done. Christmas Day was another matter, but she didn\u2019t want to think about that. And then weeks later, he\u2019d returned, without apology or explanation.</p><p>The apartment door above the garage opened, and James stepped onto the small porch. While he didn\u2019t invite her into his apartment, he made it clear that he\u2019d welcome her company. The fact that he stood there quietly, waiting, told her as much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tired though she was, Christie couldn\u2019t walk away. She loved James. He\u2019d hurt her badly when he\u2019d disappeared without a word\u2014and then seemed to think all should be forgiven once he came back. Eventually she had forgiven him, although she still didn\u2019t understand exactly why he\u2019d left. For good measure she\u2019d tossed in a threat or two. If he ever walked out on her again, it would be over.</p><p>She had legitimate reasons for being upset with him. She\u2019d believed he was different from her various exes. Christie had a bad track record with men, starting in high school. The only thing her ex-husband had ever given her\u2014besides trouble\u2014was his name. And every man she\u2019d loved, before and since, had left her high and dry. She\u2019d had a pattern of finding losers she felt she could rescue with enough love and sympathy. Generally they moved in together and for a while all would go well. Then, invariably, there\u2019d be a fight or a betrayal or some kind of disastrous revelation, and the affair would be over, leaving Christie sick at heart, crying her eyes out and desperately alone.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d believed James was unlike any other man she\u2019d ever known. Certainly in the obvious ways, such as the fact that he wasn\u2019t nearly as handsome as the guys she usually went for. Tall, skinny, with facial features that were sharp and slightly irregular, he resembled the caricature of a butler in some English comedies she\u2019d seen. But that was superficial and irrelevant. He was compassionate, caring and kind, and that made him more appealing than all the good-looking men she\u2019d been attracted to in the past.</p><p>Furthermore, James had inspired her to become a different woman, to look beyond herself. She\u2019d laid out her past, ugly as it was, so there\u2019d be no secrets between them. Then poof! Like every other man she\u2019d ever loved, he\u2019d disappeared from her life.</p> <p>When he\u2019d come back a few weeks later, Teri and Bobby had championed his case, but Christie was having none of it. Then Teri went into labor and they\u2019d met at the hospital. After that, Christie decided to give their relationship a second chance. However, things were still tentative. She was bruised, weary, uncertain; experience had been a brutal taskmaster and she\u2019d already given too many second chances.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d James said. He met her halfway down the stairs and slipped his arm around her waist. Walking beside her, he guided her up the rest of the steps.</p><p>\u201cYou would, too, if you\u2019d held a fussy infant for the past three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Christopher.\u201d Her sister had named the three little boys after Bobby, James and Christie. Naturally, Christie couldn\u2019t help being partial to Christopher, the smallest of the three and\u2014of course\u2014the one who demanded the most attention.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do to your hair?\u201d James asked as he kissed the top of her head.</p><p>Christie had recently had the front bleached blond and then added streaks of auburn. She never could wear her hair just plain. That was far too boring. Good thing Teri was a hairdresser by trade, or had been until her difficult pregnancy, which had put a temporary end to her career. Her friend Rachel Peyton had done a terrific job with this new style.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he said, drawing her inside his small apartment. He led her to the sofa and urged her to sit down. Christie didn\u2019t object as he went into the kitchen and put water on for tea.</p><p>\u201cI like you, too,\u201d she told him.</p><p>James brought her a cup of tea, sweetened with honey and with a fresh slice of lemon on the side. No other man had ever waited on her. None had loved her in quite the way James did, either. It would be easy to let down her guard yet again, but she couldn\u2019t. She needed time to feel confident in his love. Everything she knew about James said she could trust him; however, she\u2019d believed that before, and he\u2019d abandoned her. No, for her own peace of mind, her own emotional well-being, she had to play it safe.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Christie had signed up for photography and accounting classes, and another business course, intent on starting a company that specialized in documenting personal property for insurance purposes.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Having a reliable vehicle was a huge benefit. Getting to school by bus could be a daunting task, especially since she still worked at Wal-Mart. James had been instrumental in getting her that car, although she hadn\u2019t known it at the time. She would never have accepted his assistance had she been aware that Bobby and Teri had involved him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping one of the girls in my accounting class.\u201d Christie was proud of that. \u201cI\u2019m actually pretty good with numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we\u2019ll have smart babies one day,\u201d she said, laughing. She couldn\u2019t resist teasing him a little.</p><p>James\u2019s face flushed at the mention of children. He was worlds behind her when it came to sex and relationships. Christie knew he\u2019d had some brief and not very successful liaisons, but had never been in a serious relationship before now. He\u2019d been a chess prodigy\u2014like Bobby\u2014until he\u2019d suffered a nervous collapse. Bobby was a good friend to James, and had eventually hired him as his driver. To the best of Christie\u2019s knowledge, James hadn\u2019t played chess since he was a teenager.</p><p>James sat close to her and slid one arm around her shoulders. Christie relaxed against him, shutting her eyes and sighing contentedly.</p> <p>\u201cI want us to get married soon,\u201d he said.</p><p>She savored his words, wanting to believe they\u2019d spend the rest of their lives blissfully together. But her experience shouted otherwise.</p><p>Several of the men in her past had offered to marry her; the marriage proposal typically came just before certain awkward matters arose.</p><p>Yeah, right. Awkward didn\u2019t begin to describe them.</p><p>With Jason, they\u2019d had to wait until his divorce was final\u2014and then she\u2019d learned he hadn\u2019t even bothered to file.</p><p>With the next guy, it was problems with the IRS. Big problems.... He\u2019d expected her to pay off his debt.</p><p>And with Danny... He\u2019d had trouble with the law. In fact, she\u2019d found out just in time that he was only interested in marriage so she would make conjugal visits while he served a twenty-year prison sentence for fraud. Plus, her role as his wife meant supplying him with money for the entire length of his term.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>She knew James was waiting for her response.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for marriage yet,\u201d she murmured, and felt him tense. She didn\u2019t expect him to be pleased but she couldn\u2019t say anything different.</p><p>James didn\u2019t respond right away. \u201cI thought marriage was what you wanted,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWhat we both want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do...but not yet.\u201d</p><p>He removed his arm and straightened. Leaning forward, he stared down at the floor, then asked, \u201cWhen do you suppose you will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why? Are you planning to walk out on me again?\u201d If so, she wanted to know that now.</p><p>\u201cNo. I plan to spend the rest of my life loving you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard that before. Her suspicions rose again; it sounded so promising, but then it always did...until she learned the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to get married so quickly? Do we really know each other, James? I trusted you and look what happened.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to keep throwing that one transgression in his face, but she was genuinely worried about it.</p><p>He stood and walked to the other side of the room. \u201cI\u2019d hoped we could let it go.\u201d</p><p>Christie wished their situation was that simple. \u201cDo we really know each other?\u201d she repeated. \u201cSure, we\u2019re attracted and it would be easy to become physically involved...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He perked up at that.</p><p>How predictable men were. This was usually when other men she\u2019d dated would suggest they \u201ctest\u201d their relationship by setting up house together. Naturally they always moved in with her\u2014because they could no longer afford rent. Granted, that wasn\u2019t the case with James, but she realized he was growing frustrated, although he was the one who\u2019d initially wanted to wait. He\u2019d resisted jumping into bed a few months ago, when she\u2019d been willing. Apparently their views on this subject had been reversed. Imitating a game-show host, she blared, \u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><p>The vehemence in her voice made his head jerk back. \u201cYou aren\u2019t interested in sex?\u201d</p><p>She laughed spontaneously. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said with reluctance. \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? You were certainly ready to do it with other men. Why not me?\u201d</p><p>Christie blinked at the physical pain that struck her at his words. She pressed her hand against her heart until it passed. Then she drew in a deep breath and slowly expelled it before she stood.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I left. Thank you for the tea.\u201d She carried her mug to the sink. Her hand shook as she set it down and she tried to swallow the constriction in her throat. She turned to leave and found James blocking the door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said, sounding utterly miserable.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one feeling bad. \u201cSure you did,\u201d she said, putting on a bright face. \u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s true. I was all too willing to give myself to other men. There were a lot of them, too. And then I was stupid enough to tell you everything, thinking\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know, thinking that if you knew, we could put it behind us. Thinking you\u2019d understand how important a clean slate was to me. And let me remind you, James, you turned me down a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou can trust me, Christie. You know I\u2019d never intentionally hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to think so,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNow...\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe it\u2019s best to hold off on marriage. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014you let me know when you\u2019re ready to forgive and forget, and we\u2019ll talk again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cAnd you do the same.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up, and he stepped aside so she could exit the apartment.</p><p>Christie walked past him and was halfway down the stairs when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose this is a good time to mention that I\u2019m going away for a few days.\u201d</p><p>She paused, her foot midway between two steps. The only reason he\u2019d told her this now was to get her attention. For all she knew, it might not even be true. \u201cWhen did this come up?\u201d she asked without turning around.</p><p>\u201cAn hour ago. It\u2019s business. Bobby and I have some meetings in L.A.\u201d</p><p>Which explained why Teri hadn\u2019t said anything earlier. Questions buzzed in her brain, demanding answers. She wanted to know exactly how long he\u2019d be away. What kind of business? And why did he leave it until now to tell her? But making an issue of this would\u2019ve been too much like the old Christie, the insecure Christie, the woman who required constant reassurance.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, although she clenched the railing so tightly that her fingers ached. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould I call you when I\u2019m back?\u201d</p><p>She gave a quick shrug. \u201cUp to you. Have a good trip.\u201d</p><p>He sighed loudly enough for her to hear. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him with a tentative smile. \u201cNo, I mean it, James. I want you to have a good trip.\u201d She felt his gaze follow her as she descended the steps and walked to her car. She didn\u2019t look back.</p> <p>As she pulled out of Teri\u2019s driveway, she couldn\u2019t help wondering if she\u2019d just rejected a marriage proposal from the only decent man who\u2019d ever asked her.</p><p>Six</p><p>On Thursday, Grace hurried into the Pot Belly Deli five minutes late. She\u2019d arranged to meet Olivia for lunch at noon, but she\u2019d had to deal with a patron\u2019s inquiry. She didn\u2019t like to keep her friend waiting.</p><p>Now that Olivia had finished her chemo, she was on the way to remission. She\u2019d given herself the summer off to regain her strength before returning to the courthouse, where she was a family-court judge.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Grace said, sliding into the chair across from her best friend.</p> <p>\u201cI took the liberty of ordering for you.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cOh, good. What am I having for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCream of potato soup and a green salad with ranch dressing on the side. No scone.\u201d</p><p>Olivia knew her likes and dislikes, which stood to reason after forty-some years of friendship. \u201cAnd you?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cA salad and scone.\u201d</p><p>Grace threw her friend an accusing look. Olivia was still far too thin; she needed more than just a salad.</p> <p>Olivia grinned. \u201cAnd a slice of double chocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith two forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you ready for Rover?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace leaned back in her chair. After months of preparation, the Reading with Rover program was about to launch at the library. She\u2019d worked hard to get it set up. Children with below-grade-level reading abilities could come to the library, where they\u2019d be paired with a dog. The dogs made the reading environment nonthreatening; kids could read simply for enjoyment. With a dog\u2014and a silent companion\u2014as their audience, they didn\u2019t risk being embarrassed in front of their teachers or peers. Children loved dogs, and the dogs loved them back. She\u2019d learned about the program in a professional journal and been intrigued.</p><p>\u201cAm I ready?\u201d Grace said, repeating the question. \u201cI think so. I won\u2019t know until this afternoon. So far, I have two teenage volunteers and two adults from the community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many dogs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting with six dogs and six children between the ages of seven and eleven. They\u2019re all at risk schoolwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe superintendent\u2019s on board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. The superintendent herself told me she\u2019s impressed with the idea.\u201d</p><p>Olivia reached for her tea. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely enthralled with the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, and I\u2019m so glad they all came from the animal shelter.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced up. \u201cAren\u2019t they trained? I thought you told me they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, they are. Beth Morehouse chose the dogs from the shelter and then trained them as therapy dogs. She does wonders with these animals. She\u2019s been taking them into nursing homes and hospitals for the past couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth Morehouse? You\u2019ve mentioned her, but we\u2019ve never met. She wasn\u2019t at the fundraiser, was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was out of town, working with a dog owner in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about her.\u201d Olivia grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably told me before but, you know\u2014chemo brain.\u201d</p><p>Grace was well aware that chemotherapy often resulted in a mental fog that could take months or even years to lift.</p><p>Grace nodded sympathetically. \u201cShe moved into the area a few years back. She\u2019s a divorced mother of two and a dog trainer by profession. She already had three dogs of her own and then adopted the others...and it sort of grew from there.\u201d</p><p>Grace had met Beth while working as a volunteer at the animal shelter. When she discovered Beth had therapy dogs, it seemed natural to use them in the Reading with Rover program. Grace had first spoken to Beth in early winter, and the other woman had immediately caught her vision and agreed to help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Grace said. Not only did she love bringing new programs into the library, but this one had felt right from the moment she\u2019d heard of it. Now, after months of planning, she was about to see it come to fruition.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s going to go well,\u201d Olivia said with unwavering confidence.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I detect a note of hesitation?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Having been friends all these years, Olivia knew her better than anyone, even Cliff. \u201cNot hesitation, exactly. I\u2019m a bit concerned about the two high school volunteers.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought their meals and they both started to eat.</p><p>\u201cOne is Tanni Bliss and the other is Kristen Jamey,\u201d Grace said after a spoonful of soup. \u201cThose two are about as different as any two teenagers can be. Kristen is a cheerleader and I understand she\u2019s well liked. Tanni, on the other hand, goes out of her way to avoid hanging out with the popular crowd. I know from her mother that she\u2019s had a rough time of it since her father died and pretty much isolates herself. I just hope Tanni and Kristen can work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you suspect they can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t sure how to explain it. \u201cAt the first volunteer meeting, I saw how Tanni looked at Kristen, like she thought the time I spent training Kristen was a complete waste. She as much as said so\u2014she hinted that after a couple of weeks, Kristen would be gone. Kristen pretended not to hear, but she did and I could tell she was offended.\u201d</p><p>Olivia paused with her fork next to her plate. \u201cWhy would Tanni take such a strong dislike to Kristen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to view Kristen as an airhead who\u2019s gotten involved because she needs a volunteer project on her college application. Tanni implied Kristen wasn\u2019t going to get into college on her grades alone. She\u2019s a cheerleader, very cute and bubbly, and Tanni isn\u2019t that type. Like I said, the two are total opposites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s recently lost her father, so my guess is that Tanni\u2019s dealing with depression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d Grace hoped the program would provide Tanni with some encouragement\u2014and that the girls would keep their mutual dislike out of the library.</p><p>At three-thirty that same afternoon, Grace was surrounded by dogs and kids and mild chaos as the children were matched up with their new canine friends.</p><p>\u201cKristen,\u201d Grace said, \u201cI want you to work with Mimi and Aubrey.\u201d Mimi was a mixed breed, part Pomeranian and part something else she couldn\u2019t identify. Aubrey was a first-grader who clung to her mother\u2019s hand until she was introduced to Mimi. Grace found it gratifying to see how quickly the youngster responded to the dog.</p><p>Kristen led the girl to a fairly secluded area by the window, where the lighting was good. Together Aubrey and Kristen sat down on the carpet. Mimi snuggled up next to Aubrey and placed her chin on the little girl\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cTanni, I\u2019m going to assign you to Boomer and Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d The girl nodded and led seven-year-old Tyler and Boomer to the opposite end of the area reserved for the program. Boomer was a golden retriever who reminded Grace of Buttercup, her own dog.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t help noticing that Tanni moved as far away from Kristen as she could, which didn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>She paired the two adults with two children and two dogs each, but those children were older\u2014ten and eleven, eight and ten, respectively.</p><p>Grace stood back and waited. Her research indicated that the children felt more comfortable reading aloud to the dogs than to adults and achieved higher reading levels with practice, which of course made sense. Research showed that being with dogs enhanced their social skills and helped overcome shyness. Watching the children interact with the animals, she witnessed a startling\u2014and very rapid\u2014transformation in each child. She smiled as Boomer, the golden retriever, looked up at Tyler with his big brown eyes and actually held the book open with his paw pressed across the top of the page.</p><p>Grace had learned that various bookstores as well as libraries across the continent participated in programs very similar to this. In fact, one large Seattle bookstore brought therapy dogs into the children\u2019s section twice a month. Apparently other bookstores were starting to do the same thing.</p><p>Grace only hoped that the reading program at the Cedar Cove library would prove to be as popular and as rewarding.</p><p>The thirty minutes seemed to flash by. She moved silently from one reading group to another. It was important that the children feel relaxed and at ease; the volunteers were there to oversee the kids and dogs, but once the children were set up with books, they were to quietly extract themselves and watch from a distance, letting the children read to \u201ctheir\u201d dogs alone.</p><p>Grace joined Kristen after she\u2019d left Aubrey. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kristen\u2019s pretty face lit up with a smile. \u201cAubrey took to Mimi right away. It was amazing. Did you notice how Mimi cuddled up to Aubrey? It was so sweet.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of her eye, Grace noticed as Tanni made a face. Kristen saw it, too. Grace saw a flicker of pain in the girl\u2019s eyes. She didn\u2019t say anything but Grace knew Tanni\u2019s look of contempt had hurt.</p><p>When the children were finished, Beth Morehouse collected the dogs and walked them out of the library, with Kristen and Tanni\u2019s help.</p><p>Tanni returned to retrieve her backpack. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d Grace asked, stopping her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>Grace led the way into her small office. \u201cHow did you feel the first session went?\u201d she asked, gesturing for Tanni to take the seat across from her.</p><p>The teenager slouched down in the chair. \u201cAll right, I think. Tyler and Boomer seem to be a good match. I was surprised by how easily Tyler felt comfortable with such a big dog. He\u2019s small for his age and I was afraid a golden retriever might intimidate him, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth suggested the pairings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times I wanted to jump in and correct Tyler, but I knew that\u2019s not what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d The children needed to gain self-confidence and self-esteem. That wouldn\u2019t happen if the volunteers intervened and corrected their pronunciation.</p><p>Tanni reached for her backpack, which she\u2019d dropped at her feet when she sat down.</p><p>\u201cI had another reason for asking to speak to you,\u201d Grace said, broaching the subject carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s about Kristen.\u201d</p><p>Tanni frowned. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you dislike her?\u201d</p><p>The girl shrugged. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the two of you have a history I should know about?\u201d</p><p>Tanni stared down at the floor and shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t like her, do you?\u201d Grace asked, pressing the point.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tanni was honest enough to admit.</p><p>Grace leaned forward. \u201cDo you mind telling me why?\u201d</p><p>Tanni didn\u2019t answer right away. When she did respond, the words seemed to spew out. \u201cKristen isn\u2019t doing this because she wants to help these kids. You realize that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Grace raised her eyebrows. \u201cShe told you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but it\u2019s obvious. She\u2019s volunteering because she\u2019s hoping for this Citizen Award that\u2019s given out at graduation.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had gotten the award the year they\u2019d graduated. The Rotary Club gave it to a graduating senior with good marks who\u2019d shown leadership skills and had a history of volunteering in the community.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d never get it with her grades,\u201d Tanni said scornfully.</p><p>\u201cYou know this for a fact?\u201d Grace asked.</p> <p>Tanni hesitated. \u201cNot for sure, but like I said, it\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t appear all that obvious to Grace. \u201cI think you\u2019re making an assumption about Kristen that might be way off base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Tanni said without a hint of doubt. \u201cShe\u2019s a cheerleader.\u201d This was added in the most contemptuous tone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like cheerleaders?\u201d Grace asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a cheerleader in high school,\u201d Grace told her.</p> <p>Tanni chanced a look in her direction. \u201cBut things were a whole lot different back then.\u201d</p><p>She made it sound like the days of the Wild West, when covered wagons roamed the prairie. \u201cOh? How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Tanni said with another shrug.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheerleaders these days are real airheads. Kristen is, anyway. She\u2019s got this laugh that makes me want to puke every time I hear it.\u201d</p><p>Grace wondered what that was about. \u201cDoes she have a boyfriend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tanni lifted one shoulder. \u201cI suppose so. They all do in that crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m jealous, you\u2019re wrong! I have a boyfriend, too. Shaw Wilson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw who works at Mocha Mama\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t there anymore. He\u2019s at art school in San Francisco. A friend of Will Jefferson\u2019s helped him get in. It\u2019s a really big deal that he was accepted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Shaw wanted to be an artist.\u201d Grace was well aware that Tanni\u2019s mother, Shirley Bliss, was both gifted and successful.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really talented,\u201d Tanni said, her voice fervent with conviction.</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful that he has this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but Grace could see that the girl missed her boyfriend. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re at loose ends without him around,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tanni gave the same careless shrug, which wasn\u2019t really a response. \u201cI am. It\u2019s one of the reasons I volunteered here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d</p><p>Tanni raised her eyes to meet Grace\u2019s. \u201cYou mean you want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I don\u2019t get along with Kristen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019d be willing to cut her a little slack.\u201d</p><p>Tanni frowned. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDrop the dirty looks and the sarcastic comments.\u201d</p><p>Tanni shuffled her feet back and forth. \u201cI\u2019ll try. The thing is,\u201d she said wryly, \u201cit comes sort of instinctively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to be friends, Tanni. All I\u2019m asking is that you respect her and stop judging her motivations. So what if she volunteered because she\u2019s going after the Rotary award? Her being here isn\u2019t taking anything away from you, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she reluctantly agreed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Tanni bent to grab her backpack. \u201cCan I go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thanks for hearing me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be back next week?\u201d Grace asked, following her to the office door.</p><p>Tanni nodded. \u201cI might not like Kristen, but I think Tyler and Boomer are cool.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Rachel Peyton stopped at the dry cleaners to pick up her good jacket on the way home from Get Nailed. As she waited, a wave of dizziness nearly overwhelmed her and she quickly found a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Duck-Hwan Hyo asked, his eyes dark with concern.</p><p>Rachel tried to reassure him. \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, but her voice sounded shaky.</p><p>\u201cYou have baby?\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. Funny, the man at the dry cleaners had figured it out, but not her own husband. There were times Bruce could be so dense that she wanted to hit him over the head with her shoe. She longed to tell her husband; despite the fact that this pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned, Rachel was excited about the baby.</p><p>Duck called something in Korean to his wife. The petite woman came out from the back of the shop and joined her husband at the front counter. They had a brief conversation that involved several sympathetic glances at Rachel.</p><p>\u201cYou want tea?\u201d his wife, Su Jin, asked softly. \u201cI make you cup of green tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d her husband asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Duck,\u201d Rachel told him. \u201cThank you. I just got light-headed for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI change my name,\u201d Duck said with a polite bow of his head. \u201cI not Duck anymore. I pick American name.\u201d His face beamed with pride.</p><p>\u201cI choose American name, too,\u201d Su Jin announced.</p><p>\u201cMy American name,\u201d Duck said, squaring his shoulders, \u201cis Jos\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJos\u00e9,\u201d Rachel repeated, and struggled not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy American name,\u201d his wife said next, \u201cis Serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember both,\u201d Rachel promised them. She collected her dry cleaning and went out to her car. Going to the cleaners had been a delaying tactic. Jolene would be home and there\u2019d be the usual tension between them once Rachel entered the house. If anything, that tension had been escalating.</p><p>Jolene and Rachel used to be close; Rachel had been friend as well as surrogate mother to the girl. That changed when Rachel married her father. Then they\u2019d gone from friends to adversaries. Jolene appeared to see Rachel as competition for her father\u2019s affection. The groundwork of friendship Rachel had laid had given way like quicksand as soon as Bruce slid the wedding ring on her finger.</p><p>Rachel was still shocked that her relationship with Jolene had disintegrated so fast. She\u2019d done her utmost to be patient and understanding. At first, she\u2019d tried to keep Bruce out of it; she didn\u2019t want her husband caught in an impossible situation, forced to side with either his wife or his daughter. That hadn\u2019t worked. Jolene\u2019s antagonism had grown to the point of near-belligerence, and Rachel no longer knew what to do.</p><p>The pregnancy complicated everything. She\u2019d warned Bruce that they needed to be more careful about protection when making love. She\u2019d gone on the pill right away, but had a rare adverse reaction to it. So Bruce had said he\u2019d take responsibility for birth control and he had\u2014most of the time.</p><p>She blamed Bruce; she blamed herself. When she\u2019d realized that their occasional slips had resulted in pregnancy, Rachel had been stunned. She\u2019d needed to adjust to it before she told Bruce, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the secret from Jolene for long. Based on recent experience, Rachel recognized that the situation, which was barely tolerable now, would only get worse.</p><p>She should be heading home and getting dinner started, but the thought of facing Jolene was more than she could bear, especially when she felt queasy, as she seemed to every afternoon. She suspected it was a combination of nausea caused by the pregnancy, worrying about Jolene\u2019s reaction and the constant stress at home.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it. Instead of driving home, she went to Teri\u2019s place on Seaside Avenue. Rachel hadn\u2019t been to see her friend in nearly a week. She turned into the long driveway and parked in front of the house with a feeling of reprieve\u2014however temporary that reprieve might be.</p><p>Rather than ring the doorbell for fear of waking the triplets, she tapped on the door.</p><p>To her surprise Bobby answered, a baby tucked in the crook of his arm. \u201cTeri will be glad to see you,\u201d he said, bouncing the baby as he spoke. This was a sight Rachel had never expected to see. Bobby, who was a world chess champion, holding an infant in his arms. It warmed her heart and helped her believe that the power of love could change things for the better.</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d she asked, afraid she might\u2019ve walked into the middle of a feeding. Those were always hectic.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Teri asked, sweeping into the foyer. \u201cI\u2019m dying for company. Come on in and make yourself comfortable. Let me bring Jimmy here over to Nikki. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d Teri took the baby from her husband\u2019s arms and briefly disappeared. When she returned, without little Jimmy, she flopped down on the sofa next to Rachel. Bobby, who\u2019d been awkwardly trying to entertain Rachel with an account of some chess game or other, hurried off, his relief all too evident.</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d Rachel told Teri.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Teri admitted. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the boys into a routine yet. Nikki\u2019s helping me with it.\u201d She sighed gustily. \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019d do without such a wonderful nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were lucky to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Teri smiled, clasping her hands prayerfully. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful. Now...what about some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Rachel said. Ever since she\u2019d declined the cup of tea Su Jin\u2014or Serenity\u2014had offered her, she\u2019d been craving one.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I haven\u2019t had a chance to sit down all afternoon.\u201d Despite looking worn out, Teri leaped back up and hurried into the kitchen, Rachel trailing behind her. \u201cI hope you\u2019re here to tell me Bruce knows you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>Rachel shook her head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRach, you have to tell your husband.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shrugged. \u201cI agree. I just want to preserve what peace there is for as long as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t allow Jolene to run your life\u2014which is exactly what\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me how to change that and I\u2019ll be happy to do it.\u201d</p><p>Teri sat down at the kitchen table, and Rachel took the chair across from her. \u201cHave you tried taking Jolene out, just the two of you?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cBut she isn\u2019t interested in going anywhere if I\u2019m along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she liked to shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, but not if I\u2019m with her.\u201d Part of the problem was that Jolene preferred to be with kids her own age rather than an adult. Like almost every young teenager, she was far more influenced by her friends and their opinions than by her parents. Granted, she idolized her dad, but Rachel had become the evil stepmother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also tried to get her interested in taking a class with me.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s eyes shone with approval. \u201cGreat idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI signed us up for cake decorating. You know how much Jolene loves to bake. Bruce thought it was a good idea, too, but it backfired. The night of the first class she pretended to be sick and stayed home. Bruce said the minute I was out the door Jolene experienced a miraculous recovery.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t seen some of her bad behavior, but he doesn\u2019t see the whole picture. Anyway, I finished the classes without Jolene attending a single one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Did she get \u2018sick\u2019 every week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she flat-out refused to go. She said she missed too much the first week and would always be behind. Besides that, she said she wasn\u2019t interested in decorating cakes. That was for retards like me\u2014her word, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Jolene was free with her insults but smart enough not to say them in front of her father. And so far, Rachel hadn\u2019t been able to bring herself to tattle.</p><p>\u201cHow are things between you and Bruce?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>The kettle whistled then and Teri got up to make the tea\u2014decaffeinated, in deference to Rachel\u2019s pregnancy\u2014and assemble a plate of crackers and various cheeses. They carried everything back into the family room and sat down on the sofa again.</p> <p>\u201cBruce is...Bruce,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOblivious, right?\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded, making a wry face to hide her unhappiness. The pregnancy was playing havoc with her emotions. In the past, she\u2019d never dissolved easily into tears but they sprang to her eyes now. She fought to hold them back, blinking furiously. \u201cHe\u2019s got a one-track mind,\u201d she whispered, dabbing at her eyes with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cAnd that one track leads directly to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded again.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he wants to go to bed at eight o\u2019clock every night infuriates Jolene, too. The girl isn\u2019t stupid. She knows why her father\u2019s suddenly so tired.\u201d Rachel had tried to explain to him that his sexual appetite wasn\u2019t helping the situation between her and Jolene, but Bruce said his love life was none of his daughter\u2019s business. He was right; nevertheless, it made Rachel\u2019s relationship with Jolene even more difficult.</p> <p>Rachel loved the way her husband desired her. The hours they spent locked in their bedroom were the only peaceful times she had. Whenever they made love she had the urge to tell him about the baby...but she hadn\u2019t. She simply couldn\u2019t. And she hadn\u2019t told him he could dispense with using protection. Even Bruce might\u2019ve been able to figure that one out.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help, either, that Jolene was often still up, slamming things around, making sure they knew that she knew what they were doing. And Bruce himself often went right to sleep afterward. So...she hadn\u2019t found a natural opportunity to tell him.</p><p>Rachel tentatively chose a sliver of cheese from the platter Teri had set on the table. \u201cI dread going home at the end of the day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t, and I feel helpless to change anything. I don\u2019t know what to do, Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could try family counseling.\u201d Her friend pulled up her knees, resting her feet on the edge of the sofa. \u201cOr...do you want Bobby to talk to Bruce?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Rachel was grateful Teri had offered, but she couldn\u2019t see how it would improve matters. \u201cThanks, but no.\u201d</p><p>Teri actually looked relieved. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Bobby would know what to say, anyway,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI adore that man, but this is not the sort of thing he\u2019s comfortable with. Did I tell you he was away for a few days? The boys and I missed him like crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBobby was away? Where?\u201d</p><p>Teri took a sip of her tea. \u201cBobby and James went to L.A. They had some business they needed to attend to\u2014I don\u2019t know the details.\u201d She frowned as she said it.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Teri was quick to assure her. \u201cNot with Bobby. It\u2019s my sister again. Christie and James have had another falling-out. James can be as stubborn as my little sister. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Hearing that saddened Rachel. Everything had been going so well between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll work it out,\u201d Teri said. \u201cJames loves her and my sister feels the same way about him. My guess is that this will blow over in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. The next time I talk to you, I want to hear that they\u2019ve set a wedding date.\u201d</p><p>Rachel finished her tea and left soon afterward, driving straight to Yakima Street. She hadn\u2019t come up with any solutions but felt better for having discussed the problem with her best friend.</p><p>When she finally got home, Bruce was already there. She pulled her car into the garage beside his and grabbed her dry cleaning from the backseat. Bruce had the garage door open before she\u2019d even reached the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said in aggrieved tones.</p><p>\u201cI went to see Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let Jolene know where you were. She was worried.\u201d The accusation in his voice stung, although Rachel didn\u2019t believe for a minute that her stepdaughter was worried.</p><p>Jolene stood behind her father, looking far too pleased with herself. \u201cYou told me I have to let you know if I\u2019m going to be home late,\u201d she said smugly.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but I\u2019m the adult here. I don\u2019t report to you.\u201d Perhaps that was too blunt, but she couldn\u2019t restrain herself. Rachel was barely inside the house and the attacks had already begun. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make you happy, I\u2019ll call the next time I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to abide by the rules, but you don\u2019t?\u201d Jolene said as Rachel stepped past her and into the kitchen.</p><p>Rachel ignored the comment, hung her dry cleaning in the hall closet and then walked back to the kitchen, past both Jolene and Bruce. \u201cI\u2019ll start dinner now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we having?\u201d Jolene asked, following her.</p><p>Rachel had put ground chicken in the refrigerator to thaw. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>The girl shrugged. \u201cNothing you cook,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>Rachel pretended not to hear. \u201cBruce, do you have any preference for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about tacos?\u201d he called out from the living room, where he sat at the computer desk he\u2019d placed in one corner. He was, as usual, unconscious of the tension between Rachel and Jolene.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Rachel said, not looking at Jolene as she brought the thawed chicken out of the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cI hate tacos,\u201d her stepdaughter said.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you started cooking them. My dad used to make them better. We made tacos together and had a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Rachel\u2019s advent into their lives had ruined everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love your help,\u201d Rachel said, striving to speak pleasantly and disregard Jolene\u2019s insults. \u201cIf you showed me how, then maybe I could make them the way you like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Jolene said, and disappeared down the hallway to her bedroom.</p><p>Trying to salvage the evening, Rachel went to work; she seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning, grated the cheese, diced fresh tomatoes and shredded lettuce. Then she put the meal on the table, which, to her pleasure, Bruce had set without being reminded. He summoned Jolene and the three of them sat down.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d Bruce asked his daughter.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I got an A on my history test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Jolene glanced away as if to discount any praise from Rachel. \u201cMisty asked me to spend the night on Friday. I can, can\u2019t I, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Bruce looked at Rachel. \u201cI don\u2019t have any objection if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Misty\u2019s parents worked swing shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSo, who else will be there until her parents get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Jolene said irritably. \u201cHer parents let her take care of herself. We\u2019re not babies, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s spent the night at Misty\u2019s before,\u201d Bruce added, siding with his daughter.</p><p>\u201cBut that was a Saturday and her parents were home,\u201d Rachel pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have Misty spend the night at our place?\u201d Rachel suggested.</p><p>Jolene glared across the table at her. \u201cNot with you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d Bruce snapped, reprimanding her.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d never married Rachel,\u201d she shouted at her father. \u201cI hate having her in our house. I want it to be like it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene, please...\u201d Rachel began but her stepdaughter wasn\u2019t willing to listen. Instead, she jumped up from the table and ran down the hallway to her room. Rachel flinched as the door slammed shut.</p><p>After a moment of silence, she met her husband\u2019s eyes across the table. Bruce released a pent-up sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was...unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d Hard as Rachel tried, it never seemed to do any good.</p><p>\u201cNo, you brought up a valid point. If Jolene spends the night with one of her girlfriends, I want there to be adult supervision. I know Misty\u2019s grandmother stays with her some of the nights her parents are gone, but apparently she\u2019s alone the rest of the time. Those two girls together, without any supervision, could get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stood and started to clear the table. She considered bringing up the possibility of counseling, then decided to wait until she didn\u2019t feel quite so tired.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get Jolene to help with the dishes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>If he did, Jolene would sulk and argue, and that would only increase Rachel\u2019s stress. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll do them.\u201d</p><p>Bruce frowned. \u201cShe should be doing chores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...not tonight. She\u2019s upset with us both. She can do the dishes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rachel nodded wearily. A few minutes later, as she stood at the sink, rinsing off the plates and setting them in the bottom rack of the dishwasher, Bruce moved in behind her. He\u2019d finished clearing the table and had put the leftovers in the refrigerator. Now he slipped his arms around her waist and nuzzled her neck, dropping warm, moist kisses beside her ear. Shivers of awareness raced down her spine.</p><p>\u201cBruce...\u201d she whispered, but then she let him continue. She closed her eyes and leaned back, her weight resting against his strength. She was vaguely aware of a noise behind her, but it didn\u2019t register at first. When she realized Jolene had come into the room, she instantly stiffened.</p><p>\u201cYou two are disgusting!\u201d the girl screamed. \u201cI can\u2019t have friends over because you embarrass me. It would help if you could keep your hands off each other for five minutes, you know.\u201d With that, she stormed down the hallway and banged her bedroom door shut for the second time that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bruce released Rachel and sighed. \u201cI guess that means Misty won\u2019t be spending Friday night with us.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t know if he was joking or simply unobservant. Either way, the only response she could manage was to roll her eyes.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Mary Jo Wyse woke, startled out of a deep sleep. She wasn\u2019t sure if that was because of a dream she\u2019d been having or because Noelle had made some small noise as she slept. At almost five months, the baby was sleeping through the night\u2014well, practically every night. Mary Jo was grateful for that. Noelle slept in a crib in her room; Mary Jo wasn\u2019t ready to move her to the nursery yet.</p> <p>As she lay in bed, staring up at the dark ceiling, Mary Jo mulled over what she\u2019d discovered the previous weekend. Mack owned the duplex. He\u2019d wanted her living close by and, in order to make that happen, he\u2019d misled her into thinking a distant friend of his was the owner.</p><p>His lie disappointed her deeply. She liked Mack; in fact, she liked him a great deal. Nevertheless, she was wary of embarking on another relationship. David Rhodes had taught her several painful lessons and she\u2019d be a fool if she didn\u2019t take those lessons to heart.</p><p>The problem was that she wanted to trust Mack. But she\u2019d yearned to believe in David, too. She\u2019d clung for much too long to the fiction that her baby\u2019s father loved her and welcomed their child, refusing to accept what was obvious to everyone else...and should\u2019ve been to her.</p><p>Even her brothers knew what kind of man David was without ever meeting him. When she\u2019d finally recognized the truth, Mary Jo had been devastated. Yet, despite everything, she\u2019d never regret having Noelle. The baby gave her life purpose. And hope.</p><p>Because of Noelle, there was more to think about than herself. Any decision she made, any action she took, would have an impact on her daughter, too.</p> <p>To his credit Mack had tried to make amends. Monday afternoon Mary Jo arrived home from her job at Allan Harris\u2019s law firm to find a large bouquet of flowers on her doorstep. The card that accompanied it said simply, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and was signed by Mack.</p><p>Tuesday and Wednesday nights he was at the fire station, but on Thursday there was another gift. A set of cake pans.</p><p>Cake pans! Of all the silly things to remember she needed. She wanted to bake a coconut cake using a recipe Charlotte Rhodes had generously shared. Mary Jo had purchased the ingredients, but when she reached home, she realized she didn\u2019t have circular cake pans. By then she didn\u2019t feel like returning to the store. She\u2019d bake it another time.</p><p>Mack was working so hard to convince her to forgive him. Again, every instinct told her she should. She\u2019d always be grateful for his help in finding a home for her and Noelle\u2014even though she firmly disagreed with his deception, regardless of how well-intentioned it was. Without him, she might still be living with her three overbearing brothers. She loved them\u2014they were her family\u2014but they were suffocating her.</p><p>When she\u2019d lost her job with the insurance company, she\u2019d flown into a panic, although it was a blessing in disguise if ever there was one. Her fear was that once she returned from maternity leave she\u2019d be forced to see David Rhodes again, since he worked for the same company. But her employer had taken that worry off her hands and presented her with another\u2014no job at all. A friend had recently told her that David was no longer employed by the company, either.</p><p>The opportunity to move to Cedar Cove had come at the perfect time. Mack had been instrumental in that decision. Grace Harding and Olivia Griffin, who\u2019d also befriended her, had made the transition as effortless as possible. The two women had helped her find a new job, and Grace\u2019s younger daughter, Kelly, provided day care for Noelle.</p> <p>Once she\u2019d secured employment and child care, all Mary Jo needed was an affordable place to live. She knew housing costs would be significantly lower than Seattle prices, and she\u2019d been delighted that rent on a refurbished duplex was so reasonable. No wonder. Mack could\u2019ve rented it for twice what he charged her. Well, she\u2019d taken care of that, although it put a serious strain on her budget. She\u2019d checked with a real-estate agent Grace recommended and come up with an appropriate amount. Mack obviously saw that she wasn\u2019t changing her mind on this, since he hadn\u2019t argued when she\u2019d insisted on paying full rent. She also planned to repay him the balance for the months she\u2019d already lived there.</p><p>At one point after she\u2019d been confronted by David, Mack had offered to marry her, which had felt...weird, but she\u2019d said yes, anyway. Fortunately, they\u2019d both recognized what a mistake that was and called it off before they\u2019d made any family announcements. She could only imagine how Linc would react if he\u2019d learned about that.</p><p>Linc.</p><p>Thinking about her brother, Mary Jo smiled as she rolled onto her side and punched her feather pillow to reshape it. She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing her brother this happy. She wouldn\u2019t have guessed it, but marriage suited him. He and Lori hadn\u2019t known each other long\u2014a shorter time, even, than she\u2019d known Mack\u2014but they seemed to complement each other well.</p><p>Linc wasn\u2019t an impulsive man, but in the past couple of months he\u2019d made two drastic changes to his life. The first was marrying Lori Bellamy. The second was moving to Cedar Cove and starting a branch of the auto body and repair business their father had established more than forty years earlier. Mel and Ned, the two younger brothers, were now in charge of the Seattle shop.</p><p>The fact that Linc had handed over the business to his siblings said he believed they were capable of handling it without him. Apparently he, too, had felt the restraints imposed by family and was ready to move ahead with his life. Good for him!</p><p>At first Mary Jo had suspected that Linc\u2019s reason for coming to Cedar Cove was to stand guard over her. That, however, didn\u2019t appear to be the case. The truth was, she rarely saw him. He was busy setting up his business, equipping and renovating the commercial garage he\u2019d purchased, and enjoying married life.</p><p>Mary Jo must have fallen asleep again because the alarm woke her abruptly at seven. Immediately Noelle woke up, too, hungry and badly in need of a diaper change. Mary Jo gave her a bath, fed and dressed her and took her to Kelly\u2019s house on her way to the office.</p> <p>Mary Jo was tired all day, no doubt because of the hours she\u2019d lain awake, thinking about Mack and David Rhodes and Linc.... \u201cWell, at least it\u2019s Friday,\u201d she muttered to herself as she corrected a document for the third time.</p><p>When she finally got home that afternoon, she saw Mack\u2019s truck in their shared driveway. He must\u2019ve been waiting for her because he came onto the porch as soon as she climbed out of the car. She gave him a cursory wave, then lifted Noelle from her carrier in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, looking unsettled and yet eager to talk. He\u2019d slid his hands in his hip pockets, a habit that signaled he was ill at ease.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still angry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think angry is the right word. I think disappointed says it better.\u201d</p><p>He took a moment to consider her reply. \u201cI really am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Mary Jo had sensed his guilt and regret the minute he\u2019d confessed. \u201cI just wish you\u2019d been honest with me from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will from now on.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. She really didn\u2019t have anything more to say. She figured everyone was entitled to one mistake; if anything else happened, she\u2019d know it was time to move on.</p><p>\u201cCan we let bygones be bygones, then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cYes, let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His relief was obvious. He stepped down from the porch and started toward her. \u201cI wanted to tell you\u2014I went to the library this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember that much about World War II from my high school history class, so I took out a couple of books on the war. I\u2019d like to familiarize myself with some of the details.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled. \u201cI talked to Charlotte this Wednesday and also last week, when I took Noelle over there,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd I did an online search of every high school in the area, but I didn\u2019t find a single Jacob Dennison in the 1930s or early forties. I\u2019ll expand my search the next chance I get.\u201d She shifted Noelle from her right arm to her left.</p><p>\u201cDid Charlotte have any information?\u201d Mack asked, reaching inside her car for the baby seat and diaper bag.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. She thought Joan Manry might have attended Cedar Cove High School, so I went online and checked out the names of everyone who graduated during the war years. She wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to look online for telephone directories from that era, too, but I haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we try.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s face broke into a bright smile.</p><p>Mary Jo frowned, wondering what he found so amusing.</p><p>\u201cI love that you said \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Mack explained, clearly understanding her question. \u201cI want us to work together to track down those two. I don\u2019t understand why Joan would hide the letters. I\u2019m grateful she did, but it makes me wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I can think is that her family objected to her soldier boy and this was the only way to keep his letters to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Jacob did say something about her sister not liking him, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I have no idea why. Although I gather the two of them\u2014Joan and Elaine\u2014didn\u2019t get along that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she lived with her sister here in Cedar Cove? What about their parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. What I\u2019ve picked up from the letters is that she and Elaine did live here, but I haven\u2019t seen anything about their parents. It\u2019s difficult to follow everything just reading his half of the correspondence.\u201d Mary Jo held her door open for Mack. \u201cDo you want to come in? Stay for dinner?\u201d She could tell right away that the invitation pleased him.</p><p>\u201cHow about if I order pizza? That way we can look at the letters and check the dates against the books I got from the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza sounds fabulous.\u201d Mary Jo had planned to make clam chowder, but she was exhausted at even the prospect of cooking. A broken night and a long week took their toll, and the strain between her and Mack hadn\u2019t helped. \u201cJust make sure none of those anchovies you like so much end up on my half of the pizza,\u201d she warned laughingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Mack said with a grin.</p><p>An hour later, they sat at her kitchen table, the pizza box open on the counter. Noelle lay on her stomach in the playpen nearby, gurgling and chewing on her toys. Both history books were on the table, along with the cigar box of letters. Mack and Mary Jo had finished eating and were prepared to start their research.</p><p>\u201cOkay, check this date,\u201d Mary Jo said, unfolding a letter. \u201cJune 3, 1944. That\u2019s the last one in the box. Listen to what he has to say.\u201d She began to read. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hi, Honey,</p><p>How\u2019s my best gal? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening but there\u2019s been a lot of talk lately. If I say any more it\u2019ll probably get cut out of this letter, so I won\u2019t. Whatever it is, I know I\u2019m going and soon. I feel it in my gut.</p><p>At a time like this, I want you to understand that no matter what\u2019s ahead of me, I\u2019m ready. If the invasion comes to pass\u2014although I have no idea where or when\u2014you should know there\u2019s a strong likelihood that I won\u2019t make it back. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t want to die. None of us do. But this is war, Joan, and if I have breath left in me, I will fight. I\u2019m no hero, but I am willing to do what\u2019s required of me so that you, my parents, my brother and sisters\u2014and everyone in Europe and America and the rest of the world\u2014can live in freedom.</p><p>If I had a choice, I\u2019d be with you, making those babies we talked about. Instead, I\u2019m all the way over on the other side of the world, ready to do whatever it takes to send Hitler straight to hell where he belongs.</p> <p>Remember I love you. I can\u2019t say it any plainer than that. If I lose my life, then please remember that nothing here on earth or in heaven will stand in the way of my love. Pray for me, my darling. Pray for us all.</p><p>Hugs and kisses,</p><p>Jacob</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s voice broke as she read the last few lines.</p><p>Mack couldn\u2019t help responding to her emotion. Focusing on his task, he reached for one of the library books, flipping through it. \u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mary Jo set aside the letter and walked over to his side of the table, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJune 6 of that year was D-day. When the Allies invaded Europe on the beaches of Normandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was his last letter,\u201d Mary Jo repeated. She returned to her chair and slumped down. She realized what must have happened.</p><p>\u201cRemind me what some of the previous letters say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he said the men were in constant drills. I know Jacob was a paratrooper with the 101st. He talked about what it was like when he made his first jump. He was scared out of his wits, but he said it got easier the more often he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve been practicing for the landing,\u201d Mack said. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the letter, when he said that if anything happened to him\u2014\u201d Mary Jo couldn\u2019t continue.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mack asked, glancing up.</p><p>Mary Jo blinked back tears. \u201cHe was killed, wasn\u2019t he? He didn\u2019t survive the invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that. He might have been wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she agreed with some hesitation. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think she would\u2019ve kept the letter notifying her of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t married, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They were engaged; Jacob had left for Europe with the promise that if he made it back they\u2019d be married.</p><p>\u201cBut if they weren\u2019t husband and wife, the army wouldn\u2019t have notified Joan that Jacob had been wounded,\u201d Mack explained. \u201cThe only way she\u2019d learn that was if someone in Jacob\u2019s family told her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here from his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still can\u2019t rule out the possibility that he might\u2019ve been wounded. I don\u2019t think we should leap to the conclusion that he was killed in the invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the book say about D-day?\u201d Mary Jo asked, feeling she was sadly lacking in her knowledge of Second World War history.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mack said, scanning the information. \u201cThe Normandy landings by the Allied forces were the largest amphibious invasion ever undertaken. Wow, listen to this! There were one hundred and seventy-five thousand troops and over five thousand ships. I can\u2019t even imagine what that must\u2019ve looked like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came from England, didn\u2019t they?\u201d She remembered that much, anyway.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe landings took place along a fifty-mile stretch of the Normandy coast and were divided into five sectors.\u201d He listed them. \u201cI remember something about Omaha Beach and Utah Beach in history class\u2014and from that movie, Saving Private Ryan. That\u2019s where the Americans landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes... Of course.\u201d Mary Jo had watched the movie with her brothers on DVD. The battle-scene action had upset her\u2014and now she knew of someone who\u2019d actually been there, part of the battle. Someone who might have died there. Someone whose handwriting she\u2019d become familiar with, whose thoughts she was privy to.</p><p>\u201cI believe the English and Canadians were on Juno Beach and Sword Beach,\u201d Mack went on. \u201cOmaha and Utah were definitely where the Americans landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob wouldn\u2019t have been on the beaches,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a paratrooper, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He was.\u201d She wasn\u2019t entirely sure what that meant, other than that he jumped out of planes.</p><p>\u201cThen he must\u2019ve parachuted in behind enemy lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Behind enemy lines,\u2019\u201d she echoed in a hushed voice, hardly aware she\u2019d spoken the words aloud.</p><p>Mack glanced over at her. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t automatically mean Jacob was killed,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cI know, but without another letter after the invasion, it doesn\u2019t bode well.\u201d</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t say anything for a minute or two. \u201cAre you sure there wasn\u2019t more than the cigar box hidden under the floorboards?\u201d he eventually asked.</p><p>At the time, Mary Jo had been so excited about finding the letters that she hadn\u2019t searched further.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go and look,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to do it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not.\u201d</p><p>She led the way into her bedroom. The more she thought about it, the more convinced she was that Jacob Dennison had been killed. Perhaps that was why Joan had hidden his letters. She couldn\u2019t bear to part with them, but couldn\u2019t bear to look at them, either.</p><p>Mack opened the closet door and got down on all fours to remove the loose planks. Mary Jo doubted that anything else could\u2019ve been hidden inside that small space.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a flashlight?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, hold on.\u201d She hurried into the kitchen, opening the utility drawer and pulling out the flashlight. Linc had bought it for her and she was grateful because she\u2019d already used it once during a power outage.</p><p>When she returned to the bedroom, Mary Jo found Mack lying on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, handing him the light.</p><p>Mack stretched out his arm and took it from her.</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the excitement out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said in a half grunt. Whatever he\u2019d uncovered was in his hands now. He scrambled into a kneeling position and gave Mary Jo what appeared to be a small square with a piece of oilcloth wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, hardly able to believe her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOpen it and see,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>Mary Jo knelt on the floor next to him and reverently peeled off the protective rag to discover a small brown book, closed with a tiny hinged lock. Across the top Five Year Diary was written in faded gold lettering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Joan\u2019s diary,\u201d Mary Jo exclaimed. She pressed it to her heart. At last they\u2019d have their answer. At last they\u2019d learn the fate of the man who had become so real to them.</p><p>If Mack hadn\u2019t thought to look in the hiding space again, she might never have seen this diary. \u201cThank you, Mack,\u201d she said, and spontaneously leaned forward to kiss him. It was a simple kiss, but it instantly stirred Mary Jo\u2019s emotions.</p><p>Neither of them moved for a long moment and then, as if drawn together by some outside force, they simultaneously reached for each other....</p><p>The diary was forgotten as Mary Jo threw her arms around Mack and gave herself over to his kiss.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Will Jefferson was certain he\u2019d made some headway with Shirley Bliss. After several disappointing conversations, she\u2019d finally accepted a date. This was no small achievement on his end; Shirley had agreed to attend a Seattle art show featuring the work of Larry Knight.</p><p>When the invitation arrived Will knew right away that this event would interest Shirley. She\u2019d always been impressed by his connection with a major art-world star like Knight. Will had asked her out on several other occasions in the past month and she\u2019d had excuses every time. He\u2019d prefer to believe she would\u2019ve been eager to accompany him if not for her \u201cprior engagements.\u201d</p><p>He knew at least one of those engagements was real, the one with her friend Melinda, Matilda...M something-or-other Sullivan. Miranda. That was it. He and Miranda had chatted briefly on the phone and she\u2019d said she\u2019d assist him when necessary. So far, he hadn\u2019t needed her. She hadn\u2019t sounded any friendlier during that conversation than she had the night of the library event. However, Will was confident he\u2019d win her over without a lot of effort.</p><p>Despite his offer to pick her up at home, Shirley had insisted on meeting him at the Bremerton ferry. He wasn\u2019t happy about it, but at this stage he was willing to let her set the parameters of their relationship. If she wanted to go slow, that was fine; he was a patient man.</p><p>When he got to Bremerton, Will found Shirley waiting in the ferry terminal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He held out his hands as he walked toward her and leaned forward to kiss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, too.\u201d She stepped back quickly. He knew she wasn\u2019t physically demonstrative, especially in public, so he wasn\u2019t offended.</p><p>She looked lovely, dressed in a bold black-and-teal outfit. Will felt fortunate to have her at his side. He\u2019d taken care with his appearance, too. He recognized the importance of dressing well and didn\u2019t mind splurging on suits that fit him properly. In his experience, money spent on a man\u2019s wardrobe produced dividends. Clothes made the man; that might be a clich\u00e9 but Will was in full agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you invited me,\u201d she said as they walked onto the ferry. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Larry Knight\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>They made their way to the front, getting to the choice seats before those who\u2019d driven on could reach them. They sat on the comfortable padded benches across from each other.</p><p>\u201cLarry Knight is a friend of mine,\u201d Will reminded her. He didn\u2019t want to point out that if it weren\u2019t for him, Tanni\u2019s boyfriend would never have gotten into that San Francisco art school. Thanks to him and his connections, Shaw was doing what he wanted\u2014and at a considerable distance from Shirley\u2019s daughter. Fortunately, Larry felt Shaw had talent and was willing to help him.</p><p>\u201cI really admire his work, especially some of the recent pieces. You know, the ones that were influenced by sixties pop art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s very talented.\u201d Will knew he sounded a bit cursory.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more than talented,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThe man is a genius.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will frowned. Saying Larry was a genius was going overboard in his opinion. Maybe Shirley thought too highly of the man. Nevertheless, Will was determined to make this an evening she\u2019d long remember. The dinner he\u2019d arranged for afterward was guaranteed to impress her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worked in almost every medium,\u201d she said, and seemed unable to keep her admiration at bay. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone as versatile as Larry. Well, actually, we haven\u2019t met, not officially, but I\u2019m familiar with his work and I almost feel I know him through you. It\u2019s such a privilege to finally meet him.\u201d</p><p>Will was growing tired of this. \u201cI\u2019ve known Larry for years. We met in Atlanta in \u201996, at the unveiling of a painting he did for the Olympics,\u201d Will said, bringing the conversation back to himself. He\u2019d been involved in organizing the cocktail party and subsequent press. Truthfully, Georgia had done much of the work, but she preferred to remain in the background, whereas Will enjoyed the limelight.</p><p>Shirley nodded. \u201cWere you aware Larry used to do cover art?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCover art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor novels.\u201d</p><p>Will hadn\u2019t known about that part of Larry\u2019s portfolio. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt one time he illustrated children\u2019s books, too.\u201d</p><p>He arched his eyebrows in a show of surprise. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t anymore, does he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s priced himself out of that market and probably the commercial art market, as well.\u201d</p><p>Will murmured something noncommittal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so thrilled to have this opportunity to meet him,\u201d Shirley said, sounding more animated than he\u2019d ever heard her.</p><p>Will crossed his legs and suspected now might be a good time to reinforce the fact that her entr\u00e9e to the great Larry Knight was due to him. \u201cLike I said earlier, we\u2019re old friends.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that the artist had lost his wife five years before, because it gave Larry and Shirley a common bond, which didn\u2019t do anything to set his mind at ease.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d she said reverently.</p><p>He nodded, basking in her appreciation.</p> <p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t for you and Larry, Shaw would probably still be working at Mocha Mama\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Some of his tension ebbed. Shirley understood; he hadn\u2019t invited her so she could fawn over Larry Knight. She was his date.</p><p>The Seattle Art Museum was already crowded when they arrived. The walk from the ferry dock up to First Avenue had been exhilarating. It was a beautiful spring night, and the \u201cglitterati\u201d were out in force. Will felt he and Shirley blended perfectly with the rich and cultured art lovers making their way to the event. The tickets hadn\u2019t been cheap, and Will hoped Shirley appreciated that he\u2019d put down serious money for this opportunity. He\u2019d also made dinner reservations at an expensive restaurant.</p><p>When they entered the gallery, Larry was standing with a group of people, all chatting and drinking a variety of high-end wines, if the bottles on display were any indication. Larry was a tall man, two or three inches over six feet. He wasn\u2019t big or muscular but he had a commanding presence. These days he sported a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and tonight he wore a Western-style jacket. His hair, a bit too long by Will\u2019s standards, was combed back from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll introduce you,\u201d he said, steering Shirley in Larry\u2019s direction. Knowing how many people Larry met, Will hoped there wouldn\u2019t be an awkward moment before he recognized him.</p><p>He waited politely until Larry was free, then stepped forward. \u201cLarry, I\u2019d like to introduce my friend, Shirley Bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Jefferson.\u201d Larry shook hands with him. \u201cWonderful to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Will told the other man, hoping his relief wasn\u2019t evident.</p> <p>Next, Larry turned to Shirley and extended his hand. \u201cShirley Bliss,\u201d he repeated slowly. \u201cI recognize the name. You\u2019re an artist?\u201d</p><p>Shirley blushed profusely and seemed too tongue-tied to answer.</p><p>\u201cShirley is a fabric artist from Cedar Cove,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cShirley Bliss,\u201d Larry said, as if the name had suddenly clicked in his mind. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ve seen your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d Shirley seemed stunned by this revelation.</p><p>\u201cYes. Will here sent me a photograph of his gallery, and I had an excellent view of the dragon, which he said is currently on display. An incredible piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy...thank you. That\u2019s one of the biggest compliments of my career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed wine or white?\u201d Will asked brusquely.</p><p>Shirley glanced at him. \u201cRed, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Will\u2019s getting your wine, allow me to show you one of my own pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored.\u201d</p><p>Will scowled as Larry led Shirley away, one hand under her elbow. He didn\u2019t quite know how things had gotten so quickly out of control. He sensed an instant rapport between Larry and Shirley, and it worried him.</p><p>Will located a waiter and obtained two glasses of red wine. When he rejoined Shirley and Larry and handed her the cabernet, she regarded it blankly for a second, then thanked him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve dominated too much of your time,\u201d Will said abruptly, prepared to usher Shirley to the opposite side of the room.</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d Shirley agreed with obvious reluctance. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoyed speaking with you, Larry. Thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Larry bowed his head slightly and held her gaze a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cShall we look around?\u201d Will suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>Will drew her away from Larry but saw how Shirley\u2019s eyes followed the other man as he strolled about the room, greeting his guests and chatting with them.</p><p>As they surveyed the paintings, Will had to appreciate Larry Knight\u2019s talent\u2014although he wasn\u2019t the least bit inclined to appreciate the attention Larry had paid to his date.</p><p>Each canvas seemed to mesmerize Shirley. \u201cHis use of color and shadow is awe-inspiring,\u201d she said at least a dozen times.</p><p>Will knew Larry\u2019s work sold for six figures and up. At those prices they should inspire awe.</p><p>An hour later, the room started to clear. Will was about to suggest they leave when Larry unexpectedly sought them out.</p><p>Shirley\u2019s eyes lit up as he approached. \u201cDo you two have dinner plans?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Will said, not giving Shirley an opportunity to answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI\u2019d like it if you could join me at a private supper this evening. I fly out early in the morning. It\u2019ll be my agent, the exhibit\u2019s curator, a few other people and me. We\u2019re getting together at a club not far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t,\u201d Will said, trying to sound genuinely sorry.</p><p>Shirley shot him a pleading glance. \u201cCan\u2019t we change our plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no. I\u2019ve made dinner reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was obviously none too happy.</p><p>Will locked eyes with the other man, warning him to butt out. Shirley was his date and Larry was treading on his territory.</p><p>\u201cAnother time, then,\u201d Larry said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cAnother time,\u201d Will echoed. He clasped Shirley\u2019s elbow as he led her toward the exit.</p><p>Once outside, he half expected Shirley to argue, but she accepted his unwillingness to share her company. Her attitude soothed his ruffled ego. It was bad enough that Shirley had hung on every word Larry Knight uttered.</p><p>Will had made reservations at the best steak house in Seattle and preordered a bottle of expensive wine. He was surprised to learn that Shirley wasn\u2019t fond of red meat. Maybe he didn\u2019t know her as well as he\u2019d thought....</p><p>She was subdued on the ride back to Bremerton. When the ferry docked he insisted on walking her to the parking garage, where she\u2019d left her car.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as they reached her vehicle. \u201cI had such a nice time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed myself, too,\u201d he said, hoping to emphasize that the evening wouldn\u2019t have been half as pleasurable without her.</p><p>\u201cMeeting Larry was definitely a highlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I could make that happen for you.\u201d Will hated to be so blatant; still, he wanted Shirley to acknowledge his role in presenting her with that \u201chighlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost his wife, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d So Larry had told her he was a widower. Too bad, since Will had made a point of not mentioning it....</p><p>\u201cFive years ago. She had a heart ailment. Apparently she\u2019d been born with it but they didn\u2019t find out until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTragic,\u201d he said. Those were details he hadn\u2019t known. Obviously the two of them hadn\u2019t been discussing artistic techniques in the few minutes it had taken him to get the wine. Shirley had probably revealed that she was a widow, too.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, searching inside her purse for her car keys.</p><p>\u201cHow about a nightcap?\u201d</p><p>Shirley smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Will hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d agree, but he\u2019d felt he should ask.</p><p>She\u2019d started to open her car door when Will gently placed his hand on her shoulder. After everything he\u2019d invested in making this evening a success, he\u2019d appreciate a kiss.</p><p>But Shirley turned her face and pressed her lips to his cheek. \u201cThank you again for a lovely, lovely evening.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside as she climbed into her car, backed out of the space and drove away.</p><p>Will felt an odd mixture of emotions as he walked toward the lot where he\u2019d left his own car. For the past year he\u2019d lived a restrained and modest life. Practically like a saint, if he said so himself. Or a monk. It hadn\u2019t been easy, either. There\u2019d been more than one opportunity to connect with a beautiful woman, to spend a night or a week with her, no questions asked.</p><p>But the whole point of moving to Cedar Cove was to make positive changes in his life, to break old patterns. He wanted a lasting relationship and he wanted it with Shirley Bliss. Not only was she talented, intelligent, classy, but he found her extremely attractive.</p><p>What he hadn\u2019t considered was the fact that she might not find him attractive. That thought did more than sting; it was a hard blow to his ego. He recognized that Shirley was strongly attracted to Larry Knight, although he doubted a romance between them would go anywhere. Larry\u2019s travel and engagement schedule would make maintaining a relationship next to impossible.</p><p>That left room for Will....</p><p>As he drove back to Cedar Cove, his mind was whirring with ideas on how to pursue the reluctant Shirley Bliss. So far, he\u2019d failed; that was because he\u2019d been too eager, he decided. A bit of circumspection would go a long way. Playing hard to get was a classic strategy, as every high school kid knew.</p><p>He\u2019d wait at least a week before contacting Shirley again. If another one of her pieces happened to sell, great, but he\u2019d mail her a check at the end of the month, like he did for everyone else. No more personal phone calls or special deliveries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That would work. He should probably date someone else, too. He considered the options\u2014and then in a flash it came to him. Grinning broadly he slapped his hand on the steering wheel. If anyone would get Shirley\u2019s attention, it would be her best friend.</p><p>Oh, yeah, Will liked a challenge and this was a two-for-one. Miranda Sullivan and Shirley Bliss. Tomorrow he\u2019d call Miranda and ask her out.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Waiting for Peggy Beldon the morning after Memorial Day weekend, Corrie McAfee glanced out her living room window. Peggy, who was picking her up for their shopping expedition, had taken a break from the renovations she and her husband, Bob, were doing at their Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast on Cranberry Point. The place was deservedly popular; Peggy possessed the gift of making guests feel welcome in their home. She was a multitalented cook, as well. Her breakfasts\u2014all her meals\u2014were feasts to behold. And to enjoy.</p> <p>Corrie moved away from the window and grabbed her purse when Peggy pulled up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d Corrie called out to her husband. Roy would be leaving for his office in half an hour or so, while Corrie, who worked as his assistant, had taken the day off. That was definitely one of the benefits of keeping employment in the family.</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Roy said without lowering the paper.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to warn me about spending too much money?\u201d she teased.</p><p>Roy laid the newspaper on his knee. \u201cWould it do any good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust one small reminder,\u201d Roy said. \u201cYou don\u2019t save money by spending money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d</p><p>He scowled in her direction but his eyes shone with barely disguised amusement. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>Hiding her own smile, she blew him a kiss and was out the door.</p><p>Peggy was on her cell phone when Corrie slid onto the passenger seat. Finishing the call, Peggy closed her cell and smiled over at her friend.</p> <p>\u201cI was talking to Bob. He\u2019s painting the bedrooms this week and I wanted to confirm that I had the right color for each room.\u201d The goal for this excursion was to purchase bedspreads and sheets for the guest rooms at the B and B.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go to the outlet mall in Chehalis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I haven\u2019t been there since last Christmas.\u201d</p><p>The drive would take more than an hour but that gave them a chance to catch up. Corrie wasn\u2019t looking for anything in particular at the stores. True, a bargain was a bargain, but even though Roy had implied otherwise, she was sensible.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mack?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Corrie replied. She was happy to have her son living so close. His relationship with his father was better than it\u2019d been since he was a child. They\u2019d been at odds for years, which had made family gatherings uncomfortable. For her sake, Roy had tried not to goad Mack but his resolve never seemed to last long. She wasn\u2019t sure how or why things had improved. Nothing had really changed other than the fact that Gloria had come into their lives.</p><p>Sadness settled over Corrie as she thought about her oldest daughter. She\u2019d given birth to Gloria as a college student and surrendered her for adoption. She and Roy had broken up; he was involved with another girl by the time Corrie discovered she was pregnant. Without telling him about the baby, she\u2019d returned home to her family and quietly waited out the pregnancy. Not until they\u2019d reunited a couple of years later did Roy learn they\u2019d had a child.</p><p>Then, as an adult, Gloria had tracked them down. Corrie was overjoyed at this opportunity to know the infant she\u2019d relinquished to another family. After Gloria\u2019s adoptive parents were killed in a private plane crash, she\u2019d gone in search of her birth family. Gloria had been shocked to learn that her birth parents had married each other and that she had two full siblings\u2014a younger sister and brother.</p> <p>All in all, their reunion had gone well. Everyone had made an effort, although a certain hesitation remained. Linnette and Mack didn\u2019t share a family history with Gloria, who\u2019d been raised as an only child. They had no memories or experiences in common.</p><p>Everyone had worked hard, and continued to work hard, to make Gloria feel loved and wanted. And yet, at times, Corrie sensed a dissatisfaction in her oldest daughter, a feeling that she didn\u2019t belong. In some ways they were still strangers.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it working out with Mack and Mary Jo living next door to each other?\u201d Peggy asked next.</p><p>\u201cSo far so good.\u201d Corrie held up one hand, fingers crossed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you Mary Jo found a box full of letters from World War II? Mack mentioned that they\u2019ve been doing research on the war,\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember who wrote the letters? Or who received them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were written to a Joan Manry, and they\u2019re from her soldier boyfriend. She worked in the shipyard during the war years, but Mack doesn\u2019t seem to think her family was originally from Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize the name,\u201d Peggy said. She\u2019d been born and raised in Cedar Cove and had married Bob Beldon, her high school sweetheart. They\u2019d lived in the Spokane area for a number of years and then returned to Cedar Cove to retire, buying the bed-and-breakfast.</p><p>\u201cMack said there was an influx of families during the war years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Peggy nodded. \u201cThey came to work in the shipyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young soldier who wrote the letters is called Jacob Dennison. Does that name sound familiar?\u201d Corrie asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d Corrie sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s such an intriguing mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are Mack and Mary Jo doing with the letters? I wonder if either party is still alive.\u201d Peggy checked her rearview mirror as she merged with the freeway traffic heading toward Olympia, the state capital.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo wants to give them to the heirs if they can be located. Mack and Mary Jo have told us quite a lot about those letters. They really are a treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see them sometime.\u201d</p><p>When Corrie murmured, \u201cOh, I would, too,\u201d Peggy added, \u201cI occasionally look at Bob\u2019s letters from Vietnam and...well, they really bring back that whole time.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for a while after that.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s growing so fast,\u201d Corrie eventually commented. \u201cMack asked if I\u2019d watch Noelle for a couple of hours this past Sunday so he could take Mary Jo to the movies. I loved every minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to be a grandma?\u201d Peggy asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d Corrie looked forward to it, but she suspected it would take a few years. Unless, as she hoped, she inherited baby Noelle as her granddaughter. That would thrill her, and Mack, too. A marriage between Mack and Mary Jo seemed increasingly likely.</p><p>She was sure Linnette would eventually marry, as well, although Corrie had the feeling it wouldn\u2019t be for some time. Her daughter wasn\u2019t over losing Cal Washburn, who\u2019d broken her heart. As a result, Linnette had quit her job, packed up her car and set out with no destination in mind. She\u2019d ended up in a small town in North Dakota called Buffalo Valley.</p><p>As a physician assistant she had a lot to offer the community, which had welcomed her with open arms. Last Christmas, Buffalo Valley had remodeled an old house to use as a medical clinic and hired her to run it.</p><p>Linnette was dating a farmer but Corrie doubted the relationship was serious. At least, that was the impression she had, based on meeting the young man briefly and on what Linnette had to say. In their previous conversation, Corrie had asked about Pete Mason, and her daughter had quickly changed the subject. She surmised that the relationship hadn\u2019t developed and Linnette was easing her way out.</p><p>\u201cGloria\u2019s doing well...I think,\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>\u201cHow does she like working with the sheriff\u2019s office here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, as far as I know.\u201d</p><p>Gloria had made the transfer from the Bremerton police to Cedar Cove as soon as an opening became available. She had only praise for Sheriff Troy Davis and his department. Corrie was delighted that their oldest daughter had gone into police work. Roy\u2019s career had been with the Seattle police until he was forced into early retirement because of a back injury.</p><p>They arrived at the outlet center just before ten, and stopped for coffee and a muffin before tackling any serious shopping. Peggy described the rehearsals for the community theater\u2019s new production. Bob had won the role of Jacob in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Peggy, as usual, had volunteered to work on costumes.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Olivia the other day,\u201d Peggy said between bites of her bran-and-cranberry muffin. \u201cShe\u2019s looking more like herself these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Corrie had ordered the same muffin and felt it was nowhere near as good as the ones Peggy baked.</p><p>\u201cOlivia said she plans to return to work in September.\u201d</p><p>Corrie smiled on hearing that. The last time she\u2019d talked to Olivia, the family-court judge was weighing her options and considering early retirement. Apparently Olivia had made her decision.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I had lunch with Faith Beckwith last week,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cShe\u2019s busy making plans for the wedding. You\u2019ll never guess where Troy wants to go for a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawaii?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014Alaska. Some lodge up near the Arctic Circle. To fish.\u201d</p><p>Corrie wrinkled her nose and laughed.</p><p>Peggy dug the paint samples from the bottom of her purse and sorted them out. Then they went in search of bedspreads.</p><p>For some reason Corrie didn\u2019t really understand, she found herself wandering through the baby section while Peggy visited the bedding department. Maybe it was because of Peggy\u2019s earlier question about being a grandmother, but Corrie couldn\u2019t make herself leave.</p><p>Holding up a tiny yellow sleeper, she felt a stirring deep inside. \u201cI\u2019m buying this,\u201d she said to no one in particular. Then, almost immediately, she muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d She put it down again. Roy would think she\u2019d gone crazy, buying baby clothes when she didn\u2019t have the slightest idea when, or even if, she\u2019d become a grandmother.</p><p>She rejoined Peggy and they discussed bedspread choices for the different rooms. They went to three other stores, and Peggy made purchases at each. Corrie helped carry the bulky packages to the car.</p><p>\u201cI think that about does it for me,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m finished.\u201d Corrie glanced over at the outlet where she\u2019d stumbled on the infant jumper.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, this won\u2019t take long.\u201d Corrie rushed back to the store while Peggy waited in the car. She grabbed the yellow sleeper and two others, along with a set of receiving blankets. Before she could stop herself, she added more and more clothes, and blankets and toys to her load. All the while she told herself this was crazy. Roy would laugh his head off, but she didn\u2019t care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They managed to squash the bags in the backseat. Corrie didn\u2019t tell Peggy what she\u2019d bought. They resumed their easy camaraderie, discussing movies they\u2019d recently seen and books they\u2019d read and exchanging gossip of the unmalicious but still enjoyable variety.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me. I appreciated the company,\u201d Peggy said, parking in front of 50 Harbor to let Corrie out.</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cIt was fun.\u201d She started to walk away when Peggy called her back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your bags.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Corrie had nearly left them behind.</p><p>Roy, of course, was at the office, which was just as well. She dreaded telling him the only purchase she\u2019d made was baby clothes\u2014for a nonexistent baby. Even now, she wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d done it. Guiltily, she shoved the packages in the spare-bedroom closet.</p><p>The phone rang as she entered the kitchen, and a quick glance at caller ID told her it was Linnette\u2019s cell. Hearing from her daughter in the middle of the week, let alone the middle of the day, was highly unusual. Linnette was often so busy at the clinic that she didn\u2019t get home until six or seven at night. Thankfully Buffalo Valley had provided housing close by, so her daughter didn\u2019t have far to go when she finished at the end of the day.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d Corrie greeted her cheerfully. \u201cIs the weather in North Dakota as nice as it is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Linnette asked. \u201cI tried earlier and no one was home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShopping with Peggy. Is everything all right? Did you try your father at the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk to Dad. I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Corrie sat on the kitchen stool she kept near the phone. \u201cI\u2019m here now. What\u2019s wrong, Linnette?\u201d</p><p>Her question was met with silence. \u201cI guess there isn\u2019t any easy way to say this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Corrie tried to control the stomach-churning anxiety she immediately felt.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told you before and I didn\u2019t, and then the longer I put it off, the harder it got, and now...now it\u2019s going to come as a shock and I apologize. Please, please, don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d</p> <p>Inhaling deeply, Corrie said, \u201cLinnette, of course I won\u2019t be angry with you. Just tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, Mom. In fact, this is really good. At least, I think it is.\u201d</p><p>A tingling sensation went down Corrie\u2019s spine. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The response was half laugh and half sob.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness...\u201d Corrie slid off the stool and stood upright. Excitement bolted through her\u2014excitement followed by anxiety. Who was the father? Would Linnette, single and self-supporting, keep the baby? Somehow Corrie felt sure she would. \u201cI must\u2019ve known. Somehow I must\u2019ve suspected. I was shopping with Peggy Beldon and I had this irrepressible urge to buy baby clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, there\u2019s more,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having twins,\u201d Corrie blurted out.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarried.\u201d For some reason, this second shock hit her harder than the first. \u201cTo whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete Mason? The guy we met at Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Pete had driven Linnette home so she could visit her family for the holidays. Corrie had liked him, but hadn\u2019t sensed that he and Linnette were anywhere close to marriage.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Corrie\u2019s biggest fear was that her daughter had married on the rebound.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes... We got married when we were driving home. We stopped in Vegas on December twenty-ninth. We didn\u2019t plan to get married. I know it sounds insane, but we could only find one hotel room, and then Pete said we should take it even if it just had one bed. I joked that I wasn\u2019t that kind of girl and he said, Well, why don\u2019t we get married, and I said, Let\u2019s do it, and we did.\u201d Linnette hadn\u2019t paused for breath, and this all came out in a rush. \u201cI think I must\u2019ve gotten pregnant that night.\u201d</p><p>Corrie needed to sit down again. Looking at the calendar, although it hardly seemed necessary, she realized her daughter was five months along. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve known all this time and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mom, I\u2019m sorry. I wanted to say something but I was afraid you and Dad would be upset with us, so like I said, I kept putting it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m thrilled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell Daddy for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Linnette hesitated. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart, I think he\u2019ll be overjoyed. Can I tell Mack and Gloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. Except...Mack already knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack knows.\u201d Corrie found it hard to believe her children had been able to keep this secret\u2014hard to believe and a little hurtful.</p><p>Swallowing her disappointment, she asked, \u201cWhat about Gloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told her yet. Do you want to do it or should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Corrie said. It would be a good\u2014and legitimate\u2014reason to visit her.</p><p>Linnette expelled her breath loudly. \u201cI feel so much better, Mom. I can\u2019t tell you what a relief it is finally to let you know about Pete...and the baby.\u201d</p><p>They spoke for another ten or fifteen minutes, and by the time Corrie hung up, any hurt or disappointment had disappeared. She felt...ecstatic. Okay, so she\u2019d hoped to arrange the perfect wedding for her daughter someday, but she reminded herself that the marriage was more important than the wedding. She wondered if this baby would be a boy or a girl; Linnette had chosen not to know. So...yellow was the right color, at least for now.</p><p>Caught up in her musings, she did some housework and prepared a special dinner of pork tenderloin and saut\u00e9ed spinach, Roy\u2019s favorite meal.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d she said when he walked into the house shortly after six. She met him in the living room, and slipped her arms around his waist.</p><p>Roy eyed her suspiciously. \u201cOkay, what did you buy? How much is it going to set us back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy,\u201d she chided. \u201cI spent less than two hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby clothes?\u201d he repeated, his forehead creased.</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandpa. We\u2019re going to have a baby in...oh, late September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d He looked as if he needed to sit down. \u201cWho\u2019s having the baby?\u201d</p><p>Corrie started to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess. Linnette and Pete, and before you say anything, they\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Gloria Ashton paced the small living room of her apartment as she waited for her dinner date. She\u2019d gone out with the doctor only once before, nearly three years ago. From her point of view, the evening had been a disaster. Afterward, Chad had made numerous attempts to ask her out a second time, but Gloria had declined repeatedly.</p><p>Just thinking about that long-ago date made her cheeks burn with mortification. She\u2019d spent the night with him. One date, and she\u2019d fallen into bed without a single thought to the consequences. She\u2019d never done that before or since and would never do it again. Such irrational, impulsive behavior went against everything Gloria believed. In her opinion, lovemaking should be reserved for committed couples. All she could attribute her conduct to was the fact that she was lost, lonely and unsettled. She\u2019d moved to Washington State in search of her birth parents shortly after the death of the two people who\u2019d adopted, raised and loved her. She was alone and vulnerable, and for reasons she still couldn\u2019t fathom, she\u2019d lowered her natural reserve with this stranger. Afterward she\u2019d felt embarrassed and frankly humiliated by her own behavior, so she\u2019d refused to see him again.</p><p>Then she\u2019d learned that Chad intended to move away from Cedar Cove and she realized she didn\u2019t want him to go. Overwhelmed by unfamiliar emotions, she recognized that she didn\u2019t want to lose him but equally disturbing was her fear of what might happen if she allowed him back in her life. Before she could properly assess her feelings, she\u2019d accepted this date. Their second in three years.</p><p>In retrospect, she thought she understood why she\u2019d reacted to him the way she had that first night. Chad had been wonderful, listening to her, offering encouragement and support. That time with him had been like finding a lifeboat after losing the safety of the ship. She\u2019d told him everything, about the death of her parents, the search for her birth family, her doubt and anguish. She\u2019d bared her soul to this man who was virtually a stranger.</p><p>The doorbell chimed. Gloria closed her eyes, took a deep breath and let Chad into her apartment.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said with an easy grin. He was casually but smartly dressed in a well-fitting beige sports jacket and a blue shirt that reflected the color of his eyes\u2014deep blue with dark lashes. Gloria knew other women found him attractive, too. But his appeal went far beyond his all-American good looks. He exuded confidence and genuine charisma.</p><p>Gloria managed a return smile. \u201cHi. Would you like to come in for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He stepped inside the apartment and shrugged off his jacket, draping it over the sofa arm. \u201cI\u2019m glad you agreed to dinner.\u201d</p><p>A thousand times since, she\u2019d wondered what had possessed her to say yes. He frightened her, intrigued her and mystified her, all at once. She\u2019d never wanted to see him again and yet she was convinced to the very marrow of her bones that if he walked out of her life, she\u2019d always regret letting him go.</p><p>Her hands felt moist and she rubbed her palms against her thighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to bite, you know,\u201d Chad said, grinning again.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cDo I look that tense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Being a good hostess demanded that she ask him if he\u2019d like a drink first. \u201cWine? I have both red and white. The white\u2019s from New Zealand. Roy recommended it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t quite think of him\u2014or refer to him\u2014as her father.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>Gloria was grateful for something to do. She made a beeline for the kitchen and got the bottle of sauvignon blanc from the fridge. Taking two glasses from the cupboard next to her sink, she deftly filled them and carried them into the living room.</p><p>Chad, watching the view from her front window, turned as she approached.</p><p>Gloria handed him a glass and squared her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019d like to start over, if we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart over? You mean you want to forget our first date?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t blush often, but she did now. Lowering her gaze to the carpet, she nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Holding his wineglass, Chad turned back to the window that overlooked Sinclair Inlet. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can. I treasure that night. I always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be repeated, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He faced her again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it could be,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI met the most incredibly warm, beautiful woman that night.\u201d</p><p>She was embarrassed by what he\u2019d said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cI...I wouldn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know you. We don\u2019t know each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, but we do,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re Gloria Ashton and you\u2019re generous, loving, courageous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m so courageous, then why am I shaking like a leaf?\u201d She held out her hand so he could see how just being close to him made her tremble.</p><p>\u201cBut you agreed to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel I had a choice,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I had no choice but to keep asking you. I fell in love with you that night, Gloria. Why else would I stand up to the kind of rejection you constantly threw at me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t love me,\u201d she told him sharply. These were the very words she\u2019d been afraid he\u2019d say. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you fighting me so hard?\u201d He set his wineglass on the coffee table and moved to her side. Placing his hands on her shoulders, he stared down at her.</p><p>Although it was difficult, she met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIf you want to start again, we will.\u201d He dropped his arms. \u201cHello, my name is Chad Timmons.\u201d He held out one hand in a gesture of mock solemnity.</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d she said. Her voice was breathless and quavery. \u201cGloria Ashton.\u201d She briefly touched her hand to his, suppressing a shiver at the contact.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLikewise. So...we\u2019re going out to dinner this evening,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It all seemed a bit ridiculous, but she\u2019d asked for this. \u201cGood,\u201d she said in response. She was able to offer him a small grateful smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She took a quick sip of her wine, then brought both glasses back to the kitchen. Standing by the counter she closed her eyes, praying she could get through the evening without making an idiot of herself.</p><p>\u201cI made reservations at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove,\u201d Chad said as he retrieved his jacket.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said, joining him again.</p><p>Chad helped her on with her sweater. Gloria had fretted over what to wear; she didn\u2019t want to appear too casual, nor did she want to overdress. In the end she chose white linen pants, a sleeveless white top and a pink sweater with a rose pattern.</p> <p>She locked her apartment and they walked to the restaurant. \u201cI parked my car there earlier,\u201d he explained. \u201cI thought after dinner we could go for a ride, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That would be nice.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand and she let him take it. His hold was gentle; she could feel herself beginning to relax. If they could start over, they might actually become friends\u2014and then they could see if friendship led to anything else.</p><p>The dinner was everything she\u2019d hoped it would be\u2014and feared. Once the awkwardness left her, they talked for two hours over succulent crab cakes and the same wine she\u2019d served at the apartment. Chad told her about his experiences at the clinic and she responded with stories from her years of police work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d accepted a position in the E.R. in Tacoma,\u201d he said at one point.</p><p>\u201cWere they upset when you changed your mind?\u201d If so, Gloria would have to take the blame.</p><p>\u201cNot too much. They said if I ever wanted a job to let them know.\u201d</p><p>She looked into her wineglass and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m glad you stayed in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>He added something Gloria couldn\u2019t quite make out. It sounded like \u201cMore than ever.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>They finished their meal, ending with coffee, and strolled along the waterfront for a while. Warm from the bottle of wine they\u2019d shared and feeling more at ease than she\u2019d thought possible, Gloria smiled over at Chad. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am surprised. I didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.\u201d</p><p>Chad rested one hand lightly on her shoulder. \u201cI always knew it would be,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gloria decided not to respond.</p><p>They walked in silence for another ten minutes, and then Chad led her to his car, a sporty convertible. He put the top down. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, \u201cI only had a glass and a half of wine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked once they were both seated inside.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d</p><p>The answer that came automatically to mind was \u201chome.\u201d She wanted her life to go back to the way it was when her parents were alive. She wanted to go home to California, where she\u2019d been raised and everything felt familiar. But that wasn\u2019t possible. Her life there was over. Her parents were buried, her home sold. Everything she knew and loved was gone.</p><p>\u201cWherever you\u2019d like,\u201d she said, since he was waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He put the car in gear and they headed down Harbor Street, then around the cove toward Bremerton. Chad turned on a golden-oldies station and they sang along to classics from Elvis to the Rolling Stones. The car took the corners smoothly and soon Gloria was laughing, closing her eyes in exhilaration and letting the wind tangle her hair.</p><p>\u201cI love the sound of your laughter,\u201d Chad said as he pulled into a parking lot near the shipyard and shut off the engine.</p><p>Gloria smiled when he reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cI feel good,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, either\u2014unless it\u2019s the wine. And the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, those things help, and so does my charming company, but I know what the big reason is.\u201d</p><p>Curious, she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou found your family,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cMy birth parents,\u201d she said. The McAfees had made every effort to welcome her into their lives but it hadn\u2019t really worked. Not for her. She didn\u2019t fit. Much as she wanted to belong, she simply didn\u2019t. It felt forced, like trying to break into a closed circle. The desire was there on both sides, but it would take more than blood to create this bond.</p><p>\u201cYou have a new family now,\u201d he added.</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t doubt that Roy and Corrie loved her. She felt their love\u2014and their regret. She\u2019d been excited to learn she had a full sister and brother, but try as they might they hadn\u2019t truly connected. Not like real siblings. Yes, they\u2019d become friends, but these weren\u2019t intimate friendships.</p><p>\u201cGloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a family?\u201d she asked, and was shocked when her voice cracked. She so badly wanted to fit in with the McAfees and didn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t. Linnette tried to keep in touch but they weren\u2019t close, not the way Gloria wanted. Only yesterday she\u2019d found out from Corrie, who\u2019d come over to her apartment with the news, that Linnette was married and having a baby. Gloria was the last one in this so-called family to hear of her sister\u2019s marriage. Okay, so Linnette had kept her wedding and pregnancy a secret from her parents, too, but Mack knew. Linnette hadn\u2019t told Gloria, though.</p><p>To her acute embarrassment, tears gathered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette\u2019s married,\u201d she whispered, and blinked furiously, embarrassed beyond words by this unexpected display of emotion.</p><p>Chad frowned.</p><p>\u201cShe married P-Pete Mason.\u201d Somehow Gloria managed to choke out the words. \u201cI\u2019m going to be...\u201d She was about to say an aunt, when Chad slipped his finger beneath her chin and turned her face toward him.</p><p>He was going to kiss her. She started to tell him she didn\u2019t want his kiss when his mouth settled lightly on hers. Awareness ripped through her, and even as her brain screamed in protest she willingly surrendered her mouth to his. Winding her arms around his neck, Gloria yielded to the comfort of his embrace.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long they kissed. They couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of each other. When Chad broke away, he released a shuddering breath, then immediately started the car and drove out of the darkened lot.</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t know where they were going. She didn\u2019t care. Closing her eyes, she leaned her head against the back of the seat and tried to understand what had just happened. Or, more accurately, what was about to happen.</p><p>They arrived at Chad\u2019s apartment near the medical facility. He turned off the engine and looked straight ahead. \u201cTell me to take you home, Gloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. Her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cBecause if we go inside, we both know what\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cChad, I\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t do it. With Chad, every defense she\u2019d ever erected tumbled down as soon as he kissed her. Her resolve, her determination that this wouldn\u2019t be a repeat of their first date, flew out the proverbial window.</p><p>Reaching over, she slipped her hand around his neck and brought his lips back to hers. That kiss was like setting a match to a keg of dynamite. Chad pulled away from her and got out of the car.</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t wait for him to come around and open her door. She climbed out and was in his arms again within seconds. They kissed continually on the way to his apartment.</p><p>He fumbled with the keys. She didn\u2019t make it any easier, nibbling on his ear as he attempted to unlock his door.</p><p>Once inside he didn\u2019t turn on the lights. Gloria was glad. She removed her sweater, hardly able to get it off fast enough; her top and her bra followed. With the same sense of urgency, Chad threw off his clothes and led her into the bedroom.</p><p>Entwined, they fell onto the bed without bothering to pull back the sheets. They made love once, drifted off to sleep, and then again when they woke in the middle of the night. Afterward, he cuddled her spoon-fashion, wrapping the sheet and blanket around her shoulders, placing his arm around her waist.</p><p>Gloria woke up at five that morning, feeling sick to her stomach. They\u2019d done it again. She\u2019d spilled her guts to a man she barely knew, revealed her disappointment after finding her family. Even now, she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was about this man that made her forget every scrap of common sense she\u2019d ever possessed.</p><p>Chad snored softly close to her ear. Taking care not to wake him, Gloria slid out of bed. Her clothes were scattered across three rooms. She collected everything in the dark and quietly dressed.</p><p>She left Chad a note and propped it against his coffeepot, then tiptoed silently out of his apartment and walked back to her own. The early-morning chill seeped into her bones.</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t happen again. It couldn\u2019t. They\u2019d been in such a hurry, so hot for each other, they hadn\u2019t even taken time to use birth control. They\u2019d behaved with complete irresponsibility. Not once, but twice. They were a doctor and a cop\u2014two people who certainly knew better. Her face burned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chad had some mystifying, incomprehensible hold on her that stripped away all logic, all reason. It was this quality of his that frightened her\u2014his ability to leave her powerless, vulnerable. She\u2019d never experienced anything like it with another man.</p><p>Not that she didn\u2019t blame herself just as much for ceding control to him. When she talked to high school girls, didn\u2019t she tell them that was exactly what they shouldn\u2019t do? Some role model she was! She\u2019d put herself in a situation she couldn\u2019t handle, one she knew she couldn\u2019t handle.</p><p>The only option, the only way to make sure this wouldn\u2019t be repeated, was to tell Chad she never wanted to see him again. She\u2019d written a note that made it clear once and for all.</p><p>Twelve</p> <p>Mary Jo had dinner in the oven when she heard Mack\u2019s truck pull into their shared driveway. Despite everything, her heart beat a little faster but she tried to ignore the way he made her feel. Falling in love could be dangerous, as she well knew, and she refused to put Noelle and herself at risk again. As much as possible, she ruthlessly shoved aside every bit of tenderness she felt for Mack. He made that difficult, however, and she\u2019d started to weaken....</p><p>As he climbed out, she opened her front door and stood on the small porch.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she called. She couldn\u2019t forget the kiss they\u2019d exchanged when he\u2019d found Joan\u2019s diary. She tried not to think about it and yet it popped into her mind at the most inopportune times. Like now...</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Mack walked over to where she stood. \u201cSomething smells good,\u201d he said, attempting to look around her and into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs that a hint?\u201d she asked, raising her eyebrows.</p> <p>\u201cCould be. What\u2019s cookin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it Reuben casserole. Linc had me make it at least every other week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSauerkraut and corned beef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSauerkraut.\u201d Mack wrinkled his nose in distaste.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like sauerkraut?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot particularly, but if this is Linc\u2019s favorite, then I\u2019d be willing to give it a try.\u201d His gaze held hers, and Mary Jo had the impression that even if she\u2019d baked rocks he would\u2019ve been happy to come for dinner. The thought made her feel light-headed. They\u2019d kissed before, plenty of times. But the night he\u2019d discovered the diary it\u2019d been different, more intense...deeper. It was as though the barriers between them had vanished. Together they\u2019d found a missing piece of the puzzle that intrigued them both. And perhaps a missing part of their puzzle, as well, a connecting piece that brought them together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us,\u201d Mary Jo said, and had to admit she hoped he would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go clean up and be back in ten minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mary Jo watched him walk into his own place and then turned to look at her daughter, who sat in her baby seat, chewing on her tiny fist. Noelle was teething, which made her irritable and a bit feverish. \u201cMack\u2019s coming for dinner,\u201d she announced giddily. She\u2019d fed Noelle earlier and the baby had fussed, not really interested. Mary Jo didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>The previous Sunday, Mack and Mary Jo had gone to the movies. It\u2019d felt more like a real date than the other times they\u2019d gone places together, perhaps because they were on their own, without Noelle to consider. Their relationship still seemed casual but was quickly gaining momentum. Noelle had stayed with Roy and Corrie; Corrie said she\u2019d loved having her and seemed to mean it.</p><p>Mary Jo had set the table and placed the casserole in the middle, together with a green salad and fresh bread, by the time Mack returned.</p><p>\u201cDinner looks great,\u201d he said, eyeing it appreciatively as they sat down.</p><p>She dished up the casserole and passed him the salad. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading Joan\u2019s diary whenever I have a chance,\u201d she said. Actually, she\u2019d done little else during her free time since they\u2019d found the book. She\u2019d started with January 1, 1944, getting to know the intimate thoughts of this woman who\u2019d become so important to her.</p> <p>\u201cAnything interesting so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all interesting. She refers a lot to how she didn\u2019t get along with her sister. Apparently Elaine wanted her to date Marvin\u2019s brother Earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Marvin is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s Elaine\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Earl in the service?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo shrugged. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t say. It\u2019s sort of hard to follow because each entry is only three or four lines. Joan writes in this shorthand way. \u2018Busy today,\u2019 \u2018no letter from Jacob,\u2019 that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see the diary when we\u2019re finished eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d They continued their meal, with Noelle\u2014finally content\u2014in her baby seat. Mack had obviously changed his views on sauerkraut, since he had two helpings. They cleared the table and Mary Jo made coffee, then retrieved the journal from her room. The night before, she\u2019d read until the words had started to blur.</p><p>\u201cDid you get to June 6, 1944?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, just to the first part of May.\u201d Perhaps because she was afraid of what she might learn or because she was so involved in Joan\u2019s day-to-day life, Mary Jo hadn\u2019t skipped ahead.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if she mentions D-day,\u201d he said, opening the clasp and flipping through the pages. \u201c\u2018June 6, 1944. Did my washing. No mail from Jacob. Worked hard all day on troop transports.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroop transports? What does that mean?\u201d Mary Jo asked.</p><p>Mack shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about June 7?\u201d she asked, resisting the urge to read over his shoulder.</p><p>Mack turned the page. \u201c\u2018No mail from Jacob. My heart is broken. Had to tack on 3. Got some 200 w lightbulbs. Wrote letters and emb.\u2019\u201d He looked up. \u201cI see what you mean about the shorthand. I wonder why she\u2019s talking about lightbulbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were probably being rationed.\u201d Mary Jo had only recently learned about ration books. \u201cDid you know it was because of rations that the recipe for red velvet cake was developed?\u201d</p><p>Mack looked up from the diary and stared at her blankly. \u201cRed velvet cake? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my brother Ned\u2019s favorite. I bake it for his birthday every year with cream-cheese frosting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes it red? Strawberries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a sip of her coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading about domestic life during the war. You\u2019re not the only one with a library card,\u201d she told him primly. \u201cI checked out a couple of history books, but they weren\u2019t about battles.\u201d She set down her cup. \u201cLike I said, they focused more on the home front and how families coped with their men being away, women working in large numbers, rationing. Stuff like that.\u201d She paused. \u201cCocoa\u2019s one thing that was rationed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocoa,\u201d Mack repeated. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there was a scarcity of cocoa, and women couldn\u2019t make chocolate cakes. Oh, and sugar was rationed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means...\u201d He gestured with his hand, urging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cWhich means,\u201d she said, thinking it should be obvious, \u201cthat women came up with the idea of substituting red food coloring for chocolate. You mean to say you\u2019ve never had red velvet cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bake you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I have to share it with your brother?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and she smiled back, and for a moment they seemed to be lost in each other. Mary Jo looked away first, but her entire body remained aware of the man sitting across from her.</p><p>Mack returned to the diary. \u201cJune 8, 1944, says, \u2018Jacob, oh, Jacob, why don\u2019t you write. I\u2019m losing my mind.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling assailed Mary Jo\u2019s stomach. \u201cWhat about June 9?\u201d</p><p>Mack turned the page, silently read the entry, then glanced up. \u201c\u2018I scrubbed the house. No letter from Jacob. I\u2019m so afraid....\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep reading,\u201d Mary Jo whispered. She had to know, and yet, at the same time, she didn\u2019t think she could bear it if this man had died.</p><p>\u201cFor June 10 and 11, 1944, all it says is, \u2018No letter.\u2019\u201d He flipped over the page.</p><p>\u201cWhat about June 12?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does it pick up again?\u201d</p><p>Mack started flipping pages again and then set the diary aside. \u201cThe rest of the book is blank,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe wrote nothing more?\u201d Mary Jo murmured. \u201cHe died, then. Jacob must\u2019ve been killed on D-day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure. Maybe we can access military records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or what about looking for Elaine Manry?\u201d she suggested. They might not find Joan, but they might be able to locate her sister.</p><p>\u201cDid she mention Elaine\u2019s married name?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>Mary Jo exhaled in frustration. \u201cNo, but then there wouldn\u2019t be any reason to in her journal, would there?\u201d</p><p>She knew she was overreacting, but she couldn\u2019t help it. After reading Jacob\u2019s beautiful love letters and Joan\u2019s diary so full of longing and angst, she\u2019d come to care deeply about these people. They weren\u2019t just names on a page; they were real people who\u2019d lived through a hellish time.</p><p>\u201cI...I have to believe Jacob was killed,\u201d she murmured, hardly able to say the words aloud. \u201cIt makes sense that if Joan didn\u2019t hear anything after June 6, 1944, something happened to him. Why else would she leave the pages blank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t think we should make that assumption,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cJacob was a paratrooper,\u201d she went on.</p><p>Mack nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe airborne units suffered tremendous losses.\u201d She\u2019d read about troops who parachuted behind enemy lines. One entire unit was mowed down when they landed in a town swarming with German troops. The thought of Jacob\u2019s death felt like a personal loss.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I made the right assumption,\u201d she said, close to tears. That was why she hadn\u2019t read ahead in the diary. Because she knew. Deep down, she knew. This must be why Joan had hidden his love letters. It was too painful for her to see them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just guessing here,\u201d Mack reminded her.</p><p>\u201cBut how can we find out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mack looked perplexed. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a record of all the men buried in France.\u201d Mary Jo had seen pictures of acre upon acre of white crosses on the rolling hills of Normandy. If Jacob had died in France, there was a good chance he\u2019d been buried there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to get that information,\u201d Mack said. \u201cWe might also discover he\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>He seemed so optimistic, so eager to believe Jacob had survived the invasion.</p><p>\u201cHe might\u2019ve been wounded,\u201d Mary Jo said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. We wondered about that earlier, remember?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCommunication took a long time, so it could\u2019ve been weeks before Joan learned what had happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>She nodded, but the possibility that Jacob had never come back from the war was still very real to her.</p> <p>Noelle began to cry, and before Mary Jo could reach for her, Mack stood and took her out of the infant seat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s teething,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s been fussing lately. Plus it\u2019s seven-thirty\u2014time for bed.\u201d</p><p>Mack rocked Noelle in his arms and soon the baby girl was smiling, drool dripping off her chin and onto her pink sleeper. \u201cI should get her into her crib,\u201d she said, feeling slightly guilty that she\u2019d ignored her daughter this long, caught up in the drama of World War II.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the dishes,\u201d he told her. They\u2019d piled everything in the sink and on the counters.</p><p>Getting her brothers to help in the kitchen had always been a struggle, although they paid lip service to the concept of doing their share. Mack\u2019s volunteering was a pleasant surprise.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure I do. My mom said if she cooked, she shouldn\u2019t have to do the dishes. Dad agreed, so Linnette and I had kitchen duty every night.\u201d He grinned wickedly. \u201cThen Linnette and I left home, and Mom pointed out that the dishes had now become my dad\u2019s responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he do them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night,\u201d Mack said. \u201cIn fact, I think he and Mom have fun doing them together. I\u2019ve caught them more than once dancing to old rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tunes.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled. \u201cDo you want me to put on some music?\u201d</p><p>Mack smiled back. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p> <p>By the time she\u2019d finished getting Noelle changed and ready for bed, Mack had cleaned up the kitchen. He turned on the television to the nightly news, keeping the volume low, while she fed Noelle. Then he sat down next to her and, after a moment, put his arm around her shoulders. Mary Jo felt the warmth of his affection and she was convinced Noelle did, as well.</p><p>Her daughter fell asleep in her arms and Mary Jo was far too comfortable to move. She rested her head against Mack and sighed deeply. \u201cI so badly want Jacob to have survived the war,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Mack kissed the top of her head. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>They sat there, quietly watching television for the next hour. When he left, Mary Jo settled Noelle carefully in her crib. She almost didn\u2019t hear the gentle tap on her front door ten minutes later. When she opened it, Mack stood on the other side, the look on his face exultant.</p><p>\u201cI went online as soon as I got home.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo\u2019s heart leaped. \u201cJacob Dennison made it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure, but I do know he didn\u2019t die in France. His name isn\u2019t on the list of Americans buried there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe he was injured, after all, and sent stateside,\u201d Mary Jo said. That, too, might explain why Joan had ceased writing immediately after the Normandy invasion. Somehow, Mary Jo conjectured, she\u2019d made her way to the hospital where Jacob was sent. She\u2019d left everything behind and didn\u2019t want her sister finding her diary. Then, after Jacob had healed, they\u2019d gotten married and Joan had never gone back to retrieve her diary and the letters.</p> <p>Mary Jo felt giddy with relief.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Mack said. \u201cAren\u2019t you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ecstatic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time you were this happy it was because I found the diary\u2014and you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo laughed at his broad hint, then leaned forward and threw her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d Mack said just before he lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Roy McAfee glanced up from his computer screen as Corrie let herself into his office, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cLeonard Bellamy is here to see you,\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>Roy looked at his desk calendar.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an appointment,\u201d Corrie said, confirming Roy\u2019s assumption. \u201cHe asked to see you right away.\u201d The last two words were stated with more than a hint of disapproval.</p><p>Roy already knew his wife wasn\u2019t impressed with Bellamy. His family, probably the wealthiest in the area, owned half of downtown Bremerton and several large properties on Bainbridge Island. Roy knew they had several holdings in Cedar Cove, as well. He\u2019d done work for the man before, mostly background checks on potential hires.</p><p>\u201cI can see him.\u201d Roy was admittedly curious\u2014it wasn\u2019t every day Leonard Bellamy stopped by for a chat.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t make an appointment,\u201d Corrie reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m available,\u201d Roy said. Corrie was well aware that not everyone scheduled appointments with him; he always had a certain number of walk-ins. He wasn\u2019t going to hold that against Bellamy, even if his wife did. Leonard Bellamy paid his bills promptly.</p><p>The last case Roy had worked on for Bellamy had concerned an employee who\u2019d filed for workers\u2019 compensation, claiming that due to a serious back injury, he was unable to continue in his current position. Having suffered from back ailments himself, Roy was in full sympathy with the employee\u2014until he caught him training to climb Mount Rainier hefting a fifty-pound knapsack. Leonard had paid Roy a handsome bonus at the end of that investigation.</p><p>\u201cHe comes in without an appointment and just assumes you\u2019ll see him because he\u2019s the great and mighty Leonard Bellamy,\u201d Corrie muttered. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s arrogant and demanding and a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow him in, Corrie,\u201d Roy said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI will, but I don\u2019t like him taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to defend Bellamy, since Corrie\u2019s dislike of him made her unwilling to listen.</p><p>A minute later she escorted Leonard Bellamy into Roy\u2019s office. Roy stood and the two men exchanged perfunctory handshakes.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Roy said, and waited until the other man had taken the upholstered chair across from him before sitting down again. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he asked. He was a busy man and so was Bellamy. They didn\u2019t need to waste time with further chitchat.</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ve met my daughter, Lori.\u201d</p><p>Roy wasn\u2019t sure he had. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know I have two daughters, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And a son. Older than the girls. Both Robert and Denise worked with their father.</p><p>\u201cYou may remember that Lori was engaged to...to that felon Geoff Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Roy knew the Duncan case well. Geoff had worked for attorney Allan Harris as his legal assistant. Harris had been handling Martha Evans\u2019s estate when several pieces of expensive jewelry went missing. All the evidence suggested that Dave Flemming, a local pastor, had been responsible for the theft. Sheriff Troy Davis and Roy had solved the case together. In a systematic search of pawnshops, Roy had come across one where Geoff had left a piece of the jewelry.</p><p>Geoff had accepted a plea bargain and was now serving a prison sentence.</p><p>\u201cI do remember that Duncan was engaged at the time,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>Bellamy sighed loudly. \u201cI swear that girl doesn\u2019t have the sense God gave a duck. You\u2019d think she\u2019d have better judgment, but Geoff managed to convince her that he was madly in love with her and the two of them were meant to be together. I had my suspicions the minute we met. The man was a con artist of the first order. He didn\u2019t love Lori. It was blatantly obvious he was after her money.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI have to admit he grew on me after a while\u2014that con-artist-charmer type, you know. But I should\u2019ve gone with my gut instinct.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t respond, although he had his own opinion on the matter. He\u2019d seen Geoff Duncan as an unfortunate case. The young man had gotten in over his head financially, trying to impress the Bellamys, and when his money situation became precarious, he\u2019d stolen the jewelry. Roy didn\u2019t believe Geoff Duncan was a career criminal\u2014just irresponsible and desperate to make a good impression on his fianc\u00e9e and future in-laws. His plan had backfired, and the man seemed genuinely repentant when confronted with the truth.</p><p>\u201cI hate to say this, but my daughter isn\u2019t the brightest girl you could hope to meet.\u201d Bellamy sat back in the chair and crossed his legs. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s jumped directly from the frying pan into the fire with this latest stunt of hers.\u201d</p><p>Roy had perfected his poker face years ago and was able to conceal his aversion to the way Bellamy spoke about his daughter.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d he asked in a mild voice.</p><p>The question was ignored. \u201cDid I mention she works at a dress shop? My daughter in a dress shop. Three years of college and she drops out because she\u2019s got some fantasy about becoming a designer. This friend of my wife\u2019s owns a dress shop and hired her. If Lori wanted to quit school and find a job, I could\u2019ve given her one. When I offered, you know what she said?\u201d</p><p>Roy wasn\u2019t allowed to answer.</p><p>\u201c\u2018No, thank you, Daddy,\u2019\u201d he said in a falsetto voice. \u201c\u2018I\u2019d rather work with Brenda.\u2019\u201d He closed his eyes, apparently overcome with frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to check out her employer?\u201d Roy asked, figuring this must be what he had in mind.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he barked, then cast Roy an apologetic look. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Lori\u2019s done something to top all the other foolish decisions she\u2019s made in the past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Bellamy clenched his hands until his knuckles went white. \u201cShe married a man she barely knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Roy said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, she met this man and married him within a month. Perhaps less. I don\u2019t know if my wife got the story straight. As you can imagine, Kate was more than a little upset.\u201d He blew out a sigh, and his shoulders slumped. \u201cNaturally Lori tried to keep it a secret from us. If it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that Kate\u2019s friend Brenda\u2014the one who owns the shop\u2014let it slip, heaven knows how long it would\u2019ve taken us to find out. When I talked to Lori after Kate told me, the girl didn\u2019t bother to deny it. She admitted she\u2019d married this man\u2014as if getting married is something you do on a whim. My wife was mortified that a friend had to be the one to tell her our daughter has a husband.\u201d</p><p>Roy could empathize with their shock. Knowing what he did about the family, Roy suspected the Bellamys would have expected to throw a huge wedding. Not only had she eloped, but she\u2019d deprived them of putting on the event of the year.</p><p>\u201cYou can imagine how upset Kate is about this,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cYou obviously are, too,\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Roy did understand his feelings\u2014to a degree\u2014because he\u2019d experienced something similar. Linnette had recently surprised him and Corrie with her news. Marrying Pete Mason without a word to family until the deed was done had been a shock to them, too. However, they\u2019d met and liked Pete. Roy considered himself a good judge of character, and he trusted the man. Pete was a decent, hardworking farmer, and their daughter loved him. The fact that Linnette was about to make them grandparents only sweetened the deal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt gives me no pleasure to come to you with this,\u201d Leonard continued. \u201cI want you to find out whatever you can about this man who manipulated my daughter into marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do a background search for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig up everything there is,\u201d he said, his face growing red. \u201cThis man is a parasite. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have his name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, and that\u2019s another thing. Lori\u2019s taken his name. She\u2019s no longer Lori Bellamy but Lori Wyse. Not even Bellamy-Wyse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWyse?\u201d Roy repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes, like wise guy.\u201d Bellamy smirked as he said it.</p><p>\u201cAny relation to Mary Jo Wyse?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy stared across the desk at him. \u201cDon\u2019t know who that is. Why?\u201d</p> <p>Roy picked up his pen and rolled it between his palms. \u201cMy son, Mack, is dating Mary Jo Wyse. She lives on the other side of his duplex. I seem to remember Mack mentioning that her brother\u2019s moved into town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met this Linc Wyse?\u201d</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ve met Mary Jo a number of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Lori married Lincoln Wyse. Linc, for short.\u201d He seemed to wait for Roy to respond.</p><p>\u201cThey might be related, which means it could be a conflict of interest for me to take this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t be objective?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying I know a relative or someone who might be a relative. I\u2019d want you to be aware of that up front. Not telling you would be a breach of ethics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I know it. Now find the dirt on this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a money-grubbing thief, hoping to swindle my idiot daughter out of every penny she\u2019s due to inherit.\u201d He scowled. \u201cFact is, I\u2019m tempted to cut her out of my will. Then we\u2019ll see how long this so-called marriage lasts. It would serve her right, too. When can you start?\u201d</p><p>Roy hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWill you take the case or not?\u201d Bellamy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to investigate Lincoln Wyse,\u201d Roy said after a moment, \u201cbut with your full understanding that this man could very well be related to the woman my son is dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said I don\u2019t care.\u201d Bellamy waved off his concern. \u201cHow soon could you get me the information?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow soon do you want it?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cYesterday. I want this man out of my daughter\u2019s life before she does something even more foolish and gets pregnant. I swear she\u2019s determined to age her mother and me before our time. If it isn\u2019t one thing with Lori, it\u2019s another. The girl seems to do nothing but embarrass us. First it was Duncan and now she marries a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does seem to have an impulsive nature,\u201d Roy said carefully, still somewhat perturbed by the man\u2019s contempt for his daughter.</p><p>Bellamy stood and again they exchanged handshakes. \u201cI\u2019ll wait to hear from you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>The other man held his look. \u201cDon\u2019t spare the truth. I want it all, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I do a thorough search,\u201d Roy promised.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>With that, Bellamy was out the door, seemingly eager to escape. No sooner had he left the office than Corrie got up from her desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want this time?\u201d she asked, her eyes narrow with suspicion. She stood in his doorway, her arms folded.</p><p>Okay, the guy was arrogant and demanding, but he wasn\u2019t the first client who\u2019d behaved that way. Roy didn\u2019t know why his wife found Bellamy so objectionable. \u201cHe wants me to do a background check on someone.\u201d</p><p>Corrie made a snorting sound.</p><p>\u201cI realize you don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a bad feeling about him,\u201d she said. \u201cA bad vibe, as we used to say.\u201d She looked at him earnestly. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been particular about the cases you accept. Even when I don\u2019t like one of our clients, I\u2019ve never expressed my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Roy cocked his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cFine. Maybe I have...occasionally. Bellamy pays his bills on time, which is good, but if it were up to me\u2014and I know it isn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d steer clear of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently his daughter eloped a few weeks ago and he\u2019s afraid the young man married Lori for her money.\u201d Roy stood and walked over to his wife\u2019s side. \u201cLori married Lincoln Wyse. I think he might be Mary Jo\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Corrie met his eyes. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Bellamy that was possible and I said it might cause a conflict of interest, but he didn\u2019t care. He wants me for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Lori and Linc,\u201d she said, her frown deepening. \u201cThey\u2019re a sweet couple. I refuse to believe Linc married her because she\u2019s related to Leonard Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>Corrie returned to the front office and Roy sat down at his desk again. He was logging on to his computer to begin the search when Corrie came back. \u201cI still don\u2019t think you should take this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said, leaning back in his chair. He linked his fingers behind his head and regarded his wife. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>Corrie seemed flustered. \u201cHe...he wants you to dig up something damaging. If you don\u2019t, he\u2019ll believe you didn\u2019t do your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Actually, it was. Roy suspected Bellamy was hoping Roy would come up with a divorce or two or perhaps a bankruptcy, just to prove to his daughter how wrong she was.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d take the job,\u201d Roy said, and he was a man of his word.</p><p>\u201cThen untell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d If he accepted a job, then he intended to follow through\u2014and he\u2019d conduct his investigation with integrity. At the same time, he\u2019d never seen his wife this adamant about a case.</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling you were going to say that,\u201d Corrie said with a deep sigh of resignation. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t regret this.\u201d</p><p>Roy waited until she\u2019d left the office and closed the door. When he was fairly sure she wasn\u2019t listening, he reached for his phone and dialed his son\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d Call display was a marvelous thing, Roy mused.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>Roy got right to the point. \u201cWhat do you know about Linc Wyse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc Wyse,\u201d Mack repeated. \u201cMary Jo\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalt of the earth. Honest as the day is long. And other assorted clich\u00e9s. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s married to Lori Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe married her, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Roy smiled. \u201cMen marry for reasons other than love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Linc. He\u2019s not like that.\u201d Mack spoke with certainty. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say why you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t.\u201d He rarely approached family with business matters but he felt Mack\u2019s judgment about people was reliable. \u201cThanks. You told me what I needed to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Roy answered. \u201cThanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>As Roy disconnected, he grinned. He\u2019d look into Linc Wyse\u2019s background, but he doubted he\u2019d find anything that would satisfy Leonard Bellamy\u2019s hunger for negative information. Roy acknowledged he\u2019d derive some pleasure from that when he made his report.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>After three straight days of rain, the sun broke out shortly after noon on Saturday.</p><p>Mary Jo was more than ready to leave the duplex for a while. Noelle had been irritable all morning and a distraction would be good for both of them.</p><p>Despite the overcast skies and drizzle earlier in the day, Mack had been working outside, wearing rubber boots. He\u2019d weeded the garden and was now erecting a fence around the backyard. He\u2019d also promised to put up a swing for Noelle, which he planned to do.</p><p>There was a chance of rain, so Mack had suggested they drive down to the farmer\u2019s market and include a stop at the library. Immediately after lunchtime, she bundled up Noelle and they set off, again taking her car.</p><p>When they\u2019d parked in the free lot next to the library, Mary Jo got Noelle from the backseat while Mack set up the stroller. The baby gurgled happily when Mary Jo fastened her inside. Her little girl was growing so quickly. Already Noelle was sitting up on her own, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before she started crawling.</p><p>They returned their library books, then walked over to the market, chatting about Joan and Jacob and the letters.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Grace and Olivia. At that booth with all the soap.\u201d Mary Jo caught their attention and waved.</p><p>The two women immediately came toward them. Grace carried a small bag from the Soap People and as they drew closer Mary Jo could smell the distinctive scent of lavender.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s Noelle,\u201d Olivia said, leaning over to get a better look at the baby. \u201cOh, my, she has two little teeth.\u201d</p><p>After the months of chemo, Olivia\u2019s hair had grown back in short, bouncy curls all over her head. Mary Jo wasn\u2019t sure what the color or texture had been before but it was silver now, and Mary Jo thought it was beautiful. She hadn\u2019t met Olivia until last December, when she was in the middle of her fight with cancer. She\u2019d been so thin and pale. So fragile. She was a different woman now, still thin but healthy and vibrant.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re off to shop,\u201d Grace told them after they\u2019d visited for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, you two,\u201d Mack said as he steered Mary Jo toward the market.</p><p>Mary Jo purchased two pounds of fresh clams and invited Mack to share in her feast that night. He bought a crusty loaf of French bread from the local bakery and salad makings, plus a bottle of white wine to complement their meal. She told him that soon they\u2019d have produce from their garden\u2014lettuce and peppers and beans.</p><p>\u201cOur garden,\u201d Mary Jo said again. Mack had done all the hard work, tilling the ground and preparing the soil. True, she\u2019d done the planting, but they\u2019d both contributed to the weeding and watering. From the beginning they\u2019d agreed to share the bounty.</p><p>\u201cWell, sure, it\u2019s our garden,\u201d Mack said, sounding surprised. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve enjoyed working in it as much as I\u2019m going to enjoy eating all that good stuff.\u201d</p><p>A man who liked gardening. That seemed to her a very positive thing. It showed how nurturing and patient he was, how generous. She didn\u2019t want to fall in love with him and yet it was almost impossible not to....</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Mary Jo noticed her brother and his wife. She was about to mention it when she saw Linc place his arm around Lori. Marriage had changed her oldest brother. Mary Jo became aware of the subtleties it had brought into his life\u2014or, perhaps, revealed in his personality\u2014every time she saw him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For years Linc had been on his guard, looking after his family. He\u2019d taken on the responsibilities of a parent, constantly worrying about his siblings, trying to protect them. He hadn\u2019t liked it when Mary Jo had moved to Cedar Cove, but her decision had been a turning point for him, as well.</p><p>She\u2019d made a mess of things by trusting David Rhodes. Naively, she\u2019d believed he loved her, because it was what he\u2019d said and what she wanted to believe. All his lies and false promises had left her pregnant and alone.</p><p>In giving herself to David, she\u2019d rebelled against the control Linc had over her. Her pregnancy had complicated everything\u2014and yet it was the beginning of a new order in the Wyse family. She\u2019d moved to Cedar Cove and, as an indirect result of that, Linc had met Lori. Over the past few months Mary Jo\u2019s relationship with her brother had begun to change. He became her brother for the first time since they\u2019d lost their parents. Her brother and not a surrogate father.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Linc and Lori?\u201d Mack asked.</p> <p>Mary Jo nodded. The differences in Linc were apparent in more than just his attitude. He seemed at ease with himself and the world. He behaved like a carefree young man, and she realized how much he\u2019d been robbed of after their loss. Selfishly, all Mary Jo had thought about were her own feelings, not his. She regretted her adolescent rebelliousness, recognizing that, without ever intending to, she\u2019d made his life harder.</p><p>They met and chatted for a few minutes, making tentative dinner plans for later in the week. Then Mack and Mary Jo resumed walking through the market. Mack purchased a couple of quilted bibs for Noelle, who seemed to constantly drool now that her teeth were coming in. Mary Jo tied a pink one around her neck right away.</p><p>Around three o\u2019clock, the market started to wind down. Mack suggested they continue their stroll along the waterfront. The afternoon was so bright and sunny that Mary Jo eagerly agreed. Noelle had fallen asleep, and Mary Jo felt relaxed, contented in the sunshine and Mack\u2019s presence.</p><p>The Seattle ferry had just pulled into the Bremerton dock and seagulls circled overhead. The scent of the tide going out filled her nostrils.</p><p>Pushing the stroller with one hand, Mack clasped her hand with the other. They didn\u2019t speak. The simple pleasure of walking by the water, all her senses engaged\u2014being with Mack\u2014made her happier than she\u2019d been in a long time. She was about to tell Mack exactly that when a familiar voice spoke behind them. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t this a cozy picture.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Jo\u2019s blood turned to ice. David Rhodes.</p><p>At the sound of David\u2019s voice, Mack whirled around. Instinctively Mary Jo moved closer to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Mack demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d David answered defiantly.</p><p>Seeing her baby\u2019s father so unexpectedly was almost more than she could tolerate. Her entire body started to shake.</p><p>\u201cI see it didn\u2019t take you long to find my replacement,\u201d David said, staring at Mack. He smiled then, that easy, confident smile she knew so well. \u201cActually, he\u2019s welcome to you. All I care about is my daughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Mary Jo asked, then regretted the question. The answer was obvious. He\u2019d come to see his father and stepmother. Or worse, he\u2019d come in search of her and Noelle.</p><p>While he claimed all he cared about was Noelle, she noticed that he hadn\u2019t glanced once at the stroller or their daughter, as if Noelle didn\u2019t even exist.</p><p>\u201cI came to find you,\u201d David said, looking directly at Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She hated the way her voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. Nor did she want to.</p><p>\u201cStay out of Mary Jo\u2019s life,\u201d Mack said from between clenched teeth.</p><p>Mary Jo placed a calming hand on his forearm. She didn\u2019t want this to turn into a sparring match, although she was fairly sure that if it did, Mack would easily overtake David. Seeing him now, with his puffy face and bloodshot eyes, she wondered why she\u2019d ever been attracted to the man.</p> <p>Even as she asked herself that question, her mind provided an immediate response. In David she\u2019d seen freedom, a way out from under her brother\u2019s thumb. David Rhodes had offered her an escape, and she\u2019d been both foolish and blind enough to take it.</p><p>David returned his attention to Mary Jo. \u201cI\u2019m here to warn you that if you file for child support with the state, you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threaten Mary Jo and you\u2019ll deal with me,\u201d Mack growled. He brushed her hand from his forearm and stood directly in front of David.</p><p>David didn\u2019t back down. \u201cAs I mentioned earlier,\u201d he said in a congenial voice, \u201cthis really isn\u2019t any of your business. The matter of our child\u2014and who gets to keep her\u2014is between Mary Jo and me.\u201d He looked at Mary Jo again, his eyebrows raised. \u201cMy father said he advised you to file for child support.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo swallowed uncomfortably. Ben had brought up the subject this past Wednesday, when she\u2019d stopped by for her weekly visit. He\u2019d felt David should be held financially accountable for his daughter. The fact that David had denied any responsibility disturbed Ben, and he\u2019d urged Mary Jo to file for support. She\u2019d promised to consider it. She hadn\u2019t discussed any of this with Mack, but had been quietly contemplating a course of action. Her biggest fear was that if she did file, David would insist on visitation rights, and he seemed to be implying that he would. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of handing Noelle over to David, since she didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>A slow smile appeared on David\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s a wise decision.\u201d</p><p>Mack took a menacing step forward.</p><p>David held up one hand. \u201cMary Jo can make her own decisions,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need any help from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on marrying her,\u201d Mack told him.</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cWell, good for you, but don\u2019t forget I had her first.\u201d</p><p>For an instant Mary Jo felt as if she was going to be sick. \u201cStop it!\u201d she shouted. \u201cJust stop it.\u201d</p><p>Noelle woke with a piercing cry. Mary Jo and Mack reached for her at the same time, bumping heads in the process. Mary Jo grabbed her daughter, turning her back on both Mack and David. She was shaking so badly it was almost impossible to walk.</p><p>This confrontation was horrible. Every fear she\u2019d ever had regarding David seemed to be staring her in the face. For the second time since leaving Seattle she had the strongest desire to move back to her family home.</p><p>Mack caught up to her a moment later, touching her shoulders. \u201cDavid\u2019s gone,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, his face concerned.</p><p>Mary Jo wasn\u2019t sure how to answer him. Every part of her trembled with shock and reaction. She never wanted to see David again as long as she lived. As for turning Noelle over to him\u2014she\u2019d rather die. His threat was all too real, and Mary Jo refused to take chances with her daughter. The less Noelle had to do with her biological father, the better.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo?\u201d Mack\u2019s hands tightened on her shoulders. \u201cAnswer me. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shivering.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps because she sensed her mother\u2019s tension, Noelle began to cry. Mary Jo bounced her baby gently in her arms and whispered words of reassurance.</p><p>Mack took control then, getting Mary Jo and Noelle back to the car, then dealing with the stroller. Once inside, he started the engine.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m taking you,\u201d Mack said soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI mean Seattle.\u201d She gazed straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle and I will be safe there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe with me,\u201d Mack countered.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s never been to the house in Seattle. He...he doesn\u2019t even know where my family lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking clearly,\u201d Mack said urgently. \u201cHe could get their address, no problem.\u201d</p><p>Although she knew he was right, Mary Jo didn\u2019t care. Every instinct she possessed told her to run and hide. She didn\u2019t want to risk running into David ever again and if she remained in Cedar Cove that would always be a possibility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Troy Davis,\u201d Mack told her.</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to file a restraining order against David Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere must be something,\u201d he said stubbornly. \u201cWe can look into it.\u201d</p><p>Still, she didn\u2019t know if that was the best way to handle the situation.</p><p>In what seemed like only a minute, they were back at the duplex. But when Mack pulled into the driveway, he made no move to leave her car.</p><p>\u201cWill you get a restraining order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but it gives the sheriff the authority to arrest him. I refuse to allow this man to threaten you and Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come too far to let him stand between us now,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>Wiping her face, Mary Jo felt torn by indecision. Her afternoon had begun with such promise, meeting special friends, seeing her brother and Lori\u2014and now this.</p><p>She looked at Mack. \u201cHold me. Please, just hold me.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her, and Mary Jo buried her face in his chest. Closing her eyes, she took in his warmth and his love. Soon the trembling subsided.</p><p>\u201cOkay now?\u201d Mack whispered.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo more talk of moving back to Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my smartest idea,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cYou heard what David said. Ben wants me to file for child support. He believes David needs to be held responsible for Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that something you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d Ben had made a good case, but although she\u2019d listened intently to everything the older man had said, Mary Jo wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of David talking to you like that.\u201d Mack\u2019s voice was steely. \u201cI don\u2019t like his threats or his insinuations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid.\u201d She realized that he dreaded facing eighteen years of child support and wanted out. If that involved making her life miserable, then he\u2019d do it.</p><p>Mack opened the door. \u201cI meant what I said.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo looked at him, confused by his comment. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarrying you.\u201d</p><p>Not that again. \u201cMack, thank you, but no.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, and for an instant she saw hurt and disappointment in his eyes before he could disguise his feelings.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we been through this before?\u201d she asked, hoping to make light of his proposal. \u201cThe last time, your proposal was prompted by another one of David\u2019s threats.\u201d If he really wanted to marry her, Mary Jo wanted to be loved for herself and not because Mack was afraid of losing her or Noelle to David Rhodes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess I forgot,\u201d he muttered, striding toward his side of the duplex.</p><p>\u201cMack!\u201d she called.</p><p>Abruptly he turned to face her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still coming for dinner, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Shirley Bliss was curled up on her living room sofa, feet tucked beneath her and a cup of tea in her hand. Her friend Miranda sat across from her, holding an identical mug, also filled with steaming tea. Miranda had recently accepted a part-time job with Will Jefferson, which in Shirley\u2019s opinion was good for Will and for Miranda. Her friend didn\u2019t need the money, but she was at loose ends and Will could use the help. Besides, Miranda had connections that could benefit the gallery.</p><p>Her husband had been a well-known landscape artist. Miranda dabbled in art, too, although she lacked the discipline to capitalize on her talent. However, she had an excellent eye and her criticism was incisive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dying to hear about your hot date with Will Jefferson,\u201d Miranda said.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a hot date,\u201d Shirley said, not meeting her eyes. Shirley felt mildly guilty for accepting Will\u2019s invitation. In all likelihood, she would\u2019ve found yet another excuse to refuse if not for the fact that he\u2019d asked her to the gallery event, where she\u2019d met Larry Knight. Shirley couldn\u2019t turn down the opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>When they did meet, Larry was everything she\u2019d imagined and more. They hadn\u2019t spoken long. He\u2019d told her he\u2019d lost his wife five years earlier, and an instant rapport had developed between them. Those minutes alone with him\u2014despite being in a room full of people\u2014had been magical.</p><p>\u201cWill took you to Canlis, didn\u2019t he?\u201d This was one of the most exclusive and expensive restaurants in Seattle.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Miranda gave a short laugh. \u201cApparently he didn\u2019t get the message that you don\u2019t eat red meat.\u201d Shirley wasn\u2019t a full vegetarian and did on occasion eat beef, but not often and never steak.</p><p>\u201cHe got it by the end of the night.\u201d The message about her food preferences wasn\u2019t the only one. She couldn\u2019t have been any clearer\u2014she wasn\u2019t interested in pursuing a relationship with Will Jefferson. While she appreciated everything he\u2019d done for Tanni and Shaw, that appreciation didn\u2019t imply any kind of romantic relationship.</p> <p>\u201cHe talked you into letting him display your dragon piece.\u201d</p><p>That, too, had been prompted by the guilt Shirley felt over using Will, primarily in the situation with Tanni and Shaw. The dragon was a deeply personal work of art that she\u2019d never allowed in public before and wouldn\u2019t again. He wanted it up for the summer and she\u2019d reluctantly consented, after initially agreeing to only one month.</p><p>To her, the dragon symbolized the fiery grief the death of her husband had brought into her life. Shirley had made the fabric collage shortly after her husband, Jim, was killed in a motorcycle accident. Will had taken one look at it and practically begged her to let him display it. After weeks of turning him down she\u2019d finally acquiesced, with the proviso that specific measures be taken to protect it. Will had accepted her conditions.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Will since last Sunday?\u201d Miranda asked.</p><p>Shirley shook her head. His reticence was mildly surprising. He\u2019d been finding one reason or another to contact her every other day and then...silence. Not that Shirley was complaining.</p><p>\u201cDoes the fact he hasn\u2019t called concern you?\u201d Miranda asked.</p><p>Sipping her tea, Shirley watched her friend over the rim of her mug. \u201cWhy all these questions about me and Will Jefferson?\u201d</p><p>Miranda shifted uncomfortably. \u201cNo reason. I was just wondering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI enjoyed talking to Larry Knight for five minutes far more than I enjoyed that expensive dinner with Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would never have met Larry if it hadn\u2019t been for Will.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you feel guilty about that, right?\u201d</p><p>Shirley sighed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Miranda mumbled, looking decidedly un comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Shirley asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI heard from Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Jefferson? He called you about work, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Miranda shrugged. \u201cAt first I thought he wanted me for the gallery. I\u2019ve already worked a couple of afternoons. However, this time he called and...asked me out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>That was encouraging news. \u201cAnd?\u201d Shirley asked, excited for her friend.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Her reply was forceful. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go out with the man my best friend\u2019s dating if you paid me a million bucks.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWell, maybe I would for that kind of money.\u201d</p><p>Shirley smiled, too. \u201cI get your drift, but you don\u2019t have to turn him down.\u201d</p><p>Miranda looked in every direction except Shirley\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, it wouldn\u2019t bother me in the least if you wanted to go out with Will,\u201d Shirley said, hoping to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cBut it would bother me.\u201d Miranda spoke just as adamantly as she had earlier. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in you. The only reason Will asked me is to get a reaction out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>Miranda rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you could be right.\u201d Shirley laughed. \u201cSo call him back and tell him you\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Shirley repeated. \u201cBecause I have a feeling you might actually be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding! That man\u2019s used to women falling all over themselves to make him happy. He\u2019s had his way for far too long.\u201d Amusement glimmered in her eyes. \u201cYou were the exception, the woman he couldn\u2019t get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, rumor has it there were others,\u201d Shirley said, thinking of Grace.</p><p>\u201cHe needs a woman who\u2019ll tell him what\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman he needs, Miranda, is you,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, not interested.\u201d</p><p>Shirley wasn\u2019t convinced that was even close to the truth. \u201cWhatever you decide is fine with me. I don\u2019t want him, so he\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him, either,\u201d Miranda said stubbornly. \u201cIt would take far too much time and effort to whip him into shape. I don\u2019t have the inclination or the patience to take on that project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Miranda insisted.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Shirley had seen the spark in Miranda\u2019s eyes whenever Will\u2019s name was mentioned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start with me, Shirley Bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I won\u2019t,\u201d she returned, smiling. Oh, her friend was interested, but at the same time she was afraid. Miranda\u2019s marriage hadn\u2019t been nearly as happy as Shirley\u2019s. For all his talent, Hugh Sullivan had been a difficult and demanding personality.</p><p>A half hour later, Shirley was in the kitchen preparing a chicken-and-rice casserole dish when Tanni came home.</p><p>Her relationship with her teenage daughter was rocky and hadn\u2019t improved much. Shirley tended to tread lightly, always unsure of Tanni\u2019s mood. It was usually best to wait for her to speak first.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d her daughter asked, wrinkling her nose as she watched Shirley work.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Shirley said without elaborating.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t putting mushrooms in it, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She had planned to add mushrooms but wouldn\u2019t now. \u201cThis is chicken with cheese and rice. Does that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds okay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Evidently Shirley had deflated her daughter\u2019s indignation. She chanced a look in Tanni\u2019s direction and took a leap of faith. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>Tanni whirled around, and Shirley was shocked to see tears in her eyes. In the past she would\u2019ve pretended she hadn\u2019t noticed, but she couldn\u2019t do that anymore. She reached out her arms and hugged Tanni.</p><p>Tanni released a sob as she slid her arms around her mother\u2019s waist. \u201cHe won\u2019t even answer my text messages anymore,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cShaw?\u201d</p><p>Tanni nodded jerkily.</p><p>The two of them\u2014Tanni and Shaw\u2014had been together constantly for about eight months. Shirley had been nearly frantic with worry that they might become physically involved. Her fear was that they\u2019d already crossed that line. Will Jefferson had thrown her a life preserver when\u2014with Larry\u2019s assistance\u2014he\u2019d arranged for Shaw to attend the San Francisco Art Institute.</p><p>At first Shaw and Tanni were in frequent communication, but then as the weeks passed, Tanni heard from him less and less often. In the beginning she\u2019d made excuses for Shaw. \u201cHe\u2019s busy,\u201d she\u2019d say, keeping her cell phone close at hand.</p><p>\u201cI thought he loved me,\u201d Tanni blurted now. Shirley could feel her daughter struggling to control her emotions.</p><p>She had no words of advice to offer. It didn\u2019t matter. What Tanni needed was comfort and love, and Shirley had both in abundance.</p><p>\u201cI volunteered at the library because I thought it would help take my mind off Shaw, but that\u2019s no good, either.\u201d</p><p>The Reading with Rover program was going well, and Shirley assumed Tanni enjoyed being part of it. Every indication from Grace Harding suggested that Tanni was doing a terrific job.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to like working with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I hate having to deal with Kristen.\u201d She twisted her lip as she pronounced the other girl\u2019s name. \u201cShe\u2019s such a goody-goody,\u201d Tanni spat out. \u201cAnd Grace wants me to make nice. Give me a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll work it out.\u201d Shirley couldn\u2019t think of anything else to tell Tanni.</p><p>\u201cI want to quit, but I can see how much the little kids love reading to the dogs. And if I left, Grace would have to remove someone from the program. That\u2019d be wrong. Besides, I\u2019d just go back to worrying about Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t quit without a good reason.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter glared up at her as if Shirley had uttered the stupidest words ever spoken by a parent. \u201cThanks, Mom, but I already figured that out on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops, sorry.\u201d They rarely had a conversation without Shirley making at least one critical error in judgment, saying either too much or too little.</p><p>Tanni broke out of her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not calling or texting Shaw ever again.\u201d</p><p>That was no doubt for the best, although hard to pull off, especially since these kids seemed to have cell phones permanently attached to their hands.</p><p>Tanni hesitated. \u201cNot today, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to hold on to your cell phone for you?\u201d Shirley asked, thinking it might help if she kept temptation out of the way.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tanni sent her a scornful look and went into her bedroom, closing the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, sorry I asked,\u201d Shirley muttered.</p><p>The phone rang and caller ID said it was a private number. As usual, Tanni answered after a solitary ring. Two or three seconds later her daughter shrilled down the hallway, \u201cIt\u2019s for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Shirley asked. If she didn\u2019t get this casserole in the oven, dinner wouldn\u2019t be ready until eight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Some man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome man\u201d probably translated into Will Jefferson, but if that was the case Tanni should have recognized his voice. He certainly phoned often enough.</p><p>Sighing, she reached for the phone. \u201cThis is Shirley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley, it\u2019s Larry Knight. Am I calling at a bad time?\u201d</p><p>Shock and delight rippled through her. \u201cNo, not at all. This is perfect.\u201d Any time he called would be perfect as far as she was concerned. She hadn\u2019t dared to hope she\u2019d hear from him.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you what a pleasure it was to meet you last week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe pleasure was mine.\u201d The expression was commonplace, but she meant it sincerely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be in the Seattle area again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...wonderful.\u201d She wished her voice wasn\u2019t so breathless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a friend of mine.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley waited for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to ask if you\u2019d be free to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d she said, regardless of the details.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on Sunday the twenty-seventh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d She bit her lip, embarrassed that she no longer seemed to know any other words.</p><p>\u201cI can get a third invitation if you\u2019d like to include Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, that isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Larry asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI arrive early Saturday and fly out Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come to Cedar Cove?\u201d she asked, and immediately regretted it. She imagined how awkward it would be if they ran into Will Jefferson.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have commitments in Seattle on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Of course he would. Shirley felt gauche for having made the suggestion. Larry was an important artist, a celebrity, and he had better things to do than visit Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible to see you on Sunday? Have dinner after the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I mean, yes, it would be possible.\u201d Every time she opened her mouth she seemed to say something stupid. She had to wonder why Larry wanted to see her at all.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He sounded pleased, which only added to Shirley\u2019s delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you called,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to hear from you, and, well, I\u2019m...more than a little flattered.\u201d It was probably all wrong to tell him that, to be so effusive, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>They talked for another five minutes while they made arrangements. He\u2019d send a car for her and, if he could manage it, he\u2019d come with the car, although at this point that looked doubtful. As he spoke, Shirley got a pen and pad from the kitchen junk drawer and wrote it all down, certain that if she didn\u2019t she\u2019d forget every word.</p><p>As soon as she was off the phone, Shirley rushed down the hallway to her daughter\u2019s bedroom and threw open the door. Tanni lay on her bed, cell phone in hand, text messaging.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who that was!\u201d Shirley cried.</p><p>Tanni looked up with a bored expression. \u201cHugh Jackman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly. Larry Knight.\u201d</p><p>Tanni gaped at her. \u201cThe Larry Knight. The artist?\u201d Shirley nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything about Shaw?\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t even occurred to Shirley to ask. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, feeling a little guilty.</p><p>The hope that had flared in Tanni\u2019s eyes was quickly extinguished.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me on a date,\u201d Shirley told her.</p><p>\u201cA date with you?\u201d</p><p>Shirley knew it probably sounded as inconceivable to her daughter as it did to her that Larry Knight had asked her out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded, trying not to act too happy when her daughter was so miserable over Shaw. Still, she couldn\u2019t quite contain her joy as she hurried back to the kitchen.</p><p>She could hardly wait to tell Miranda about this.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Charlotte sat in her favorite chair, doing her favorite thing\u2014knitting. Her fingers were as busy as her mind and although she\u2019d knit this same sweater a number of times she kept making small mistakes that she had to rip out, kept needing to refer to the pattern. She\u2019d been so distracted and forgetful. She blamed it on this stress caused by her husband\u2019s son, David.</p><p>Ben had turned on the television and sat staring at it, apparently engrossed, although she doubted either of them was concentrating on the evening news.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d Charlotte finally said.</p><p>He glanced away from the TV and looked at her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ask Olivia. She knows about the law in situations like this.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate; there was no need to. Ben knew very well that she was talking about David\u2019s daughter, Noelle.</p><p>Ben\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had no intention of pressuring him. Ben loved his little granddaughter and had already taken financial measures to secure her future. His son\u2019s actions had devastated him\u2014and this wasn\u2019t the first time. David had a history of hurtful and irresponsible behavior, which included \u201cborrowing\u201d money from Ben. Money that was rarely ever repaid. A \u201csponger,\u201d her own son had called him. Maybe Will\u2019s behavior hadn\u2019t always been exemplary, either, but compared to David he was a paragon.</p><p>Charlotte knew Ben had been hoping David would do the right thing, the responsible thing, and support his child. That hadn\u2019t happened and probably wouldn\u2019t. Instead, David had obstinately insisted Noelle wasn\u2019t his child, even after admitting it earlier. But he could no longer deny his paternity, since a DNA test had proven it conclusively.</p><p>They\u2019d spoken with David on Saturday. Now he\u2019d started claiming that DNA testing wasn\u2019t infallible and that Mary Jo was some kind of fraud. Or\u2014and he\u2019d also claimed this\u2014she was promiscuous, although he\u2019d put it more crudely.</p><p>Ben wasn\u2019t having any of that and neither was Charlotte. He\u2019d urged Mary Jo to file a paternity suit. For David to acknowledge his responsibility and accept it would be the honorable course of action, but as Charlotte had learned, David Rhodes was not an honorable man. \u201cMaybe it would be a good idea to discuss this with Olivia,\u201d Ben said after several minutes.</p><p>\u201cShe deals with similar cases every day in court, or she did,\u201d Charlotte amended, \u201cwhen she was working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is...\u201d Ben let the rest of his thought fade.</p><p>Charlotte knew better than to prompt him. Ben often broke off in the middle of a sentence while he considered a dilemma or mulled over a solution.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is,\u201d he began a second time, \u201cI don\u2019t know if Mary Jo is willing to take our advice.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was knitting at a frantic pace, ignoring any errors she might be making. The poor girl had arrived at the house late Saturday afternoon, so upset she\u2019d hardly been able to speak; they got the story out of her in bits and pieces. From what Charlotte recalled of the conversation, David had confronted Mary Jo and more or less threatened her if she pursued child support.</p><p>Charlotte was outraged whenever she thought about it. She didn\u2019t say anything because it would only upset Ben, and he\u2019d already endured about all he could from his youngest son.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d make up a batch of that soup you like. The one with the meatballs and fresh spinach.\u201d For the life of her, she couldn\u2019t remember the name of it.</p><p>\u201cItalian wedding soup,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one. I bet Olivia would enjoy it, too. I\u2019ll make a big pot and we\u2019ll bring it over tomorrow afternoon for lunch.\u201d She\u2019d spend the morning baking a loaf of oatmeal molasses bread and would add that to her basket.</p><p>Ben reached across the space between their two chairs and took her hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you thanking me, Ben Rhodes?\u201d</p><p>He answered her with the sweetest of smiles. \u201cFor your love and patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vowed to love you, and I do, and as for the patience part, you don\u2019t need to thank me for that. You\u2019re a good man, and a good father, too.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. We can\u2019t take on the faults of our children. As adults, we all make our own decisions and live our own lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s still hard to see our children acting badly.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>The following afternoon, Ben drove Charlotte out to Lighthouse Road. As they walked to the back door, she studied the small vegetable garden and the strawberry patch, dotted with succulent red berries. She\u2019d pick some later and make Olivia that freezer jam she liked.</p><p>\u201cAnyone home?\u201d Charlotte called out as they entered the house.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice came from the spare bedroom. \u201cOh, is it lunchtime already?\u201d She hurried into the kitchen with a measuring tape around her neck and a pair of scissors in one hand. She must be working on a quilt. Ever since Olivia had started to recover, she\u2019d been designing and sewing quilts for her grandchildren. They were lovely, too. It was an activity that occupied her time and gave her a creative outlet.</p><p>Ben set the Crock-Pot filled with soup on the kitchen counter and plugged it in.</p><p>\u201cAs promised, we brought lunch,\u201d Charlotte announced. She opened the kitchen cupboard, taking down three soup bowls and three bread plates. \u201cIs Jack going to be joining us?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cHave you ever known my husband to miss one of your meals?\u201d She got another bowl and plate, while Ben efficiently collected the silverware. \u201cHe\u2019s been taking time off every day to drive home and check on me. Oh, he makes it sound like he\u2019s just home for lunch, but I know that man and he\u2019s watching over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well he should,\u201d Charlotte said. She approved of Jack\u2019s less-than-subtle approach to caring for her daughter. She was grateful he kept a close eye on Olivia; the cancer was bad enough, but they\u2019d very nearly lost her last fall, and the scare had put them all on edge. The memory of those weeks always sent a chill down Charlotte\u2019s spine.</p><p>As if he\u2019d been able to smell the fresh-baked bread, Jack pulled into the space behind Ben\u2019s car. He bounded out of his vehicle and came through the kitchen door, clutching a copy of the latest Cedar Cove Chronicle. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your very own delivery boy,\u201d he said cheerfully, handing it to Olivia. \u201cHi, everyone.\u201d</p><p>They all greeted him and Charlotte smiled at him fondly.</p><p>\u201cDo I smell lunch?\u201d he asked, glancing expectantly around. He kissed Olivia\u2019s cheek and walked straight past her to the Crock-Pot on the counter. Lifting the lid, he closed his eyes. \u201cMmm. Homemade soup?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cItalian wedding,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cAs usual, you\u2019re right on time,\u201d Charlotte told him. \u201cEverything\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Within a few minutes, the four of them were sitting at the kitchen table; the bread was still warm enough to melt the butter, and the soup was delicious, if Charlotte did say so herself.</p><p>\u201cActually, Olivia, we\u2019re not just here for lunch\u2014\u201d he inclined his head at Charlotte \u201c\u2014delectable though it is. We have a few questions for you, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Ben said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Olivia looked somewhat surprised.</p><p>\u201cThis has to do with Noelle,\u201d Charlotte supplied, eager to help.</p><p>\u201cIt has more to do with my son than Noelle,\u201d Ben inserted.</p><p>Charlotte saw that he\u2019d set his spoon aside and didn\u2019t reach for it again. The subject of David had obviously ruined Ben\u2019s appetite. \u201cI urged Mary Jo to file for child support,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe should do it,\u201d Jack seconded vigorously, an opinion Charlotte strongly agreed with.</p> <p>\u201cMary Jo knows David\u2019s unemployed. She thinks there\u2019s no point in filing when he isn\u2019t making any money.\u201d Ben turned to Olivia with a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cWhether he\u2019s currently employed or not doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Ben\u2019s expression was one of relief.</p><p>Charlotte felt they should review the facts. \u201cMary Jo\u2019s been taking care of Noelle on her own and it isn\u2019t right. Ben wanted to help her financially, but Mary Jo wouldn\u2019t accept money.\u201d She had to admire the young woman, although her situation must be difficult.</p><p>\u201cI did include Noelle in my will,\u201d Ben explained. \u201cBut I feel it\u2019s David\u2019s responsibility to support his daughter even if he wasn\u2019t married to the child\u2019s mother. As it is, he\u2019s not supporting the child he had with his ex-wife, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen told his son how he felt and I\u2019m afraid their talk didn\u2019t go well. Unfortunately, David ran into Mary Jo shortly after meeting with his father.\u201d Charlotte glanced at Ben, wanting his permission before she continued. He nodded.</p> <p>She paused a moment to butter some bread. \u201cIt turns out that David saw Mary Jo and Mack McAfee with Noelle down by the waterfront on Saturday afternoon. You remember how lovely the day was, don\u2019t you? Well, Mary Jo said David threatened her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreatened?\u201d Olivia asked, frowning. \u201cHow, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Ben took over then. \u201cFrom what Mary Jo could tell us, it seems David implied that if she went after child support, he\u2019d fight her for custody of Noelle. By the way,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ve recently learned that he\u2019s moved to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte noticed that he didn\u2019t say anything about the woman David was living with, the woman who was supporting him. She knew it was a source of great shame to Ben.</p><p>\u201cI suppose being in Seattle gives him greater access\u2014and makes him more of a threat,\u201d he went on to say.</p><p>\u201cIn these situations, the state virtually always keeps the infant with the mother,\u201d Olivia assured them.</p><p>\u201cMy son has no intention of raising that child. He has another daughter from his marriage that he rarely sees. He has no interest in being a father to either of his children, painful as that is for me to admit.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte placed her hand over Ben\u2019s, offering him what comfort she could.</p> <p>\u201cIn my opinion, Mary Jo should call his bluff.\u201d Olivia spoke in a no-nonsense voice. \u201cThe courts don\u2019t take kindly to these types of threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Mary Jo, David didn\u2019t even look at the baby once,\u201d Ben said. \u201cIn Noelle\u2019s whole life, he\u2019s never held her, never touched her, and to claim now that he\u2019ll fight for custody is just plain ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when he denied even fathering the child,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cThe judge will ask about his involvement with Noelle to this point,\u201d Olivia told them. \u201cThat is, if the case ever comes before the court, which I doubt will happen.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cYou never know. He might get himself some crackerjack lawyer with a bee in his bonnet about father\u2019s rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Olivia sighed. \u201cMy guess is that David\u2019s using intimidation, hoping Mary Jo won\u2019t ask for money from him, especially now that he\u2019s unemployed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she does, I\u2019m afraid David will refuse to pay,\u201d Ben murmured. \u201cEven if he finds another job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince paternity is verified, the state will garnishee David\u2019s unemployment check, presuming that he\u2019s receiving one. He won\u2019t have any choice but to pay child support.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte knew he wouldn\u2019t like that, and his current girlfriend wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation between Mack and Mary Jo?\u201d Olivia asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard that they\u2019re sharing a duplex,\u201d Ben answered. \u201cEach living in one half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves that little baby. Why, Mack\u2019s far more of a father to her than David,\u201d Charlotte put in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI saw the three of them at the market on Saturday and they looked just like any young family on an outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mack\u2019s sweet on Mary Jo,\u201d Ben told them.</p><p>Sweet was such a lovely word, Charlotte mused. Old-fashioned and charming. Anyone could see that Mack and Mary Jo were falling in love.</p><p>\u201cIf I was a betting man, I\u2019d say they\u2019ll end up married.\u201d Jack reached for his third slice of bread.</p><p>Charlotte passed him the butter, which he took gratefully until Olivia placed a hand on his forearm. Without saying a word, Jack pushed the butter aside and patted his wife\u2019s hand.</p><p>This exchange took only a few seconds and it made Charlotte smile despite the seriousness of their conversation. A couple of years ago, Jack had suffered a heart attack, and ever since, Olivia had stood guard over his diet. The way she and Jack looked after each other was inspiring.</p><p>\u201cHas Mary Jo given you any indication that she\u2019ll eventually marry Mack?\u201d Olivia asked her mother and Ben.</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but like Ben said earlier,\u201d Charlotte replied, \u201cit\u2019s obvious that they\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were to marry, do you believe Mack would want to legally adopt Noelle?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t need to think about her response. \u201cI believe he would. He\u2019s crazy about that baby. Noelle and Mary Jo are all he talks about.\u201d To be fair, she hadn\u2019t had a lot of conversations with Mack, but whenever she did, he was full of stories about them. And his mother said the same thing.</p><p>Ben raised a cautious hand. \u201cI suspect\u2014\u201d He hesitated, then started again. \u201cI suspect that Mack and Mary Jo had some sort of disagreement after seeing David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ben...\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand again, stopping her. \u201cI know Mary Jo was flustered and upset when she came to see us, but I\u2019m sure it was over more than what happened with David.\u201d</p><p>Thinking about it, Charlotte had to agree. Mary Jo had been in a real state. She\u2019d needed to get away, she said. She needed to talk to someone. With Mack living right next door, wouldn\u2019t she go to him? Unless she couldn\u2019t....</p><p>Of course, he might\u2019ve been at the firehouse, but then Charlotte remembered Olivia mentioning that she\u2019d seen Mack and Mary Jo together that same afternoon. So Mary Jo could easily have discussed the matter with him. Instead, she\u2019d come to Ben and her.</p><p>Charlotte turned to her daughter. \u201cWhy are you asking about Mack?\u201d He wasn\u2019t part of the equation. This had to do with David, Mary Jo and Noelle.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I asked about Mack\u2019s feelings toward Mary Jo,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cis because he might want to adopt Noelle if and when he marries Mary Jo. You told me you thought that would be the case.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She had said that. And it was true.</p><p>\u201cI just want everyone to be aware of the potential complications.\u201d</p><p>Ben shrugged. \u201cIf I know David, I\u2019d say he\u2019ll do everything within his power to make the adoption as hard as possible. He doesn\u2019t want Noelle himself, but he won\u2019t want anyone else to become her father. It\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s how my son\u2019s mind works.\u201d Ben lowered his head. \u201cMuch as I hate to admit this about my own flesh and blood, if David feels he has the upper hand, he\u2019ll use it to his advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cthat you take that power away from him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cHave Mary Jo file for child support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she will,\u201d Charlotte felt obliged to insert. The girl had been so terrified that David would try to take Noelle away from her.</p><p>\u201cDavid will put up a fight, so warn her in advance to be prepared for that. Really, it\u2019s what we want because the next move will be Mary Jo\u2019s. She can then approach him with relinquishment papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that entail?\u201d Ben asked. \u201cIs it as straightforward as it sounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. If David signs those papers, he relinquishes his rights as Noelle\u2019s father. Then Mack would be free to adopt Noelle,\u201d Olivia explained.</p><p>Charlotte clasped her hands together. \u201cThat would be wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if not Mack, some other man in the future,\u201d Olivia added. \u201cIf David wants out of paying child support, this is the way to do it. I can almost guarantee it\u2019ll save Mary Jo untold heartache later on.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was more than satisfied. \u201cWe need to discuss this with Mary Jo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAt our earliest opportunity,\u201d Ben concurred.</p><p>For the first time since David\u2019s last visit, Charlotte noticed that the frown he\u2019d constantly worn had disappeared.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>\u201cYou know what Mack\u2019s going to tell us, don\u2019t you?\u201d Corrie said confidently as she finished setting the table for dinner. Mack had asked if he could bring Mary Jo and Noelle over on Friday evening. That was unusual, so Corrie was convinced she knew the purpose of this visit. Their son was going to announce that he\u2019d asked Mary Jo to marry him. They\u2019d planned to drop by for coffee or a drink, but Corrie had invited them all to dinner. After checking with Mary Jo, Mack had confirmed that they\u2019d be available.</p><p>Roy was in the living room, watching the news, and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cRoy!\u201d Corrie said, so excited she could barely contain herself. \u201cMack is going to tell us he\u2019s asked Mary Jo to be his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure of that?\u201d he asked, glancing briefly away from the screen.</p><p>\u201cNot one hundred percent. Call it a mother\u2019s intuition, but I know my son, and he\u2019s head over heels about Mary Jo and that baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged. \u201cTime will tell. Don\u2019t plan the wedding yet.\u201d</p><p>Corrie set the casserole dish on the table to cool. She\u2019d made one of Mack\u2019s favorite recipes, shepherd\u2019s pie with a mashed-potato base. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mack had asked for this dish on every birthday for as long as Corrie could remember. It seemed fitting to prepare it for him the night he told them he was engaged. She wondered what kind of ring he\u2019d bought Mary Jo....</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d Roy was looking out the front window, which provided a good view of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing,\u201d she said, rubbing her hands together. And she meant it in more ways than one. Linnette and Pete were married and now their son, too, was ready to start his family.</p><p>Corrie removed her apron and tossed it on a kitchen chair. She\u2019d take the salad out of the refrigerator just before they sat down at the table. They\u2019d visit first, with some hors d\u2019oeuvres and a congratulatory glass of wine.</p> <p>Roy opened the door for Mary Jo and their son, who held Noelle\u2019s baby carrier.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome.\u201d Corrie rushed forward to hug Mary Jo and her son. Her eyes instantly went to the baby who would soon be her granddaughter. She looked forward to becoming a grandmother\u2014twice in one year\u2014and already adored Noelle. She envisioned cooking with her one day and teaching her how to make shepherd\u2019s pie. They\u2019d have tea parties and would fill coloring books together.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d make that,\u201d Mack said, gesturing at the table. \u201cSmells fantastic.\u201d He kissed his mother on the cheek as Mary Jo dealt with Noelle.</p><p>Corrie noticed that Mary Jo wasn\u2019t wearing an engagement ring, but maybe Mack hadn\u2019t bought it yet. All through their drinks and carefully chosen appetizers\u2014cheese, crackers, stuffed mushrooms and tiny sausage rolls\u2014she waited for an announcement that didn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s ready,\u201d Corrie finally said, and stood to bring the salad to the table.</p> <p>They sat down together, and after a short grace, Roy refilled their glasses. Corrie handed the serving spoon to her son.</p><p>\u201cThis is my favorite dinner,\u201d he told Mary Jo. \u201cMom makes it every year on my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the recipe if you like,\u201d Corrie was quick to tell Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you. I\u2019d enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s a great cook.\u201d</p><p>Corrie blushed at the praise. She took her first bite and was pleased with how well the shepherd\u2019s pie had turned out\u2014every bit as good as last year\u2019s. She didn\u2019t make it often, since Roy had his own favorites.</p> <p>Halfway through the meal Corrie couldn\u2019t stand the suspense anymore. \u201cI believe I know why you and Mary Jo wanted to stop by,\u201d she said coyly, glancing at her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Mack\u2019s gaze shot to Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cYou know we came about the letters?\u201d Mary Jo asked Corrie.</p><p>Corrie frowned. \u201cLetters? What letters?\u201d She turned to her husband, hoping for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo found a box filled with letters from World War II,\u201d Mack said. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d she replied. In fact she\u2019d had a long conversation with Peggy about them.</p><p>\u201cThen Mack found a diary, hidden in the same space,\u201d Mary Jo added.</p><p>\u201cYou came here because you wanted to talk about the letters?\u201d Corrie was fascinated by them, too, but couldn\u2019t let go of her hope that they\u2019d come to share the news of their engagement.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re incredible, Mom.\u201d Mack\u2019s voice rose with enthusiasm. \u201cDid I tell you Mary Jo and I have been doing research on D-day? The Normandy invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune 6, 1944,\u201d Roy said, apparently in case she\u2019d forgotten the date.</p><p>\u201cJoan Manry and Jacob Dennison were so much in love, and then after the invasion...there\u2019s nothing.\u201d Mary Jo looked at Corrie and then Roy. \u201cNo more letters, no more diary entries. It\u2019s a mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo and I keep wondering what happened to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dying to find out,\u201d she told Corrie. \u201cThe letters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked to have dinner with us because of the letters?\u201d Corrie broke in. She couldn\u2019t conceal her disappointment.</p><p>Mack stared at her blankly. \u201cActually, you asked us to dinner, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...no. I apologize.\u201d Corrie placed her hands in her lap. \u201cI thought... I hoped you\u2019d come for another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrie...\u201d Roy warned, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mary Jo asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hoped...\u201d Corrie managed a half smile as she turned to her son. \u201cI just assumed, you know, with the two of you spending so much time together, that you might\u2019ve decided to...get married.\u201d She looked from her son to Mary Jo and then at Noelle. She\u2019d swear the baby wasn\u2019t pleased, either, making a sad face and kicking out her legs as if struggling to break free of her carrier.</p><p>\u201cMack and I\u2014\u201d Mary Jo\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo, that isn\u2019t it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about the letters,\u201d Roy said, changing the subject and not being subtle about it.</p><p>Mack seemed as eager as his father to talk about something other than marriage. \u201cSeeing how abruptly the letters stopped after the invasion, Mary Jo and I thought Jacob must\u2019ve been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think so now,\u201d Mary Jo said, \u201cbecause we can\u2019t find his name on the list of soldiers laid to rest in France following D-day. Nor is he among those recorded as missing in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have been wounded,\u201d Roy suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe thought so, too, but getting that kind of information is much more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Roy said, casting Corrie one of his I-told-you-so looks. \u201cSo you want me to help you with the research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Mack responded. \u201cFor now, we\u2019d just like any ideas you might have. Any new directions you could point us in.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re actually having a lot of fun reading about the war and looking for information on Jacob\u2019s role. We found some maps of Normandy\u2014of the beaches\u2014on the internet with the battle plans marked on them. We know approximately where his division landed.\u201d</p><p>Mack gave a slight nod of his head. \u201cI was never that interested in history, but these letters have opened my eyes to how exciting it can be. These were real people who put their lives on the line. Jacob didn\u2019t want to die\u2014I mean, no one does. He said in one of his letters that he didn\u2019t see himself as any sort of hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was. They all were,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Joan must have told him that. Unfortunately, we only have the letters Jacob wrote, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we have Joan\u2019s diary, which is filled with little details about everyday life during that time period,\u201d Mack went on to say. \u201cI think they\u2019re fascinating. She has just a few lines for each day and agonizes when she hasn\u2019t heard from Jacob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe talks about saving her sugar coupons to make a cake and walking for miles to save on gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly everything was rationed during the war years,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI remember my parents talking about that.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. \u201cAnd there are abbreviations for things, but we can\u2019t always figure them out.\u201d</p><p>Corrie felt their enthusiasm and, despite herself, was becoming intrigued.</p><p>\u201cIf and when you decide you need help,\u201d Roy said, \u201cyou let me know and I\u2019ll see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you so much, Mr. McAfee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Roy.\u201d</p><p>Or Dad, Corrie wanted to say, but didn\u2019t; she\u2019d annoy Mack, not to mention Roy, and embarrass Mary Jo, if she did. But she knew her son and every indication she saw said that Mack was in love with this girl.</p><p>The baby began to whimper, and Mary Jo immediately pushed back her chair. \u201cNoelle\u2019s teething. She\u2019s had a difficult week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d Mack offered, getting up.</p><p>While they discussed who should comfort the baby, Corrie leaned toward her husband. \u201cLook at them,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey act just like a married couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrie,\u201d Roy said in a warning voice. \u201cKeep out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they need help. You know, to realize how they feel about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf so, it shouldn\u2019t come from us.\u201d</p><p>Corrie didn\u2019t agree, but there wasn\u2019t much she could do. Roy obviously felt she\u2019d interfered enough.</p><p>When Mack and Mary Jo returned to the table, he held Noelle in his arms while Mary Jo rubbed a numbing gel over the baby\u2019s gums.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s usually a happy baby,\u201d Mary Jo said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cListen, would you two like me to watch her so you could go out for the rest of the evening?\u201d Perhaps if she gave them some time alone, they\u2019d reach the same conclusion she had. Roy might not think the young couple needed her assistance, but in Corrie\u2019s view they did.</p><p>Mack glanced at Mary Jo. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo thanked Corrie with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave Noelle when she\u2019s this fussy, but I appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>Corrie\u2019s spirits sank.</p><p>Mack got to his feet and started to clear the table. \u201cAny dessert?\u201d he asked, peering into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you baked a cake,\u201d Roy said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well\u2014it didn\u2019t turn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s inedible?\u201d Roy asked, looking disappointed. Thanks to his sweet tooth, he didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to hint.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrie, just bring out the cake,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cMom, who cares what it looks like? It\u2019s what it tastes like that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tastes fabulous,\u201d she told them. Fine. They\u2019d asked for this, so she wasn\u2019t going to deny them dessert.</p><p>She left the table and returned with the dessert plates and silverware, then went back into the kitchen to carry out the four-layer coconut cake. Charlotte had given her the recipe and it had become a family favorite. Corrie set the cake in the center of the table for all to admire.</p><p>Roy stared at it and his eyes veered back to her. The lettering on the cake, written in bright red frosting, said, Congratulations, Mack and Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cShall I cut the first slice?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mack nodded politely. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut through the part that says congratulations,\u201d she teased. \u201cI guess this is what I get for being such a know-it-all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Corrie, it was such a sweet thing to do,\u201d Mary Jo told her.</p><p>\u201cI wish we were at the point that we could tell you we had wedding plans,\u201d Mack said. He looked at Mary Jo, who stared uncomfortably down at the table. \u201cBut we, uh, have a few things we need to work through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d Mary Jo started, then stopped, as if she felt she needed to say something but wasn\u2019t sure what. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe us any explanations,\u201d Roy assured Mary Jo. \u201cIf you decide to become part of our family, we want you to know we\u2019ll welcome you with open arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Noelle, too,\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>Mary Jo looked up, and Corrie was surprised to see the glint of tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you both,\u201d Mary Jo whispered. \u201cIt means a great deal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we drop the subject now?\u201d Mack asked pointedly.</p> <p>Corrie nodded. She\u2019d been so positive this dinner had one specific purpose, only to discover she\u2019d been way off base. Instead of celebrating with Mary Jo and her son, as she\u2019d expected to, she\u2019d embarrassed them. Fortunately, they were gracious about it. She regretted causing them any discomfort, but maybe she\u2019d given them something to think about.... She hoped so, anyway.</p><p>They stayed for another hour after dinner. Mary Jo helped her clean up, and they chatted in a companionable fashion about the letters and the diary. Corrie packed up the leftovers to send home with them.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape her notice that Mack was deep in conversation with his father when she and Mary Jo joined them in the living room.</p><p>The young couple left soon afterward. Corrie watched as her son backed out of the driveway and headed down Harbor Street.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Corrie asked, turning away from the window to look at her husband. \u201cWhat did Mack tell you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think he told me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy McAfee, don\u2019t you dare do this to me! I have every right to know what\u2019s going on between Mack and Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I saw the way you and Mack had your heads together, so tell me what he said.\u201d</p><p>Roy sighed. \u201cHe loves Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does! I think he fell in love with her the night she had Noelle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he loves the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes without saying. He\u2019s practically her dad.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cBut Mary Jo has a few issues she needs to work out and until she does Mack doesn\u2019t feel he can propose.\u201d</p><p>She recalled that Mack made some remark along these same lines. \u201cIssues? What kind of issues?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Roy picked up the television remote. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they have to do with David Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat jerk has a lot to answer for,\u201d Corrie muttered, crossing her arms. Every time she heard the man\u2019s name she felt irritated. How anyone as decent and honest as Ben Rhodes could have fathered such a...a creep was beyond her.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s afraid of what might happen if David gets involved in Noelle\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has reason to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo she\u2019s doing nothing, which only perpetuates the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Mack suggest?\u201d Corrie asked, then answered her own question. \u201cMary Jo has to find the courage to stand up to David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roy agreed, \u201cand until she does, their lives aren\u2019t going to move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Corrie whispered. \u201cI am right, though. He does love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Roy gave her a reassuring smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll all resolve itself in time.\u201d</p><p>Corrie\u2019s fear was that this process might take much longer than it should.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>\u201cDa-ad, I need your help.\u201d Holding her math book, Jolene sat on the sofa arm.</p><p>\u201cAlgebra? You think I know this stuff?\u201d Bruce asked with a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cI would hope so,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cYou\u2019re the adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s been a lot of years since I was in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look, okay?\u201d</p><p>Rachel had finished the dinner dishes\u2014by herself, since it was easier that way\u2014and was enjoying the exchange between Bruce and his daughter. If Jolene was counting on his mathematical skills, then the girl was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I have to do this,\u201d she lamented.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need it in life,\u201d Bruce argued, not sounding convinced.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Bruce ignored that. He reached for his glasses, a recent acquisition, and opened the textbook she\u2019d handed him to the page she\u2019d marked. Next, he appeared to be studying the problem as if staring at it long enough would miraculously produce the answer.</p><p>\u201cGet me a pencil and paper,\u201d he commanded with the urgency of a surgeon requesting a scalpel.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Jolene hurried back to her room.</p><p>As soon as she was gone, Bruce turned to Rachel, who hovered in the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019d be much better at helping her than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look like a dope when I can\u2019t figure this out.\u201d</p><p>Rachel snickered softly. \u201cWell, you know what they say about the shoe fitting.\u201d</p><p>He scowled but didn\u2019t get a chance to comment before Jolene returned with a pencil and yellow pad.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why this stuff is so important,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou need to solve for x,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cI know that, but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot y, x.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you\u2019re confusing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m confused, too.\u201d He sent Rachel a look that pleaded for mercy.</p><p>As much as she wanted to step in, Rachel didn\u2019t dare. The request had to come from Jolene; otherwise, the girl would reject Rachel\u2019s offer and resent her for having made it.</p><p>After several minutes, Bruce threw in the towel. \u201cSorry, kiddo, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the final at the end of the week and I\u2019m going to flunk,\u201d Jolene cried, as if leaving this one problem unsolved would ruin her entire academic career. \u201cI\u2019ll never get into college if I can\u2019t pass Algebra I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got years and years before you need to worry about college,\u201d Bruce said, but if he hoped to reassure his daughter, his words fell flat.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Jolene wailed. \u201cI have to get this right, I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Rachel,\u201d Bruce suggested.</p><p>Jolene glanced in her direction. Pretending not to notice, Rachel began to wipe down the kitchen counters, which she\u2019d already done once.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Jolene said hesitantly, \u201cdo you think you could figure this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d This was not a word she was used to hearing from Jolene\u2014and it gave her hope.</p><p>Pulling out a kitchen chair Rachel motioned for Jolene to join her at the table. \u201cLet\u2019s look at this together.\u201d She had no intention of doing the work for Rachel. Her goal was to help the girl understand the concept so she\u2019d be able to solve algebra problems logically.</p><p>\u201cThe teacher said we\u2019d learn the quadratic formula next year. Do you know what they use it for?\u201d</p><p>Rachel remembered learning it, but not its purpose. \u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bruce said, sounding superior.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rachel was impressed\u2014but wary.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bruce said. Standing, he swaggered over to them. \u201cThe quadratic formula is used to solve for x.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>Rachel tried to conceal a smile but with little success. \u201cYou should go back to your online game,\u201d she advised.</p><p>Glancing at the textbook, Bruce winced and said, \u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>Rachel read over the problem, then wrote it down on the pad Jolene had brought.</p><p>\u201cDo you get this stuff?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cI do. I\u2019ve always had an ability with numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you work in a salon, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use my mathematical skills there every single day, Jolene. Not everyone who\u2019s good with math works in a bank or an accounting office. For example, I need to calculate how much coloring to put into the mix when I\u2019m doing a dye job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d This appeared to be a revelation.</p><p>They worked together for the next forty minutes, until Rachel thought Jolene had grasped the concept and could finish a series of problems without help.</p><p>Jolene stood and gave Rachel a tentative smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>The girl returned to her bedroom, and Rachel moved into the living room, just in time for her favorite cop drama on TV. Bruce came in a few minutes later. \u201cThat went well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>Rachel nodded. This was almost the way it\u2019d been between her and Jolene before the wedding.</p><p>\u201cSchool is out next Wednesday,\u201d she said. She dreaded summer vacation and the changes it would bring into their lives. Jolene was too old for day care and too young to be left alone all day without supervision.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her signed up for that drama camp for the first two weeks,\u201d Bruce reminded her.</p><p>Yes, but the expense would be a real challenge to their budget, especially if they had to continue this through the rest of the summer. What Bruce didn\u2019t know was that in a few months she\u2019d need to stop working, which would take a big bite out of their income.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive. And if we have to cover this cost all summer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we don\u2019t have any option, do we?\u201d Bruce put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>In previous summers Jolene had spent one or two days a week with Rachel, the rest of the time at municipal or church programs. But these days, the girl wasn\u2019t interested in attending any summer camp that also catered to \u201clittle kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...might have a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bruce asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI could do half days.\u201d She\u2019d been making excuses lately to explain why she was so often tired and lacking in energy. She also worried that it wasn\u2019t good for the baby if she spent too much time around the chemicals in the salon.</p><p>If she was at home half days, she could at least keep an eye on Jolene....</p><p>He considered that. \u201cBut you keep saying Jolene would rather not be around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you staying home with her might not be such a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other circumstances I\u2019d agree with you. But I\u2019m making this suggestion as much for me as Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Bruce studied her as if he had difficulty following her line of thought.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed how tired I\u2019ve been these past few months?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but I blame myself for that.\u201d He slid his hand between her thighs. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I need to cut back to half days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired because of all the extra hours you had to put in after Teri quit,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, and...for other reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther reasons? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she said, exhaling softly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you something important here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening, I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d She took his hand. \u201cBut you\u2019re not hearing me, are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>The best way to say this was straight out, Rachel decided. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she told him quietly.</p><p>Bruce blinked. When he apparently realized what she\u2019d said, he leaped off the sofa and started pacing. He shoved his hands through his hair. \u201cDid you just tell me you\u2019re...pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? This isn\u2019t a false alarm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month?\u201d He spewed out the words. \u201cYou\u2019ve known this for a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out the night Teri had the triplets.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stared at her. \u201cBut how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might be news to you,\u201d she broke in, \u201cbut guess what? I didn\u2019t get pregnant all by myself. This baby has a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not sure what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u2018Wow,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s great,\u2019 or \u2018I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u2019 or\u2014\u201d</p><p>He knelt down in front of her and grabbed both her hands, smiling the goofiest, happiest smile she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cHow about \u2018Thank you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Rachel swallowed back tears. \u201cThat works.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hands on either side of her face and kissed her. Rachel flung her arms around his neck and reveled in his love.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cAfraid,\u201d he repeated. \u201cOf what? We both want a baby. We\u2019ve talked about it. Okay, we\u2019d planned to wait, but it happened\u2014and frankly, I think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her fingers through his hair. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d feel that way. The pregnancy came as a shock to me, a total surprise, and I was afraid it would to you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best kind of surprise. I can\u2019t believe you kept it to yourself for so long.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cI had to. Because of Jolene.\u201d</p><p>The instant she spoke, she saw doubt pass over his face.</p><p>\u201cIt was the one thing she asked us to do. To wait. Not to have a baby yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t live by her dictates,\u201d Bruce argued. He kissed her again with an adoration that made Rachel go weak in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI know and I agree, but Jolene has had to deal with a number of significant changes this year. Adding my pregnancy to the mix complicates everything.\u201d</p><p>Bruce frowned. \u201cI still think we should tell her right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rachel pleaded. \u201cNot yet. Let\u2019s give it a few weeks. Once school\u2019s out, I\u2019ll start working half days. I\u2019m hoping that the time I spend with her one-on-one will allow us to repair our relationship.\u201d Maybe just being together, without Bruce, would make a difference. Maybe Jolene would stop competing for her father\u2019s affection. Maybe she and Rachel could regain the love and trust they\u2019d once shared.</p><p>\u201cWell...today was good. She asked you to help her with math.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I want to make the effort.\u201d</p><p>He continued to look a bit uncertain.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell her about the baby,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cI want her to know what an important role she\u2019ll play as the baby\u2019s big sister. My goal is for Jolene to be as excited about this addition to our family as we are. To welcome this child, prepare for her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr him,\u201d she added, smiling, \u201cwith joy and anticipation.\u201d</p><p>Bruce exhaled slowly. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll leave it up to you. Tell her when you feel it\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He sat back down beside her and they watched the rest of the police drama together. Twice she caught him staring at her.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she muttered the second time.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to wipe that silly grin off your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Rachel groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make this impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The credits rolled across the screen. \u201cAre you tired yet?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his arms and gave a loud yawn.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she chided. If Jolene walked in on them now, she\u2019d be horrified.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it, woman, I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d Then he chuckled and placed his hand over her stomach. \u201cAs this proves right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>Rachel sighed and snuggled close to her husband. He\u2019d promised not to tell Jolene and she prayed he would keep his word. That he could keep his word and not let it slip before she was ready to tell Jolene. And Jolene was ready to hear.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Gloria parked outside the McAfees\u2019 house and sat in her car for ten minutes before she found the courage to approach the door. She badly needed a mother\u2019s advice, and although she wanted to speak honestly with Corrie, she wasn\u2019t sure she could.</p><p>Chad had left ten messages on her phone. She hadn\u2019t answered even one. His final message was that this was the last time he\u2019d contact her. He\u2019d obviously meant it. Gloria hadn\u2019t heard from him in the two weeks since.</p><p>That was what she wanted. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Yes, she insisted to herself again. It was!</p><p>Then why, oh, why, couldn\u2019t she stop thinking about him? She\u2019d spent so many sleepless nights pounding her pillows, fighting to get his image out of her mind, that she was about to go mad.</p><p>Yes, he was attractive, but so were lots of other men. The simple truth was: No man had ever affected her as powerfully as Dr. Chad Timmons.</p><p>All her life Gloria had been a reserved and private person. She didn\u2019t freely share her thoughts or feelings with others. Yet an hour after meeting Chad, she\u2019d practically spilled out her entire life story. She\u2019d shared her emotions, her doubts and fears. At that time, that first night, she\u2019d even told him why she\u2019d moved to Cedar Cove. No one else knew. Only Chad. That he could so easily strip away her defenses alarmed her. Terrified her.</p><p>Now, after two weeks of silence, she still couldn\u2019t get him off her mind. She had to do something, but she was helpless to know what.</p><p>Holding her breath, she rang the doorbell and waited for her birth mother to answer. Roy was gone; Gloria had seen him drive away as she turned onto Harbor Street. She remembered that Corrie sometimes took Tuesdays and Thursdays off and hoped she\u2019d be at home.</p><p>She was.</p><p>\u201cGloria! What a pleasant surprise. Come in, come in.\u201d</p><p>Gloria stepped into the family home and glanced at the photos lining the mantel. The one of her, in her sheriff\u2019s uniform, stood next to Linnette\u2019s and Mack\u2019s high school graduation pictures. The professional family photograph on the wall above the fireplace showed Roy and Corrie maybe fifteen years earlier with their two children and a dog, who must have passed into doggy heaven. She didn\u2019t even know that dog\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI was just emailing Linnette,\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific,\u201d Corrie told her. She walked into the kitchen and over to the coffeepot and refilled her mug. \u201cWould you like some?\u201d</p><p>Gloria shook her head. \u201cWould it be all right if I had a glass of water instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Corrie immediately opened the cupboard above the coffeepot and took down a glass, which she filled with ice and water and brought to Gloria.</p><p>She sat on the stool and drank half the water before setting the glass on the counter. Her throat felt dry, her skin clammy. \u201cI...I need some advice.\u201d</p><p>Corrie dragged a stool to the other side of the counter. \u201cI\u2019m happy to help in any way I can,\u201d she said, sitting down.</p><p>\u201cI...met someone a few years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale?\u201d</p><p>Gloria avoided eye contact and nodded. \u201cI barely knew him and we...\u201d Admitting what she\u2019d done was more difficult than she would\u2019ve guessed.</p><p>\u201cYou went to bed with him,\u201d Corrie said matter-of-factly.</p><p>Gloria nodded again. \u201cI was embarrassed and shocked by my behavior and chose not to see him again.\u201d Her hand tightened around the water glass. \u201cHe made numerous efforts to contact me.... I rebuffed each one until he finally gave up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, exactly, did you refuse to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, like I said, I was embarrassed. Second, I felt vulnerable around him. Emotionally vulnerable.\u201d She paused. \u201cThere was another...complication. Another woman, someone I cared\u2014care\u2014about was interested in him. So even if I\u2019d been willing to risk a relationship with this man, I felt I had to step back.\u201d</p><p>Her mother seemed to understand. \u201cDo you still have strong feelings for him?\u201d</p><p>Gloria shrugged. \u201cI must, because I can\u2019t stop thinking about him\u2014but there\u2019s more to the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s out of the picture.\u201d She had to hope Corrie wouldn\u2019t guess that she was talking about Linnette.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fill me in on what happened next.\u201d</p><p>Gloria could hardly believe the water glass didn\u2019t shatter in her hand from the pressure. She made a concerted but unsuccessful effort to relax.</p><p>\u201cAbout a month ago, this man...he let me know he was moving away and...\u201d She closed her eyes and inhaled. \u201cI asked him to stay. He agreed and we went on a second date.\u201d The lump in her throat felt huge and she tried to swallow it. \u201cThe same thing happened all over again.\u201d She said this last part in a harsh whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou spent the night with him?\u201d</p><p>Gloria hung her head. \u201cYes. I woke up embarrassed and...and furious with myself. I don\u2019t think either of us planned it but...it just...happened. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him since?\u201d</p><p>Her birth mother seemed to intuitively ask the right questions. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Corrie smiled knowingly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and can you blame me? The only thing we have in common that I can see is our...our sexual interest in each other. He also knows too much about me. I don\u2019t talk about myself with other people\u2014it makes me uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with this man?\u201d</p><p>If Gloria had the answer to that, she wouldn\u2019t be sitting in Corrie\u2019s kitchen seeking advice. \u201cI...I don\u2019t really know. I think I might be, but I don\u2019t know my own heart. I feel so confused. I\u2019m not sure of myself anymore or how to react.\u201d She shook her head and her hair fell forward. Tucking it behind her ears, she realized her hands were trembling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat would you like me to tell you?\u201d Corrie asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Corrie reached across the counter and took one of Gloria\u2019s hands in her own. \u201cI think you owe it to this young man and to yourself to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. But it seems to me that you\u2019re running away from him and, more importantly, from yourself. You tried that once and it didn\u2019t work, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said miserably.</p><p>\u201cWhen you thought you were about to lose him, you asked him to stay. That tells me you do have feelings for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left ten messages for me. In the tenth message he said he was finished and that I wouldn\u2019t hear from him again\u2014and I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk to him,\u201d Corrie said a second time. \u201cEven if you agree never to see each other again, you need some closure. Some way of acknowledging what happened so you can both move on.\u201d</p> <p>Gloria knew her birth mother was right. She\u2019d recognized all along that this was what she needed to do, but she\u2019d wanted confirmation from someone she trusted. Corrie wasn\u2019t her real mother; Gloria\u2019s mother had died in a plane crash. But she was certain the woman who\u2019d nurtured and raised her would have said the same thing.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Corrie squeezed her hand. \u201cAnytime. Will you let me know how it goes?\u201d</p><p>Gloria promised she would and left soon after.</p><p>That afternoon, she waited outside the medical clinic for Chad. She wore her uniform, since she had to report for duty in thirty minutes. She was on swing shift and, through a quick phone call, had learned that he was on the early rotation. That gave them twenty minutes together at most. The time limitation suited her fine; she\u2019d say what needed to be said, then leave with a clear conscience.</p><p>Chad saw her the moment he stepped out the clinic door. He hesitated briefly before heading in her direction.</p> <p>Her own reaction to seeing him caught her by surprise. She hadn\u2019t expected to feel anything. But she did. Her heart seemed to trip into double time and her throat closed. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy and Chad would probably go out of his way to make it as awkward as possible.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough\u201d was his only greeting.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should...acknowledge what happened,\u201d she said, consciously quoting Corrie. She kept her hands on her hips, feet spread, the stance she used when pulling over speeders.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose we should. Do you want to meet me somewhere so we can talk in private?\u201d</p><p>Gloria shook her head. \u201cHere is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be at work soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parking lot?\u201d he reiterated.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this\u2019ll be short and sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cI guess that tells me everything I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Rather than ask what he meant, she started in on her prepared speech. \u201cClearly there\u2019s a strong physical attraction between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his sarcasm, although it irritated her. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why you affect me the way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re right for each other,\u201d she finally told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for sarcasm, Chad,\u201d she returned pointedly. She\u2019d been correct about one thing; he intended to punish her, make this as hard as he could.</p><p>\u201cYou might not think so, but it\u2019s either that or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>He started to walk away from her. \u201cYou drive me crazy, Gloria. I\u2019ve never met anyone like you. You\u2019re hot one minute, and when I say hot, we both know what I mean. Then the next minute, you can\u2019t get away from me fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Gloria couldn\u2019t very well deny his accusations.</p><p>\u201cThe night we had dinner, things got out of control. I hadn\u2019t intended to bring you back to my apartment. I told you what would happen if we went inside and if I remember correctly you didn\u2019t voice any objections.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and looked away, embarrassed because what he\u2019d said was true.</p><p>\u201cI woke up the next morning happier than I could remember being in a long time\u2014only to discover you were gone.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen I found your note. What a shock. \u2018Don\u2019t call me again. Last night was a mistake.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Gloria stared down at her shoes.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve been a mistake for you, Gloria, but I refused to think of it that way.\u201d</p><p>She had nothing to add.</p><p>\u201cHot one minute, cold the next. I tried to reason with you. I lost count of how many messages I left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d she said, then wished she\u2019d kept her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d he repeated. \u201cTen messages, and how many weeks of silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d There, she\u2019d done it again, letting him know she\u2019d counted each and every one of those tortured days.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re telling me to take a flying leap into the nearest cow pasture, right?\u201d His stance remained guarded, defiant.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s for the best not to see each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat figures. Well, go ahead, Gloria, run away and pretend there\u2019s nothing between us if that makes you feel better. Trust me, after this last episode, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the vehemence in his voice, the hardness in his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather we parted as friends,\u201d she said.</p><p>He went still, then shook his head. \u201cSorry. If you want to water this relationship down to \u2018friends\u2019 in order to make it palatable, then feel free to do so, but it doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends, you say? First, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Friends are people I trust. You\u2019ve burned me twice, and I don\u2019t feel that friendly toward you. If this is the way you treat your so-called friends, I pity them. I pity you.\u201d</p><p>Gloria\u2019s stomach tensed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I thought, you know, that if we passed each other on the street we could...be polite. And if I ever came to the clinic, we could be cordial to each other.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen, so don\u2019t worry about it. Fine, you want to be friends, we\u2019ll be friends.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away from her and started across the parking lot to his car. Every instinct demanded she follow him and make things right between them. Yet she remained rooted to the spot.</p><p>She stood frozen for several minutes, warring within herself. Chad climbed into his car and drove off, and still she stood there, not knowing what to do.</p><p>Corrie had said she needed to \u201cacknowledge what happened\u201d and move on. Chad had agreed. But if that was what she\u2019d sought, she\u2019d failed miserably. Instead of ending their affair on a friendly note, they were more at odds than ever.</p><p>Somehow she made it through her shift and, at eleven that night, went home. Although she was mentally and physically exhausted, she couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Many hours later, she downed two over-the-counter sleeping pills and pulled the sheet over her head. The sun had begun to rise, and morning light slithered into her bedroom through the gap between her curtains.</p><p>Gloria rolled onto her left side and bunched up the pillow. Ten minutes later she was on her right side and then she rolled onto her back.</p><p>She glanced at the clock and wondered how long it would take for the sleep aid to kick in. She closed her eyes, but when she did, all she could see was Chad standing defiantly before her. He didn\u2019t say a word, yet she felt his disappointment and his pain.</p><p>She felt her own.</p><p>All at once she threw aside the covers and sat up as his words echoed in her mind. She\u2019d suggested that being friends meant that if they ran into each other again, they\u2019d be cordial. Chad had said that wasn\u2019t going to happen. He hadn\u2019t meant he wouldn\u2019t greet her.</p><p>What he was telling her, she realized now, was that he wouldn\u2019t be around for her to greet. He was leaving town.</p><p>The Tacoma hospital had told him they\u2019d hire him any time he wanted the job.</p><p>Chad was leaving Cedar Cove. And her.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Mack finished his five-mile run and walked the last block to the duplex to cool down. Cool down physically from the exertion of the run and emotionally from his churning thoughts.</p><p>He\u2019d been upset with Mary Jo after their confrontation with David on the waterfront two weeks earlier. Twice since then he\u2019d tried to talk to her about the situation, and both times she\u2019d abruptly changed the subject. The only thing she wanted to talk about was their search for Jacob and Joan. And that interested him, too, but it wasn\u2019t about their lives. Clearly she wasn\u2019t comfortable discussing David. Not with him, anyway. And that hurt. He felt he had as much at stake as she did. Not to the same degree, perhaps, but he loved Noelle, too.</p><p>Their dinner with his parents hadn\u2019t helped. His mother\u2014and even his father\u2014thought they\u2019d come to announce their engagement.</p><p>He wished.</p><p>Mary Jo wasn\u2019t ready, and frankly, Mack was growing frustrated. He\u2019d recognized long ago that she was afraid. He understood that. But for the past six months he\u2019d bent himself into a pretzel trying to prove how trustworthy he was. Okay, he\u2019d stumbled once, when Mary Jo discovered he\u2019d misled her regarding the ownership of the duplex. Even then he\u2019d had her best interests at heart. If he had to do it over again, hindsight being what it was, he\u2019d tell her the truth. How much that error in judgment had cost him remained to be seen.</p><p>He was tired of the brush-off she\u2019d been giving him lately, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it. Running helped him clear his mind, so he\u2019d pounded the pavement for five miles while he mulled over the events of the past few weeks.</p><p>He loved her and Noelle, but it felt as though with every step forward, he immediately took two steps back. After six months he was beginning to think she might never feel as strongly about him as he did about her.</p><p>After his run, Mack showered, changed clothes, did a few errands and returned home midafternoon. As he brought groceries into the house, Mary Jo came out of her place.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, sounding uncertain.</p><p>Good. He hoped she enjoyed the feeling because he\u2019d been experiencing it for the past half year.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back, and reached for another bag of groceries.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you this morning.\u201d He usually made himself available to Mary Jo and Noelle in case they needed anything. Maybe that was his problem\u2014being too helpful, too eager to show he cared.</p><p>He brought the second load into the house and left the door open. A couple of minutes later, he was back to get his dry cleaning.</p><p>Mary Jo came farther into the yard, watching him. Mack pretended not to notice.</p><p>\u201cAre you upset?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped and met her look head-on. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I am.\u201d</p><p>She blinked as though his honesty had taken her by surprise. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried twice, and Noelle and her future obviously isn\u2019t something you want to discuss with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not her father,\u201d Mary Jo snapped.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t have said anything that would have wounded him more. He considered himself Noelle\u2019s protector. He loved that baby as if he were her father. He\u2019d brought her into this world and been the first to hold her in his arms. From that moment forward, Mack had felt a special bond with Noelle, warranted or not.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said stiffly, and walked past her. Once inside, he closed the door. He hung up his clothes, put away his groceries and swallowed a groan of sheer frustration.</p><p>Not more than five minutes later, his doorbell rang. Assuming it was Mary Jo, Mack toyed with the idea of not answering. Instead, he walked to the front door and threw it open. He wanted to make sure she understood that he resented the intrusion.</p><p>Staring at him intently, she stood on the other side with Noelle in her arms. \u201cI hate it when you\u2019re upset with me.\u201d</p><p>He left the screen door shut and waited for his heart to stop pounding. \u201cAre you ready to talk?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>Mack held open the screen and let her in. He motioned for her to sit down on the sofa and went into the kitchen to make them coffee. He brought out two cups. She ignored hers. He ignored his. Mary Jo set Noelle on the rug, and the six-month-old immediately began crawling toward the coffee table.</p><p>Despite his dour mood, Mack couldn\u2019t help smiling. He bent down and scooped the baby into his arms. Happy to see him, Noelle gurgled with delight. Then, remembering why Mary Jo was in his home, Mack sobered and set Noelle back on the carpet to crawl about as she pleased. As Mary Jo had so recently reminded him, he had no rights with regard to this child.</p><p>\u201cYou...aren\u2019t Noelle\u2019s father,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He glared at her. She\u2019d already made her point and he could see no reason for her to say it again.</p><p>\u201cBut I wish you were,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Those words removed the sting from her earlier comment. \u201cI do, too,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you love Noelle.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have made his feelings toward Mary Jo and her baby any plainer. He loved them both, although so far it\u2019d done him little good.</p><p>\u201cI...I spoke with Ben and Charlotte recently,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey talked to Olivia, who recommended that I file for child support. Apparently it doesn\u2019t matter whether David has a job or not. They said it was important that I register with the state.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if Mary Jo would accept that advice. When they\u2019d last spoken, she\u2019d been dead set against taking any action, certain David would follow through on his threat.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Charlotte, Olivia has lots of experience in these cases and she said David would be forced to own up to his responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll ask for joint custody of Noelle once the support request goes through?\u201d Mack believed that was a scare tactic.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what people keep telling me, Linc included. I hate it when everyone seems to think they know what\u2019s best for me and Noelle.\u201d Her voice quavered slightly.</p> <p>Mack found himself wrestling with indecision, but he\u2019d done too much of that in the past. He had to hold fast to his convictions.</p><p>\u201cYou want what\u2019s best for Noelle, yet you\u2019re willing to let David terrorize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll find some way of taking Noelle away from me,\u201d she said, sounding close to panic at the mere thought of it.</p><p>\u201cWhich is playing right into his hands, isn\u2019t it? David doesn\u2019t want to be part of Noelle\u2019s life. He couldn\u2019t care less about his daughter\u2014or you, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. She reached down and picked up Noelle, who squirmed in her arms, wanting to be put down again. Mary Jo clung to her baby.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think any judge in the land would consider giving Noelle to David?\u201d Mack asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t think so, but it could happen. I can\u2019t risk that. I don\u2019t need David. I don\u2019t want anything to do with him. Basically he\u2019s saying he wants me to leave him alone, and I\u2019m happy to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then you aren\u2019t protecting Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Mack walked to the other side of the room. \u201cIs he named as Noelle\u2019s father on the birth certificate?\u201d He turned back and watched her nod reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if something happened to you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat if, God forbid, you became ill or were seriously injured and unable to care for Noelle? Who would take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc and Lori...maybe. I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to shout that these were the very scenarios that ran through his mind in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cIf you were...gone or incapable of caring for Noelle, the state would contact David, because he\u2019s Noelle\u2019s legal father. She would then become his responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo looked horrified. Noelle slid out of her arms and plopped down on her thick diaper, sitting at her mother\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cWhen Ben talked to me, he said he was afraid that if...sometime down the road I got married and my husband wanted to adopt Noelle, David would do everything he could to cause problems. He\u2019d use Noelle for his own purposes.\u201d</p><p>Mack had thought of that himself. He didn\u2019t trust that jerk for a second.</p><p>Mary Jo glanced his way. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand how I could\u2019ve been so blind and stupid. One error in judgment, and look what happened.\u201d She swallowed visibly.</p><p>\u201cBen must have urged you to take action for another reason,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. \u201cHe told me that if I were to approach David with relinquishment papers now, he\u2019d probably sign them, which would save us all a lot of trouble down the road. Ben also told me that Noelle will always be his granddaughter. He\u2019s already made provisions for her in his will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less of a man like Ben Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019d want someone else to talk to David, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d Mack would get David to sign those papers without a problem, and it wouldn\u2019t take long, either.</p><p>\u201cNo...I was thinking I might hire Mr. Harris to do it. He could deduct his fee from my paycheck.\u201d</p><p>It seemed she was still considering that action as she spoke. Mack took a moment to digest her words.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re willing to approach David? Or have someone approach him on your behalf?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI...don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened and wanted to tell her that she should inform him when she\u2019d made her decision. Until then, he\u2019d rather she didn\u2019t torment him with her wishy-washy attitude.</p><p>Again, Mary Jo sensed his irritation. \u201cCan I change the subject for a moment?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He wondered if this was just another delaying tactic, and then with a sigh of resignation nodded for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful time at your parents\u2019 house last week.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d barely spoken since then. Right afterward, Mack was on duty for four days straight. Once he got back home, he\u2019d tried to talk to Mary Jo but she\u2019d been unresponsive. He\u2019d more or less ignored her ever since.</p><p>\u201cI apologize if my mother embarrassed you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Mary Jo told him. \u201cI was kind of amused that she assumed we were going to announce our engagement.\u201d</p><p>Mack shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cAmused?\u201d This woman had him so twisted up in knots he didn\u2019t know if he was coming or going. He felt he\u2019d done nothing but make a fool of himself over her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like I said something offensive?\u201d Mary Jo asked. \u201cHonestly, Mack, you\u2019re so prickly these days....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe idea of marrying me is a big joke?\u201d he said in a sullen voice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, maybe I need my hearing tested because that\u2019s exactly what it sounded like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t answer because he didn\u2019t want her scoffing at him, didn\u2019t want her to disparage his feelings.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s that,\u201d she said after an awkward moment. She reached for Noelle.</p><p>Mack knew if he didn\u2019t say something fast, she\u2019d leave. This might be his last opportunity and he didn\u2019t want to waste it on resentment or retaliation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have made my feelings for you and Noelle any more obvious if I tried. Yes, I love you, Mary Jo. My thoughts haven\u2019t been my own from the second I answered your 9-1-1 call last Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Once again Mary Jo bit her lip. \u201cI fell in love before, and I was so stupid and foolish. David\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not David!\u201d he flared. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer it\u2019s going to take you to realize I\u2019m nothing like him. What have I ever done to make you think I\u2019d harm you or Noelle?\u201d</p><p>He was just warming to his subject when Mary Jo put Noelle down and walked over to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He wasn\u2019t allowed to finish. Mary Jo placed her hands on his shoulders and practically forced him to look directly at her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jerome McAfee,\u201d she said.</p><p>The air rushed from his lungs and Mack found himself unable to speak\u2014and not just because she\u2019d used his given name, which was known to very few people.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t respond, couldn\u2019t even manage a nod.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to repeat that?\u201d</p><p>This time he bobbed his head.</p><p>She dropped her hands and gave him the most dazzling smile he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI love you. Noelle loves you, too. We both love you.\u201d</p><p>Feeling completely out of control, it was all he could do to return her smile.</p><p>\u201cYou could kiss me now if you wanted,\u201d Mary Jo suggested.</p><p>Mack wanted, all right. He wanted to hold her and kiss her. He gathered her in his arms and his heart seemed about to take flight. Lowering his mouth to hers, he felt an incredible surge of emotion. Just then, with Noelle holding on to his pant leg and Mary Jo in his arms, he felt as if his whole world had been transformed.</p><p>Mary Jo tasted sweet and wonderful, and one kiss wasn\u2019t nearly enough. Soon they were kissing each other deeply, intensely. They might have continued kissing and discovering their newly declared feelings if Noelle hadn\u2019t let out a sudden cry.</p><p>Reluctantly Mary Jo broke away and picked up her daughter. \u201cYou made me forget about Noelle,\u201d she whispered as though she had trouble finding her voice.</p><p>Me, too, he thought, hard as that was to believe.</p><p>Mack slid his hands down her arms, because he needed to keep touching her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we finally talked,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand having you upset with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If he received this kind of reaction every time, he might consider getting upset with her more often....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discuss the situation with Mr. Harris next week,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll get his opinion and make my decision then. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d talk to me before you decide. Will you do that?\u201d</p><p>She agreed with a quick nod. \u201cI think that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to adopt Noelle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen...when it\u2019s appropriate, I mean,\u201d he stammered.</p><p>Mary Jo smiled. \u201cShe does love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Noelle squirmed in her mother\u2019s hold, thrusting both arms toward Mack.</p><p>He took the baby and Noelle pressed her head against his shoulder. He experienced the profound sense of making a promise to this woman, this child. \u201cAnd I love her,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy little girl.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p> <p>Linc Wyse parked his battered pickup truck outside their Cedar Cove apartment building. After the confrontation with Leonard, he\u2019d wanted to move\u2014but finances made that impossible for the moment. He found that it grated on him to feel beholden to a man who had no respect for him\u2014or for his own daughter. Linc hoped that eventually their relationship with Leonard would improve, but he couldn\u2019t guess when or how that would happen.</p><p>Despite everything, he had no regrets about his marriage. Absolutely none. He\u2019d never been happier in his personal life. His business life, however, was another matter. After his move to Cedar Cove, he\u2019d hit one roadblock after another in getting his auto body shop up and running. He\u2019d purchased the building and made the necessary renovations, spending a significant part of his savings. While the work was in progress, he\u2019d applied for a business license, which shouldn\u2019t have been a problem. But his application had been delayed twice. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that Bellamy was somehow behind this. Linc wasn\u2019t sure how his father-in-law had done it, but Leonard clearly had friends in high places.</p><p>In the end Linc had been forced to hire an attorney and he\u2019d eventually received his license. At any other time, the frustration would\u2019ve infuriated him. Yet when he arrived home at the end of each day and saw Lori, every negative emotion he\u2019d experienced drained away. All she had to do was smile and Linc\u2019s troubles seemed to disappear. He\u2019d never told her about his legal problems and his suspicions about her father\u2019s role in them. No need to upset her further, so he\u2019d dealt with it all quietly.</p><p>He anticipated one of Lori\u2019s smiles when he walked in the door. Instead, she rushed across the room and wrapped her arms around him, hugging tightly.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this reception?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Generally they were kissing by now or talking non-stop about their day. He usually helped with dinner, not that he was much good in the kitchen. To him it was an excuse to spend time with Lori; each minute with her was precious and to be treasured.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother phoned,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad?\u201d Lori nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe invited us to dinner on Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>Now Linc was completely perplexed. The relationship between Lori and her family was strained, and an invitation from her mother should please her; instead she was distressed.</p><p>\u201cWill your father be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d she cried.</p><p>That explained some of her anguish. Linc patted her back soothingly, although he didn\u2019t understand why a dinner invitation had unsettled her so much.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you tell your mother?\u201d he asked. If he came up with the right questions, he might discover what was so terrible about this invitation. Didn\u2019t it mean Lori\u2019s parents, or at least her mother, were trying to build a bridge? Maybe this was a hopeful sign, the possible beginning of a reconciliation.</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlat-out no...?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her hold around him tightening.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to ask me first?\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head back, she looked up at him with wide brown eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d He felt offended that she hadn\u2019t even sought his response to this unexpected olive branch.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know why Mom invited us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>Lori looked down and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Tucking his finger under her chin, he raised her head. \u201cLori?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents want to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>He arched his brows. That wasn\u2019t a motive he\u2019d considered. \u201cAnd they would do that how?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI showed you a picture of my parents\u2019 home, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do and it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a guesthouse and an Olympic-size pool and acres of landscaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen acres, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the water.\u201d</p><p>Ten acres of waterfront property had to be worth more money than Linc could hope to earn in his lifetime. He remembered that Lori had mentioned a live-in housekeeper and cook, as well as groundskeepers.</p><p>\u201cMy father is wealthy and influential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs he let me know,\u201d Linc muttered. And well-connected, too. Still, Leonard Bellamy could erect all the roadblocks he wanted, but he couldn\u2019t stop Linc from setting up business, no matter how many friends he had.</p><p>\u201cMom will make sure dinner has three forks, two knives and four spoons just to confuse you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAfter Mary Jo moved out, my brothers and I didn\u2019t have that much silverware between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a laughing matter,\u201d Lori said. \u201cI won\u2019t give my family an opportunity to embarrass my husband, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re hoping to do.\u201d</p><p>Linc wasn\u2019t the least bit intimidated. \u201cI might have grease under my fingernails, Lori, but I\u2019m not a country bumpkin. I\u2019ll hold my own. There\u2019s no need to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea how uncomfortable Dad will make you. He\u2019ll try to trap you. He\u2019ll act all friendly and then start asking for your opinion on stocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer him truthfully. Other than my 401(k), I don\u2019t follow the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he\u2019ll want you to say and then he\u2019ll make fun of you. Only he\u2019ll do it in this supposedly witty way that\u2019s demeaning and belittling. I won\u2019t have it, Linc. I refuse to stand for it.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, Linc kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cPhone your mother back and tell her you\u2019ve changed your mind. We\u2019ll be happy to join them for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him with shocked disbelief. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori, sweetheart, you could be misreading the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cI know my parents\u2014especially my father. He thinks I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake marrying you and he\u2019s dying to prove what an idiot I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot, Lori.\u201d The fact that Leonard thought this infuriated him. \u201cAnd neither am I. In fact, your father\u2019s going to see that, and soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you haven\u2019t spent much time with him.\u201d</p><p>Their single encounter had been unpleasant enough; still, Linc was willing to give it a second try. When the time came, Lori\u2019s parents would be his children\u2019s grandparents\u2014their only grandparents. Linc knew the importance of family and longed to build a solid relationship with the Bellamys. He realized it might take months, even years, but he hoped that if Lori\u2019s parents had the chance to know him, they\u2019d see how much he loved her. He\u2019d wait them out if he had to and he\u2019d endure Leonard\u2019s interference and wouldn\u2019t let it defeat him.</p><p>\u201cThis is an opportunity we shouldn\u2019t turn down,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lori held her ground. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday night, was it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lori sighed and shook her head. \u201cSaturday night, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference\u2014we won\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori, we should go. I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc...you wonderful man. You don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but he did. \u201cCall your mother back, Lori. Please. It\u2019s time I met her.\u201d</p><p>A frown puckered her brow. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sorry, Linc, but I just can\u2019t.\u201d She broke free of his embrace and hurried into the kitchen.</p><p>Linc waited a couple of minutes, then followed her. \u201cAre we having our first fight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lori, who had her back to him, turned and then smiled. \u201cYou know, I think we are.\u201d</p><p>A smile broke out across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he drawled, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that make-up sex is the best there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLincoln Wyse, I can\u2019t believe you just said that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna find out?\u201d</p><p>He could see Lori struggling not to smile. \u201cWe haven\u2019t resolved this yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we do that later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinc, you\u2019re impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it.\u201d He motioned toward the bedroom. \u201cDinner can wait, too, can\u2019t it?\u201d Lori giggled.</p><p>Linc scooped her into his arms and carried her to the bedroom. Together they fell onto the bed.</p><p>A half hour later, sated and content, Linc lay gazing up at the underside of the pink canopy.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lori murmured, stretching luxuriously, like a cat in a patch of sunshine. \u201cYou were right about the making-up part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that means we should argue more often.\u201d Rolling onto his side he leaned over her and kissed her. \u201cCall your mother, sweetheart, okay? I promise not to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Linc, I\u2019m not worried that you\u2019d embarrass me. I just don\u2019t want them making you feel uncomfortable. I love you for who you are, not the amount of money you make or anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her again, his lips lingering on hers.</p><p>Late Saturday afternoon, Linc dressed casually in slacks and a white polo shirt for dinner at the Bellamy family home. When they arrived, they had to stop at the iron gate and wait for admittance. Entering the circular driveway, Linc had to make an effort not to stare or look impressed. The photograph Lori had shown him didn\u2019t do justice to the stately home.</p><p>He\u2019d just helped Lori out of the car when the front door opened and an elegant blonde woman stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cLori, darling, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Lori\u2019s mother came forward with her arms extended.</p><p>Mother and daughter hugged before Lori turned back to Linc. She slipped her arm around his waist. \u201cMom, this is my husband, Lincoln Wyse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bellamy,\u201d he said, and extended his hand.</p><p>She smiled and shook it. He noticed that her palm was smooth and soft, her rings obviously expensive but understated. \u201cWelcome to our home, Lincoln.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost folks call me Linc.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLinc, then. My friends call me Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d He hoped that he would, indeed, be considered a friend.</p><p>Lori\u2019s mother escorted them into the house. The foyer was massive. A round inlaid wood table dominated the area with a floral arrangement so huge it was like one he\u2019d expect to find in a five-star hotel lobby.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Lori asked, glancing around.</p> <p>That was Linc\u2019s question, too. He intended to do his best to reach an understanding with his father-in-law over dinner\u2014or at least make some progress toward that goal.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, your father was called away at the last minute,\u201d Kate said with undisguised frustration.</p><p>Lori\u2019s hand tightened around his. Linc wasn\u2019t sure what she was attempting to tell him and looked down. His wife mouthed three words\u2014that\u2019s a lie. He frowned as Kate led them into the living room.</p><p>The hors d\u2019oeuvres had been arranged on a silver platter. Linc didn\u2019t recognize a single one\u2014except for the caviar, which he\u2019d never had before. This was no crackers-and-cheese plate. Nor was it stuffed mushrooms or Greek olives. Rather than admit he didn\u2019t know what he was eating, he leaned forward and helped himself. He scooped up some caviar with a small triangle of toast and shoved it in his mouth\u2014not bad. He saw Lori glance pointedly to the right. That was when he noticed the delicate china plate and napkin.</p><p>\u201cCan I offer you something to drink?\u201d Kate asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer,\u201d Linc said automatically.</p><p>\u201cI will, too.\u201d Lori slid closer to Linc.</p><p>Her mother grinned. \u201cThen so will I.\u201d</p><p>Linc saw his wife relax visibly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you drank beer, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the truth is, I never have before, but there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t give it a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take mine in the bottle,\u201d Linc told her, fearing the housekeeper would feel obligated to serve it in a fancy crystal glass.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Dinner wasn\u2019t such a painful affair, after all. The beef Stroganoff was incredible and he went into the kitchen to personally thank the cook and praise her work. Dessert was homemade angel food cake, served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. The real stuff. The last time Linc had tasted real whipped cream had been the Thanksgiving before his parents died.</p><p>The evening ended on a companionable note, with Kate suggesting they do it again. All controversial topics were avoided, which certainly made for a more comfortable visit. On the drive home, Lori leaned her head against Linc\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou were right about Mom wanting to build a bridge.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d guessed that early on when Kate had insisted on having a beer with him. Although she\u2019d never tasted one before, she\u2019d liked it and had a second with dinner.</p><p>\u201cI found out Mom didn\u2019t tell Dad we were coming to dinner until this afternoon,\u201d Lori said.</p><p>\u201cI hope that didn\u2019t cause a problem between your parents.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty if that was the case.</p><p>\u201cMom didn\u2019t say, but I told her make-up sex is the best\u2014and that I was speaking from experience.\u201d</p><p>Linc nearly drove off the road. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Giggling, Lori wrapped her arm around his. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t, but I was tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did your father go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, and neither did Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe refused to join his family for dinner because of me?\u201d Linc almost felt sorry for the other man whose stubborn pride had prevented him from enjoying a wonderful meal and a good time. And Linc knew a little something about pride.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThis is about me. Dad still hasn\u2019t forgiven me for what happened with Geoff.\u201d</p><p>Linc felt her cringe just saying the other man\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s convinced I have no judgment whatsoever. And then you and I married so quickly, it sent him over the edge.\u201d</p><p>Linc realized this was the crux of the problem. He hoped he\u2019d reassured Kate and that she\u2019d share what he\u2019d said with Leonard.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you apologized for excluding the family from our wedding went a long way toward winning over my mother.\u201d</p><p>Linc had broached the subject between courses. His own family hadn\u2019t been invited, either, he\u2019d explained, and he\u2019d said that in retrospect he regretted it. If at some point Lori\u2019s family wanted to throw a formal wedding, that was fine with him. From the smile Kate sent him, Linc knew he\u2019d scored a few points.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said about make-up sex? Well, I heard there\u2019s an even better kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Lori straightened. \u201cIs there really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, it\u2019s the I-told-you-so-and-I-was-right kind of lovemaking.\u201d</p><p>Lori\u2019s smile filled her entire face. \u201cAre you making that up?\u201d</p><p>Linc grinned from ear to ear himself. \u201cTell you what, my wonderful wife, I\u2019ll let you be the judge.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>In the past six months, Shirley Bliss had had a few so-called dates. Spending time with a man other than her husband had felt wrong in the beginning, but she\u2019d gradually begun to accept that Jim was gone and she needed to\u2014as Miranda put it\u2014\u201cforge a new path in life.\u201d</p><p>Not that Miranda was a great example...</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t count Will Jefferson as a real date. The only reason she\u2019d accepted his invitations was out of gratitude, and in truth, she rather hoped Miranda would start seeing Will. In her opinion, her very forthright friend was perfect for the man who seemed to consider himself a gift for women to appreciate and admire.</p><p>This date with Larry Knight was in an entirely different category. For one thing, it was a real date. She felt as if she was in high school all over again, waiting to be picked up for the senior prom. That afternoon, before Larry arrived, she must have checked her reflection in the mirror a dozen times, as giddy as a schoolgirl. Thankfully Tanni had gone out with friends for the day.</p><p>She\u2019d had several conversations with Larry in the past three weeks. She\u2019d offered to drive into the city today but Larry had arranged for the car to show up at her place around two that afternoon. He\u2019d told her he probably wouldn\u2019t see her until she got to Seattle. They\u2019d attend his friend\u2019s show\u2014Manny Willingham, an artist whose name recognition had increased substantially in the past year\u2014have dinner and then the car would take her back to Cedar Cove.</p><p>While she was fussing with her hair one last time, the doorbell rang. The car was ten minutes early. Flustered, Shirley grabbed her purse and hurried to the front door. She opened it and, to her astonishment, Larry stood there on her porch. Just seeing him like this, so handsome and dynamic, just seeing his smile, left her breathless.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately greet him, Larry said, \u201cYou weren\u2019t expecting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to arrive with the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked out so I could. Are you ready, or do you need a few more minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d Or she would be, once her heart settled down and she could breathe normally again.</p><p>He guided her to the car. The driver held open the rear passenger door for her while Larry walked around to the opposite side.</p><p>Because of her initial reaction, Shirley was convinced she wouldn\u2019t be able to utter an intelligent word during the entire eighty-minute drive into Seattle. But they talked constantly\u2014about everything, from personal histories to what they were reading to preferences in art. When the driver pulled up in front of an elegant Bellevue gallery, Shirley couldn\u2019t believe so much time had passed.</p><p>She\u2019d learned a great deal about Larry, and had confided much about herself. Like her, he\u2019d lost his spouse, which she already knew. His two children were both married. He asked about Jim and her children, whom she discussed at length. Shirley thanked him again for helping Shaw and brought up her concerns about Tanni.</p><p>Manny Willingham was a sculptor. Larry introduced Shirley, and Manny took her hand in both of his, looked her directly in the eyes and said, \u201cGo easy on my friend. This has been a long time coming.\u201d</p><p>Larry growled something under his breath, but Shirley didn\u2019t hear what he\u2019d said, only that he was displeased with Manny\u2019s remark. Soon after, Manny was inundated by others with questions about his work and they didn\u2019t speak to him again.</p><p>They viewed Manny\u2019s work and Shirley could see why he commanded the prices he did. Several items already had red dots beside them, indicating a sale. Several others were for display only. One piece in particular struck Shirley, and she studied it for at least ten minutes. It was a bronze, a bouquet of roses just at their peak.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of my favorite pieces, as well,\u201d Larry said, standing behind her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for sale,\u201d she noted. She would gladly have purchased it if the price had been one she could afford\u2014which she doubted. But the decision had been taken away from her.</p><p>\u201cActually, I own that piece,\u201d Larry said.</p><p>Astonished, she turned to face him. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cManny made that for me shortly after Rosie died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife\u2019s name was Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosemarie. I called her Rosie.\u201d</p><p>Until that moment, Shirley hadn\u2019t realized that Larry had never mentioned his wife\u2019s name.</p><p>They left for an early dinner at about five. Unlike Will, who\u2019d taken her to one of the most expensive steak houses in town, Larry chose a quaint family-run seafood place along the Tacoma waterfront.</p><p>\u201cI hope seafood\u2019s okay with you,\u201d he said when he told her about it. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a meat eater.\u201d</p><p>So this was something else they had in common. \u201cI love seafood. This is perfect.\u201d And it was.</p><p>She wanted to remember every minute of their time together, everything they talked about. They had so many of the same likes and dislikes, from small things like favorite songs and movies to big ones like philosophies and beliefs. After a while, all the similarities between them seemed almost eerie\u2014and yet wonderful.</p><p>As the limo driver took them back to Cedar Cove, Larry reached for her hand. Shirley gave it to him, acutely conscious of his nearness\u2014his touch. It seemed as though her senses, long dormant, had suddenly sprung back to life.</p><p>She and Larry spent the rest of the drive just like that\u2014holding hands, exchanging quiet comments, completely focused on each other.</p><p>When the car pulled up in front of her house, Shirley was sorry the day had ended. Tanni wasn\u2019t home yet and Shirley couldn\u2019t decide whether she should worry or appreciate the privacy.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the dungeon?\u201d she asked him. The invitation was a way to keep Larry with her for a little while. Her art studio was nothing special, certainly not compared to what his must look like.</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d Larry asked the driver to wait and followed Shirley inside.</p><p>She led him down the stairs and once again felt her heart beating out of control. He was going to kiss her and she wanted that, more than anything she could remember wanting in a very long time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the bottom of the stairs, Larry rested his hand on her shoulder. Without thinking, Shirley turned into his embrace and slipped her arms around his neck. As she knew he would, as she\u2019d hoped and prayed, Larry kissed her. This was the first time another man had touched her like this since she\u2019d lost her husband. She\u2019d avoided anything physical with the few men she\u2019d dated, fearing the rush of guilt she knew she\u2019d experience. She felt none of that when Larry kissed her. No guilt, no dread. Just peace. And happiness.</p><p>After several kisses, she buried her face against his throat.</p><p>\u201cAfter we met, that night you came to my show, I had to see you again,\u201d he confessed in a husky whisper. \u201cManny\u2019s exhibit in Seattle was a convenient excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make up more excuses?\u201d</p> <p>Larry\u2019s collarbone vibrated slightly against her cheek as he chuckled. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou felt it, too?\u201d she asked, already knowing his answer. The attraction was there from the moment Will Jefferson had introduced them.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah...\u201d</p><p>Shirley heard the front door open and close. Tanni was home.</p><p>Larry dropped his arms and stepped away.</p> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>It was unusual for Tanni to seek her out; generally her daughter retreated immediately to her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cDown here,\u201d she called. \u201cThat\u2019s my daughter,\u201d she explained unnecessarily.</p><p>They started up the stairs, and when Tanni saw Larry with her mother, she raised questioning eyes to Shirley.</p><p>\u201cTanni, this is my friend Larry Knight.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s face instantly warmed as she recognized the name. Tanni pumped his hand as if she expected it to spout water. \u201cIt is a real pleasure to make your acquaintance,\u201d she said in an oddly formal fashion, hardly sounding like herself. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for everything you\u2019ve done for Shaw, and for me, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHappy to,\u201d Larry said. When Tanni released his hand, he turned to Shirley. \u201cI\u2019d better get back to Seattle. I\u2019m flying out early.\u201d</p><p>Shirley hated to see him go. She walked him to the door in silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She vowed she\u2019d sit by the phone until she heard from him. Until they talked again she couldn\u2019t allow herself to believe any of this was real. She watched him return to the car, watched it leave, before she found the strength to face her daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Tanni said reverently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wonderful.\u201d The word was inadequate to describe him and the way he made her feel.</p><p>Tanni gave her a speculative look and Shirley thought maybe she\u2019d said too much.</p><p>\u201cAre you falling for him, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>Shirley couldn\u2019t lie. \u201cI think I might be. Truthfully, it\u2019s all a little soon...and a little scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I know how I felt when I fell in love with Shaw. My stomach felt weird all the time and I didn\u2019t want to eat and all I could think about was him.\u201d As she spoke, Tanni\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Instinctively Shirley opened her arms. Tanni walked into them and laid her head against her mother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d Shirley asked softly as she stroked her daughter\u2019s hair.</p><p>Tanni broke away. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it when I cry,\u201d she muttered angrily. She scrubbed roughly at her face as though to punish herself for being so weak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Shaw, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Tanni nodded.</p><p>They went into the kitchen and sat on adjoining stools. Shirley waited for Tanni to get control of her emotions. After all these months of dealing with her daughter\u2019s contentious attitude, she was grateful that Tanni had confided in her.</p><p>\u201cI hate myself,\u201d Tanni blurted out.</p><p>Shirley wanted to argue and demand Tanni never say anything like that again. Instead, she held back and composed herself before responding.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked simply.</p><p>\u201cI hate how I act when I don\u2019t hear from Shaw. I text him and if he doesn\u2019t immediately text me back, then I accuse him of seeing other girls and we argue. I knew everything would change when he went to San Francisco. He said it wouldn\u2019t, but it has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw is changing.\u201d</p><p>Tanni bowed her head. \u201cHe makes me crazy. I hate the things I say and do. I want to believe he still loves me, but deep down I don\u2019t think he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he met someone else?\u201d</p><p>Again, she nodded, her head down, her chin almost against her neck.</p><p>Wanting to comfort her, Shirley leaned over and placed one arm around her daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to let go of the people we love. Even when we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see girls behave like this at school and I look at them with disgust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee them do what, exactly?\u201d Shirley asked. \u201cYou mean the texting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it. They hang on to their old boyfriends. They\u2019re so clingy and weak, and now I feel like one of them and I hate it. I hate myself,\u201d she said, choking back a sob.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t text Shaw, but I can\u2019t make myself stop.\u201d She looked at her mother tearfully. \u201cTake my cell phone away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried, and followed that with a tremulous smile.</p><p>They hugged, and then Tanni surprised her. \u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d she whispered as she slid off the stool.</p><p>By Monday evening Shirley understood her daughter\u2019s angst much more clearly. She hadn\u2019t heard from Larry since he\u2019d dropped her off. All of Sunday night she\u2019d waited for the phone to ring. Nothing. She considered calling him, but decided against it.</p><p>Early Tuesday afternoon, Tanni answered the door to a lovely floral arrangement that was being delivered.</p><p>She carried it into the kitchen, where Shirley was preparing a curried chicken salad.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for you,\u201d her daughter announced.</p><p>Shirley wiped her hands down the front of her jeans and reached for the card. Tanni watched as Shirley tore open the envelope and silently read the message. \u201cThank you for a lovely day. Larry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from Larry, aren\u2019t they?\u201d her daughter asked.</p><p>Shirley nodded and felt an overwhelming wave of sadness.</p><p>Tanni frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem happy that he sent you flowers.\u201d</p><p>Shirley gave what she hoped was an indifferent shrug as she dropped the card on the kitchen counter. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see me again. Flowers are a man\u2019s way of saying goodbye.\u201d All the ecstatic feelings she\u2019d experienced after their time together had turned into mere fantasy. Because she\u2019d been so attracted to Larry, she\u2019d made the wrong assumptions about his feelings for her. She was just another in a long list of women who\u2019d do anything to date him.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see you again?\u201d Tanni asked incredulously. \u201cAnd he let you know by sending you flowers? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded again as she struggled to deal with her disappointment. \u201cYes.\u201d She felt as if a thick fog had descended.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Tanni insisted.</p><p>Shirley knew otherwise. Larry Knight was an important artist, a celebrity in constant demand. He lived and worked in California and with his busy promotion and travel schedule he must\u2019ve realized how difficult maintaining a relationship would be. She\u2019d wondered when she hadn\u2019t heard from him and now she had her answer. Not that she blamed him; a long-distance romance would be impossible. Besides, she\u2019d probably just been a weekend\u2019s entertainment to him, not someone he\u2019d taken seriously....</p><p>Rather than let Tanni see how depressed she felt, Shirley managed to swallow a few bites of dinner. That evening she sat in front of the television, mindlessly watching a rerun of a reality show, too disheartened to do anything but stare at the screen.</p><p>Her head whirled with emotions she didn\u2019t want to confront. If Tanni had asked her about the program, Shirley wouldn\u2019t have been able to give her a single detail.</p><p>The phone rang, and she didn\u2019t even bother to look at caller ID. She couldn\u2019t see any reason to torture herself. Besides, Tanni would grab it fast enough.</p><p>Ten minutes later, her daughter wandered casually into the living room, arms swinging at her sides. \u201cThat man who wants to cut off his relationship with you is on the line.\u201d</p><p>Shocked to the very core of her being, Shirley nearly fell off the sofa. \u201cLarry?\u201d</p><p>Tanni grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s really nice, Mom. I like him. We talked.\u201d</p><p>Larry had spoken with her daughter for ten minutes?</p><p>\u201cI asked him about Shaw, and he said he checked and Shaw\u2019s doing really well at the art institute.\u201d Her smile revealed her pain. \u201cI\u2019m glad for him. I mean that.\u201d</p><p>Shirley knew what it had cost her daughter to make that statement.</p><p>\u201cMom, answer the phone,\u201d Tanni teased. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep Larry waiting.\u201d</p><p>Tanni was right. Feeling better than she had in days, Shirley picked up the phone.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Tanni Bliss parked in the lot adjacent to the library\u2014and did a competent job of it, too. At least in her own opinion. Having her driver\u2019s license had made a big difference to her life. It meant freedom! Her mom had been pretty good about letting her take the car, too, especially if it involved her work at the library.</p><p>The Reading with Rover program had gotten off to an excellent start. The first few weeks were an experiment to figure out how it should work when school began again in September.</p><p>Grace had called a meeting for the volunteers on Thursday afternoon. Tanni was on her way there now. She liked working with the kids and dogs; what she didn\u2019t enjoy was being around Kristen Jamey. Tanni wasn\u2019t sure why she disliked Kristen so much, other than the fact that she was dumb. She didn\u2019t know how else to put it. Kristen was about as empty-headed as anyone could get.</p><p>Her lack of intelligence didn\u2019t matter one iota because Kristen was beautiful. The boys at school stumbled all over themselves every time Kristen walked down the hall. She was popular with just about everyone\u2014except Tanni. Already there was talk about Kristen being crowned homecoming queen next October when they were seniors.</p><p>Tanni suspected Grace thought she was jealous of Kristen but that wasn\u2019t the case. It wasn\u2019t. She simply didn\u2019t respect the other girl. The head librarian had asked Tanni to make an effort to get along with Kristen, and she\u2019d tried. She really had, not that it\u2019d done much good. Knowing that Kristen would be at the meeting today put Tanni on edge.</p><p>The library was busy, probably due to the upcoming Fourth of July weekend. Half a dozen people stood in line waiting to check out books. All the computers were in use, too.</p><p>One of the librarians recognized Tanni and greeted her with a smile. \u201cGrace is in the conference room,\u201d she said, pointing in that direction.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Tanni headed toward the back of the library. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The conference room door was open, and she saw Grace sitting at the table with a pile of tissues in front of her. Tanni hesitated. Either Grace had come down with a wretched cold\u2014or she\u2019d been crying.</p><p>Not until she walked into the room did Tanni notice that Grace wasn\u2019t alone. Kristen Jamey sat across from her, and instinctively Tanni stiffened.</p><p>Grace glanced up. \u201cOh, hello, Tanni. I apologize for the tears. My dog, Buttercup...\u201d She didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cGrace found Buttercup dead this morning,\u201d Kristen explained. \u201cShe died in her sleep. Grace\u2019s husband, Cliff, is burying Buttercup in her favorite shady spot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Grace, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Tanni felt terrible for her. She\u2019d lost her own dog, Bingo, when she was ten and, until her father\u2019s death, it\u2019d been the worst event of her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d had Buttercup at the vet earlier in the week and everything seemed to be okay. She was getting on in years and sleeping a lot, but...this was unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should cancel the meeting,\u201d Kristen suggested, looking at Tanni.</p><p>\u201cSure. I can come another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Grace dabbed at her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re both here and the others are coming. I\u2019ll be fine. Just give me a few minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Kristen reached across the table and squeezed her hand gently. Tanni wanted to say something but she didn\u2019t really know how to comfort Grace. She thought of telling her about Bingo and how sad she\u2019d been when he died. Only it didn\u2019t seem like a good idea to share her own pain because it might make her weep, too.</p><p>\u201cMy dog\u2019s name was Bingo,\u201d Kristen whispered.</p><p>Tanni\u2019s head shot up.</p><p>\u201cHe was part cocker spaniel and part something else, although no one ever seemed to know what. Maybe poodle. My brother found him. The poor dog looked like he\u2019d been lost a long time. Bingo didn\u2019t have any identification, and we put an ad in the paper but no one claimed him. The day my dad was going to take him to the shelter I cried and cried, so my parents let me keep him. He\u2019d become my friend. He even slept on my bed.\u201d</p><p>Bingo had slept on Tanni\u2019s bed, too.</p><p>\u201cI got Buttercup from a friend of Charlotte Rhodes. It was shortly after my first husband died. I was so lonely, and Buttercup seemed to know how much I needed her. She loved Cliff...and me.\u201d Grace grabbed another tissue and blew her nose. \u201cEnough. I have to get a grip here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, it does get easier with time,\u201d Kristen said in the same soothing voice. \u201cI still think about Bingo and sometimes\u2014\u201d she glanced hesitantly at Tanni \u201c\u2014sometimes I feel as if he\u2019s still at the end of my bed asleep.\u201d</p><p>Tanni looked away. She felt the same thing about her Bingo.</p><p>The meeting lasted two hours. The four original volunteers showed up, plus three other adults who sat in to listen to the presentation. All three decided that they, too, wanted to be part of the program.</p><p>Tanni kept her eye on Kristen. The other girl had been so good with Grace. Kristen had said everything Tanni wished she\u2019d been able to say. Kristen had expressed sympathy and understanding and done it in a compassionate, thoughtful way.</p><p>Tanni didn\u2019t know the airhead was even capable of that. While Kristen had been comforting Grace, Tanni had sat like a dope with her tongue glued to the roof of her mouth.</p><p>When the meeting ended, Tanni followed Kristen out of the building. She wanted to tell her about Bingo. Her Bingo.</p><p>Apparently Kristen saw that Tanni was behind her because once they\u2019d left the building, she whirled around. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t like me, Tanni. I don\u2019t know what I ever did to you, but it must\u2019ve been awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I wanted to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>She hated the way Kristen made her feel. Grace had asked Tanni to make an effort with the other girl, and so far nothing had worked. Well, okay, she could\u2019ve tried harder. She took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI had a dog named Bingo, too,\u201d she told her.</p><p>Kristen\u2019s gaze narrowed as though she didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask my mother if you want. It\u2019s true. He died six years ago.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment Kristen didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI still miss my Bingo.\u201d</p><p>Tanni stared down at the pavement. \u201cI miss my Bingo, too.\u201d</p><p>The other girl hesitated. \u201cWould you like to walk over to Mocha Mama\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Her suspicions immediately shot up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Kristen shrugged. \u201cTo get something to drink. If you\u2019ve got other plans, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Tanni made a show of looking at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Kristen was all smiles now.</p><p>They walked across the street and down the next block to Mocha Mama\u2019s, where Shaw had once worked. His uncle owned the shop and had replaced Shaw with another manager. Adam was a college student who instantly perked up when Kristen and Tanni walked in. Tanni knew his sudden interest wasn\u2019t in her. Adam\u2019s eyes went straight to Kristen.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you ladies?\u201d Adam asked cheerfully.</p><p>Twice when she\u2019d stopped by, Tanni had to wait while Adam talked on his cell phone. Seeing the way he reacted to Kristen confirmed everything Tanni knew about the other girl. It wasn\u2019t fair that this airhead would command such adoration. Shaw would probably want to draw Kristen\u2019s portrait, too, she thought cynically.</p><p>Thinking about him made her tense. Without being too obvious about it, she got out her cell phone to see if there was a text message from Shaw, desperately hoping he\u2019d answered her while she was in the meeting at the library.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t.</p><p>No surprise there. She hadn\u2019t heard from him since the night before, when she\u2019d practically begged him to reply. Then his answer had been short and had basically said he was studying and she should leave him alone. She\u2019d tossed and turned half the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Kristen asked, breaking into Tanni\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>It took her a moment to respond. \u201cI\u2019ll have a chai tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Kristen said,</p><p>Tanni rummaged in her purse for money.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the house,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Kristen thanked Adam and when they\u2019d been served she led the way to a table by the window. It was the same one where Tanni often used to sit with Shaw.</p><p>\u201cThat must happen to you a lot,\u201d Tanni said, unable to hide her sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cYou mean getting stuff for free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>Tanni\u2019s cell dinged, indicating she had a text message. In her effort to reach her cell, she nearly tumbled off the chair. When she saw that the message was from her brother, Nick, who\u2019d stayed in Seattle for the summer, she wanted to weep with frustration. She became aware of Kristen watching her and quickly shoved the phone back in her purse.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you something,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like me. I\u2019m not sure why, but I can guess.\u201d</p><p>Tanni doubted Kristen would understand her feelings, but she wasn\u2019t going to argue. \u201cLet me ask you something, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Kristen sounded eager to clear the air.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you volunteer? Are you doing it because your GPA stinks and you figure having this on your college application is going to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her denial was instantaneous and vehement.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>Kristen\u2019s hand tightened around her drink. \u201cI had trouble learning to read, too. I\u2019m dyslexic, but when I first started school we lived in this really small town and they didn\u2019t test me for it. I struggled for a long time before I caught on to the concept of reading. I wanted to help another child learn because if a volunteer hadn\u2019t stepped in to help me, I might\u2019ve turned out to be one of those functional illiterates Grace talked about in the meeting this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dyslexic?\u201d Tanni found it hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cI know you think I\u2019m an airhead. But I\u2019m not stupid. It\u2019s just that I have a different way of learning than most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tanni felt immediately guilty. \u201cI assumed your heart wasn\u2019t really in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Kristen said with such conviction that Tanni would never doubt her again.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Kristen asked, then sipped at her creamy chai tea.</p><p>Tanni hesitated. The other girl had been honest with her. The least she could do was repay her in kind. \u201cI need to get my mind off Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw used to work here, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She answered with a nod. \u201cHe\u2019s attending the San Francisco Art Institute now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor him it is.\u201d Tanni, on the other hand, was stuck in Cedar Cove and would be for another year, if not longer. Before Shaw left, they\u2019d promised never to let anything or anyone come between them. He hadn\u2019t even been away three months and he was giving her the brush-off.</p><p>When he\u2019d first gone to San Francisco, they\u2019d been in constant communication. Now she was lucky if she heard from him three times a week. Whenever she did she was so happy; her behavior was downright pitiful. She hated her own reaction to his lack of contact as much as she hated what had happened between them.</p><p>\u201cNot so good for you, right?\u201d Kristen asked.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Tanni was unable to hide the pain in her voice. \u201cWe used to text every hour.... Now I hardly hear from him. I just wish he\u2019d say he wants to break up, you know. Instead, he\u2019s killing me with this silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys usually don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInitiate the breakup.\u201d</p><p>Kristen was the one with the experience in the dating world. Shaw was Tanni\u2019s first real boyfriend. He\u2019d also become her best friend. They\u2019d shared their love of art and each other, and everything had been perfect. Well, not completely, because Shaw was stuck here at Mocha Mama\u2019s brewing coffee and dying on the inside because he wanted to be an artist.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Shaw wants to break up with me?\u201d Tanni asked. Maybe Kristen could help her understand what was going on.</p><p>\u201cTell me how he\u2019s been acting.\u201d</p><p>Tanni talked for thirty minutes, rattling off a litany of slights Shaw had committed since he\u2019d moved to California.</p><p>\u201cYou say he never would\u2019ve gotten into the art institute if it hadn\u2019t been for some friends of your mother\u2019s?\u201d Kristen asked.</p><p>Eagerly Tanni nodded. \u201cHe owes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows it, too, which complicates his feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll he has to do is say the word and I\u2019m out of his life.\u201d She made it sound cut and dried, although it would be one of the hardest things she\u2019d ever had to go through. Not as hard as losing her dad.</p><p>Kristen\u2019s laugh poured salt into Tanni\u2019s already wounded heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny!\u201d she flared.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is,\u201d Kristen said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Shaw is so typical of guys I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019s being a total jerk to you\u2014and getting away with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did I do to him?\u201d Tanni wanted to cry at the unfairness of it all. The only thing she\u2019d ever done was encourage, love and support Shaw. Now he couldn\u2019t even take two minutes to send her a message.</p><p>\u201cProbably nothing,\u201d Kristen told her.</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019s he doing this?\u201d Even as she asked the question, Tanni had the answer. \u201cHe\u2019s met someone else, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Kristen didn\u2019t even try to soften the truth. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why doesn\u2019t he just say so?\u201d It would hurt a lot less if he was honest with her. Yes, it\u2019d still hurt, but the pain would be easier to deal with than being left hanging the way she was now.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what guys are like,\u201d Kristen said confidently. \u201cEspecially guys who\u2019ve been going out with you for a while. He\u2019s ignoring you, hoping you\u2019ll break up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he wants?\u201d Tanni asked with a catch in her throat.</p><p>\u201cFrom everything you\u2019ve told me, yes, that\u2019s what Shaw\u2019s waiting for you to do.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively Tanni knew Kristen was right.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out more, see other guys,\u201d Kristen advised. \u201cDo you know Jeremy Reynolds?\u201d</p><p>The name seemed familiar to Tanni but she couldn\u2019t visualize a face to go with it. \u201cI don\u2019t think so...maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s interested in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy Reynolds,\u201d Tanni repeated out loud. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve even met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe graduated this year. He lives next door to me, and when I mentioned that you and I had volunteered for the Reading with Rover program he asked a whole bunch of questions about you.\u201d</p><p>Tanni planned to dig out her yearbook the minute she got home and look him up.</p><p>\u201cJeremy\u2019s kind of shy,\u201d Kristen went on. \u201cBesides, everyone knows about you and Shaw. Would you like me to tell him you\u2019re not going out with Shaw anymore?\u201d</p><p>Tanni shrugged, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cGive it some time,\u201d Kristen said kindly. She finished her tea and set down the empty plastic cup. \u201cI\u2019m glad we talked, Tanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d And she meant it. If they hadn\u2019t, Tanni would never have guessed why Kristen had volunteered to work with kids at risk. \u201cThanks for the advice about Shaw. Would it be okay if I called you and let you know how things go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019d like it if we could be friends.\u201d</p><p>Kristen wanted to be friends with her? This was another twist Tanni hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that, too,\u201d Tanni said a bit shyly.</p><p>They stood, waved goodbye to Adam and walked slowly toward the library parking lot, chatting as they went.</p><p>When Tanni got home, she found her mother in a happy mood, which meant she\u2019d heard from Larry. They were on the phone practically every day, often two or three times.</p><p>\u201cYou seem happy,\u201d her mother said, watching Tanni in a way that would once have irritated her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be okay, Mom,\u201d she said. She went into her room and got out her Junior Annual to look for a photo of Jeremy Reynolds.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>On the Fourth of July, Mack and Mary Jo gathered down at the Cedar Cove waterfront with dozens of other families for the fireworks display. It was almost dark, and there was a buzz of anticipation in the crowd.</p><p>Linc and Lori sat on lawn chairs beside them. Noelle was already asleep, limp in Mack\u2019s arms, unaware of what was about to take place. Mary Jo doubted she\u2019d stay asleep once the fireworks began.</p><p>Mack had been on duty four days straight, but had the holiday itself free. The fire station was on high alert this week, due to the hazards caused by fireworks.</p><p>Being able to spend the entire day with Mack and her brother made this Fourth of July special. Because Mary Jo\u2019s relationship with Linc had changed\u2014more than changed, improved\u2014since her brother\u2019s marriage, she\u2019d discovered that he was a good friend. Lori was fast becoming one, too. The more she got to know Linc\u2019s wife, the more Mary Jo liked her. Lori was a gifted seamstress who\u2019d recently made an adorable summer outfit for Noelle.</p><p>Earlier in the day, the two couples had taken a picnic lunch to Point Defiance Zoo. While Noelle might be too young to appreciate the experience, she\u2019d loved seeing the animals. Even Linc seemed to have fun. Her brother had always been so serious; seeing him relaxed and enjoying himself revealed a side of him she barely remembered.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time?\u201d Lori asked impatiently. \u201cI thought the paper said ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>That was when they heard the whine of fireworks being set off. \u201cThere they go,\u201d Linc said, just as the rocket burst into a cluster, spraying red, white and blue sparks across the clear night sky.</p><p>At the explosion, Noelle woke with a start and began crying. Mack held the infant against his shoulder, gently rubbing her back. Noelle was content until the next explosion. She let out another startled cry.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cThis is scaring her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we take her home?\u201d Mack asked, his face marked with concern.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mary Jo said uncertainly. She didn\u2019t want the evening to end, but Noelle\u2019s comfort came first.</p><p>Noelle began to whimper. \u201cLook,\u201d Mack told her, and pointed up at the sky.</p><p>Mary Jo wanted to tell him he couldn\u2019t reason with a six-month-old infant.</p><p>But somehow, Mack was able to calm her and eventually Noelle returned to sleep, despite the noise and excitement. When Mary Jo glanced over at her sleeping daughter, she noticed Linc and Lori holding hands. Lori\u2019s head rested on Linc\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>She looked at Mack again and saw him watching Noelle, his expression vigilant. He must have felt her scrutiny because he turned to smile at her. She smiled back and reached for his hand.</p><p>Mack held it for a few minutes before releasing it in order to shift Noelle in his arms.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the duplex, it was almost midnight. While she put Noelle in her crib, Mack brought in the blanket, the diaper bag and the remains of their picnic. She\u2019d made potato salad, which he\u2019d raved about. She resisted telling him that the recipe had actually come from his mother.</p><p>In fact, Mary Jo had talked to Corrie McAfee twice in the past week. She liked Mack\u2019s mother; his father, too, although Roy was more difficult to know. Maybe because he was a detective and ex-cop and therefore used to keeping his reactions to himself.</p><p>When she came into the kitchen Mack was standing there, hands in his back pockets. He didn\u2019t say anything, as if gauging how best to broach whatever subject he had in mind.</p><p>Mary Jo waited for him to speak. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>Her feelings, her dissatisfaction, were still vague and unformed, and she was surprised by his perceptiveness. She tried to put her unease into words but that was harder than she\u2019d realized. She didn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing.</p><p>After another minute or so, Mack exhaled. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo felt awkward. \u201cTonight, with...Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he urged.</p><p>They stood and faced each other, and both seemed tentative, as though frightened of where this conversation might lead them.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be a dad.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the floor. \u201cYou love Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t doubt that, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His love for the baby was apparent in everything he\u2019d said and done ever since he\u2019d helped deliver her on Christmas Eve. When she raised her eyes she saw his smile.</p><p>She met his look. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He blinked in confusion. \u201cAre you asking if I love you? Mary Jo? You can\u2019t be serious! I\u2019m crazy about you. I\u2019ve told you that more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy about Noelle. I\u2019m just sort of...attached.\u201d She didn\u2019t like feeling so insecure and yet...she had to wonder. Furthermore, she\u2019d prefer the truth. She wanted to believe he cared, but she\u2019d been misled by David and could no longer trust her own instincts. She shouldn\u2019t ever forget that.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, without hesitation or embellishment. \u201cAs soon as this mess with David is straightened out, I\u2019d like us to become engaged. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>His words warmed her heart, but she refused to allow those warm feelings to sidetrack her. \u201cAfter this mess with David is settled,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and found she couldn\u2019t speak. The proposal was the reward he dangled in front of her to resolve the situation with Noelle\u2019s father. She was the one who was supposed to take the risk of pressing forward on the very issue David had warned her against. No one except Mary Jo seemed to see David as a credible threat. She had to take him at his word in this, if nothing else. His intentions were clear\u2014if she filed for child support, he\u2019d make her life miserable.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Allan Harris like you said?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Mack had been at the fire station most of the past two weeks; otherwise, she knew he would\u2019ve hounded her about this.</p><p>\u201cAnd the reason for that is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust David,\u201d she said, although that didn\u2019t really answer his question.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, because he can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>She moved away and walked over to the picture window, crossing her arms. \u201cWhy are you waiting for me to deal with David? If you love me and Noelle and we love you, then why can\u2019t we become engaged now?\u201d</p><p>Mack took his time answering. He took so long that Mary Jo turned around to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI have a good reason, Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear it.\u201d She tensed, afraid she was going to have a problem with what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cIf David gets wind of the fact that I want to adopt Noelle, it might be all the justification he needs to refuse to sign the relinquishment papers. He isn\u2019t willing to support his daughter, but as soon as he discovers I want to adopt her, you can bet he\u2019ll do whatever he can to thwart that. Ben agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve talked to Ben about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my father, too. They both said the same thing, and I respect their opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if David doesn\u2019t sign away his rights as Noelle\u2019s father?\u201d she asked slowly. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that when the time comes. Why are you assuming the worst?\u201d</p><p>Funny question. \u201cWith David I\u2019ve learned that\u2019s what I need to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t look at Mack, so she turned away again and walked into the kitchen. Needing to occupy her hands, she unpacked the picnic basket, setting the empty potato salad container in the kitchen sink and filling it with soapy water.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo, we\u2019re in the middle of an important decision. I think cleaning up can wait, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the counter. \u201cIf David refuses to sign the papers, would you still want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t pause for an instant.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sighed, obviously exasperated. \u201cLet\u2019s go back for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to Mr. Harris.\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve guessed this was coming. \u201cNo. He\u2019s been in court.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas he gone into the office at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut he\u2019s had other things on his mind. The trial only wrapped up on Friday, and I didn\u2019t want to distract him before that.\u201d This was true, but more than that it was an excuse, and as she offered it, Mary Jo realized Mack saw it for what it was.</p><p>\u201cO...kay,\u201d he said, dragging out the word. \u201cWhat about next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Harris is on vacation.\u201d Her relief tumbled out with her answer.</p><p>Mack walked into the living room, picked up a few toys scattered about, then returned to the kitchen. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to deal with this, do you?\u201d</p><p>She could lie, but Mack was right. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause?\u201d Again, he waited for her to explain.</p><p>\u201cBecause of all the reasons I\u2019ve already brought up. Nothing has changed, Mack. David will do whatever he can to ruin my life. He doesn\u2019t want me or Noelle, doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of a child, but he\u2019ll do everything in his power to make sure no one else can have us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to him,\u201d Mack said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, allow him to get into a physical confrontation with David.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he argued. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him I\u2019m marrying you and that I want to adopt Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that would help?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou just told me how important it was that David not know our plans.\u201d</p><p>Mack groaned, sounding frustrated and tired.</p><p>\u201cListen, Mack, it\u2019s really late and we\u2019re both upset. We should\u2019ve waited for another time to talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he countered. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss it right now, tonight. This whole thing started because you\u2019re afraid I\u2019m more interested in adopting Noelle than I am in marrying you. Correct?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Mary Jo nodded. It seemed so frivolous when he put it like that. Looking at him now, his eyes soft with tenderness, she wondered how she could have doubted his feelings for her.</p><p>\u201cYou do love me.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s call it a night. Forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Mack headed for the door, opening it forcefully before turning back. \u201cWould you mind waiting just a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... Okay, I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Mack tore out of the house and she heard him enter his own. Three or four minutes passed before he came back. She\u2019d used that time to finish cleaning up.</p><p>Mary Jo looked at him expectantly as he hovered in the kitchen doorway.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know I didn\u2019t plan it like this, but I think the timing is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiming? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit down.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, she sank into a kitchen chair.</p><p>Mack frowned and gestured at the living room. \u201cMaybe the sofa would be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sofa,\u201d she repeated. Fine, she\u2019d sit on the sofa.</p><p>As soon as she was seated, Mack paced in front of her. \u201cI love you, Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve established that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we? Are you sure? I don\u2019t want there to be a single doubt. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reassured me, Mack. Honestly, you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to your brother first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo let him know my intentions\u2014that I\u2019m asking his sister to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo blinked back tears as she understood exactly what Mack was doing. He was about to formally propose to her. Her hand flew to her mouth in shock\u2014and yet she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo.\u201d She stood, and when she did, Mack took her free hand in his. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>Not trusting her voice, she simply nodded.</p><p>Mack fumbled for something in his back pocket and brought out a diamond solitaire ring. \u201cI realize most women like to choose their own engagement bands. I picked it out myself, but if you don\u2019t like it I\u2019ll exchange it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d In truth she couldn\u2019t tell what the ring looked like because her eyes had filled with tears that blurred everything around her. Mack\u2019s sweet, wonderful face swam before her.</p><p>Mack slipped the diamond onto her ring finger. \u201cOkay, now we\u2019re officially engaged. Come what may, Mary Jo, no matter what happens with David and with custody of Noelle, you and I will face it together. As husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>Unable to hold back her tears, Mary Jo threw her arms around Mack and clung to him.</p><p>He drew her into his embrace. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>That was when Mack started to laugh, and the only way she could stop him was to take his face in both hands and kiss him.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Leonard Bellamy stood behind his massive desk as Roy McAfee was escorted into his office. He walked toward Roy, extending his hand.</p><p>As they shook, Roy scanned his surroundings.</p><p>The office was impeccably furnished. Pieces of modern art were prominently displayed and Roy guessed that none of them were reproductions.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your coming here,\u201d he said, gesturing for Roy to take a seat. Prior business had always been done at the McAfee office, and Roy was well aware that this time Bellamy wanted the advantage of being in his own territory.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of the service.\u201d Roy sat in the leather chair, letting his body language convey self-assurance. Bellamy\u2019s assistant brought him a cup of coffee. He thanked her with a smile and took a sip.</p><p>Bellamy reclaimed his seat. \u201cI hope you did a thorough search on that freeloader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Roy said. He put the coffee on the edge of Leonard\u2019s desk and balanced his briefcase on his legs.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. I want to pin him to the wall. He thinks he can move into Cedar Cove, set up business and marry my daughter? I\u2019ve got news for him. Wyse is going to learn that I\u2019m not letting him ride on my good name.\u201d</p><p>Roy wondered what Leonard meant. He\u2019d seen no evidence of Linc exploiting Bellamy\u2019s name or influence. Could the other man have information he didn\u2019t? Roy doubted it.</p><p>As for a bad report on Wyse...he suspected Bellamy would be disappointed. He withdrew a folder and handed it to him.</p><p>Bellamy eagerly took it and started flipping through the pages. He frowned, and his frown darkened as he read.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019ve given you a six-page report. I took extra time to do an exhaustive background check and found that Lincoln Wyse has no police record. He pays his bills on time. No problems with the IRS. He attends church\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything! I go to church, too.\u201d</p><p>Roy continued to outline his findings. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve gathered,\u201d he concluded, \u201cyour daughter made a good choice in the man she married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Bellamy said angrily. He tossed the report aside, his look sour with disappointment. \u201cFirst, my wife takes up his cause and now you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your wife\u2019s met Wyse?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWithout my knowledge she invited our daughter and that gold digger to dinner at the family home\u2014keeping it from me until the last moment. I refused to have any part of it. Later, she told me how much she enjoyed meeting him. I thought Kate had more sense than that, but apparently I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Roy had assumed Bellamy was capable of recognizing when he\u2019d made a mistake; he\u2019d obviously misjudged the other man. Bellamy was committed to the idea that Lincoln Wyse had married Lori for his own selfish reasons. Nothing would change his mind, not even the truth\u2014that Linc was a decent man and that he was in love with Lori.</p><p>\u201cDig deeper this time,\u201d Leonard bellowed, slamming his fist on the desk. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something. Find it!\u201d</p><p>Roy had hoped the report would reassure Bellamy; however, that wasn\u2019t happening. Obviously the man\u2019s agenda was more complicated than he\u2019d realized. Roy had initially wondered if Bellamy believed no man was good enough for his daughter. Now he discounted that assumption. For whatever reason, Bellamy wanted to prove he was right and Lori was wrong.</p><p>To be fair, Roy could understand Bellamy\u2019s concerns. Lori and Linc hadn\u2019t known each other long before they were married. Not inviting family to the wedding exacerbated the situation, and Roy could appreciate that, since his own daughter had done basically the same thing. He reminded himself that he had the advantage of having spent some time with Pete Mason. Bellamy knew next to nothing about Lincoln Wyse.</p><p>\u201cGo back, and bring me some facts I can use,\u201d Bellamy said. He stood as though to dismiss Roy.</p><p>Slightly amused and yet irritated, Roy remained seated. \u201cDo you think I didn\u2019t do a thorough report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that man and I don\u2019t trust him. I haven\u2019t gotten this far in business without being a decent judge of character. I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d be able to uncover what my gut told me when I met Wyse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I explained, I did a complete background check. In addition to all the normal sources, I interviewed business associates and friends and investigated his finances. I found no evidence of gambling, excessive drinking or any other vice. He has good, solid values. If it were me, I\u2019d welcome him into my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not you,\u201d Bellamy informed him, still standing. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, Lincoln Wyse is not to be trusted. He\u2019s taken advantage of my daughter. Lori\u2019s not only easy to fool, she\u2019s rebellious. She\u2019s defied me from the time she was five years old. Well, with this, she went too far.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to Roy that the real issue here wasn\u2019t Linc Wyse but Bellamy\u2019s relationship with his daughter. His apparent contempt for Lori, for her decisions in matters of work, love and who knew what else, rankled him. This was more about control than caring, more about pride than truth. He recalled how Bellamy had berated Lori because she\u2019d been engaged to Geoff Duncan. Roy felt like pointing out that Duncan had fooled nearly everyone. He\u2019d managed to deceive his employer, attorney Allan Harris, and that was no small thing. Duncan was smart, although thankfully not smart enough to get away with his crimes. It was grossly unfair to criticize Lori for being taken in by Duncan when he\u2019d misled almost everyone else in town. Ironically, Duncan had resorted to theft because he\u2019d been in over his head\u2014all in an effort to impress Lori\u2019s demanding father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mentioned that you had a connection with Wyse when I hired you,\u201d Bellamy said disparagingly. \u201cI relied on you to be objective. Knowing what I do now, I can see that was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>For Bellamy to question Wyse\u2019s integrity was one thing, but to raise doubts about Roy\u2019s went over the line. He jumped to his feet and glared at the other man. Neither spoke.</p><p>\u201cI completed the job you hired me to do,\u201d Roy finally said. \u201cThis report will stand up, despite what you want to believe. Wyse is a decent man.\u201d He would defy anyone to come up with anything different.</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d</p> <p>Roy opened his briefcase and removed the envelope that contained his bill. Bellamy thrust his hand out to take it. Instead, Roy tore it in two. \u201cIn future I\u2019d prefer if you took your business elsewhere.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for Bellamy to respond, just grabbed his briefcase and walked out the door.</p><p>In a ten-minute conversation, Leonard Bellamy had insulted and infuriated him, to the point that Roy had actually thrown away money and lucrative future jobs\u2014and felt good about it.</p><p>Rather than return to the office, Roy drove straight home. Corrie, as she often did, had taken Tuesday off to run errands. Checking his watch, he guessed she\u2019d be home by now. His wife always had a calming effect on him. He decided he wouldn\u2019t mention his meeting with Bellamy; that would only rile him up again and solve nothing. Roy applauded Lori for defying her tyrant of a father.</p><p>When he walked in, Corrie was sitting in the kitchen with several bags of groceries lined up on the counter. She appeared to be deep in thought. In fact, she didn\u2019t seem to notice he was home.</p><p>Roy waved his hand playfully in front of her nose. Her face melted into a smile, and she automatically turned to him so he could kiss her, which he did. His wife\u2019s smile brought him peace and smoothed the sharp edges of his confrontation with Bellamy.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d she commented as she slid off the stool. \u201cHow\u2019d it go with Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d remembered. Well, no need to hide the events of the afternoon, then. He shrugged. \u201cI won\u2019t bore you with the details, but I won\u2019t work for the man again.\u201d</p><p>She arched her brows, but if she was tempted to say I told you so, she didn\u2019t. \u201cOh? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have opposing points of view,\u201d he said simply. He gestured at the groceries. \u201cAny reason you haven\u2019t put the milk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you to get home and do it for me,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Grinning, he reached for the half gallon of milk and set it inside the refrigerator. \u201cAnything else that needs attention?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIce cream,\u201d Corrie cried, and searched hurriedly through the bags until she found the carton, which she shoved in the freezer.</p><p>This scattered behavior was odd for his practical, even-keeled wife. Roy walked over to the sink and turned on the faucet to pour them each a glass of cold water. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny that she was upset. \u201cI ran into Gloria at the grocery store.\u201d She paused as though to collect her thoughts.</p><p>Roy knew better than to prod her. She\u2019d tell him when she was ready.</p><p>\u201cI know Linnette so well,\u201d she said, although Roy had no idea what Linnette had to do with this. \u201cI would\u2019ve realized in a heartbeat that she was pregnant the moment I looked at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more difficult over the phone,\u201d he agreed, although he didn\u2019t know what that had to do with meeting Gloria in the Safeway store.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upset about something and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Gloria.\u201d</p><p>Roy was beginning to get her drift now. Corrie had talked to Gloria and couldn\u2019t read her the way she could their daughter. Except that Gloria was their daughter, too. Their first daughter.</p><p>\u201cI asked her to dinner on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Spending time together was the key. There were wounds to heal and relationships to build. He wanted Gloria to feel part of their family because she was family.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working?\u201d Roy knew that as the most recent addition to the sheriff\u2019s department, Gloria pulled the less desirable shifts. She\u2019d been on duty over the Fourth of July, and was probably working weekends, as well.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t give me a reason.\u201d Corrie was putting away the groceries. \u201cI suggested a weekday as an alternative and she said she\u2019d get back to me, but I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t.\u201d Corrie shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s avoiding us.\u201d</p><p>That was one possibility but his wife could be exaggerating, making unwarranted assumptions. He didn\u2019t want to say that, though. Gloria was still a sensitive subject for them.</p><p>\u201cDo you know if she\u2019s seeing anyone?\u201d Corrie asked him out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cDating, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She hasn\u2019t said. Did she mention anyone to you?\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded. \u201cBut not his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think this might be about relationship troubles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it always?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>That seemed to be the end of the conversation.</p><p>Roy spread the Cedar Cove Chronicle out on the kitchen table and opened it to the crossword puzzle.</p><p>Suddenly Corrie exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s that doctor!\u201d</p><p>Roy glanced up.</p><p>\u201cWhat doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one Linnette was so keen on. At the clinic. I remember that he seemed more interested in Gloria, and that really bothered Linnette.\u201d</p><p>Roy managed to conjure up a hazy memory of this. Linnette had liked some doctor but then given up on him and fallen for that horseman, instead. Cal Washburn, his name was.</p><p>Roy returned to his crossword as his wife washed fresh herbs and rolled them in a paper towel to store in a refrigerator bag. He had one corner of the puzzle completed when Corrie interrupted him again.</p><p>\u201cTodd,\u201d she announced triumphantly. \u201cNo, not Todd. Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimmons,\u201d she said with a snap of her fingers. \u201cChad Timmons. Dr. Chad Timmons.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and saw her watching him intently. Apparently something else was required of him, although he couldn\u2019t figure out what. \u201cYou think Gloria\u2019s seeing this doctor and having problems with him?\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s having major problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Gloria doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly Corrie turned away, then plucked a tissue from the nearby box and held it to her eyes. Corrie was crying? He got up from the table and stood behind her, clasping her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts that our daughter can\u2019t talk to us, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She sniffled, then turned and slid her arms around his middle, burying her face in his chest.</p><p>\u201cEverything will work out,\u201d Roy murmured, hoping he sounded reassuring. Corrie\u2019s feelings had been hurt, and while he wanted to comfort his wife, it was understandable that Gloria would choose not to share her emotions with them. If she\u2019d had a falling-out with Dr. Timmons, then either the two of them would resolve the issue or they\u2019d go their separate ways.</p><p>He would\u2019ve commented on this if not for the fact that Corrie started to weep in earnest. Huge sobs racked her shoulders. Then, shocking him completely, she broke away and ran down the hallway.</p><p>For an instant Roy was too stunned to react. He found her standing on the tips of her toes in front of the hall closet, reaching for a new box of tissues.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell me. I was right there. I saw it, Roy. I saw it and she could barely look me in the eye. I tried to talk to her and she...\u201d The rest was muffled as Corrie tore open the box and pressed a large wad of tissues to her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Roy asked gently. He was growing concerned. This behavior of hers wasn\u2019t like any he\u2019d seen in more than thirty years of marriage.</p><p>Corrie lowered her hand, crumpling the tissues. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you earlier, but I saw what was in Gloria\u2019s cart,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Roy couldn\u2019t imagine what their daughter might have purchased to cause this kind of reaction. Had Gloria taken to eating weird food? Like what? Or\u2014</p><p>\u201cRoy,\u201d Corrie said, grabbing his sleeve. \u201cGloria had a pregnancy test kit in her cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Corrie started weeping again. \u201cI think she must be.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Christie patted little Christopher\u2019s back in the hopes of coaxing a burp from the squirming infant. Teri sat across from her holding Robbie. Thankfully Jimmy was sound asleep in the nursery. Bobby was busy elsewhere, doing whatever it was Bobby did.</p><p>Although Christie continued to come over on Wednesdays to help her sister with the babies, she hadn\u2019t seen James yet. Their disagreement had gone on far longer than she\u2019d ever expected. He hadn\u2019t budged, nor had she. Christie hated to think their relationship was over, but maybe it was, since obviously neither one was willing to make the first move.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen James around lately,\u201d she told her sister cautiously. Christie didn\u2019t want to ask and didn\u2019t want to put up with an inquisition from Teri, but curiosity had gotten the better of her. Always before, James had sought her out. Not this time. She had the distinct impression he was away\u2014traveling or perhaps simply gone.</p><p>Or...another possibility. Maybe he was keeping out of sight, waiting for her to apologize. Perhaps she should; she didn\u2019t know anymore. Pride and stubbornness had carried her this far, but they\u2019d worn thin.</p><p>\u201cJames has been doing a lot of traveling lately,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Christie remembered one occasion, back in May, when Bobby and James had gone on some kind of business trip. Other than that, Bobby hadn\u2019t been gone much; when he did travel, James accompanied him. He was more than Bobby\u2019s driver, he was his confidant, best friend and\u2014although no one had ever said as much\u2014his bodyguard.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Oh\u2019?\u201d Teri echoed. \u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d</p><p>Christie considered the question. \u201cAll right, if you must know, James and I had a falling-out.\u201d</p><p>Her sister laughed, startling Christopher. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know this? You\u2019ve been in a bad mood for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a gross exaggeration.\u201d Christie had done her utmost to be bright and cheerful whenever she spent time with Teri, pretending nothing was amiss. To all outward appearances, she was doing just fine, busy with work and school.</p><p>Given that she was at the house every Wednesday, James could easily have spoken to her, if he had any interest. However, he hadn\u2019t taken advantage of the opportunity, and now she was wondering if he planned to end the relationship. That possibility was a painful one, but she had to admit it was what she\u2019d started to believe.</p><p>Christie stared down her sister. \u201cI have made every effort to be as congenial as possible.\u201d Apparently Teri had little appreciation of how difficult that had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her sister rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so.\u201d</p><p>Teri released an exaggerated sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s taken you long enough, but thank goodness you\u2019re coming to your senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Christie asked, defensive now but still curious.</p> <p>\u201cYou finally got up the nerve to ask about James,\u201d Teri said, smiling down at the baby as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHas he asked about me?\u201d</p><p>Teri nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Christie urged, and edged slightly forward, eager for the tiniest bit of information.</p><p>\u201cThis might come as a surprise but James can be stubborn, too,\u201d Teri said.</p> <p>No kidding.</p><p>A hundred questions flashed into her head. Did James miss her half as much as she missed him? Did he love her? She desperately wanted to believe he did. But if so, why hadn\u2019t he made the slightest attempt to patch up their differences? For that matter, why hadn\u2019t she? Why did she always sabotage herself like this?</p><p>Instead of approaching James with the goal of reconciliation, she\u2019d plowed ahead with her studies, getting A\u2019s on several tests, working long hours and doing everything she could not to think about him. She\u2019d even cleaned her oven, which gave her a sense of accomplishment and a feeling of righteousness.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he ask about me?\u201d Christie inquired, unwilling to pretend disinterest for another minute.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing much. He wanted to know how you were\u2014that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Disappointment fell heavily on her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been traveling a lot,\u201d Teri reiterated, placing emphasis on the he.</p><p>\u201cTraveling with Bobby?\u201d Her sister was trying to tell her something important, although Christie had never been much good at reading between the lines.</p><p>\u201cTraveling with and without Bobby,\u201d Teri clarified.</p><p>Christie frowned. \u201cWhatever you want to say, would you just say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve told you a whole lot sooner if you\u2019d asked,\u201d Teri said, and pressed her lips primly together.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019m asking now.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s face lit up and she grew excited. \u201cJames invented an online game that he and Bobby have been working on day and night for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnline game?\u201d Christie repeated. \u201cA chess game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSort of,\u201d her sister explained. \u201cIt starts out with a chessboard and two players.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to warrant the enthusiasm Teri displayed. \u201cOkay, but what\u2019s the big deal? I\u2019m sure there are plenty of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s different. When a player makes a particular move on the chessboard, he or she enters a parallel universe, which is set in medieval times. The player is confronted with knights and beasts and can end up in the same world or in different worlds at different times. It\u2019s complicated. The game\u2019s been compared to World of Warcraft. There are sixty levels and James has been asked to create more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Bobby involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but minimally. This has been great for Bobby and James. The idea came from James and he did most of the work. It sold, Christie, and it sold big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d James hadn\u2019t shared any of this success with her. No wonder he hadn\u2019t been in touch. He had lots of things on his mind\u2014and they didn\u2019t include her.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d Teri looked dumbfounded by her lack of reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...happy for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t act very happy.\u201d</p><p>She made a genuine attempt to smile. A moment later she noticed that Teri was staring at the entrance to the kitchen; Christie glanced up to see James standing there, looking healthy and vital and just so...good.</p><p>Her sister immediately stood. \u201cI\u2019m putting Robbie in his crib,\u201d she whispered, blatantly an excuse to leave Christie and James alone.</p><p>Christie waited until her sister had left. \u201cI...I understand congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He moved slowly into the family room, hands buried in his pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she returned cheerfully, wondering if the intense effort that required was as obvious as it felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d So he was the first to admit it....</p><p>Gazing down at the baby, she whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess Teri told you about Polgar World?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the name?\u201d she asked, looking up.</p><p>James took the seat across from her that Teri had vacated. \u201cBobby was kind enough to lend his name. We got word of the sale yesterday....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust yesterday?\u201d</p><p>James leaned back. \u201cMy agent\u2019s been in negotiations with two companies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an agent?\u201d That made her question how many other secrets he\u2019d kept from her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting, Christie.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, struggling to hide how hurt she was. \u201cWaiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d come to me when you were ready to forgive and forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say the same thing to you? It doesn\u2019t do any good for me to forgive and forget if you can\u2019t, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose it does.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else for another lengthy moment. Christie almost wished Christopher would wake up and wail to distract her from this anguish\u2014and to give voice to her own discontent.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we stand, then?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. I...I\u2019d give anything to be able to wipe the slate clean and be the woman you deserve.\u201d Her mouth was so dry she could hardly speak. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, but I can\u2019t live with the threat of you throwing it in my face every time we disagree, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t live with you constantly bringing up the fact that I let you down when I...left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d James urged when she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Polgar World?\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>The question seemed to hang in the air. Before he answered, James exhaled deeply. \u201cI feel that I\u2019ve failed at almost everything I\u2019ve tried to do in my life. The idea for the game came to me two years ago. I\u2019ve been developing it for the past year and a half. I didn\u2019t even tell Bobby until six months ago. I could live with failing, but I couldn\u2019t live with disappointing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d An inadequate response, but the best she could manage.</p><p>\u201cI figured if and when it was a success, I\u2019d come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now. I didn\u2019t just happen to stop by the house. I saw your car outside and I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>Christie stared up at him, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I thought I\u2019d be the happiest man alive when this game sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d He had every reason to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cNot if I can\u2019t share it with you.\u201d A tentative smile came and went.</p><p>She smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Christie. I\u2019m tired of being alone, tired of my pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride doesn\u2019t really keep you warm at night, does it?\u201d She was speaking for herself as well as him.</p><p>He stood then and moved toward her with his usual long strides, taking the seat beside her. \u201cI want us to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Not the most elegant answer, perhaps, but it got the point across.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re kids who don\u2019t know what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cBobby and Teri were married in Vegas....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could make it a family tradition,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>James grinned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more. Hey, are you doing anything this weekend?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d she said, then sent him a huge smile. \u201cI\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because so am I.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her and she went willingly into his arms, almost forgetting Christopher.</p><p>Between kisses James murmured, \u201cNo more arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s unlikely, but at least we know we can get past them.\u201d Her lips lingered on his. \u201cOh, James, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a loving kiss. \u201cI\u2019m marrying you and that makes me happier than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we tell Teri and Bobby?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe heard,\u201d Bobby said from the kitchen.</p><p>James straightened and looked over at them. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a best man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there and so will I,\u201d Teri said, standing next to her husband. Bobby had his arm around Teri\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll be the matron of honor,\u201d Teri added.</p><p>Christie wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>Gloria needed to tell Chad that their night together had consequences. She was pregnant. He had a right to know. It\u2019d been more than a month since he\u2019d moved away. When she\u2019d called his old phone number, she was given a number with a Tacoma area code. So she\u2019d guessed correctly. Chad had taken the job with Tacoma General to work in their E.R.</p><p>What surprised Gloria was how much she missed him since he\u2019d left. That wasn\u2019t even logical. They weren\u2019t a couple; in fact, she\u2019d refused to see him again. The only thing to which she could attribute this sense of loss was the comfort she\u2019d found in knowing he was close at hand. If she\u2019d wished to, she could\u2019ve sought him out. She hadn\u2019t, though. Instead, she\u2019d made every effort to banish him from her thoughts. But nothing had worked.</p><p>And now...now she was pregnant with his child. This baby was the result of their irresponsible behavior, yes, but...she\u2019d never been happier. While this new life was about to turn her own upside down, she felt the most incredible sensation of joy. She wanted Chad\u2019s baby, and she was sure that when she told him, Chad would be happy, too.</p><p>Because of the baby, she had no choice but to confront her fears about her relationship with Chad. He\u2019d knocked down all the protective barriers she\u2019d so carefully set up. Because of the baby she couldn\u2019t rebuild them. The baby made her vulnerable. She had to admit she did love Chad. She needed him.</p><p>Her parents\u2019 deaths had forever shaped her future. When she\u2019d found her birth family, Gloria had expected these strangers to fill the empty places in her heart. That was unreasonable; she saw that now.</p><p>It was while she was struggling to reinvent her life, to find a new family, that Gloria had met Chad. A few weeks ago, when she suspected she might be carrying his child, she\u2019d nearly panicked. This couldn\u2019t be happening. But despite her fears, she\u2019d gradually come to accept that this baby was her new family. Hers and Chad\u2019s. Once she saw the pregnancy in this light, she began to feel a sense of peace.</p><p>After she\u2019d done the home pregnancy test, she made a doctor\u2019s appointment. The next step was to tell Chad. She realized the news would come as a shock; it had to her. She assumed his reaction would be similar. She\u2019d give him time to adjust, and then they could make their decisions about the future. Decisions and plans... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew it would be a future together. Chad loved her. He\u2019d said so. And while she\u2019d been hesitant to admit it, she loved him, too.</p><p>The drive into Tacoma took thirty minutes. Gloria used that time to rehearse how she planned to break the news to Chad. She had his new address, which was close to the hospital. The reverse telephone directory had even included his apartment number.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see his car in the parking area, but she rang his doorbell and waited. As she\u2019d feared, he wasn\u2019t home. She should probably have phoned ahead, but she hadn\u2019t, primarily because she was afraid she\u2019d blurt out everything then and there. And that would\u2019ve been unfair. No, a face-to-face meeting was better.</p><p>Her other option was to go to the hospital. She\u2019d see him, however briefly, and they could arrange a time to talk. As luck would have it, she arrived just as the shift changed, so she decided to wait. Her news would be shocking enough without adding to the drama by asking to speak to him privately while he was on duty.</p> <p>She located his car in the staff parking lot and steered into a space two rows over, where she could keep his car in view. Ten minutes later she saw him.</p><p>Except he wasn\u2019t alone. An attractive blonde woman walked with him. They were deeply involved in conversation, his head leaning close to hers. Chad laughed frequently as they talked; clearly they enjoyed each other\u2019s company.</p><p>Gloria watched him escort the blonde to her car. Her heart plummeted when he bent to kiss her passionately. Then he stepped back and waited as she pulled out of her parking space and drove off.</p><p>When Chad started toward his car, Gloria sat, unmoving, in her own. He opened his door, then looked up and paused. He\u2019d caught sight of her.</p><p>With no choice now, she climbed out of her car.</p> <p>Chad walked over, and judging by the frown that darkened his face, he wasn\u2019t happy to see her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>The answer should be obvious. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>This was her opportunity to explain the reason for her visit. And yet...she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI thought I made myself clear in our last conversation,\u201d he said stiffly. He thrust his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019m through with our hot-and-cold relationship, Gloria. I hung around Cedar Cove far longer than I should have, wanting to give us a chance. I honestly hoped we could make a go of it, but you let me know you weren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>She had no defense. That was exactly what she\u2019d done.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I left, I told you I was finished and I meant it. You aren\u2019t good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose I am,\u201d she agreed sadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting over here in Tacoma and you know what? I like my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you have a...friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He didn\u2019t embellish but simply confirmed the fact.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t argue with anything you said. I wish you well, Chad, I really do. I apologize for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d he said, cutting her off. \u201cYou taught me some valuable lessons.\u201d</p><p>She merely nodded, unable to speak. With the pregnancy, her emotions had become volatile; she didn\u2019t want to risk embarrassing herself or him, so she offered him a smile. What she wanted was to tell him about the baby, but she couldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019d begun a new life, a new relationship. Some might argue that it wasn\u2019t ethical to keep the baby a secret, but that was what she intended to do. Wasn\u2019t it fairer to him that way? She could see to it that one night of his previous life, one night in an ill-fated relationship, wouldn\u2019t return to damage his future hopes and dreams. With the decision made, she turned away, got back in her car and sped out of the parking lot.</p> <p>The tears came as she headed home to Cedar Cove. By the time she exited the freeway she was a mess. Her eyes were puffy and red and the seat next to her was piled with crumpled tissues.</p><p>Hardly aware of what she was doing, Gloria was mildly surprised to find herself in front of the McAfee home on Harbor Street.</p><p>She needed her mother. At one point in her own life, Corrie had been in the same situation as Gloria. She\u2019d know what to do, how to guide her.</p><p>She wiped her face and walked up the steps to the door. If Roy answered, Gloria had no idea what she\u2019d say.</p><p>He did. Taking one look at Gloria, he whirled around and called out, \u201cCorrie!\u201d</p><p>There was an urgency in his voice, and Corrie appeared almost immediately. Roy stepped aside and Corrie took Gloria by the hand and led her into the house, straight to the kitchen. Pulling a chair out from the table, she sat Gloria down and then sat beside her, still holding her hand.</p><p>Gloria discovered she couldn\u2019t say a word. Not a solitary word. Every time she opened her mouth, nothing came out. After several futile attempts, she stopped trying. Instead, she held a clump of tissues to her eyes and wept loudly.</p><p>Corrie moved away from the table long enough to make two mugs of decaffeinated tea.</p><p>Roy briefly entered the kitchen and promptly left. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the other room if you need me,\u201d he said on his way out the door. He seemed grateful that nothing was expected of him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Corrie said soothingly. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>Gloria did. The hot liquid eased the ache in her throat. The mug held in both hands spread warmth through her chilled body.</p><p>When her vision cleared, Gloria saw that Corrie\u2019s eyes were brimming with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Gloria whispered.</p><p>\u201cI suspected it.\u201d Corrie patted her hand gently. \u201cI saw the pregnancy kit when I ran into you at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. You...you didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted you to trust me enough to come to me. I\u2019m so glad you did.\u201d Leaning over, she wrapped Gloria in her loving embrace.</p><p>A number of times in the past Corrie had hugged her and Gloria had responded, although it had all seemed rather forced. Not this time. They clung to each other in mutual understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first learned I was pregnant with you, it felt as if the world had come to an end,\u201d Corrie said in a low voice as they moved apart.</p><p>Gloria made a sound that was half tearful, half amused. \u201cI felt like that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy and I weren\u2019t seeing each other anymore and he was dating some cheerleader.\u201d</p><p>Gloria lowered her head. \u201cDid you tell him when you found out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What good would it\u2019ve done for him to know? We were so young...I was still in my teens. He was out of my life, and I was too stubborn and too hurt to go to him. Right or wrong, I believed this was my problem and I\u2019d deal with it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I dropped out of college for the rest of the school year and returned to Oregon to live with my parents. They were wonderful, helping me decide what was best for you\u2014and for me.\u201d Tears slipped down Corrie\u2019s face. \u201cI loved you so much.... You\u2019ll never know how hard it was to give you up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Gloria who comforted her mother; she drew her close and murmured words of love and reassurance. They held each other for several minutes.</p><p>When they reached for tissues at the same time, they both laughed, soft, embarrassed laughter.</p><p>Gloria sipped her tea and took a moment to compose her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhen...when did you tell...Dad?\u201d These were all questions Gloria had wanted to ask; she\u2019d never found the courage. Facing her own pregnancy without the baby\u2019s father gave her an entirely different perspective on her mother\u2019s situation. The rejection she\u2019d felt, the feelings of resentment she\u2019d experienced at being denied the joy of growing up with her brother and sister, evaporated. Her mother had loved her and had done the best she could under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cRoy didn\u2019t know about you until you were over a year old.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known about her until she\u2019d already taken her first steps. \u201cWhat made you decide to tell him?\u201d</p><p>Corrie hung her head. \u201cI went back to school and we met on campus at the library. It was all rather awkward, as you can imagine. I didn\u2019t want to see him, and at the same time I did, if that makes any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe started dating again. I\u2019d never stopped loving him, but I wasn\u2019t willing to let him break my heart a second time. When he asked me to marry him, I felt he needed to know about you.\u201d She exhaled shakily and reached for her tea with a trembling hand. \u201cHe was upset with me, Gloria, terribly, terribly upset. I\u2019ve never seen Roy like that, before or since. He was so...angry.\u201d</p><p>Gloria peered into the other room and saw that Roy was working on the computer, his back to her.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed that we wouldn\u2019t discuss it again and we both accepted that we had a daughter we\u2019d never know, but would always love.\u201d She paused to get control of her emotions before she continued. \u201cThen you came back into our lives and I can\u2019t tell you how happy that\u2019s made us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom,\u201d Gloria whispered. It was the first time she\u2019d ever addressed Corrie as her mother. It had always been Corrie and Roy, but from this point forward they\u2019d be Mom and Dad.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Corrie said, slowly releasing her breath. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s still pretty new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes...does the father know?\u201d</p><p>Gloria shook her head. \u201cNo. And I\u2019m not going to tell him.\u201d She\u2019d already made that decision and it was one she meant to keep.</p><p>Corrie studied her for several seconds before she spoke. \u201cI just told you how upset your father was that I withheld the information from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But in my case I feel this is the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time I did, too,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cMom, please support me in this.\u201d</p><p>Again, Corrie hesitated and then nodded. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to raise my baby\u2014at least, that\u2019s my thought for now. I might have a change of heart later, but for right now that\u2019s my plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father and I will support whatever decision you make,\u201d Corrie said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She\u2019d been certain her mother would say that but was grateful to hear it.</p><p>\u201cLinnette\u2019s pregnant, too, so Roy and I are going to become grandparents twice within a twelve-month period.\u201d Corrie\u2019s face beamed with joy and anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI should tell...Dad.\u201d Gloria drank the rest of her tea, then went into the other room.</p><p>Roy\u2019s computer was set up in a small alcove there, and Gloria saw that he was checking stock prices. When he sensed her presence, he turned to look up at her. \u201cDid you and your mother have a good talk?\u201d</p><p>Gloria nodded, swallowing hard. Telling her father about the baby was even more difficult than she\u2019d expected. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you a grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand,\u201d Roy said. He cleared his throat. \u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first, his meaning wasn\u2019t clear, and then Gloria understood that he was asking if she wanted him to confront the baby\u2019s father. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure.\u201d</p><p>He returned to the computer screen. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of years since we\u2019ve had babies in this family,\u201d she heard him say. \u201cHigh time we did again.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>\u201cI think taking your parents to dinner is a lovely idea,\u201d Mary Jo said as she slid into the booth across from Mack at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove. They\u2019d arrived first and been seated.</p><p>Linc and Lori had agreed to watch Noelle for the evening. The baby, familiar with her aunt and uncle, had gone to them without a fuss.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who said we should tell them about the engagement over dinner?\u201d Mack smiled. He picked up the wine list and began to study it while Mary Jo read over the menu.</p><p>\u201cWhen I suggested dinner, I assumed I\u2019d cook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is a celebration,\u201d Mack said. He reached for her left hand, and she flexed her fingers, showing off her diamond ring. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to have to do all that extra work.\u201d</p><p>This man who would soon be her husband was considerate, thoughtful, loving. As it stood now, Mary Jo wasn\u2019t sure what they were going to do regarding David. His presence in their lives hung over them like a storm cloud. Either it would eventually blow past or it would rain down upon them in torrents. Mary Jo was braced for whatever happened, whatever the future held. One thing was certain; she wouldn\u2019t allow David to take Noelle away from her. Mack wouldn\u2019t, either. They\u2019d stand side by side and face any threat from David together.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Mom now,\u201d Mack said. He stood to greet his mother as the hostess escorted her to their booth.</p><p>Corrie kissed her son\u2019s cheek and smiled down at Mary Jo, who held her left hand under the table, in her lap. \u201cRoy\u2019s parking the car. We got caught in traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraffic?\u201d Mack repeated with a laugh. \u201cYou could walk to the restaurant.\u201d The McAfee family home was up the hill, only five or six blocks from the waterfront.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Corrie admitted, \u201chowever, we did drive and we had to wait at the stoplight.\u201d</p> <p>Mack shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away from Seattle too long.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s mother smiled as she pulled a menu toward her.</p><p>Mary Jo had already chosen her meal. The fresh Alaskan halibut, steamed and then topped with shrimp, cheese and a dollop of sour cream sounded delicious. Her brothers had always been meat-and-potatoes people and she rarely cooked fish. Now that she was living on her own, she took every opportunity to sample the bounty of the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Roy joined them, sitting in the booth next to Mack. \u201cSorry we\u2019re late,\u201d he said.</p><p>They weren\u2019t, not really. Well, maybe a minute or two. Mack got his promptness from his family, Mary Jo thought. This was another admirable trait he shared with his parents.</p><p>\u201cRoy,\u201d Corrie said, glancing up from her menu, \u201con your way in, did you notice that the special of the day is oysters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh from Hood Canal,\u201d Mack added. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m having.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t bother to pick up his menu. \u201cSounds good to me, too.\u201d</p> <p>Corrie continued to study the offerings. \u201cEverything looks so wonderful, it\u2019s hard to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Roy said, \u201cI\u2019d like to say this dinner invitation is a pleasant surprise. It isn\u2019t every day one of our children treats us to a meal out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a very good reason,\u201d Mack said, smiling tenderly at Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cI suspected as much.\u201d Roy leaned back in his seat and crossed his arms. \u201cYou want my help, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d Mary Jo asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWith Jacob Dennison\u2019s letters. I talked to Mack about it the other day and he said the two of you have hit a dead end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Mary Jo began, \u201cbut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Dad,\u201d Mack said, gently cutting off Mary Jo\u2019s response. \u201cWe could definitely use some help with that if you have the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like nothing better than solving a good mystery.\u201d He sent his wife a smug glance as he spoke.</p><p>Corrie sighed and directed her question to Mack. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason you asked us to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d He was about to explain when the waiter came for their drink order.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019re all having fish,\u201d Roy said. \u201cSo I suggest a white wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a bottle of your best champagne,\u201d Mack told the waiter, ignoring his father\u2019s advice. \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day a man gets engaged.\u201d</p><p>At his announcement, Corrie nearly flew out of her seat. \u201cI knew it! I just knew it.\u201d Grinning, Mary Jo raised her left hand, and Corrie shrieked with delight. \u201cOh, Mack, I\u2019m thrilled. And the ring\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She took Mary Jo by the shoulders and hugged her close. \u201cThis is absolutely perfect. One day we\u2019re longing to be grandparents and then suddenly we discover we\u2019re going to have three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d Mack said, looking bewildered. \u201cIs Linnette having twins?\u201d</p><p>Roy, as usual, got straight to the point. \u201cIt\u2019s Gloria,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d Mack repeated, frowning. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know she was seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t, either,\u201d Corrie told him. \u201cWe only just heard the news ourselves.... I probably should\u2019ve let her tell you herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you said something,\u201d Mack said, concern in his voice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to you and Mary Jo,\u201d Corrie said eagerly. \u201cHave you set a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>\u201cBut soon,\u201d Mack insisted.</p><p>She nodded as they locked eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking August,\u201d Mack said next.</p><p>\u201cAugust?\u201d Mary Jo and Corrie chimed in simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cMack,\u201d Corrie said, pressing her hand over her heart. \u201cThat\u2019s next month!\u201d</p><p>Mack looked from his mother to Mary Jo. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t know how to answer. \u201cI... We haven\u2019t discussed what kind of wedding we\u2019re going to have.\u201d Between Mack\u2019s schedule and her own, they hadn\u2019t had time to go over the details of their engagement. Nor had they given any thought at all to the wedding itself or a honeymoon or anything else.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a church wedding?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mary Jo answered.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d was Mack\u2019s reply.</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d Mary Jo muttered, and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Mack said, recovering quickly, \u201cI definitely want a church wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a reception?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo and Mack both nodded.</p><p>\u201cWould you two want a dinner with the reception?\u201d Corrie asked.</p><p>Mary Jo hadn\u2019t considered that. It sounded more expensive than they\u2019d be able to afford. \u201cWould a cake, maybe some mixed nuts and those colorful mints be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Corrie assured her.</p><p>\u201cIf Mary Jo wants a dinner, that\u2019s okay by me,\u201d Mack said decisively.</p><p>Corrie smiled at her son. \u201cServing a dinner might mean postponing the wedding by a month or two,\u201d she explained. \u201cThese things take time and planning.\u201d</p><p>Mack shook his head. \u201cThen we can do without the meal.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo couldn\u2019t hold back a laugh. Mack\u2019s eagerness to marry her was endearing\u2014and it also sent a chill of excitement through her. Excitement about the days and nights ahead....</p><p>The champagne arrived and they ordered their meals. Once their flutes were filled, Roy offered a lovely toast. Mack\u2019s normally succinct father was downright lyrical and his kind words brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>For most of the meal they discussed wedding plans, to the point that Mary Jo\u2019s head started to spin. She\u2019d only drunk half a glass of champagne or she might\u2019ve thought the alcohol was affecting her.</p><p>Watching Mack with his parents, seeing how close he was to Linnette, she recognized once again that this was a man she could trust. Mack had been brought up with the same values she had. Knowing Ben, she realized David had been raised that way, too, but at some point, years before, he\u2019d abandoned those values for his own selfish purposes.</p><p>Their dinners were served and Mary Jo\u2019s halibut was every bit as good as she\u2019d imagined. Better. Perhaps it was because of the occasion; she couldn\u2019t tell. Mack\u2019s family had welcomed her, accepting her and Noelle without question, without voicing a single doubt. How fortunate she was to marry into a family like this!</p><p>As they ordered coffee, Mack returned to the subject of the letters. \u201cDad, you mentioned Jacob Dennison when you first got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Your mother and I had a small wager going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won,\u201d Corrie said, looking pleased with herself. \u201cYour father assumed your dinner invitation had to do with those letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother assumed it was because you two had something important to tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich they did,\u201d Corrie stated gleefully.</p><p>\u201cI would like to remind you,\u201d Roy said with a comical scowl, \u201cthat you made the same assumption once before and you were totally off base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Corrie nodded. \u201cI was then, but I\u2019m not now.\u201d</p><p>Mack held up his hand. \u201cThe thing is, Mary Jo and I ran into a problem in our research. So we kind of dropped it for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating, learning about World War II,\u201d she told them. \u201cMack and I rented the movie The Longest Day and we found out even more about the Normandy invasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob was part of the 101st Airborne unit that dropped in behind enemy lines,\u201d Mack reminded them.</p><p>\u201cOne group missed their target and landed right inside Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise, only to be mowed down by the Germans,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d She\u2019d hardly been able to watch the scene, especially since the man who\u2019d written those beautiful letters might well have been one of the young soldiers who\u2019d lost his life there.</p><p>\u201cI believe the group you mean was the 82nd Airborne,\u201d Mack inserted.</p><p>\u201cI saw that movie, too,\u201d Roy said. \u201cYears ago.\u201d He rubbed the side of his face. \u201cDidn\u2019t the men who parachuted in have a clicking device?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mack confirmed, \u201cthe clickers were handed out so the men could find one another. They were to click once and those replying were to click twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey dropped dummies in parachutes, too,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThey exploded on impact and confused the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting back to the letters... What stumps us is the fact that they stop after that one in early June 1944,\u201d Mary Jo said. For her own satisfaction if nothing else, she wanted to learn his fate, even if he\u2019d been killed. All they knew was that he hadn\u2019t been listed among those buried in France or among the known dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure Jacob\u2019s his actual first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how he signs all his letters,\u201d Mack said. \u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack,\u201d Mary Jo broke in softly.</p><p>He glanced at her.</p> <p>\u201cIf you wrote me, you\u2019d sign your letters \u2018Mack,\u2019 right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your given name is Jerome.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. There were other Dennisons included on the website.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back and check,\u201d Mary Jo said excitedly.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another possibility,\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mary Jo wished now that they\u2019d taken this to Roy earlier. Talking to him had given them a new approach. If they found Jacob, if he was still alive or even if he wasn\u2019t but had family, they might also be able to learn Joan\u2019s fate.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your idea?\u201d Mack asked his father.</p><p>\u201cYou said he isn\u2019t listed among those who were killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we know of,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>Mary Jo felt it was important to add, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find a list of the wounded, though\u2014so he might\u2019ve been injured and shipped home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we discounted that,\u201d Mack said. \u201cIf he was injured, he still would\u2019ve had a way of getting in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mary Jo nodded. \u201cIf he was injured, he could\u2019ve written eventually or had someone write for him.\u201d Mary Jo was convinced that if Jacob had been capable of it, he would\u2019ve found a way to tell Joan he\u2019d survived.</p><p>\u201cHe might have been captured,\u201d Roy suggested.</p><p>\u201cCaptured,\u201d Mack echoed. \u201cYou mean taken as a prisoner of war? We didn\u2019t even consider that.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo stared at Roy, stunned. How could they have overlooked such an obvious possibility?</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll be doing some more research. You\u2019ve certainly given us something to think about,\u201d Mack said. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Corrie told him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a long time before I let your father live down the fact that I was right.\u201d She gleefully rubbed her palms together. \u201cWe\u2019re going to love having you and Noelle as part of our family, Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>And Mary Jo was going to love being a McAfee, too.</p> <p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Bellamy Towers. Linc stared up at the four-story building in Bremerton, feeling his mouth go dry. He\u2019d got the address of his father-in-law\u2019s office out of the telephone directory but he\u2019d only had the street name and number. He was shocked to discover that Bellamy obviously owned the whole complex. He knew from visiting the family home that Lori came from money; what astonished him was how much.</p><p>He needed to speak to his father-in-law. Pacing back and forth in the parking lot, Linc realized that in his present frame of mind he\u2019d make a mess of this. He was too angry to think logically or speak calmly. Linc had a temper, which he tended to fire off quickly; with enough provocation he\u2019d say something he couldn\u2019t take back. This conversation was too important to be ruled by emotion. He needed a clear head and cool reason.</p><p>Just as he was finally ready to enter the building, out came Leonard Bellamy. The other man frowned when he saw Linc. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Bellamy demanded.</p><p>Linc bit back a sarcastic reply. He felt like telling Lori\u2019s father that he was in the area and thought they could go for a beer together. Instead, he spoke in as polite a tone as he could manage. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you for a couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d Bellamy attempted to step around him.</p><p>Linc blocked his move. \u201cUnfortunately, I have a lot of time on my hands and my guess is you know why.\u201d The man had set out to ruin his business and had just about succeeded. Linc couldn\u2019t hang on much longer. He\u2019d been able to find out that Bellamy had told certain influential people in Cedar Cove and adjoining communities that Linc was a gold digger who\u2019d married his daughter for her money. Bellamy had also tried to thwart him by delaying his license application. When that didn\u2019t shut Linc down, he\u2019d apparently spread false rumors. Not that Linc could prove it, but there\u2019d been hints. Mack McAfee had made a point of telling him that he\u2019d heard Bellamy was \u201cout to get\u201d him.</p><p>Linc had spoken to his attorney, who said there was basically nothing to be done. He could file a suit for slander or for restraint of trade but Linc would rather end this than take his father-in-law to court\u2014especially with a weak, hearsay case.</p><p>Long before he\u2019d set up his shop he\u2019d done extensive research on the area. Only because he felt he could make a go of it had he decided to branch out into Cedar Cove; otherwise, he would\u2019ve continued his commute into Seattle. Based on his findings, he\u2019d obtained a loan from a local bank to cover his start-up costs and he\u2019d drawn on his savings, sinking most of the money into remodeling the garage.</p><p>As part of his research, Linc had gone to visit various local insurance claim adjusters. These were the people who generally sent work his way. He\u2019d talked to a number of them before he\u2019d made his decision to move. Every one of them had assured him there was a need for his business.</p><p>When the promised work didn\u2019t come, Linc went to see them all again. On his second series of visits Linc found his reception much cooler. The adjusters had no work to send him and weren\u2019t interested in receiving his bids. When he dug deeper, Linc learned that Bellamy was good friends with someone high up in the state insurance commissioner\u2019s office. Linc couldn\u2019t prove that Bellamy had used their friendship to influence the adjusters but it all added up.</p><p>He\u2019d purchased a garage that had sat in disrepair for several years, cleaned it up and remodeled it. Then he\u2019d hired two employees. Now these employees were twiddling their thumbs while Linc paid their wages from his dwindling reserves. Another month like the last one, and he\u2019d have no choice but to close his doors.</p><p>\u201cI said I don\u2019t have time, nor do I have the desire to speak with you,\u201d Bellamy said in a tone few would question. \u201cNow kindly step aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spreading lies about me in the community.\u201d Bellamy\u2019s attitude made Linc reconsider the advisability of taking him to court. But the idea went in and out of his mind in seconds. Much as he disliked Bellamy, the man was Lori\u2019s father. Linc refused to jeopardize that relationship\u2014or at least jeopardize it any more than Bellamy already had himself.</p><p>\u201cWe can make this all go away,\u201d Bellamy said, his mood suddenly more affable. \u201cWith a snap of my fingers, I can set things straight for you.\u201d</p><p>Linc hesitated. The man had essentially confirmed everything he\u2019d suspected. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Lori?\u201d Linc couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you out, make all the trouble you went to in getting that garage set up worth your while. All I ask is that you walk away from my daughter and don\u2019t look back.\u201d</p><p>How friendly he sounded. How cordial. Linc\u2019s financial difficulties would disappear if he abandoned his wife.</p><p>Linc stared at him, still unable to believe that even Bellamy would suggest such a thing.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re late with last month\u2019s payment to the bank.\u201d</p><p>The only way Bellamy would know that was if someone from the bank had fed him the information.</p><p>\u201cYou made a mistake when you married my daughter.\u201d His tone grew threatening again. \u201cYou saw her as an easy target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her as the most incredible woman I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Linc countered. He meant it\u2014meant it with everything in him.</p><p>Bellamy snickered. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you married her...what, two weeks after you met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d After meeting Lori\u2019s mother, Linc felt he should have insisted to Lori that they wait. In their haste to get married, Linc had planted the seeds of suspicion within her family. In retrospect he would\u2019ve preferred to meet her parents first and give them the opportunity to know him. Bellamy might still have objected, but at least Linc would\u2019ve made the effort. At least he would\u2019ve created the beginnings of a relationship.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still time to fix this,\u201d Bellamy said.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave Lori?\u201d He shook his head as he said the words.</p><p>\u201cDivorce her.\u201d</p><p>The words hit him with such force, Linc stumbled back two steps. \u201cI realize I was wrong. I should\u2019ve come and talked to you first before marrying Lori. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Red-faced, Bellamy leaned closer and when he spoke it was through gritted teeth. \u201cWhere you were wrong, young man, was in thinking you could get to me through my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to you?\u201d The man seemed to assume the entire world revolved around him and his bank account. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know who you were.\u201d Bellamy started to scoff but Linc talked right over him. \u201cI married Lori because I\u2019m in love with her. As for leaving her, I\u2019d rather die first.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy laughed in his face. \u201cWe both know my daughter\u2019s incapable of making a decent decision. She\u2019s an empty-headed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Linc had heard enough. He grabbed Bellamy by his fancy suit lapels and jerked him forward. \u201cDon\u2019t ever speak about my wife like that again,\u201d he snapped. \u201cLori has brains and integrity, and if you don\u2019t see that in her, I pity you.\u201d He abruptly released the other man.</p><p>Bellamy straightened his sleeves and glared at Linc. \u201cI could have you arrested for assault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d If the man was determined to ruin him, he might as well do a thorough job.</p><p>\u201cYou stay married to my daughter and I\u2019m cutting her out of my will. I swear to you that you won\u2019t get a penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019ll believe me, but I have no interest in your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s your problem.\u201d Linc figured he might as well leave now, while his dignity was relatively intact.</p><p>When he returned to the garage, he saw that both employees were lounging around, idly entertaining themselves. One was working on a sudoku puzzle and the other was tossing cards into an empty coffee tin. Linc sent them both home.</p><p>An hour later, after he\u2019d sorted through the bills that were stacked on his desk, he hung his head in abject frustration. He wouldn\u2019t be able to make this month\u2019s payment to the bank, either.</p><p>Unless something changed fast, Linc was about to go belly-up. He knew he had the option of filing for bankruptcy, but he refused to consider it. No matter what happened, he wouldn\u2019t take the easy way out, wouldn\u2019t walk away from his debts. He was the one who\u2019d taken the financial gamble; he\u2019d pay the price.</p><p>With his elbows propped on his desk, he shoved the hair away from his face. It was time to go home to Lori. At five-thirty, he posted the closed sign on the door.</p><p>Shoring up his resolve, Linc sat in his truck for several minutes before he headed into the ground-floor apartment. As much as possible he tried not to inflict his worries on Lori. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he walked in, the aroma of simmering barbecue sauce tickled his nostrils.</p><p>\u201cLori?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, honey, I\u2019m out back.\u201d</p><p>Linc followed her voice and found her dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, standing over their barbecue grill on the small patio. He kissed her the way he always did, and the instant his mouth settled over hers, Linc\u2019s worries fled. He held her tight against him, enjoying the feel of her body so close to his. Give up Lori? Walk away from the most precious gift he\u2019d ever received? Bellamy was out of his mind, and if Linc had the chance, he\u2019d tell him that.</p> <p>Thirty</p><p>Tanni knew from the nervous, excited way her mother was acting that Larry Knight must be arriving any minute. They had a Friday-afternoon date, and Shirley had spent the past hour getting ready.</p><p>Watching the changes in her mother since she\u2019d met Larry had been interesting. Tanni used to wonder how she\u2019d feel if her mother became involved with another man. It seemed weird to think of Shirley falling in love with someone other than Tanni\u2019s dad. What surprised her was that she was all right with it. That might not have been the case if it was anyone other than Larry. He was special, and Tanni understood why her mother had fallen for him. Besides being a fabulous artist, Larry was thoughtful, generous and just plain nice. Not only was he responsible for helping Shaw get into art school, but he\u2019d brought the spark back to her mother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>In the past few weeks, her mother and Larry had been on the phone practically every day, and these weren\u2019t short conversations. One night they talked for three hours straight. Tanni knew because she kept track of the time. She\u2019d taken delight in teasing her mother. Even more fun was seeing the flush that crept over her cheekbones. Shirley had it bad. This Tanni recognized because she\u2019d once had those same intense feelings for Shaw. Not anymore, though.</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d Shirley asked. She wore pale linen pants and a white top with a teal-and-lime-green scarf. She\u2019d thrown a linen jacket over the whole ensemble.</p> <p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d Tanni wasn\u2019t just saying that. Her mother had been paying far more attention to her hair and makeup since she\u2019d started dating Larry. Even when all they did was talk on the phone, her mother\u2019s hair was brushed, her makeup applied and she was neatly dressed. She\u2019d stopped wearing old jeans and her father\u2019s too-large sweatshirts around the house. It was as if she thought Larry might drop in unannounced at any second. Tanni found that amusing but remembered she\u2019d been the same way when she first met Shaw, too.</p><p>Shaw... She didn\u2019t want to think about him. It was over. She hadn\u2019t heard from him in more than two weeks, but the choice had been hers. She\u2019d decided to cut off the relationship. That had been painful, but as Kristen had assured her, it was the right thing to do. Tanni had taken control. Rather than let him ignore her, she\u2019d quit playing the game.</p><p>Shirley tugged at her jacket sleeves. \u201cMiranda insisted I wear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda has such a good eye for color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Tanni said, surprised her mother lacked confidence in her own sense of style. Shirley worked with fabric and color all the time, so no one, in Tanni\u2019s opinion, had a better eye than she did.</p> <p>Shirley thanked her with a brief smile, then glanced at her watch.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Larry due?\u201d Tanni asked.</p><p>\u201cAround one.\u201d She set her purse by the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he taking you for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d She grew flustered. \u201cHow silly of me.\u201d</p><p>Tanni couldn\u2019t resist rolling her eyes. \u201cWas I this dopey after I met Shaw?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d her mother said wryly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d</p> <p>They exchanged a smile. She felt relieved to be on good terms with her mother again. The change had come about gradually over the past few months, ever since Shaw had moved to San Francisco. They used to be at odds with each other all the time, and now they weren\u2019t. \u201cDo you have plans this afternoon?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>Tanni shrugged. \u201cJeremy might come over. Kristen, too.\u201d If anyone had told Tanni she\u2019d become friends with the girl she despised most, she would\u2019ve fallen down laughing.</p><p>As little as a month ago, Tanni could barely stand to be in the same room with her. These days they hung around, went places together and talked nearly every day.</p><p>Kristen had been such a help with the whole Shaw situation. She\u2019d broken off a number of relationships herself and said it was best just to be done with it. If Shaw was sending Tanni all the signals that he wanted their relationship to end\u2014and he was\u2014then Kristen said she should make it easy on him. So Tanni had.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy on her, though. When she called Shaw to tell him, he seemed shocked. Kristen said that was to be expected, too. Guys might want to end the relationship, but then they had a change of heart as soon as the girl took the initiative. At first, Tanni had thought her friend was exaggerating, but everything Kristen had said would happen did.</p><p>Almost immediately after she broke up with him, Shaw started texting her five or six times a day. After weeks of driving Tanni insane by disregarding her messages, he suddenly wanted to be in contact. She gained a perverse satisfaction from ignoring him. But that only encouraged him to text more often. He\u2019d even tried to phone. She\u2019d had to force herself not to answer, but managed to hold firm. Kristen praised her for being in control. It felt good, she felt good, and she was determined never to let anyone treat her emotions so lightly again.</p><p>As a bonus Kristen had introduced Tanni to her neighbor Jeremy Reynolds and they\u2019d met several times. He was very different from Shaw. Knowing that Jeremy was interested in her made the fact that Shaw was out of her life a lot more tolerable.</p><p>The doorbell rang and her mother rushed into the living room. Tanni followed her, wanting to greet Larry and hear about their plans so she\u2019d know when her mother would be home. That was a role reversal if ever there was one.</p><p>Halfway into the room, Tanni froze. Larry Knight was at the door, but he wasn\u2019t alone. Shaw was with him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tanni,\u201d Shaw said as he sauntered into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She made it clear that she didn\u2019t appreciate his unexpected arrival. If she\u2019d known Shaw was coming, she could have mentally prepared herself for the confrontation. She would\u2019ve liked to discuss this with Kristen first and gotten her advice.</p><p>\u201cTanni.\u201d Her mother said her name softly, reminding her of her manners.</p><p>\u201cHello, Shaw,\u201d she said with less of an edge.</p><p>Larry had his arm around her mother\u2019s waist. \u201cTanni, I brought Shaw along as a surprise.\u201d He gave Shaw a skeptical look. \u201cI was led to believe you\u2019d welcome a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so thoughtful,\u201d Shirley said, smiling at him.</p><p>Larry\u2019s expression indicated he was no longer so sure of that. \u201cWould you rather I dropped Shaw off at his family\u2019s place?\u201d He spoke directly to Tanni.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tanni,\u201d Shaw pleaded. \u201cI just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>Larry regarded each one in turn. \u201cIs that what you want, Tanni?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem any too pleased with Shaw, which was all right with her.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d she said.</p><p>Still, Larry hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d like to take your mother to lunch here in Cedar Cove, and then we thought we\u2019d stop off at the art gallery,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be gone more than a couple of hours. Would that suit you?\u201d Again, he looked at Tanni.</p><p>She shrugged, letting that be her response. She wanted Shaw to realize that her feelings about him were lukewarm at best.</p><p>Larry and her mother left and then Tanni was alone with Shaw. At one time she would have welcomed the privacy. That wasn\u2019t true anymore.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked. He made himself at home on the sofa, crossing his legs and stretching his arm across the back.</p><p>Tanni sat on the other side of the living room, as far from him as possible. He looked different, but then so did she. With subtle suggestions from Kristen, Tanni had changed her wardrobe. She\u2019d stopped wearing all black and added color here and there. Today she had on regular jeans and a pink T-shirt. She\u2019d changed her hairstyle, too; now she wore it shorter and parted on the side. Again, she had Kristen to thank for that. Kristen had good instincts about style and together they\u2019d found a new, more flattering look for Tanni.</p><p>Her mother liked her new hairstyle, too, although she seemed reluctant to say much. That was understandable.</p><p>For a long time after her father died, Tanni didn\u2019t want her mother to comment on anything to do with what she wore or how she looked. That wasn\u2019t the case now; their relationship was a lot more comfortable these days, a lot closer. Tanni wasn\u2019t sure what, exactly, was different but she suspected it had more to do with her than with her mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going,\u201d she said flippantly, answering his question.</p><p>Shaw shifted his position and leaned forward. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said curtly. When they\u2019d first started going out, Shaw used to wear dark clothes, the same as her. He had on blue jeans and an artsy T-shirt now.</p><p>\u201cSchool\u2019s going really well,\u201d he said, and seemed to want her to comment.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tanni, if you\u2019re mad, fine, but get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d Okay, so that wasn\u2019t entirely true. But Kristen had helped her cope with those negative feelings. They\u2019d talked at length about how to end a relationship properly, and Tanni had absorbed every word.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not mad, then why aren\u2019t you talking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I do. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the impression he\u2019d given her after he got to San Francisco. He\u2019d made it seem as if he was far too busy to bother with her. She could remind him of the grief and frustration he\u2019d caused her, but then decided that was exactly what she shouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be in town?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here over the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll give you time to see your friends,\u201d she said, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cThe only person I want to see is you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>\u201cAnd Will Jefferson,\u201d Shaw added. \u201cI want to thank him. I owe him big-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my mother?\u201d she asked, unable to disguise her irritation. Shirley had been just as instrumental in getting Shaw into art school as Will Jefferson and Larry Knight. Her mother was the one who\u2019d put everything in motion.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Shaw was quick to make amends. \u201cI\u2019d never have made it into art school if it hadn\u2019t been for your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are things with your family?\u201d she asked after an awkward pause. From the very beginning, Shaw\u2019s father had been against his becoming an artist. He\u2019d wanted Shaw to attend law school. It\u2019d taken real courage for Shaw to stand up to his father and live his own life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Shaw said. He seemed pleased to be able to say it. \u201cMom\u2019s proud of the fact that I\u2019m attending on a full scholarship, and Dad\u2019s actually coming around. I\u2019ve emailed them some of my work and I keep in touch. I\u2019ll be with the family tonight for this big dinner Mom\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p><p>Tanni thought that was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to drop by Will Jefferson\u2019s place with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Apparently Shaw could tell that she wouldn\u2019t be having any cozy chats with him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any other plans for a while,\u201d Tanni said, keeping her voice casual. \u201cI can drive.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cWhen did you get your license?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d texted him the day she\u2019d passed her driver\u2019s test. Obviously he hadn\u2019t taken the trouble to read it. Rather than berate him, or remind him that he should know, she shrugged. \u201cA while back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s great that you\u2019ve got wheels,\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>Again, she pretended it was no big deal, but in actuality her whole life had undergone a transformation. Now that she had her license, she felt a new sense of freedom and independence. She felt like an adult.</p> <p>They left the house, and during the short drive to the gallery, Shaw dominated the conversation, acting as if hardly anything had changed between them. He was animated, telling her tale after tale of friends he\u2019d made in art school. He didn\u2019t seem to notice that she said almost nothing.</p><p>He avoided mentioning any of the girls he\u2019d met, although Tanni knew he hung around with several. One name in particular stood out\u2014Mallory, Marcie...something like that. Tanni briefly considered bringing up Jeremy, but decided against it.</p><p>Tanni parked down the street from the gallery. The place looked attractive; Will Jefferson had done some work recently, refreshing the outside with a coat of white paint and arranging large baskets of red geraniums in front. He\u2019d redesigned the inside earlier, with new display cases and glass enclosures. Will had put a lot of money into the renovation, and it showed.</p><p>When they walked into the gallery, Shaw\u2019s eyes went immediately to the wall where her mother\u2019s dragon quilt was displayed. There was no denying that \u201cDeath\u201d was a masterful piece of work.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t fully appreciated the skill involved in the creation of fabric art, and this piece in particular, until Will Jefferson had hung it on his wall. To Tanni, that dragon breathed life\u2014and death\u2014and spoke of grief, love, passion. It captivated the attention of all who saw it. She knew there\u2019d been numerous offers to buy it but the work wasn\u2019t for sale.</p><p>Will stepped out from his office, and when he saw them, he smiled. \u201cShaw,\u201d he said, holding out his hand as he advanced toward them. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Mr. Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands and then Will turned to Tanni. \u201cGreat to see you, too.\u201d He looked around as though he expected her mother to be with them.</p><p>Tanni smiled and out of the corner of her eye she caught a movement. Someone else was in the gallery.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tanni,\u201d Miranda Sullivan greeted her, emerging from the back room a moment later. \u201cWhat\u2019s your mother up to this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Larry.\u201d</p><p>Will Jefferson stiffened noticeably. \u201cLarry Knight\u2019s in town?\u201d he asked, and he didn\u2019t sound pleased to hear it.</p><p>\u201cI flew in with him,\u201d Shaw told them. \u201cIt was a chance to reconnect with friends,\u201d he said pointedly, glancing in Tanni\u2019s direction. \u201cI wanted to see you, too, so you\u2019d know your faith in me was justified. If you speak to Larry, he\u2019ll tell you I\u2019ve done well in each of my classes so far.\u201d</p><p>Will hardly seemed to hear him. \u201cHas your mother been seeing a lot of Larry?\u201d he asked Tanni.</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond and looked to Miranda for help. As her mother\u2019s friend, Miranda had encouraged the relationship with Larry\u2014not that her mother needed much encouragement.</p><p>\u201cLarry and Shirley are grateful for your introduction, Will,\u201d Miranda said smoothly, coming toward them. \u201cThey have a great deal in common, you know.\u201d</p><p>Will frowned. \u201cReally.\u201d The comment was more sarcasm than affirmation.</p><p>\u201cI believe they might be stopping in later,\u201d Miranda added.</p><p>Tanni recalled that Larry had said something about that.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cLarry wants to see the red dragon piece.\u201d</p><p>Tanni hadn\u2019t heard that, but it made sense. Larry had only seen photographs of the massive fabric hanging, which had been featured in several newspaper and magazine articles. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem, is it?\u201d she asked Will.</p><p>\u201cNot for me, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Will muttered. He turned to Miranda as though he thought she could supply more information.</p><p>Shaw had apparently become aware of the tension in the room. Moving closer to Will, he said, \u201cI want to let you know again how much I appreciate what you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded absently.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cShaw just thanked you.\u201d</p><p>He broke out of his stupor. \u201cRight. My pleasure,\u201d he said without emotion. \u201cStop in anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Shaw returned, looking puzzled.</p><p>It seemed they were being dismissed; Will Jefferson all but hustled them out the door. Tanni met Miranda\u2019s eye and the other woman shrugged as if to say she didn\u2019t understand it, either. One thing was clear. Will Jefferson didn\u2019t like the fact that Tanni\u2019s mother was seeing Larry Knight.</p><p>Tanni smiled inwardly as she headed toward the parked car, with Shaw behind her. If Mr. Jefferson needed help getting over her mother, maybe Tanni would suggest he talk to Kristen.</p><p>\u201cWell...nice seeing you again,\u201d she told Shaw when they reached the car.</p><p>\u201cWe...we aren\u2019t going back to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry. I\u2019m meeting up with a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The word was weighted with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cJeremy and I have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy?\u201d Shock reverberated in his voice as he repeated the other boy\u2019s name.</p><p>Tanni grinned. \u201cOh, honestly, Shaw, you didn\u2019t think you were the only guy in my life, did you?\u201d</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>\u201cCan you talk?\u201d Mack asked urgently.</p><p>Placing one hand over the receiver, Mary Jo glanced toward her boss\u2019s office. Allan was with a client, and the meeting would probably go on for a while.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a few minutes.\u201d She rarely took personal calls at work. The fact that Mack had phoned her meant it was important. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d He paused. \u201cI just finished talking to my dad and he wants to see us right after work.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo waited. \u201cDid he find out anything?\u201d she prodded. \u201cAbout Jacob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo was too excited to sit still. \u201cI knew we made the right decision when we asked him for help.\u201d They\u2019d tried to track down Jacob Dennison on their own. Roy, however, was the one with experience. People hired him to do this; he was the expert and they were amateurs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at the house after work, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get Noelle before we go over to your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get her? That\u2019ll save time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll phone Kelly and let her know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the afternoon dragged by. Mary Jo didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been more anxious for a workday to end. At precisely five, she leaped out of her seat like a jack-in-the-box and reached for her purse.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning, Mr. Harris,\u201d she called out.</p><p>Her boss came to the doorway between their two offices. \u201cYou seem to be in a hurry this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Mack\u2019s father might have some information about that World War II soldier I mentioned a while back. Roy offered to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Update me when you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d she promised. True, it might be another dead end, but she had a feeling there was more.</p><p>Mack was in his truck, waiting for her, as she pulled into the driveway at home.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Noelle?\u201d she asked immediately.</p><p>\u201cMom has her. She claims she needs grandma practice. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Actually, she was touched that Corrie wanted to spend time with Noelle.</p><p>They rode in silence for a couple of blocks. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mack grinned. \u201cYes, what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mack, I can hardly stand it. Did your father tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he just said he\u2019d uncovered some information he thought we\u2019d want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he happy? Sad? Did his tone of voice give anything away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. But that\u2019s my dad. Always keeps his cards close to his chest.\u201d Mack parked in front of the office. Mary Jo jumped out, not waiting for him to open her door or give her his hand. He met her on the sidewalk. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-o-oh, yes. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d he said, and held open the door.</p><p>Mary Jo entered the investigator\u2019s office and glanced curiously around. She\u2019d never been inside before. The reception area had a sofa and a chair, with magazines neatly fanned out on the adjoining end tables. The door leading to Roy\u2019s private office was ajar and he waved them in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got, Dad?\u201d Mack slipped into a visitor\u2019s chair and Mary Jo took the one next to him.</p><p>Roy tipped back his own chair. \u201cThe other night Mary Jo pointed out that Jacob might not be Dennison\u2019s given name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he had another name?\u201d Mary Jo asked breathlessly, leaning forward in her eagerness.</p><p>\u201cNo. His name\u2019s Jacob. That was an excellent theory but it didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Mack warned. \u201cJust tell us what you found.\u201d</p><p>Roy grinned sheepishly. \u201cI was right. He was taken captive by the Germans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a POW?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cApparently Jacob was captured in the first few days after the invasion and sent by train into the heart of Germany.\u201d</p><p>Mack was leaning forward now, too. \u201cDid he survive the war?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded again. \u201cAmazingly, he did.\u201d</p><p>Mack and Mary Jo exchanged glances. Next came the question that burned inside them both.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that...he\u2019s still alive?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The wide grin that broke out across Roy\u2019s face was answer enough. \u201cHe is\u2014alive and kicking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Mack said. He reached for Mary Jo\u2019s hand and squeezed it hard.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he living? Is there any chance we can meet him? I\u2019d love to ask him about Joan. Can we talk to him?\u201d Mary Jo stopped to take a breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wouldn\u2019t have thought Roy\u2019s smile could grow any wider, but it did. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part. I don\u2019t know how to describe this. Call it luck. Call it coincidence. Call it whatever you like, but I think it\u2019s pretty darn close to divine intervention.\u201d</p><p>Mack\u2019s eyebrows gathered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob Dennison is living here. In Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo gasped.</p> <p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d Mack said exultantly.</p><p>Mary Jo couldn\u2019t believe their luck. \u201cHe must be...how old now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMid-eighties for sure, maybe older,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReveille,\u201d Roy told them.</p> <p>\u201cThe veterans\u2019 home on the hill?\u201d All this time Jacob Dennison had been practically under their noses!</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d like to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nearly fell out of her chair. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ve already talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI called their office to be sure I had the right Jacob Dennison. The manager confirmed it and she gave me some useful information. From what she said, he\u2019s only been at Reveille House since March. Before that he lived in Seattle and his three children are still there.\u201d Roy shook his head. \u201cI learned that he\u2019s a widower but I don\u2019t have any details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d Mary Jo was saddened by that. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d It felt as if she\u2019d just learned that a close friend had died.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know about the letters?\u201d Mack asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Roy assured them. \u201cI told the manager, a Ms. Roberts, but she promised not to say a word about that to him. Besides, you two found those letters and the diary. You should be the ones to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should bring them with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mack said, answering for his father. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve wanted to do from the moment we read them.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get them and head up to Reveille now,\u201d Mack told his father.</p><p>\u201cRoy,\u201d Mary Jo said, coming to her feet. \u201cThank you, thank you very, very much.\u201d She walked around the big desk and hugged her soon-to-be father-in-law. He\u2019d managed what she\u2019d thought was impossible\u2014and with apparent ease.</p><p>They stopped at the duplex first, then drove toward Reveille House, a few miles away. The winding road to the facility went up a steep hill that overlooked the cove. The view of Bremerton and the naval shipyard against the backdrop of the Olympic Mountains was breathtaking, but for once Mary Jo barely noticed.</p><p>The receptionist met them, and Mack explained that they were there to see Jacob Dennison. They were asked to wait and paced anxiously in the reception room until the woman reappeared ten long minutes later. \u201cMr. Dennison will be with you shortly,\u201d she said. She led them down the hall to a cozy lounge, fortunately not in use at the moment.</p> <p>There were bookshelves and a fireplace that looked inviting. A piano stood in one corner, while a number of upholstered chairs and a sofa in matching fabric occupied the middle of the room.</p><p>They sat down, Mary Jo perched on the edge of her chair, with the cigar box resting in her lap. It held the diary as well as the letters.</p><p>About five minutes later, a young male attendant wheeled in a white-haired man. \u201cHere we go, Mr. Dennison,\u201d he said cheerfully as he settled the wheelchair between Mack and Mary Jo, then left the room. The elderly man regarded them both with faded blue eyes.</p><p>He looked from Mack to Mary Jo and smiled. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked shakily.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mack answered. \u201cBut we know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve read your letters,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cYour letters to Joan Manry,\u201d Mary Jo added. \u201cFrom the war years.\u201d</p><p>Jacob frowned. \u201cWhere did you find those?\u201d</p><p>Mack moved closer to the end of the sofa. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Mack McAfee and this is my fianc\u00e9e, Mary Jo Wyse. We\u2019re thrilled to meet you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t often I have a beautiful young woman come to visit.\u201d He clasped her hand between both of his. \u201cThat is, unless it\u2019s one of my granddaughters.\u201d He chuckled softly. \u201cNow tell me about those letters. I have to admit you\u2019ve piqued my curiosity. You say they were written during the war years? By me?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo nodded. \u201cMack and I live in a duplex on Evergreen Place in Cedar Cove,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEvergreen Place,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s the house where Joan once lived with her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote Joan letters at that address,\u201d Mack told him. \u201cOnly it isn\u2019t a single house anymore, but a duplex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvergreen Place,\u201d Jacob said again, and it seemed that the address had disappeared from his memory.</p><p>Mary Jo didn\u2019t know where to start, there was so much to tell. \u201cI noticed a loose board in the closet one day. When I went to investigate, I discovered a cigar box full of letters hidden under the floorboards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy letters?\u201d Jacob hardly seemed able to take it in. \u201cFrom the war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With infinite pleasure Mary Jo gave Jacob the box. She placed it on his lap and, as she started to move away, the old man reached for her hand and kissed it. Tears spilled from his eyes; embarrassed, he wiped them away, but his emotion brought tears to her eyes, too.</p><p>\u201cI always wondered where these ended up. Joan never said. She wasn\u2019t close to her sister, and the two of them shared that house. Elaine was jealous of her, I think. At any rate they were estranged until near the end of Elaine\u2019s life, and then Joan went to her and they made their peace.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo was interested to hear this and relieved that the two sisters had finally settled their differences.</p><p>\u201cJoan\u2019s diary was hidden in there, too,\u201d Mack told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Joan?\u201d Mary Jo asked, anxious now for more of the details. \u201cWe know she died, but...\u201d</p><p>Jacob opened the box and reverently pulled out the diary. \u201cAfter the liberation of Europe, Joan and I were married.\u201d Jacob looked up from the treasure in his hands and shook his head sadly. \u201cShe died far too young. She was seventy-one. We had three children, a boy and two girls. Mark, Margaret and Marianne....\u201d He paused as the reminiscence, the grief, overcame him. He withdrew a handkerchief from his shirt pocket and dabbed at his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell us about your experiences on D-day?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell. I was one of the fortunate ones. I was herded, along with other Americans, onto a train. It took us to a POW camp in central Germany, where I spent the rest of the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat couldn\u2019t have been an easy time.\u201d</p><p>Jacob sighed. \u201cWar is never easy, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you released?\u201d Mary Jo asked. His imprisonment was clearly a painful memory he\u2019d rather not discuss.</p><p>\u201cMay 1945. American paratroopers dropped onto the field outside the prison camp,\u201d he said with a far-off look. \u201cThose of us who\u2019d survived were afraid the German soldiers would kill us rather than expose the conditions under which we\u2019d been held.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t, thank God,\u201d Mary Jo whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. Instead, they threw down their weapons and ran. Many of them were just boys, fighting a war they didn\u2019t want to fight. Like me, all they wanted was to go home to their families.\u201d</p><p>His attitude was one of forgiveness and generosity, which impressed Mary Jo and moved her deeply. \u201cDid Joan know you\u2019d been taken prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Jacob nodded. \u201cNot for several weeks, though. She assumed I was dead. She\u2019d moved back to the family home in Spokane to help with her younger brothers and sisters. Apparently her mother had taken ill and she was needed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before you saw her again?\u201d</p><p>Jacob sat up a bit straighter. \u201cFar longer than I wanted. When I was rescued I weighed less than ninety pounds. The army sent me home in a hospital ship.\u201d He chuckled hoarsely. \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten well much faster if they\u2019d just flown me back to my family. My mother was the best cook in the world.\u201d</p><p>Mack exchanged a smile with Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cAt nights, back in the camp, I used to go to sleep thinking about my mother\u2019s apple pie. The first meal she cooked for me was fried chicken. I ate almost an entire bowl of mashed potatoes by myself.\u201d Again, tears filled his eyes. \u201cThat was one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo could well imagine. \u201cDo you know why Joan hid the letters?\u201d She asked the question that had haunted her all these weeks. Now she might finally learn the answer.</p><p>\u201cNot really, other than the fact that Joan and her sister never got along.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo was disappointed that this part of the mystery would probably never be solved. For whatever reason, Joan\u2019s relationship with her sister was difficult and that was as much of an explanation as they were likely to get.</p><p>\u201cNot only that,\u201d Jacob said, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t keen on me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. She just wasn\u2019t. Felt it was up to her to say what Joan should do and who she could see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about Joan,\u201d Mary Jo said.</p><p>Jacob leaned back in his wheelchair. \u201cShe was a beauty. We met at a soda fountain here in Cedar Cove. I came over from Fort Lewis for a USO dance and stopped at the drugstore. She was working behind the counter and caught my eye. I had a soda and asked if she\u2019d be at the dance. At the time, her sister worked there, too. It was later that they got jobs at the shipyard. Her sister told me to stay away from Joan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you didn\u2019t heed her advice,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cWild horses wouldn\u2019t have kept me away. I was smitten the first time I laid eyes on her.\u201d</p><p>Mack looked at Mary Jo as if to say he understood the feeling.</p><p>\u201cWe met up at the dance and then again the following day. Joan had to sneak away from her sister and they had words afterward. It was too bad that Elaine and I started off on the wrong foot, but honestly, I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve mattered. Elaine wasn\u2019t a happy person. She tried to control Joan and to thwart our romance, not that it did much good.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Mary Jo that maybe Joan hadn\u2019t hidden the letters all at one time but had kept them\u2014and her diary\u2014in the closet to prevent her sister from finding them.</p><p>\u201cHow did Joan die?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>\u201cCancer. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever recover from losing her.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut we had almost fifty years together. And my children are good to me. They visit when they can and the grandchildren, as well.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo could see that the old man was tiring. \u201cWe should go,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get someone to take you back to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay if we stopped by and visited every now and then?\u201d Mack asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be very pleased to see you again.\u201d He clutched the cigar box and the small diary. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for going to the effort of finding me so you could return these letters.\u201d He inhaled softly. \u201cThey\u2019ll mean the world to my children\u2014and to me.\u201d</p><p>Mack stood and so did Mary Jo. Impulsively she bent down and kissed the leathery cheek. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you thanking me?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re the ones who found me and brought me back my letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for writing them, and for showing Mack and me how much we owe the heroes of your generation.\u201d</p> <p>He dismissed her comment with a wave of his hand. \u201cNonsense, I\u2019m no hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI can understand why you\u2019re called the \u2018Greatest Generation\u2019\u2014because you are.\u201d</p><p>The old man looked up at them and smiled. Then, raising his hand to his forehead, he saluted them.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Olivia slipped into the row of seats behind Grace Harding. The wedding of Faith Beckwith and Troy Davis was about to start. The large gazebo outside Justine\u2019s Victorian Tea Room was filled to capacity as so many well-wishers had come to share this special day.</p> <p>No sooner had she sat down than the music swelled and Pastor Flemming came forward. Faith and Troy stood, with their families and friends gathered in a semicircle around them. After a few words from the clergyman, Faith and Troy quietly exchanged their vows. The ceremony, while short, touched Olivia\u2019s heart.</p><p>Jack was obviously moved, too. Her husband clasped her hand and she squeezed back. They\u2019d both come to a fuller appreciation of each other in the past eight months, while she\u2019d battled cancer. Just as Jack\u2019s heart attack several years earlier had showed Olivia how much she loved this man, her cancer had brought him the same realization. These illnesses had made the prospect of loss very real, and they\u2019d both learned to treasure each day together.</p><p>Jack Griffin, the town paper\u2019s new editor, had stormed into Olivia\u2019s life twenty years after her divorce. Now she wondered how she\u2019d lived all those years without him.</p><p>Like Faith and Troy, she and Jack had hit more than a few snags in their relationship. But their marriage was worth every hard lesson in compromise and tolerance. She knew the same would be true for Faith and Troy.</p><p>They\u2019d all attended high school around the same time, and Olivia remembered that Faith and Troy had dated. After graduation they\u2019d gone their separate ways, only to meet again almost forty years later, both widowed by this time. They\u2019d quickly renewed their relationship.</p><p>Now, seeing them look at each other with such love, Olivia couldn\u2019t help feeling this marriage would be as happy as hers and Jack\u2019s.</p> <p>The reception was inside the recently opened restaurant. Troy and Faith stood at the entrance and greeted each of their guests. Faith was beautiful in her soft pink suit, with a bouquet of white rosebuds. Troy had never looked handsomer, wearing a dark suit and pink tie. A white rosebud boutonniere was pinned to his lapel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it,\u201d Faith told Olivia, hugging her. Justine and her staff bustled about, carrying trays of food to the buffet table.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss this for anything,\u201d Olivia said, and it was true.</p><p>Grace and Cliff followed Olivia and Jack as they entered the restaurant. A number of round tables, covered in white linen, were artfully arranged about the room. Each had a pink floral arrangement at its center. A buffet table, set up against the wall, held a tiered wedding cake, with a large silver punch bowl beside it.</p><p>Holding Olivia\u2019s hand, Jack led the way to a centrally located table. Grace and Cliff joined them.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll be before they cut the cake?\u201d Jack asked, leaning toward Olivia.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Pretending to be scandalized, she elbowed her husband. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than a kid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d her husband protested. \u201cAnd I\u2019m especially hungry for cake.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia laughed. \u201cOkay, it shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of nice-looking food over there,\u201d Cliff said, pointing at the buffet table. \u201cIf you get some, bring extras for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d Grace chastised. \u201cWe just had lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else is going up for food yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, somebody has to be the first.\u201d</p><p>Grace exchanged a look with Olivia and rolled her eyes.</p><p>Jack suddenly turned to Olivia. \u201cIs that your brother?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p><p>Olivia craned her neck to see. Sure enough, it was Will. She hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been invited to the wedding. With the art gallery to run, it was unusual for him to take time off in the middle of a Saturday, which was the most profitable day of the week, particularly during the summer. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice him in church earlier, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I did,\u201d Jack commented. \u201cHe looks a bit lost to me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced over at Grace and Cliff. \u201cWould you mind if I invited Will to join us?\u201d</p><p>Grace deferred to her husband.</p><p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d Cliff said. He stretched his arm across the back of Grace\u2019s chair in what Olivia recognized as a possessive gesture.</p><p>She approached her brother, who stood just inside the restaurant. Although past sixty, Will was still an attractive man. In some ways his natural good looks and charismatic personality had been a detriment. Everything had come too easily to Will. He\u2019d been a star football player, the high school\u2019s homecoming king and an equally big success in college. He\u2019d done well as an engineer and risen steadily up the ranks of his company, retiring early after his divorce. Personally, Olivia was pleased to have Will living in Cedar Cove. Despite his irresponsible behavior toward his ex-wife, Georgia\u2014and toward Grace\u2014she valued his wit, his intelligence and his friendship with her and Jack. She couldn\u2019t fault his emotional and practical support when she\u2019d been so ill. Besides, their mother was getting on in years, although Charlotte would be the first to insist she didn\u2019t want her children looking after her. Regardless, Olivia welcomed her brother\u2019s presence in town and was grateful she wouldn\u2019t have to make any decisions concerning Charlotte on her own.</p><p>\u201cWill, come and sit with us,\u201d she said, impulsively touching his arm.</p><p>Will turned around. \u201cOh, hi, Liv. Thanks, but I\u2019ve got Mom with me. She\u2019s in the ladies\u2019 room at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought Mom?\u201d</p><p>He answered with a sigh. \u201cShe phoned at the last minute and said she needed a ride to the wedding and asked if I could take her. As it was, we missed most of the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d</p><p>Will shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, but something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t sure what to make of this. She\u2019d talk privately with her mother when she had the chance. \u201cIt was good of you to drop everything and bring her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal,\u201d Will said, shrugging off her thanks. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that busy and Miranda Sullivan\u2019s filling in for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda Sullivan,\u201d Olivia repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t. She lives in Gig Harbor but she\u2019s in town quite often. She\u2019s friends with Shirley Bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Olivia would make a point of seeking Miranda out and introducing herself. She wanted to thank the other woman for taking Will\u2019s place at the gallery so he could escort Charlotte to the wedding.</p><p>Olivia touched her brother\u2019s arm again. \u201cWill, is everything all right?\u201d She\u2019d rarely seen him so disheartened.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d His answer was quick. Too quick. He must have realized it because he gave her a chagrined look. \u201cOkay, if you must know, I had a bit of a surprise last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good one.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI made a point of letting Shirley Bliss know I was interested in her.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was well aware of it; her brother had set his sights on Shirley and actively pursued her.</p><p>\u201cYou might recall that she and I went out a few times.\u201d</p><p>After each outing Will had talked endlessly about Shirley. He\u2019d asked Olivia to suggest a restaurant in Seattle, and then followed her advice and made a reservation. The next week he reported what a wonderful dinner they\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cHow is Shirley?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Miranda, she\u2019s in love,\u201d he said despairingly. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Will, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. It\u2019s my own fault. I introduced her to an artist friend of mine and then, next thing I know, the two of them are head over heels for each other, which Miranda was happy to share. A week ago they came to the gallery\u2014and they thanked me,\u201d he said sardonically. \u201cTrust me, I can read the writing on the wall.\u201d He stared down at his feet and shrugged again, trying to pretend it really didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Clearly this rejection had come as a shock to her brother. Women had always been interested in Will, and he\u2019d been interested in them. It seemed that, in the past, Will could\u2019ve had almost any woman he wanted. Grace was an exception, but that was a whole other story.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d her brother said. \u201cI\u2019m getting old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder, Will, not old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. You\u2019re as attractive as ever.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Olivia was surprised by the fragility of her brother\u2019s ego. She wanted to laugh off his concern, but she could see that he took this seriously. She supposed his inability to cope with rejection made sense, considering he\u2019d received very little of it over the years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cOf growing old alone.\u201d</p><p>She searched for the words to reassure him and would have spoken if not for the fact that their mother stepped out of the ladies\u2019 room just then. Olivia knew immediately that Will was right; Charlotte was distressed about something.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia said, meeting her halfway. She slipped an arm around her mother. \u201cCome and sit with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She steered Charlotte toward the table where Jack and her friends were waiting with their champagne flutes. Will followed two steps behind.</p><p>Charlotte sat next to Olivia and set her small handbag in her lap. Olivia noticed that her mother hadn\u2019t brought her knitting, which was unusual. Charlotte never allowed a spare moment\u2014even at a formal event like this\u2014to pass without knitting.</p><p>Moving a little closer to her mother, Olivia asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d</p><p>Her mother stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cBen, Mom,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe went to talk to David.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t welcome information. Anything to do with Ben\u2019s son was generally bad news. \u201cDavid\u2019s in town?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte worried her lip. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, dear. Ben took a phone call and then said he had to leave for a while. I completely forgot about Troy and Faith\u2019s wedding. Thank goodness Will could bring me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was obviously distraught. \u201cYou know David\u2019s living in Seattle now?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia nodded; Ben had mentioned it the day they\u2019d come for lunch.</p><p>Charlotte lowered her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d She paused and exhaled slowly. \u201cDavid was let go from his job. He\u2019s unemployed.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had already heard about that, too, and wondered why her mother was repeating it. She sounded as if it was news to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s living with a woman and...oh, dear, Olivia, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Ben this upset. He thought David had lost the power to hurt him, but he was wrong. Ben can\u2019t believe his son would stoop to letting a woman support him. It\u2019s bad enough that David seems to enjoy terrorizing Mary Jo over that precious baby.\u201d</p><p>Olivia reached for her mother\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d she said in a soothing voice. \u201cBen knows how to deal with David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat David needs is someone who\u2019ll talk to him without taking any of his garbage,\u201d Will interjected. \u201cIf he won\u2019t listen to his father, maybe he\u2019ll listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Olivia muttered, silencing her brother. He was only throwing gasoline on the fire.</p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d she told her mother again, \u201cBen knows how to handle his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Olivia, I do hope you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t tell you how worried I am.\u201d</p><p>Will scowled, clearly angry at what this business with David was doing to their mother. Good thing David Rhodes wasn\u2019t anywhere close to her brother, who had little tolerance for that kind of behavior. One look at him told her Will would love to straighten David out.</p><p>\u201cBen knew Faith and Troy\u2019s wedding was this afternoon. We planned to attend together. I bought a new dress and Ben got a new tie and we\u2019d been looking forward to it. He must have forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the case, Mom,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid of what David might do. He doesn\u2019t know that Ben\u2019s found out where he\u2019s living. If Ben shows up unexpectedly, everything might blow up in his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told Ben all this about David?\u201d she asked, hoping to keep Charlotte from dwelling on the negative possibilities.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. Somebody... And then a woman phoned the house early this afternoon and asked to speak to Mr. Rhodes. When he finished with the call, Ben didn\u2019t tell me who she was or why she phoned. I have to assume this is another young lady David has hurt in one way or another. All Ben said after he hung up was what I told you.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte paused and seemed to need a moment to collect her thoughts. \u201cBen was so upset. He said it was time he paid his son a visit.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m so worried....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think David would hurt his father, do you?\u201d Olivia tried to hide her alarm but wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>\u201cWith David, it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d Her hands opened and closed the clasp of her purse.</p><p>Olivia placed an arm protectively around her mother\u2019s shoulders.</p> <p>Faith and Troy were walking toward the cake, and Olivia watched as Jack sat up and took notice. He\u2019d finished a plateful of crab salad, broccoli quiche and smoked salmon canap\u00e9s, but he was ready, as usual, to indulge his sweet tooth. She nudged him with her foot as a warning to behave. Honestly! Anyone would think Cliff and Jack hadn\u2019t eaten in a week.</p><p>\u201cBen!\u201d Charlotte cried out, raising her arm and giving an anxious wave.</p><p>Olivia looked toward the front of the restaurant and saw Ben Rhodes enter the dining area. Charlotte stood and hurried toward him. He smiled down at her and slid his arm about her waist. The two of them talked intensely before Olivia\u2019s mother brought Ben back to the table.</p><p>Both Jack and Cliff stood to greet the other man. Will did, too, but his dour, thoughtful mood hadn\u2019t improved.</p><p>Although Olivia sympathized with her brother\u2019s disappointment, she felt a bit of rejection might be good for him. He did seem genuinely hurt that Shirley Bliss had fallen in love with someone else. But then, most people had learned by this age that life had its share of disappointments.</p><p>Ben leaned close to Charlotte, whispering a few words in her ear. Almost immediately, Charlotte relaxed.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t want to seem too inquisitive, but she couldn\u2019t help being curious. \u201cIs everything all right, Ben?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ben\u2019s hand rested on his wife\u2019s back. \u201cNever better,\u201d he assured her, although his face was expressionless.</p><p>Olivia wondered what had taken place between David Rhodes and his father. Obviously Ben wasn\u2019t about to divulge what had happened, nor was he willing to feed anyone\u2019s speculation. But she guessed that whatever had been said would eventually come out.</p><p>An hour later it was time to go. Olivia had visited with various friends she hadn\u2019t seen since she\u2019d taken a leave of absence from court. As they filed out of the restaurant, Olivia felt that Faith and Troy\u2019s wedding had been lovely in every way, exactly what she\u2019d wanted for them. Earlier, she\u2019d learned from Grace that they\u2019d booked a honeymoon trip to Alaska. The couple planned to fly out the next morning.</p><p>As Jack escorted her to the parking lot, Charlotte called out to them. Olivia walked back to meet her mother.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I can\u2019t seem to find my knitting. You didn\u2019t see it when I arrived, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, sorry. Are you sure you brought it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, sweetheart, you know me well enough to realize I never go anywhere without my knitting.\u201d</p><p>Yes, which was why Olivia had wondered about it. \u201cCould it be in Will\u2019s car?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled in relief. \u201cOf course! How silly of me. That\u2019s where it must be.\u201d Will was ready to pull out of the parking lot when Ben stopped him.</p><p>Will lowered his window as the two men had a quick exchange. Will reached over to the passenger seat and handed Ben the quilted bag. Ben turned, holding it up so Charlotte would know he had her precious knitting.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness,\u201d Charlotte breathed.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine, Mom,\u201d Olivia said more confidently than she felt. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Jack came up then, and the two of them saw Ben and her mother off. \u201cPoor Mom,\u201d she said to her husband.</p><p>\u201cShe was worried about Ben, that\u2019s all,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe all get confused when we\u2019re concerned about someone we love. And when you\u2019re dealing with someone like David, someone who seems to have no conscience at all, everything\u2019s that much harder.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had to agree. In her opinion, David Rhodes had already done untold damage. She could only hope this was the end.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Rachel was convinced that telling Jolene about the baby this soon was a mistake. Bruce, however, disagreed. He seemed to think that the longer they could give his daughter to adjust to the news, the better it would be.</p><p>However, Rachel couldn\u2019t see Jolene accepting this gracefully. Certainly not with joy or excitement.</p><p>Bruce decided the best way to make the announcement was to take his \u201cgirls\u201d for a night out. He planned every detail, starting with reservations at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove.</p><p>As Rachel dressed for dinner she felt sick, but her queasiness had nothing to do with the pregnancy. She\u2019d managed to hide her morning sickness from her stepdaughter all these weeks and doubted Jolene even suspected she might be pregnant.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Bruce called from the living room.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d she called back. Then, sitting on the edge of the bed, Rachel closed her eyes and offered up a silent prayer that her stepdaughter would welcome her half brother or sister into their family. A cold sweat broke out across her forehead as apprehension settled over her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rachel,\u201d Bruce said, crashing into the bedroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup? If we don\u2019t leave now, we won\u2019t make our reservation.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a weak smile. Bruce didn\u2019t appear to notice her uneasiness as she reached for her purse.</p><p>Jolene was waiting in the living room and eyed Rachel curiously when she appeared. \u201cYou aren\u2019t sick, are you?\u201d The question wasn\u2019t one of concern. She asked it as if she expected Rachel to do something to ruin this evening her father had planned for them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Bruce pulled the car out of the garage and Rachel got into the front seat beside her husband.</p><p>Jolene slammed the rear door as a reminder that until Bruce had married Rachel, she\u2019d always sat in front. Bruce had yet to comment on the abuse his daughter gave the rear door. Rachel let it go. That door was the least of her problems.</p><p>Bruce located a convenient parking spot at D.D.\u2019s and the three of them walked to the restaurant. Rachel saw that Jolene stayed close to Bruce\u2019s side, preventing her from walking next to her husband. Bruce seemed unaware of the girl\u2019s maneuvering and Rachel wasn\u2019t about to get into a shoving match over whose right it was to be next to Bruce. She followed quietly a couple of steps behind, desperately hoping she\u2019d make it through the evening.</p><p>The hostess seated them and Jolene instantly slid into the booth beside Bruce.</p><p>\u201cThe last time we were here we split a bowl of steamed clams,\u201d Jolene told him. \u201cCan we do that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bruce said, without looking up from his menu.</p><p>Jolene knew that Rachel disliked clams. She hated to be paranoid but her stepdaughter seemed to be going out of her way once again to prove that Rachel was an intruder on their happy family.</p><p>This was all the more reason, in Rachel\u2019s view, to delay telling Jolene about the pregnancy. Unfortunately, Bruce didn\u2019t agree. He also disagreed that counseling might help. Rachel had tentatively brought it up, but he insisted that they could work out their own problems\u2014and that Jolene would refuse to go anyway.</p><p>Bruce and Jolene had steamed clams as an appetizer, while Rachel sipped herbal tea. She did her best not to watch for fear that looking at them eating clams would upset her stomach even more. Jolene made slurping sounds as she ate, suggesting that she was thoroughly enjoying herself.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s order dinner,\u201d Bruce said as the waitress removed the bowl of clam shells. \u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d he asked Rachel.</p><p>\u201cCan I have steak?\u201d Jolene cut in, not allowing Rachel to respond.</p><p>Bruce smiled indulgently at his daughter. \u201cYou can order anything you like, sweetheart.\u201d He looked at Rachel again.</p><p>\u201cDad, what are you going to eat?\u201d Again, Jolene cut Rachel off before she had an opportunity to answer.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll have a T-bone. This is a celebration, after all.\u201d He smiled at Rachel, clearly pleased with himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t seem to share any of her concerns about Jolene\u2019s reaction to their news. Rachel wondered how her husband could be this oblivious. After helping Jolene with her algebra, she thought her relationship with the girl had improved. That peace, however, was short-lived. Within a matter of days, everything returned to the way it was from the moment Rachel had married Jolene\u2019s father.</p><p>Instead of the family friend Rachel had been, starting when Jolene was in first grade, she became an interloper, the woman who\u2019d trespassed on the girl\u2019s territory. It\u2019d been just Jolene and her father for so long that no one, no matter how close, would fit into the family picture.</p><p>When the waitress came for their dinner order, Rachel was finally able to announce her choice. She asked for crab cakes with rice pilaf and a green salad. Both Bruce and Jolene chose the full steak dinner, complete with baked potato, soup and salad.</p><p>Bruce, at least, was in high spirits. Rachel tried to catch his mood; she ignored every slight Jolene threw at her, smiled sweetly and pretended it didn\u2019t hurt that her own husband hadn\u2019t noticed the way his daughter treated her.</p> <p>To be fair, Rachel didn\u2019t know if she was being over-sensitive, since the pregnancy had played havoc with her emotions. The best she could do was disregard the verbal jabs and refrain from countering even the nastiest ones.</p><p>Father and daughter spoke animatedly through dinner. Rachel swallowed a few bites and then asked for a take-out container. By contrast Bruce and Jolene both ate their entire meals.</p><p>\u201cHow about dessert?\u201d Bruce said when the last of their dishes had been removed from the table.</p><p>Rachel placed her hand on her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m full. I couldn\u2019t eat a single bite,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d Jolene said eagerly. \u201cWhat would you like, Dad?\u201d</p> <p>Bruce read over the dessert menu and then looked at his daughter. \u201cI suppose you want the ice cream sundae with chocolate sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d she moaned playfully. \u201cThat\u2019s for kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a kid,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Jolene giggled.</p><p>The girl was happier than she\u2019d been in all the months since Rachel had married Bruce. It was easy to see why. Jolene was in her element. She had her father\u2019s full attention and she\u2019d managed to shut Rachel out.</p><p>What Jolene didn\u2019t know was that her father was about to deliver a devastating blow that would disrupt her entire world.</p> <p>They each ordered a different dessert. Bruce got the apple tart warmed and with vanilla ice cream and Jolene chose a slice of chocolate cake.</p><p>Bruce waited until their dessert was served, then stretched his hand across the table to reach for Rachel\u2019s. His fingers curled around hers.</p><p>Jolene stared at Rachel and narrowed her eyes menacingly.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that tonight\u2019s a celebration,\u201d Bruce began, turning to his daughter.</p><p>Jolene slowly nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what we\u2019re celebrating?\u201d he asked.</p><p>For a moment, Jolene looked confused. \u201cI passed my algebra test and advanced to intermediate in swimming, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Bruce commented.</p> <p>Jolene had been forced to take the swimming test three times before advancing. In addition, she\u2019d gotten a B-on her algebra final. Both tests had been hard for her. Rachel was proud of Jolene, although the girl had scorned her praise.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about making it into the intermediate swimming class or doing well on your algebra final,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>Jolene looked blankly at her father. \u201cThen what are we celebrating?\u201d</p><p>Bruce glanced at Rachel and offered her a soft, reassuring smile. \u201cRachel told me some exciting news recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel did?\u201d This was asked as if she had difficulty believing Rachel was capable of saying anything of interest.</p><p>\u201cJolene, tonight we\u2019re celebrating the fact that you\u2019re going to become a big sister.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked from her father to Rachel, and then back at Bruce before the light dawned. She turned to face Rachel. \u201cYou\u2019re having a baby?\u201d The question was an accusation more than an inquiry.</p><p>Gazing down at the table, Rachel nodded and then, reminding herself that she had nothing to be ashamed of, boldly met Jolene\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d The girl turned to her father. Her face crumpled as if she was begging him to tell her it wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d Bruce asked in the same animated way he\u2019d announced her pregnancy. \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Jolene muttered.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you happy?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou can name the baby if you want,\u201d Bruce said next.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t discussed this with Rachel. However, if it helped Jolene adjust, she was more than willing to let the girl make suggestions.</p><p>\u201cIs it a boy or a girl?\u201d she asked sullenly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cI won\u2019t have an ultrasound for several weeks.\u201d Personally, she\u2019d rather not know the sex of their baby. However, it seemed important to Jolene. Rachel took longer than she should have to realize why. Jolene was afraid a baby girl would be competition for her father\u2019s affection.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d show more enthusiasm than this,\u201d Bruce complained.</p><p>\u201cGive her time,\u201d Rachel said, hoping a gentle approach would soothe Jolene\u2019s feelings. She directed her subsequent remark to Jolene. \u201cI understand this is a shock and I apologize if it upsets you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s not upset,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t, are you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. Instead, she glared straight ahead, avoiding eye contact with both her father and Rachel.</p><p>The waitress brought the bill and Bruce reached for his wallet. \u201cHow about a movie?\u201d he suggested as he slid his credit card into the holder.</p><p>Rachel couldn\u2019t imagine Jolene agreeing to spend any more time with her than necessary.</p><p>\u201cCan we just go home?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Bruce was more than eager to appease his daughter in any way he could.</p><p>They left the restaurant and drove back to the house. Bruce stopped to set the garbage cans by the curb while Rachel and Jolene went inside. Jolene immediately raced to her bedroom.</p><p>Rachel slumped down in a living room chair. This had gone exactly as she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jolene?\u201d Bruce asked as he threw his car keys on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cHer room.\u201d Rachel guessed she was on her cell, talking to her friends, spilling the disastrous news to anyone and everyone who\u2019d listen. And once Bruce was out of the house, the silent treatment would start. It was either that or a tirade against Rachel because of how she\u2019d single-handedly ruined the girl\u2019s life.</p><p>Bruce stood in the middle of the room, hands on his hips. \u201cWhy\u2019s everyone so miserable?\u201d he asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier about the baby. I\u2019m thrilled to death. Okay, I know we agreed to wait for Jolene\u2019s sake, but the deed is done. She\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel feared that was simply wishful thinking on his part. \u201cI hope so,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGive the kid some credit,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cJolene is flexible. It might take her a while to come to terms with the fact that we\u2019re adding to the family, but eventually she\u2019ll be as happy as we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d Rachel echoed. She wasn\u2019t a pessimist by nature, but she didn\u2019t share his optimism about Jolene.</p><p>He studied her for a moment. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said. It was a mild exaggeration, but she needed time alone to think. \u201cWould you mind if I went to bed?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at his watch, he arched his brows. \u201cIt\u2019s only seven-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cInterested in company?\u201d</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cSorry, not tonight.\u201d</p><p>His face fell. \u201cIs it going to be like this during the whole pregnancy?\u201d He sounded like a little boy who\u2019d been deprived of dessert.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she snapped, in no mood to deal with this.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, I apologize. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAre you keeping track?\u201d he asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that like closing the barn door after the cow gets out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. We should\u2019ve paid more attention before now.\u201d She stood and started toward their bedroom.</p><p>Reaching out, Bruce grabbed her hand. His eyes were dark. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019d rather you weren\u2019t pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Bruce. You have to know the timing\u2019s all wrong. Jolene is upset and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He released her hand. \u201cFine. If having my baby is such a hardship, then I won\u2019t trouble you again. I\u2019ll move into the spare bedroom and you can rest assured I won\u2019t interrupt your precious sleep.\u201d</p><p>So it had come to this. The two of them were at odds, attacking each other. This should be the happiest time of her life and it was all Rachel could do not to break into tears.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Bruce demanded.</p><p>\u201cIf moving into the spare bedroom is what you want, then don\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Four</p><p>Roy McAfee wasn\u2019t a man who got involved in other people\u2019s affairs. In his line of work, he\u2019d seen enough to make any man skeptical of the human heart. Because of that, he tried to stay away from divorce cases, especially those that included child custody disputes. Most of his work concerned background checks and insurance investigations. In his opinion, people had a right to live the way they wanted, unless they hurt or swindled others.</p><p>The reason he was making an exception now had to do with his daughter Gloria. She\u2019d made her decision not to tell Chad Timmons she was pregnant. Corrie had given Gloria her word that she\u2019d abide by that decision. Roy, however, saw his own situation reflected in Chad\u2019s\u2014a situation that hadn\u2019t been righted for more than three decades. He refused to let that happen again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d Corrie asked as he headed out the front door on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>In an instance such as this, it was best to be vague. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this something I know about?\u201d Corrie eyed him speculatively, as if she\u2019d guessed exactly who he intended to see and what he intended to do.</p><p>Roy swore his wife had some sort of psychic ability. She seemed to instinctively know this had to do with Gloria and Chad. He hedged, reluctant to lie, and at the same time unwilling to admit he was a man on a mission\u2014or to tell her what that mission entailed.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to know what this is about?\u201d</p><p>He muttered a few words he\u2019d rather she didn\u2019t hear and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cRoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, this is something I need to do.\u201d</p><p>She slipped in front of him, blocking his exit. \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to Chad Timmons, aren\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t confirm or deny the statement.</p><p>\u201cRoy, don\u2019t. Please reconsider,\u201d Corrie whispered with an urgency that gave him pause.</p><p>He clutched the car keys so tightly they dug into his hands. \u201cThat young man has a right to know about his baby.\u201d</p><p>Corrie closed her eyes and he knew she was thinking back to the time she\u2019d found herself pregnant and alone. The same memory had haunted him from the moment their daughter came to tell them she was pregnant and the father was out of her life.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time Gloria has ever come to us with a problem,\u201d Corrie argued. \u201cIt\u2019s been a breakthrough in our relationship. If you say anything to Chad, it could destroy her trust. It could destroy everything. I\u2019m begging you, Roy, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s eyes bored into hers and he stood his ground. They so rarely disagreed that it made this standoff even more difficult. Still, Roy was determined. \u201cThe young man has a right to know,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Corrie gave him a sad smile. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that you had a right to know and I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d he all but shouted. When he\u2019d discovered he had a daughter he would never meet, it had nearly broken his spirit. He loved Corrie and had asked her to be his wife, and yet she\u2019d kept this secret for months. The anger and anguish had nearly consumed him. What she\u2019d done had the power to tear them apart. Roy hadn\u2019t let that happen; instead, he\u2019d buried his feelings. But he understood now that this unresolved matter could still undermine their marriage, their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never begged you for anything,\u201d his wife said. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please, Roy, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p> <p>Unsure now, he walked over to his recliner and sagged into it. His car keys dangled from his hand as he leaned forward, gripped by indecision. He believed that contacting Chad Timmons was the right thing to do for Gloria and her baby. Yet everything Corrie said was true. Their daughter, the very one he\u2019d thought forever lost, was back in their lives. Corrie feared, as he did, that going against her will would destroy their fragile bond.</p><p>Corrie remained where she stood.</p><p>\u201cI need to think,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed after a prolonged moment.</p><p>He heard the reluctance in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThink of Gloria\u2014this is what she wants,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cRight or wrong, these are her wishes.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling the full weight of his years, Roy wiped a hand down his face. \u201cHave you ever wondered what would\u2019ve happened if I\u2019d found out you were pregnant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Corrie didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never know because you made the decision not to tell me.\u201d He tried hard to keep the bitterness out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou were seeing someone else.\u201d Her words rang with painful accusation. \u201cWhat did you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected you to tell me,\u201d he barked. Corrie had taken the choice away from him. He\u2019d been young and stupid, and even now he couldn\u2019t be completely sure how he would\u2019ve handled the situation. He liked to think he would have stepped up and been a man, but again that was something he\u2019d never know.</p><p>\u201cLet me give it more thought,\u201d he said when he\u2019d regained control of his emotions. What had happened had happened; they couldn\u2019t go back and undo the past. Reviving these dead emotions could only hurt them.</p><p>Corrie sat down on the sofa and pressed her hands between her knees. When she spoke she lowered her head, her words barely audible. \u201cI know what Gloria feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he urged, wanting to understand how she\u2019d rationalized her silence all those years ago.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>Corrie glanced up. \u201cRejection. Blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame?\u201d Roy stared at her. \u201cWhy would I blame you? The responsibility for birth control should be shared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...had an important decision to make and I wanted to make it myself, without pressure from you.\u201d</p><p>Her reasoning irritated him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that was rather selfish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Corrie would not back down. \u201cI was young and immature,\u201d she said. \u201cI had all I could deal with already. I couldn\u2019t handle you being in the center of the situation. Gloria feels the same way. Chad is out of her life. He, too, is involved with someone else. Gloria feels as I did\u2014that she\u2019d rather deal with this on her own.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her so coldly cut out Chad, just as Corrie had eliminated him from the equation, made the decision easy for Roy. He came to his feet and stalked out of the house.</p><p>\u201cRoy!\u201d his wife called after him. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please...don\u2019t do this,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>Roy ignored her, climbed into his car and drove off. He couldn\u2019t say he looked forward to meeting Chad Timmons. The task of informing the other man that he was about to become a father wouldn\u2019t be pleasant.</p><p>He drove into Tacoma and parked at the hospital. His visit was brief. He left a message for Chad with the receptionist, asking the doctor to meet him at a tavern close to the hospital. Whether or not Chad decided to show up was his choice. If he didn\u2019t arrive within half an hour of the end of his shift\u2014which the receptionist had told him was 4:00 p.m.\u2014Roy would take that to mean Chad wasn\u2019t interested in talking to him. In that case, he wouldn\u2019t pursue the issue. Corrie and Gloria would get their wish. But, by the same token, Roy would feel he\u2019d done what he had to do.</p><p>He sat at a table in the darkened room and ordered a beer. He wasn\u2019t much of a drinking man. Never had been, but there were occasions that seemed to call for it. This was one of them.</p><p>He\u2019d drunk about half his beer when the door opened and Dr. Chad Timmons entered. They\u2019d met briefly at the opening of the medical clinic, and Roy recognized him immediately. The younger man paused near the entrance and looked around.</p><p>Roy raised his chin just enough for Timmons to spot him.</p><p>Chad walked the length of the room and stood in front of him. \u201cYou wanted to speak to me?\u201d he asked defensively.</p><p>Roy gestured toward the chair.</p><p>Chad ignored the silent invitation to join him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, son.\u201d</p><p>With obvious reluctance he pulled out a chair and sat.</p><p>\u201cYou know my daughter,\u201d Roy said without emotion.</p><p>\u201cI know both your daughters,\u201d Chad returned.</p><p>For a moment Roy had forgotten that at one time Linnette had been infatuated with Chad.</p><p>\u201cHas something happened to Gloria?\u201d Chad asked. A look of concern passed over his face.</p><p>Roy managed to disguise a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it.\u201d He caught the bartender\u2019s eye, lifted his nearly empty glass and held up two fingers. A minute later, two pints were delivered to their table.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this,\u201d Chad said, still sounding defensive.</p><p>Roy resisted the urge to suggest he was going to need it. Instead, he offered the other man a few words of advice. \u201cDon\u2019t turn down a free beer.\u201d</p><p>Chad cracked a smile.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I told you a story about me?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Chad motioned for him to proceed.</p><p>\u201cCorrie and I were college sweethearts. I was playing for the football team and became a bit of a campus celebrity. I\u2019m afraid I let that attention go to my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can happen easily enough,\u201d Chad said. He leaned forward and put his elbows on the table.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when one of the sexiest cheerleaders on the squad made a play for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re only human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, only human.\u201d Roy wasn\u2019t proud of this next part. \u201cI broke up with Corrie. As they say, I had bigger fish to fry. I knew I\u2019d hurt her and I felt bad about that, but Alicia\u2014the cheerleader\u2014made it clear she didn\u2019t like competition.\u201d</p><p>Chad grinned as if he understood Roy\u2019s quandary. \u201cIt was either one or the other, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the picture.\u201d Roy paused and sipped his beer. \u201cCorrie left school and I have to tell you I was relieved not to see her around campus. Especially after Alicia dumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason you lost the cheerleader?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cI got hurt, put on injured reserved. My star had fallen. Alicia moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBigger fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Roy\u2019s hand tightened around the beer mug. \u201cI decided that if I was going into law enforcement, I couldn\u2019t risk another injury. So I gave up sports and concentrated on my studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou joined the Seattle police force, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cI made detective.\u201d</p><p>Chad arched his brows.</p><p>\u201cThat injury returned to haunt me years later, when I hurt my back during a chase, and it led to my taking early retirement. But that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a point to this story?\u201d Chad asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, there\u2019s a point. I\u2019ll get to it in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Chad lifted his mug. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying the beer, take as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>Roy chuckled, relaxing against the back of the captain\u2019s chair. \u201cI ran into Corrie on campus a short while later. That was the following year. We met at the library. When I saw her again, I was stunned by how beautiful she was. How genuine. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d left her for someone as superficial as Alicia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Corrie would have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Roy had to agree. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make it easy. I sort of accidentally on purpose showed up at the library every night, about the same time I knew she\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make detective on looks alone.\u201d</p><p>Chad grinned.</p><p>\u201cEventually Corrie realized I was serious and agreed to go out with me again. I didn\u2019t make the same mistake twice, and just before I graduated I asked her to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that was a good move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d Roy straightened and stared down at his beer. \u201cThe night before we were married, Corrie told me that when she\u2019d gone home to live with her family she\u2019d given birth to my baby.\u201d He made eye contact with Chad.</p><p>\u201cGloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gloria. I didn\u2019t know I had a daughter until after she\u2019d been given up for adoption.\u201d Chad frowned.</p><p>\u201cLike her mother, Gloria tends to be...cautious with what she shares. Private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she does,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>Uncertain how to lead into the purpose of his visit, Roy met Chad\u2019s eyes again. \u201cShe says you\u2019re seeing someone else now.\u201d</p><p>Chad held his look. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not discuss my personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. However, before I say anything more, I want to tell you that I\u2019m taking a huge risk seeing you this afternoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife is dead set against it, and when Gloria finds out she\u2019ll probably never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to see me.\u201d Chad took a sip of his beer. \u201cAbout three weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she said. Did you ever ask her why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know why. She changed her mind again. Frankly, she\u2019s done this to me twice and I\u2019m through playing her games. If she sent you to talk to me, then you\u2019ve wasted your money on good beer.\u201d He paused, as though everything was beginning to add up. \u201cBut you said she might not appreciate the fact that you came to see me, so what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Roy ignored the question. \u201cI came because I wasn\u2019t going to sit idly by and let history repeat itself.\u201d</p><p>Chad stared at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you that obtuse, young man?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Chad\u2019s mouth fell open. It seemed to hit him all at once. His chest expanded and then as quickly deflated. He stood, thrust his hands in his pockets and walked around the table.</p> <p>\u201cAnother beer?\u201d the bartender called out.</p><p>Roy shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBring me a shot of whiskey,\u201d Chad told him, and then, looking at Roy, he said, \u201cNever mind. Just bring the bottle.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>Mack had always assumed it was the bride who\u2019d be nervous, not the groom. He certainly didn\u2019t expect to be the one pacing back and forth an hour before the wedding. Everything had come together so quickly that his mind was spinning. Once Mary Jo had agreed to marry him\u2014and once they\u2019d told his mother\u2014the wedding seemed to take on a momentum of its own. But the best news was that Ben Rhodes had gotten David to agree to sign relinquishment papers, although he hadn\u2019t told anyone how he\u2019d managed it or what he\u2019d said. It had happened the day of another wedding\u2014Troy and Faith\u2019s. Some people, like his father, thought Ben had offered David an incentive; others, like Jack Griffin, believed he\u2019d used some kind of leverage. All Mack cared about, however, was the fact that he could now adopt Noelle.</p><p>Linnette and Pete\u2019s plan to visit Cedar Cove in early August made the choice of a wedding date easier. If his sister and new brother-in-law were going to be in Cedar Cove, he and Mary Jo should take advantage of it.</p> <p>Once the date was set, the details all seemed to fall into place. A whirlwind of events followed. His mother had arranged the reception and hired a photographer, while Mary Jo and Linc\u2019s wife, Lori, worked on the wedding dress. Lori had designed it and had seen to its completion in record time. According to Mary Jo, Lori was immensely talented, not that Mack knew anything about women\u2019s clothing. Although he hadn\u2019t actually seen this work-of-art wedding creation, he\u2019d certainly heard enough about it from Mary Jo.</p><p>In getting all the arrangements made for the wedding, they\u2019d also attended premarriage classes with Pastor Dave Flemming for two weeks. The sessions had seemed like a waste of time and effort when the pastor first mentioned them. Now that they were over, Mack was happy Dave had urged them to attend. Of the many things they\u2019d discussed, the one that stuck in his mind was the way that assumptions could be detrimental to relationships. Assumptions about themselves and each other.</p><p>The six hour-long meetings with the pastor had made him aware of various issues between him and Mary Jo. Issues that could lead to contentious problems later on. Like his tendency to be overprotective and Mary Jo\u2019s to withhold her feelings. He was grateful to have had this opportunity to prepare for marriage and felt confident that they had a good chance of making their life together work.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d His father stepped into the small vestibule behind the altar where Mack waited. Waited and paced. He\u2019d sit down and then vault to his feet and resume pacing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He heard the hesitation in his own voice.</p><p>Roy chuckled and slapped him on the back. \u201cLinc will be here in less than ten minutes, so you can stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>Linc Wyse would serve as Mack\u2019s best man, and Lori was standing up as Mary Jo\u2019s matron of honor.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say he\u2019s not here yet?\u201d Mack stopped abruptly. He\u2019d been so consumed with his own nervousness that he hadn\u2019t realized his best man hadn\u2019t shown up.</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be just fine,\u201d Roy assured him, grinning widely.</p><p>Mack scowled at his father. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you think this is so funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help it. This wedding business brings up a lot of memories. I was a nervous wreck before I married your mother, too. In fact, I nearly fainted at the altar.\u201d</p><p>Mack could hardly believe that his highly competent, unflappable father had ever been nervous about anything, let alone his own wedding.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was so beautiful I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off her and when it came time to repeat my vows I was so tongue-tied\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, stop it,\u201d Mack said. He was already having enough difficulties; he didn\u2019t need his father regaling him with horror stories just before his wedding.</p><p>\u201cSorry, son.\u201d Roy did have the good grace to look guilty.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d Mack asked, hoping a change of subject would settle his mind.</p><p>Appearing cool and relaxed, his father sat on the chair so recently vacated by Mack and crossed his legs. \u201cShe\u2019s with Charlotte Rhodes, getting everything set up for the reception.\u201d</p><p>The church had agreed to let Mack and Mary Jo use the Fellowship Hall following the wedding for their reception. Mack would have liked the waterfront gazebo, but that had been reserved months earlier by another couple, as was nearly every other facility in town. When Pastor Flemming had offered them the Fellowship Hall, it had been a big relief to his mother, who\u2019d been working diligently on the problem.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Charlotte Rhodes helping Mom with the reception?\u201d he asked.</p><p>His father gave him an odd look. \u201cShe baked the wedding cakes.\u201d</p><p>Mack remembered that now\u2014or at least the part about Charlotte doing the baking. She was justly famous for her culinary skills. \u201cCakes, as in more than one?\u201d If he distracted himself with details, he might actually get through this wedding without making an idiot of himself.</p><p>\u201cApparently you and Mary Jo are going to have one big cake and three smaller ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d Mack didn\u2019t recall that. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. That\u2019s what your mother told me.\u201d</p><p>Mack had only a vague recollection of their long discussions about the flowers and cake and a dozen other matters. Mack had left most of it to his mother, Mary Jo and Lori. He didn\u2019t have the patience for that sort of thing. He guessed few men did.</p><p>As it was, he found wearing this tuxedo downright uncomfortable. The last time he\u2019d worn a suit had been for his grandfather\u2019s funeral and that was... He\u2019d lost count of the years.</p><p>A tuxedo. Him? Mary Jo and Lori had said he should rent one. He\u2019d gone along with it, thinking he didn\u2019t really have a choice. Only when he and Linc had gone for the fitting had he figured out otherwise. His brother-in-law had complained at great length, but by then it was too late for them to take a stand. In Mack\u2019s opinion, an opinion seconded by Linc, formal wear was an instrument of torture.</p><p>\u201cI understand Ben Rhodes is bringing a special guest,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t have a chance to respond or ask who it was before the door flew open and a breathless Linc shot into the room. \u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a flat tire. Have you ever tried to change a tire in one of these getups?\u201d he demanded. He straightened his sleeves and exhaled heavily.</p><p>Mack leaned against the wall.</p><p>Linc stared hard at him. \u201cYou\u2019re looking pale. You\u2019re not going to faint on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning on it.\u201d Now that Linc mentioned it, Mack did feel light-headed. His father\u2019s admission of his own wedding-day troubles hadn\u2019t helped. Feeling a sudden need to sit down, Mack sank into a chair and leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees.</p><p>Roy placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. \u201cThe wedding will go off without a hitch, don\u2019t you worry. You\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>Mack hoped so. Before he could think of anything else to worry about, Pastor Flemming came in. It was time.</p><p>His father left. Then Linc and Mack came through the vestibule door to stand beside the altar. He watched as his parents were seated in the front row next to Linnette and Pete. Gloria sat with them, on his parents\u2019 other side. Noelle slept in her arms.</p><p>Ned and Mel Wyse sat in the pew across from them, together with some of Mary Jo\u2019s Seattle friends.</p><p>As Mack looked at his family he saw his mother reach for a tissue. Trying not to be obvious, Corrie dabbed at her eyes. The music hadn\u2019t even started and already his mother was getting emotional.</p><p>This was supposed to be a happy occasion! Strangely, seeing his mother so affected by this wedding seemed to relax him. He found he was smiling. As he glanced at his father, Roy winked in his direction.</p><p>The church was nearly full. Mack and Mary Jo had mailed out invitations; he couldn\u2019t keep track of the number of people his mother had added to the list. His parents\u2019 friends had made a point of attending, along with half the fire station. Their support touched him. He\u2019d become close friends with these men in a short period of time. He wasn\u2019t surprised by the number of guests as much as he was honored.</p><p>Then the organ music began. Everyone stood as Mary Jo appeared at the back of the church. Mack straightened his shoulders and turned to face the woman who was about to become his wife.</p><p>One glance at her, and his breath caught in his throat. He must have taken a small step forward because Linc placed a restraining hand on his arm.</p><p>Mary Jo had never looked more beautiful. The dress, lace and pearls over silk, was everything she\u2019d promised. Their eyes met, happiness radiating from hers. He felt her joy and experienced his own profound sense of rightness. For a moment he forgot to breathe. He stood transfixed, unable to move. Not until Pastor Flemming spoke did Mack realize it was time to stand by Mary Jo\u2019s side and repeat his vows.</p><p>The rest of the ceremony was lost in a whirl of words. Somehow he managed to say and do all that was required of him. While he\u2019d been nervous earlier, now he felt calm and confident. Deep in his heart, his soul, he recognized that he\u2019d made the best decision of his life when he\u2019d asked Mary Jo to be his wife.</p><p>Organ music soared through the church as they walked down the aisle together as husband and wife. Several guys from the station high-fived him as he walked past. Mack\u2019s smile was so big it hurt his face.</p><p>Everyone followed them from the church to the Fellowship Hall, where the tables were set up. The area had been transformed with flowers, decorations and balloons. Mack had no idea who was responsible for all this but he guessed his mother, Linnette and Gloria had played a large role.</p><p>Together with his parents, Mack and Mary Jo formed a short reception line and greeted their guests as they came through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou might remember that I mentioned Ben Rhodes was bringing a special guest,\u201d Roy said to him in a low voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. Who is it?\u201d</p><p>His father pointed at the other side of the room, where Jacob Dennison sat in his wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo, look,\u201d he said, and nodded toward Dennison.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mack.\u201d</p> <p>When their last guest had entered the hall, Mack took Mary Jo by the hand and led her across the room. Dennison smiled up at them. \u201cWhat a fine young couple you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such an honor to have you at our wedding,\u201d Mary Jo told the old man in a tremulous voice.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to miss this. You two gave me a priceless gift by returning the letters I wrote Joan. Reading them brought back memories I\u2019d long forgotten, memories I want to pass on to my children and grandchildren. This is a piece of my history\u2014of their history, too. I will be forever grateful to you.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo bent down to kiss Jacob\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he went on to say, \u201cI wish for you the same happiness Joan and I had together. May your life be filled with love and may you always be as happy as you are this day.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Jo smiled tearfully and looked at Mack. He tightened his hand on hers.</p><p>Dennison glanced at the wedding cakes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d mind cutting me a piece of cake, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to,\u201d Mary Jo told him.</p><p>They made their way through the crowd toward the wedding cakes. When they were almost there, Mary Jo paused and placed her hand over her heart. \u201cWhat Jacob said? I am happy, Mack, so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d This was no exaggeration. Mack wasn\u2019t even sure how to describe the emotion that suffused every part of him. He felt both calm, supremely calm, and ecstatic, surrounded by his family and friends, surrounded by happiness.</p><p>He and his father exchanged a smile. Roy wasn\u2019t a man who smiled often or freely, but he did now. Mack felt his approval, his support. His mother was mingling with guests, completely in her element. His two sisters sat at a table, their heads close together, chatting about heaven knew what. Gloria continued to hold the sleeping Noelle.</p> <p>Linnette was obviously pregnant now and due in another six weeks. Pete seemed content, talking to one of Mack\u2019s firefighter buddies.</p><p>Mary Jo cut the large, tiered cake and after they\u2019d posed for pictures they delivered the first slice to Jacob Dennison. Ben and Charlotte sat with him and had been joined by Olivia and her husband, Jack Griffin. Grace and Cliff Harding were at the same table.</p><p>Corrie and Charlotte took over cake duty, much to Mack\u2019s relief, with the assistance of Emily Flemming, the pastor\u2019s wife.</p><p>Noelle woke then and wanted to be held, so Mack took the baby in his arms and carried her around the room. Then he and Mary Jo went to sit with her brothers for a few minutes. Mel, Linc and Ned were all enjoying wedding cake, tasting and comparing the different varieties.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly believe my baby sister\u2019s married,\u201d Linc said to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for us to go?\u201d Mary Jo whispered to Mack. \u201cBefore my brothers start crying in their cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t crying,\u201d Mel insisted.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not giving you a chance to get started,\u201d Mary Jo informed them. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said, smiling up at Mack, \u201cwe need to leave for our honeymoon.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-Six</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her here!\u201d Jolene shouted loudly enough to be heard on the opposite side of the house.</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d Bruce snapped. He knew Jolene wanted Rachel to hear every word, which she probably had. The tension between them was driving him to the point of madness. He was trapped in a seemingly hopeless situation, and anything he said or did only made matters worse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her living here,\u201d his daughter continued.</p><p>\u201cRachel is your stepmother and my wife,\u201d he said with barely restrained anger. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change, so you\u2019d better adjust your attitude.\u201d Bruce had tried to let the two of them work this out themselves. Unfortunately, that hadn\u2019t happened. He didn\u2019t understand how all this crazy, competitive jealousy had gotten so out of hand, although he was well aware that Jolene had played the major role.</p><p>At one time she\u2019d loved Rachel almost to the point of idol worship. They\u2019d been close from the day they\u2019d met, when he\u2019d taken Jolene to Get Nailed for a haircut. It was through his daughter that Bruce had gotten to know Rachel.</p><p>Bruce slumped onto his recliner in the living room and wished this senseless bickering would end. Rachel had told him before they were married that Jolene needed more time. He hadn\u2019t listened. He\u2019d wanted the three of them together as a family, so he\u2019d rushed things and brushed aside Jolene\u2019s doubts and Rachel\u2019s fears. Now they were all paying the price.</p><p>No one was happy, least of all Bruce. Since their argument the night of the dinner, he\u2019d been sleeping in the spare bedroom. That was a week ago. A week without Rachel in his bed. He missed her and wanted her back where she belonged. With him. He\u2019d made overtures to that effect, but Rachel had ignored them.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jolene demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he raised his head. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel is my wife.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to argue with his teenage daughter.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cShe isn\u2019t even sleeping with you. The two of you hardly talk anymore.\u201d</p><p>Bruce couldn\u2019t deny the truth. \u201cEvery couple goes through an adjustment period. Rachel and I will sort this out.\u201d He certainly wasn\u2019t prepared to call it quits, and he didn\u2019t think Rachel wanted that, either. They\u2019d come a long way in the past few years. It wasn\u2019t as if they were kids who\u2019d rushed into the relationship. The marriage, yes, you could say that, but not the relationship. When they\u2019d first met, Bruce was determined he\u2019d never fall in love or marry again after Stephanie\u2019s death. Then gradually, through the years, he\u2019d come to appreciate Rachel. More than once he thought he\u2019d lost her. More than once he\u2019d been sure she\u2019d marry Nate Townsend, that navy guy. But she hadn\u2019t. No, Rachel was meant to be with him\u2014and with Jolene, too.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need her,\u201d Jolene insisted, unwilling to drop the subject.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s pregnant...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? She doesn\u2019t have to be part of our lives, does she? Everything changed after she moved in with us, and I\u2014\u201d Jolene stopped abruptly when Rachel entered the room.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I join this conversation,\u201d his wife said calmly.</p><p>Jolene crossed her arms, looking venomously at Rachel.</p><p>\u201cJolene has a point,\u201d Rachel said, again in the same low voice, a voice completely devoid of emotion. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told us she was uneasy about us getting married, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d his daughter accused him, righteous indignation in every word.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d already made the decision,\u201d Bruce countered. \u201cOkay, so we rushed the wedding a bit, but I wanted you with me and you said you felt the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did at the time.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the implications of her remark. \u201cAre you saying you regret it now?\u201d</p><p>To his dismay Rachel nodded.</p><p>Jolene thrust a triumphant finger at her stepmother. \u201cSee? See, she doesn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>Rachel ignored her. \u201cJolene has never accepted me as her stepmother.\u201d</p><p>Bruce didn\u2019t like the way this conversation\u2014like so many of their conversations\u2014revolved around his daughter\u2019s likes and dislikes. He and Rachel were the adults in the room; he wasn\u2019t about to let a thirteen-year-old girl dictate his life or his marriage. He realized now that stepping aside and leaving his daughter and his wife to work out their differences had contributed to the problem. \u201cJolene,\u201d he said pointedly, \u201cwill learn to accept you.\u201d And if it took a counseling session with some stranger to make that happen, so be it.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d the girl screeched.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she will.\u201d Rachel shook her head. \u201cAnd maybe she won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll she needs is time,\u201d Bruce muttered.</p><p>Jolene marched up to Bruce. \u201cStop talking about me like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d Whirling around, she confronted Rachel. \u201cI hate you. I never wanted you to marry my dad. Look what you\u2019ve done! You ruined my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene!\u201d Bruce had taken all he could from his daughter. Rising to his feet, he clasped the girl\u2019s shoulders and turned her to face him. \u201cYou will apologize to Rachel. I won\u2019t have you speaking to her that way.\u201d</p><p>Jolene glared back at him, her eyes flashing with defiance. His own anger simmered just below the surface. He\u2019d been stupid and blind. Jolene and her malicious jealousy had driven a wedge between Rachel and him.</p><p>\u201cWhat Jolene said is true.\u201d Rachel surprised him by siding with the girl. \u201cI am pregnant and now there\u2019s another person to consider in this equation. Jolene doesn\u2019t want this baby any more than she wants me in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow just a minute.\u201d Bruce needed to make it clear that despite his daughter\u2019s attitude he wanted this baby.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo paraphrase you, when Jolene said you don\u2019t need me, you basically told her you\u2019re stuck with me because I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>How she\u2019d arrived at that conclusion, Bruce would never know. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you, and frankly, neither one of you made any effort to hide your conversation from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re going to leave?\u201d Jolene asked, eyes wide with feigned innocence.</p><p>Bruce was quick to answer. \u201cDefinitely not. Rachel\u2019s staying here, where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s shoulders slumped forward. \u201cDaddy, let her go. We don\u2019t need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s right,\u201d Rachel confirmed. \u201cAnd as she\u2019s said more times than I can count, I\u2019ve come between the two of you and ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s eyes blazed with triumph. \u201cSee! Even Rachel admits it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d Bruce argued, ignoring his daughter\u2019s outburst. \u201cOur baby needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Rachel said far too easily. \u201cOur baby does need me. He or she needs me to live in a stress-free environment. This child also has to know he or she is loved and wanted by this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love our baby,\u201d Bruce insisted.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be best if I left,\u201d Rachel said firmly, as if anything he said, any opinions he held, shouldn\u2019t be taken into account.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Again, Bruce\u2019s response was quick and automatic. This wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Rachel was actually suggesting she move out. None of this seemed real...or right.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be best if you left, too,\u201d Jolene chimed in, sounding gleeful at the prospect of getting rid of her stepmother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Bruce said heatedly.</p><p>Rachel just smiled. \u201cDo you plan to hold me captive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bruce couldn\u2019t believe it had come to this. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it. Rachel, tell me you aren\u2019t really going to walk away.\u201d</p><p>A sad, defeated look came over her. \u201cI can\u2019t continue like this. All the fighting and stress isn\u2019t good for the baby and it isn\u2019t good for me. Jolene is anxious to be rid of me and I don\u2019t have the energy to fight her anymore\u2014not when I have to do it alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. I made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve taken a more active role in this...this conflict between you, but I was afraid if I intervened it would only aggravate the situation. I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know,\u201d Jolene yelled. \u201cGet Rachel and that baby out of here.\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s patience had reached its limit. He pointed to the hallway. \u201cGo to your room. Rachel and I need privacy to talk this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jolene stamped her foot. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me out of this. I have a right to my say, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to your room! Now.\u201d</p> <p>His daughter seemed about to argue, but then shrugged and marched out of the room.</p><p>Bruce waited until Jolene had disappeared before he spoke again. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes revealed pain and disappointment. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what there is to talk about. I can\u2019t live like this, Bruce. I love you and Jolene, but I think we can both say we made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bruce refused to see their marriage that way. Okay, he\u2019d admit it; he\u2019d made more than his share of blunders. He should\u2019ve done more to reassure his daughter and to support his wife. Perhaps he\u2019d been naive to assume that Jolene would be as thrilled about Rachel\u2019s pregnancy as he was. He\u2019d hoped she\u2019d be excited. That seemed a vain, foolish hope now....</p><p>\u201cWhat if we went to family counseling?\u201d he said desperately. \u201cWe could see someone at the clinic or...or Pastor Flemming or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. And as you told me before, Jolene won\u2019t go anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving, Bruce,\u201d Rachel said simply. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to persuade me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>That had been his intention, but seeing the determination in her eyes, he knew it would do no good. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d he asked, feeling defeated.</p><p>\u201cA friend offered me a place to live until I can make other arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>She took her time answering. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cA month?\u201d She couldn\u2019t possibly intend to stay away an entire month. He couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>It hit him then that she might not ever come back. The realization stunned him. \u201cThis...this is what you want?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI never dreamed it would end like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He sat up straighter. \u201cWill you keep in touch, let me know how you are, where you are?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t immediately agree. \u201cOkay,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019ll phone you.\u201d</p><p>In other words, she wasn\u2019t willing to give him her contact information. Still, if that was all she\u2019d offer him, he\u2019d take it. The alternative was too harsh to even think about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave in the morning,\u201d she said, and started to walk away.</p><p>Bruce caught her hand. \u201cGive Jolene time. Please. She\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d His daughter\u2019s voice rang down the hallway.</p><p>Despite the seriousness of the moment, Rachel smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s always had the best hearing of anyone I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Bruce smiled, too, remembering the early days of their marriage when they\u2019d self-consciously tried to hide the fact that they were lovers from his daughter. In retrospect it had been ridiculous. They weren\u2019t fooling anyone, certainly not Jolene.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bruce,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d It occurred to him that she might need help. \u201cYou\u2019ll call if you need anything, right? You\u2019ll keep in touch?\u201d he asked again. He\u2019d go mad if she didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t believe he was actually letting her walk out the door, not knowing where she intended to live or how long she\u2019d stay away. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Not to Rachel and him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cCan I hold you?\u201d</p><p>She considered his request, tears brightening her eyes, then slowly nodded.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around her, Bruce held her close, savoring the feel of her in his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can let you go,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said again. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders buckled in a sob. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I want, either, but I don\u2019t see any other alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cWe can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we could, too, but I was wrong.\u201d She disentangled her arms and stepped away from him. \u201cLike I told you earlier, I\u2019m afraid all this stress is hurting the baby.... This is something I need to do for me and for our child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make this any harder than it already is.\u201d</p><p>Although it felt as if his chest was about to cave in, Bruce nodded. \u201cAll right, go if you have to, but know that I\u2019ll be here waiting when you\u2019re ready to come back.\u201d Reaching out, he stroked her cheek and a tear ran down her face onto his hand.</p><p>Leaning toward her, Bruce kissed Rachel goodbye. His heart pounded with fear that this might be the last time he ever kissed his wife. </p> </body></html>"]
