It\u2019s out of character for him. Especially since I\u2019m not the one who encouraged it.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Daniel,\u201d he groans on the other end of the line. \u201cStop. And stop asking me why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a weird thing to tattoo on yourself. Hopeless. It\u2019s a very depressing term. But still, I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go. I\u2019ll call you later this week.\u201d</p><p>I sigh into the phone. \u201cGod, this sucks, man. The only good thing about this entire school since you moved is fifth period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fifth period?\u201d Holder asks.</p><p>\u201cNothing. They forgot to assign me a class, so I hide out in this maintenance closet every day for an hour.\u201d</p> <p>Holder laughs. I realize as I\u2019m listening to it that it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard him laugh since Les died two months ago. Maybe moving to Austin will actually be good for him.</p><p>The bell rings and I hold the phone with my shoulder and fold up my jacket, then drop it to the floor of the maintenance closet. I flip off the light. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later. Nap time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Holder says.</p><p>I end the call and set my alarm for fifty minutes later, then place my phone on the counter. I lower myself to the floor and lie down. I close my eyes and think about how much this year sucks. I hate that Holder is going through what he\u2019s having to go through and there isn\u2019t a damn thing I can do about it. No one that close to me has ever died, much less someone as close as one of my sisters. A twin sister to be exact.</p><p>I don\u2019t even try to offer him advice, but I think he likes that. I think he needs me to just continue being myself, because God knows everyone else in this whole damn school has no clue how to act around him. If they weren\u2019t all such stupid assholes he\u2019d probably still be here and school wouldn\u2019t suck half as bad as it does.</p><p>But it does suck. Everyone in this place sucks and I hate them all. I hate everybody but Holder and they\u2019re the reason he isn\u2019t here anymore.</p> <p>I stretch my legs out in front of me and cross my ankles, then fold my arm over my eyes. At least I have fifth period.</p><p>Fifth period is nice.</p><p>My eyes flick open and I groan when something lands on me. I hear the sound of the door slam shut.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I place my hands on whatever just fell on me and begin to roll it off me when my hands graze a head full of soft hair.</p><p>It\u2019s a human?</p><p>A girl?</p><p>A chick just fell on me. In the maintenance closet. And she\u2019s crying.</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d I ask cautiously. Whoever she is, she tries to push off me but we both seem to be taking turns moving in the same direction. I lift up and try to roll her to my side but our heads crash together.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she says.</p><p>I fall back onto my makeshift pillow and grab my forehead. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>Neither one of us moves this time. I can hear her sniffling, trying not to cry. I can\u2019t see two inches in front of me because the light is still out but I suddenly don\u2019t mind that she\u2019 s still on top of me because she smells incredible.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m lost,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I was walking into the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, even though I know she can\u2019t see it. \u201cNot a bathroom,\u201d I say. \u201cBut why are you crying? Did you hurt yourself when you fell?\u201d</p><p>I feel her whole body sigh on top of me and even though I have no idea who she is or what she looks like, I can feel the sadness in her and it makes me a little sad in return. I\u2019m not sure how it happens, but my arms go around her and her cheek falls against my chest. In the course of five seconds we go from extremely awkward to kind of comfortable, like we do this all the time.</p><p>It\u2019s weird and normal and hot and sad and strange and I don\u2019t really want to let go. It feels sort of euphoric, like we\u2019re in some sort of fairytale. Like she\u2019s Tinkerbell and I\u2019m Peter Pan.</p><p>No, wait. I don\u2019t want to be Peter Pan.</p><p>Maybe she can be like Cinderella and I\u2019ll be her Prince Charming.</p><p>Yeah, I like that fantasy better. Cinderella\u2019s hot when she\u2019s all poor and sweaty and slaving over the stove. She also looks good in her ball gown. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that we\u2019re meeting in a broom closet. Very fitting.</p><p>I feel her pull a hand up to her face, more than likely wiping away a tear. \u201cI hate them,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate everybody.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and lift my hand, then run it down her hair, doing my best to comfort her. Finally, someone who actually gets it. I\u2019m not sure why she hates everybody but I have a feeling she\u2019s got a pretty valid reason.</p><p>\u201cI hate everybody too, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>She laughs softly, probably confused as to why I just referred to her as Cinderella. Whatever just made her laugh, at least it\u2019s not more tears. Her laugh is intoxicating and I try to think of how I can get her to do it again. I\u2019m trying to think of something funny to say when she lifts her face off my chest and I feel her scoot forward. Before I know it, I feel lips on mine and I\u2019m not sure if I should shove her away or roll on top of her. I begin to lift my hands to her face, but she pulls back just as quick as she kissed me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI should go.\u201d She places her palms beside me on the floor and starts to lift up, but I grab her face and pull her back down on top of me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. I bring her mouth back to mine and I kiss her. I keep our lips pressed firmly together as I lower her to my side and pull her against me so that her head is resting on my jacket. Her breath tastes like starburst and it makes me want to keep kissing her until I can identify every single flavor.</p><p>Her hand touches my arm and she gives it a tight squeeze just as my tongue slips inside her mouth. That would be strawberry on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>She keeps her hand on my arm, periodically moving it to the back of my head, then returning it to my arm. I keep my hand on her waist, never once moving it to touch any other part of her. The only thing we explore is each other\u2019s mouths. We kiss without making another sound. We kiss until the alarm sounds off on my phone. Despite the noise, neither of us stops kissing. We don\u2019t even hesitate. We kiss for another solid minute until the bell rings in the hallway outside and suddenly lockers are slamming shut and people are talking and everything about our moment is stolen from us by all the inconvenient external factors of school.</p><p>I still my lips against hers, then slowly pull back.</p><p>\u201cI have to get to class,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I nod, even though she can\u2019t see me. \u201cMe, too,\u201d I reply.</p><p>She begins to scoot out from beneath me. When I roll onto my back, I feel her move closer to me. Her mouth briefly meets mine one more time, then she pulls away and stands up. The second she opens the door, the light from the hallway pours in and I squeeze my eyes shut, throwing my arm over my face.</p><p>I hear the door shut behind her and by the time I adjust to the brightness, the light is gone again.</p><p>I sigh heavily. I also remain on the floor until my physical reaction to her subsides. I don\u2019t know who the hell she was or why the hell she ended up here, but I hope to God she comes back. I need a whole hell of a lot more of that.</p><p>She didn\u2019t come back the next day. Or the day after that. In fact, today marks exactly a week since she literally fell into my arms, and I\u2019ve convinced myself that maybe that whole day was a dream. I did stay up most of the night before watching zombie movies with Chunk, but even though I was going on two hours of sleep, I don\u2019t know that I would have been able to imagine that. My fantasies aren\u2019t that fun.</p><p>Whether she comes back or not, I still don\u2019t have a fifth period and until someone calls me out on it, I\u2019ll keep hiding out in here. I actually slept way too much last night, so I\u2019m not tired. I pull my phone out to text Holder when the door to the closet begins to open.</p><p>\u201cAre you in here, kid?\u201d I hear her whisper.</p><p>My heart immediately picks up pace and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s that she came back or if it\u2019s because the light is on and I\u2019m not really sure I want to see what she looks like when she opens this door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I say.</p><p>The door is still barely cracked. She slips a hand inside and slides it around the wall until she finds the light, then she flicks it off. The door opens and she slips into the room, then quickly shuts it behind her.</p><p>\u201cCan I hide with you?\u201d she asks. Her voice sounds a little different than last time. It sounds happier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crying today,\u201d I say.</p><p>I feel her make her way over to me. She grazes my leg and can feel that I\u2019m seated on a countertop, so she feels around me until she finds a clear spot. She pushes herself up beside me and takes a seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad today,\u201d she says, her voice much closer this time.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It\u2019s quiet for several seconds, but it\u2019s nice. I\u2019m not sure why she came back or why it took her a week, but I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in here last week?\u201d she asks. \u201cAnd why are you in here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchedule mishap. I was never assigned a fifth period, so I hide out and hope administration doesn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cSmart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s quiet again for a minute or so. Our hands are gripping the edge of the counter and every time she swings her legs, her fingers barely touch mine. I eventually just move my hand on top of hers and pull it onto my lap. It seems odd to just grab her hand like this, but we pretty much made out for fifteen minutes straight last week so holding hands is actually reversing a base.</p><p>She slides her fingers between mine and our palms meet, then I fold my fingers over hers. \u201cThis is nice,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never held anyone\u2019s hand before.\u201d</p><p>I freeze.</p><p>How the hell old is she?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in junior high, are you?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cGod no. I\u2019ve just never held anyone\u2019s hand before. The guys I\u2019ve been with seem to forget this part. But it\u2019s nice. I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree. \u201cIt is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she says. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in junior high, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet,\u201d I say.</p><p>She swings her leg out to the side and kicks me, then we both laugh.</p><p>\u201cThis is kind of weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cElaborate. Lots of things could be considered weird, so I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referring to.\u201d</p><p>I feel her shoulders shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. This. Us. Kissing and talking and holding hands and we don\u2019t even know what each other looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really good looking,\u201d I say.</p><p>She laughs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. If you could see me right now, you\u2019d be on your knees begging me to be your boyfriend so you could flaunt me around the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighly unlikely,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do boyfriends. Overrated.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hold hands and you don\u2019t do boyfriends, then what do you do?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cPretty much everything else. I\u2019ve got quite a reputation, you know. In fact, it\u2019s possible the two of us may have had sex before and we don\u2019t even realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible. You\u2019d remember me.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again and as much as I\u2019m having fun talking to her, that laugh makes me want to drag her to the floor with me and do nothing but kiss her again.</p> <p>\u201cAre you actually good looking?\u201d she asks skeptically.</p><p>\u201cTerribly good looking,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Dark hair, brown eyes, great abs, white teeth, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d I say. \u201cLight brown hair, correct on the eyes, abs, and teeth, but American Eagle Outfitters all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d I say. \u201cThick blonde hair, big blue eyes, an adorable little white dress with a matching hat, royal blue skin, and you\u2019re about two feet tall.\u201d</p><p>She laughs loudly. \u201cYou have a thing for Smurfette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy can dream.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still laughing and the sound of her laughter actually makes my heart hurt. It hurts because I really want to know who this chick is but I know once I find out, I more than likely won\u2019t want her like I want her right now.</p><p>She inhales a breath after her laughter subsides and then the room becomes quiet. So quiet, it\u2019s almost uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming back in here after today,\u201d she says softly.</p> <p>I squeeze her hand, surprised by the sadness I felt at that confession.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving. Not right away, but soon. This summer. I just think it\u2019d be silly if I came back here, because eventually we\u2019ll have to turn on the light or we\u2019ll slip up and say our names and I just don\u2019t think I want to know who you are.\u201d</p><p>I graze my thumb over her hand. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come back today, then?\u201d</p><p>She exhales a delicate breath. \u201cI wanted to thank you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly. \u201cFor what? Kissing you? That\u2019s all I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, matter-of-fact. \u201cExactly. For kissing me. For just kissing me. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since a guy has actually just kissed me? After I left last week I tried to remember, but I couldn\u2019t. Every time a guy has ever kissed me, he\u2019s always been in such a hurry to move on to what comes after the kisses that I don\u2019t think anyone has ever taken the time to give me an honest to God, genuine kiss before.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s really depressing,\u201d I say. \u201cBut don\u2019t give me too much credit. I\u2019ve been known to want to rush past that part in the past. I just didn\u2019t really care to rush past it last week because you\u2019re a pretty phenomenal kisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says confidently. \u201cI know. Imagine what making love to me could feel like.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow the sudden lump in my throat. \u201cBelieve me, I have. For about seven days straight now.\u201d</p><p>Her legs stop swinging next to me. I don\u2019t know if I just made her uncomfortable with that comment.</p><p>\u201cYou know what else is sad?\u201d she asks. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever made love to me before.\u201d</p><p>This conversation is headed in a weird direction. I can already tell.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young. Plenty of time for that. Virginity is actually a turn-on, so you have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, but it\u2019s a sad laugh this time.</p><p>Weird how I can already differentiate her laughs.</p><p>\u201cI am so not a virgin,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s sad. I\u2019m pretty skilled in the sex department, but looking back . . . I\u2019ve never loved any of them. None of them have ever loved me, either. Sometimes I wonder if sex with someone who actually loves you is different. Better.\u201d</p><p>I think about her question and realize that I don\u2019t have an answer. I\u2019ve never loved anyone, either. \u201cGood question,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad that we\u2019ve both had sex, multiple times it sounds like, but neither of us has ever loved anyone we\u2019ve done it with. Says a lot about our characters, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cSure does. A lot of sad truth.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a while and I still have hold of her hand. I can\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that no one\u2019s ever held her hand before. It makes me wonder if I\u2019ve ever held the hands of any of the girls I\u2019ve had sex with. Not that there have been a ton, but enough that I should be able to recall holding one of their hands.</p><p>\u201cI might be one of those guys,\u201d I ashamedly admit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever held a girl\u2019s hand before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding mine,\u201d she says.</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cSo I am.\u201d</p><p>A few more beats of silence pass before she speaks again.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I leave here in forty-five minutes and never hold another guy\u2019s hand again? What if I go through life like I am right now? What if guys continue to take me for granted and I do nothing to change it and I\u2019ll have lots of sex, but never know what it\u2019s like to make love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t do that. Find you a good guy and tie him down and make love to him every night.\u201d</p><p>She groans. \u201cThat terrifies me. As curious as I am about the difference between making love and having sex . . . my stance on relationships makes it impossible to find out.\u201d</p><p>I think about her comment for a while. It\u2019s weird, because she sounds a little like the female version of me. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m as opposed to relationships as she is, but I\u2019ve definitely never told a girl I loved her and I really hope that doesn\u2019t happen for a hell of a long time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really never coming back?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not coming back,\u201d she says.</p><p>I let go of her hand and press my palms onto the cabinet, then jump down. I move and stand in front of her, then place my hands on either side of her. \u201cLet\u2019s solve our dilemma right now.\u201d</p><p>She leans back. \u201cWhich dilemma?\u201d</p><p>I move my hands and place them on her hips, then pull her to me. \u201cWe have a good forty-five minutes to work with. I\u2019m pretty sure I could make love to you in forty-five minutes. We can see what it\u2019s like and if it\u2019s even worth going through relationships in the future. That way when you leave here, you won\u2019t worry about never knowing what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>She laughs nervously, then leans toward me again. \u201cHow do you make love to someone you aren\u2019t in love with?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward until my mouth is next to her ear. \u201cWe pretend.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the breath catch in her lungs. She turns her face slightly toward mine and I feel her lips graze my cheek. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re bad actors?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I close my eyes, because the possibility that I might actually be making love to this chick in a matter of minutes is almost too much to take in.</p><p>\u201cYou should audition for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re convincing then I just might agree to this absurd idea of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I say.</p><p>I take a step back and remove my shirt, then lay it on the floor. I grab my jacket off the counter and unfold it, then lay it on the floor as well. I turn back to the counter, then scoop her up. She locks herself around me, burying her head in my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your shirt?\u201d she asks, running her hands across my shoulder. I lower her to the floor, onto her back. I ease myself to her side and pull her against me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying on it,\u201d I respond.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was considerate of you.\u201d</p><p>I bring my hand up to her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s what people do when they\u2019re this in love.\u201d</p><p>I feel her smile. \u201cHow in love are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the way,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What is it about me you love so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour laugh,\u201d I say immediately, not sure how much of that is actually made up. \u201cI love your humor. I also love the way you tuck your hair behind your ears when you\u2019re reading. And I love how you hate to talk on the phone almost as much as I do. I really love that you leave me those little notes all the time in your adorable handwriting. And I love that you love my dog so much, because he really likes you. I also love taking showers with you. Those are always fun.\u201d</p><p>I slide my hand from her cheek to the nape of her neck. I ease my mouth forward and rest my lips against hers.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says against my mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re really convincing.\u201d</p><p>I smile and pull away. \u201cStop breaking character,\u201d I tease. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn. What do you love about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love your dog,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s a great dog. I also love how you open doors for me even though I\u2019m supposed to want to open doors for myself. I love that you don\u2019t try to pretend you like old black and white movies like everyone else does, because they bore the hell out of me. I also love it when I\u2019m at your house and every time your parents turn the other way, you steal little kisses from me. My favorite part about you though is when I catch you staring at me. I love that you don\u2019t look away and you stare unapologetically, like you aren\u2019t ashamed that you can\u2019t stop watching me. It\u2019s all you want to do because you think I\u2019m the most amazing thing you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. I love how much you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI love staring at you.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her mouth, then trail kisses across her cheek and up her jawline. I press my lips against her ear and even though I know we\u2019re pretending, my mouth runs dry at the thought of the words about to pass my lips. I hesitate, almost deciding against it. But an even bigger part of me wants to say it. A huge part of me wishes I could mean it and a small part of me thinks I probably could.</p><p>I run my hands up and through her hair. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>The next breath she draws in is a deep one. My heart is hammering against my chest and I\u2019m quiet, waiting on her next move. I have no idea what comes next. Then again, neither does she.</p><p>Her hands move from my shoulders and slowly make their way up to my neck. She tilts her head until her mouth is flush against my ear. \u201cI love you more,\u201d she whispers. I can feel the smile on her lips and I wonder if it matches the smile on my face. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m suddenly enjoying this so much, but I am.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d I whisper, moving my lips closer to her mouth. \u201cSo damn beautiful. And every single one of those guys who somehow passed this up is a complete fool.\u201d</p><p>She closes the gap between our lips and I kiss her, but this time the kiss seems so much more intimate. For a brief moment, I actually feel like I really do love all those things about her and she really does love all those things about me. We\u2019re kissing and touching and pulling the rest of our clothes off in such a hurry, it feels as if we\u2019re on a timer.</p><p>I guess we technically are.</p><p>I pull my wallet out of the pocket of my jeans and grab a condom, then ease myself back against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can change your mind,\u201d I whisper, hoping to hell she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSo can you,\u201d she says.</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>She laughs.</p> <p>Then we both shut the hell up and spend the rest of the hour proving exactly how much we love each other.</p><p>I\u2019m on my knees now, quietly gathering our clothes. After I slip my shirt over my head, I pull her up and help her with her own shirt. I stand up and pull on my jeans, then help her to her feet. I rest my chin on top of her head and pull her against me, recognizing the perfect fit.</p><p>\u201cI could turn on the light before you leave,\u201d I say. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little curious to see the face of the guy you\u2019re madly in love with?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head against my chest with her laugh. \u201cIt\u2019ll ruin everything,\u201d she says. Her words are muffled by my shirt, so she lifts her head away from my chest and tilts her face up to mine. \u201cLet\u2019s not ruin it. Once we find out who each other is, we\u2019ll find something we don\u2019t like. Maybe lots of things we don\u2019t like. Right now it\u2019s perfect. We can always have this perfect memory of that one time we loved somebody.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her again, but it doesn\u2019t last long because the bell rings. She doesn\u2019t release her hold from around my waist. She just presses her head against my chest again and squeezes me tighter. \u201cI need to go,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I close my eyes and nod. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by just how much I don\u2019t want her to go, knowing I\u2019ll never see her again. I almost beg her to stay, but I also know she\u2019s right. It only feels perfect because we\u2019re pretending it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>She begins to pull away from me, so I lift my hands to her cheeks one last time. \u201cI love you, babe. Wait for me after school, okay? In our usual spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll be there,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I love you, too.\u201d She stands on her tiptoes and presses her lips to mine; hard and desperate and sad. She pulls away and makes her way to the door. As soon as she begins to open it, I walk swiftly to her and push the door shut with my hand. I press my chest against her back and I lower my mouth to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI wish it could be real,\u201d I whisper. I put my hand on the doorknob and open it, then turn my head when she slips out the door.</p><p>I sigh and run my hands through my hair. I think I need a few minutes before I can leave this room. I\u2019m not sure I want to forget the way she smells just yet. In fact, I stand here in the dark and try my hardest to commit every single thing about her to my memory, since that\u2019s the only place I\u2019ll ever see her again.</p> <p>Chapter One</p><p>One year later</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I say, frustrated. \u201cLighten up.\u201d I crank the car just as Val climbs inside and slams her door in a huff, then pushes herself back against the seat.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019s inside the car, the overwhelming amount of perfume she has on begins to suffocate me. I crack the window, but just enough that she won\u2019t think I\u2019m insulting her. She knows how much perfume bothers me, especially when chicks smell like they bathe in it, but she never seems to care what I think, because she continues to douse it on by the gallon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so immature, Daniel,\u201d she mutters. She flips the visor down and pulls her lipstick from her purse, then begins to reapply it. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if you\u2019ll ever change.\u201d</p><p>Change?</p><p>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cWhy would I change?\u201d I ask, cocking my head out of curiosity.</p> <p>She sighs and drops her lipstick back into her purse, smacks her lips together, then turns toward me. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re happy with the way you act?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>With the way I act? Is she really commenting on the way I act? The same girl I\u2019ve seen curse at waitresses for something as simple as too much ice in her glass is seriously commenting on the way I act?</p><p>I\u2019ve been seeing her off and on for months now and I haven\u2019t had a single clue that she was hoping I would eventually change. Hoping I\u2019d become someone I\u2019m not.</p><p>Come to think of it . . . I keep getting back together with her, thinking she\u2019ll be the one to change. To be nice for once. In reality, people are who they are and they\u2019ll never really change. So why the hell are Val and I even wasting our time on this exhausting relationship if we don\u2019t even really like who each other is?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d she says smugly, incorrectly assuming my silence was admission that I\u2019m not happy with how I act. In actuality, my silence was the moment of clarity I\u2019ve needed since the day I met her.</p><p>I remain silent until we pull into her driveway. I leave the car running, indicating that I have no plans on going inside with her tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod and stare out the driver\u2019s side window. I don\u2019t want to look at her, because I\u2019m a guy and she\u2019s hot and I know if I look at her, then my moment of clarity regarding our relationship will become foggy and I\u2019ll end up inside her house, making up with her on her bed like I always do.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the one who gets to be mad, Daniel. You acted ridiculous tonight. And in front of my parents, no less! How do you expect them to ever approve of you if you act the way you do?\u201d</p><p>I have to exhale a slow, calming breath so that I don\u2019t raise my voice like she\u2019s doing right now. \u201cHow do I act, Val? Because I was myself at dinner tonight, just like I\u2019m myself every other minute of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for your stupid nicknames and immature antics and dinner with my parents isn\u2019t the time or the place!\u201d</p><p>I rub my hands over my face out of frustration, then I turn and look at her. \u201cThis is me,\u201d I say, gesturing toward myself. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like all of me, then we\u2019ve got serious issues, Val. I\u2019m not changing and honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be fair of me to ask you to change, either. I would never ask you to pretend to be something you\u2019re not, which is exactly what you\u2019re asking of me right now. I\u2019m not changing, I\u2019ll never change and I would really like it if you would get the hell out of my car right now because your perfume is making me fucking nauseous.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow and she grabs her purse off the console and pulls it toward her. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice, Daniel. Insult my perfume to get back at me. See what I mean? You\u2019re the epitome of immature.\u201d She opens the car door and unbuckles her seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cWell at least I\u2019m not asking you to change your perfume,\u201d I say mockingly.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d she says, getting out of the car. \u201cWe\u2019re done, Daniel. For good this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I say loud enough for her to hear me. She slams her door and marches toward her house. I roll down her window to air out the perfume and I back out of the driveway.</p><p>Where the hell is Holder? If I don\u2019t get to complain to someone about her, I\u2019ll fucking scream.</p><p>I climb into Sky\u2019s window and she\u2019s sitting on the floor, rummaging through pictures. She looks up and smiles as I make my way into her room. \u201cHey, Daniel,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cheese Tits,\u201d I say as I drop down onto her bed. \u201cWhere\u2019s your hopeless boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>She nudges her head toward her bedroom door. \u201cThey\u2019re in the kitchen making ice cream. You want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m too heartbroken to eat anything right now.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cVal having a bad day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVal\u2019s having a bad life,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd after tonight I\u2019ve finally realized I don\u2019t want to be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows. \u201cOh, yeah? Sounds serious this time.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWe broke up an hour ago. And who\u2019s they?\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a confused look, so I clarify my question. \u201cYou said they were in the kitchen making ice cream. Who\u2019s they?\u201d</p><p>Sky opens her mouth to answer me when her bedroom door swings open and Holder walks in with two bowls of ice cream in his hands. A girl is following behind him with her own bowl of ice cream and a spoon hanging out of her mouth. She pulls the spoon from her lips and kicks the bedroom door shut with her foot, then turns toward the bed and stops when she sees me.</p><p>She looks vaguely familiar, but I can\u2019t place her. Which is odd because she\u2019s cute as hell and I feel like I should probably know her name or remember where I\u2019ve seen her, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>She walks to the bed and sits down on the opposite end of it, eyeing me the whole time. She dips her spoon into her ice cream, then puts the spoon back in her mouth.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop staring at that spoon. I think I love that spoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Holder asks. I regretfully take my eyes off the Ice Cream Girl and watch as he takes a seat on the floor next to Sky and picks up a few of the pictures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with her, Holder,\u201d I say, stretching my legs out in front of me on the bed. \u201cFor good. She\u2019s fucking crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought that\u2019s why you loved her,\u201d he says mockingly.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cThanks for the insight, Dr. Shitmitten.\u201d</p><p>Sky takes one of the pictures out of Holder\u2019s hands. \u201cI think he\u2019s actually serious this time,\u201d she says to him. \u201cNo more Val.\u201d Sky tries to look sad for my sake, but I know she\u2019s relieved. Val never really fit in with the two of them. Now that I think about it, she never really fit in with me, either.</p><p>Holder looks up at me curiously. \u201cDone for good? Really?\u201d He sounds oddly impressed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, really, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Val?\u201d Ice Cream Girl asks. \u201cOr better yet, who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my bad,\u201d Sky interrupts. She points back and forth between Ice Cream Girl and me. \u201cSix, this is Dean\u2019s best friend, Daniel. Daniel, this is my best friend, Six.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never get used to hearing Sky call him Dean, but her introduction gives me an excuse to look over at that spoon again. Six pulls it out of her mouth and points it at me. \u201cNice to meet you, Daniel,\u201d she says.</p><p>How in the hell can I steal that spoon before she leaves?</p><p>\u201cWhy does your name sound familiar?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI dunno. Maybe because six is a fairly common number? Either that or you\u2019ve heard of what a raging whore I am.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I don\u2019t know why I laugh, though, because her comment really wasn\u2019t funny. It was actually a little disturbing. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d I say, still confused as to why her name sounds so familiar. I don\u2019t think Sky has ever mentioned her in front of me before.</p><p>\u201cThe party last year,\u201d Holder says, forcing me to look at him again. I\u2019m pretty sure I roll my eyes when I have to look away from her, but I don\u2019t mean to. I\u2019d just much rather stare at her than at Holder. \u201cRemember?\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the week I got back from Austin and a few days before I met Sky. The night Grayson pummeled you on the floor for saying you took Sky\u2019s virginity?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, you mean the night you pulled me off of him before I even got the chance to kick his ass?\u201d It still irritates me just thinking about it. I could have had him if Holder hadn\u2019t stepped in.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Holder confirms. \u201cJaxon mentioned something that night about Sky and Six, but I didn\u2019t know who they were at the time. I think that\u2019s where you heard her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Sky says, waving her hands in the air and looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. \u201cWhat do you mean Grayson pummeled you because you said you took my virginity? What the hell, Daniel?\u201d</p><p>Holder puts a reassuring hand on Sky\u2019s lower back. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, babe. He just said it to piss Grayson off because I was about to kick the idiot\u2019s ass for the way he was talking about you.\u201d</p> <p>Sky is shaking her head, still confused. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t even know me. You just said it was a few days before you met me, so why would you be pissed that Grayson was talking shit about me?\u201d</p><p>I stare at Holder, too, waiting for his answer. I never thought about it then, but that is odd that he was pissed over Grayson\u2019s comments when he didn\u2019t even know Sky at the time.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like how he was talking about you,\u201d he says, leaning in to kiss Sky on the side of the head. \u201cIt made me think he probably talked about Les the same way and it pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Of course he would think that. Now I really wish he had let me kick Grayson\u2019s ass that night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, Holder,\u201d Six says. \u201cYou were protecting her before you even knew her.\u201d</p> <p>Holder laughs. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t know the half of it, Six.\u201d</p><p>Sky looks up at him and they smile at each other, almost like they have some sort of secret, then they both turn their attention back to the pictures on the floor in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I ask, inquiring about the pictures they\u2019re looking through.</p><p>\u201cFor the yearbook,\u201d Six says, answering me. She sets the bowl of ice cream on the bed beside her, then pulls her feet up and sits cross-legged. \u201cApparently we\u2019re supposed to submit pictures of ourselves as kids for the senior page, so Sky is going through the pics Karen gave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go to the same school as us?\u201d I ask, referring to the fact that she included herself in the explanation of the assignment. I know we go to a huge school, but I have a feeling I would remember her, especially if she\u2019s Sky\u2019s best friend.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to that school since junior year,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be there once Monday rolls around.\u201d She says it like she\u2019s not at all looking forward to it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but smile at her reply, though. I wouldn\u2019t mind having to see this girl on a recurring basis. \u201cSo does that mean you\u2019ll be joining our lunchroom alliance?\u201d I lean forward and grab the bowl of ice cream she didn\u2019t finish and pull it to me, then take a bite.</p><p>She watches me as I close my lips around the spoon and pull it out of my mouth. She scrunches up her nose, staring at the spoon. \u201cI could have herpes, you know,\u201d she says.</p><p>I grin at her and wink. \u201cYou somehow just made herpes sound appealing.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, but her bowl is suddenly ripped from my hands by Holder and he\u2019s pulling me off the bed. My feet hit the floor and he shoves me toward the window. \u201cGo home, Daniel,\u201d he says, releasing his grip on my shirt as he lowers himself back to the floor next to Sky.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d I yell.</p><p>Seriously, though. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Sky\u2019s best friend,\u201d he says, waving a hand in Six\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to flirt with her. If the two of you mess around it\u2019ll just cause tension and make things weird and I don\u2019t want that. Now leave and don\u2019t come back until you can be around her without having the perverted thoughts I know are going through your head right now.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in my life, I think I\u2019m actually speechless. Perhaps I should nod and agree with him, but the idiot just made the biggest mistake he could possibly make.</p> <p>\u201cShit, Holder,\u201d I groan, running my palms down my face. \u201cWhy the hell did you have to go and do that? You just made her off-limits, man.\u201d I begin to make my way back out the window. Once I\u2019m outside, I stick my head back through and look at him. \u201cYou should have told me I should date her, then I more than likely wouldn\u2019t have been interested. But you had to go and make her forbidden, didn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, Daniel,\u201d Six says, unenthusiastically. \u201cGlad to know you think of me as a human being and not a challenge.\u201d She looks at Holder as she stands up from the bed. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t realize I had a fifth overprotective brother,\u201d she says, making her way toward the window. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys later. I probably need to go rummage through my own pictures before Monday, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Holder glances back at me as I step aside and allow Six to climb out the window. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but the look he gives me is a silent warning that Six is completely off-limits to me. I raise my hands in defense, then pull the window shut after Six is outside. She walks a few feet to the house next door and begins to climb through that window.</p><p>\u201cDo you take short-cuts through windows all the time, or do you happen to live in that house?\u201d I ask, walking toward her. Once she\u2019s inside, she spins around and leans her head out. \u201cThis would be my window,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about following me inside. This window has been out of commission for almost a year and I have no plans to reopen for business.\u201d</p><p>She tucks her shoulder-length blonde hair behind her ears and I take a step back, hoping a little distance will allow my heart to stop attacking the walls of my chest. But now that Holder has stupidly declared her off-limits, all I want to do is figure out a way to recommission her window.</p><p>\u201cYou really have four older brothers?\u201d</p><p>She nods. I hate the fact that she has four older brothers, but only because it presents four more reasons why I shouldn\u2019t date her. Add that to Holder making her off-limits and I know she\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll be able to think about now.</p><p>Thanks, Holder. Thanks a lot.</p><p>She rests her chin in her hands and stares at me. It\u2019s dark outside, but the moon overhead is casting a light right on her face and she looks like a fucking angel. I don\u2019t even know if people should use the words fucking and angel in the same thought structure, but shit. She really looks like a fucking angel with her blonde hair and big eyes. I\u2019m not even sure what color her eyes are because it\u2019s dark and I didn\u2019t really pay attention when we were in Sky\u2019s bedroom, but whatever color they are, it\u2019s my new favorite color.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very charismatic,\u201d she says.</p><p>Jesus. Her voice completely slays me. \u201cThanks. You\u2019re pretty cute yourself.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you were cute, Daniel. I said you were charismatic. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of one,\u201d I say. \u201cYou like Italian?\u201d</p><p>She frowns and pulls back a few inches like I just insulted her. \u201cWhy would you ask me that?\u201d</p><p>Her reaction confuses me. I have no idea how that comment could have offended her. \u201cUh . . . have you never been asked out on a date before?\u201d</p><p>The scowl disappears from her face and she leans forward again. \u201cOh. You mean food. I\u2019m sort of tired of Italian food, actually. Just got back from a seven-month exchange there. If you\u2019re asking me out on a date, I\u2019d rather have sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had sushi,\u201d I admit, trying to process the fact that I\u2019m pretty sure she just agreed to go out on a date with me.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>This was way too easy. I figured she\u2019d put up a fight and make me beg a little like Val always does. I love that she isn\u2019t playing games. She\u2019s straightforward and I like that about her already.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you tonight,\u201d I say. \u201cI had my heart completely broken about an hour ago by a psychotic bitch and I need a little more time to recover from that relationship. How about tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is Sunday,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an issue with Sundays?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNot really, I guess. It just seems odd to go on a first date on a Sunday night. Meet me here at seven o\u2019clock, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at your front door,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you might not want to tell Sky where you\u2019re going unless you want to see me get my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to tell?\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going on a random Sunday night date or anything.\u201d</p><p>I smile and back away, slowly heading backward to my car. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Six.\u201d</p><p>She places her hand on her window to pull it down. \u201cLikewise. I think.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, then turn to head toward my car. I\u2019m almost to the door when she calls my name. I spin back around and she\u2019s leaning out her window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your broken heart,\u201d she whispers loudly. She ducks back into her bedroom and the window closes.</p><p>What broken heart? I\u2019m pretty sure this is the first time my heart has actually felt any form of relief since the moment I started dating Val.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cDoes this look okay?\u201d I ask Chunk when I make it into the kitchen. She turns and looks me up and down, then shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI guess. Where ya going?\u201d</p><p>I step in front of one of the mirrors lining the hallway and check my hair again. \u201cA date.\u201d</p><p>She groans, then turns back around to the table in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019ve never cared before what you look like. You better not be proposing to her. I\u2019ll divorce this family before I allow you to make her my sister.\u201d</p><p>My mother walks past me and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cYou look great, honey. I wouldn\u2019t wear those shoes, though.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my shoes. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with my shoes?\u201d</p><p>She opens a cabinet, takes out a pan, then turns to face me. Her eyes fall to my shoes again. \u201cThey\u2019re too bright.\u201d She turns and walks to the stove. \u201cShoes should never be neon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re yellow. Not neon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeon yellow,\u201d Chunk says.</p><p>\u201cNot saying I think they\u2019re ugly,\u201d my mother says. \u201cI just know Val, and Val is more than likely going to hate your shoes.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the kitchen counter and grab my keys, then put my cell phone in my pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what Val thinks.\u201d</p><p>My mother turns and looks at me curiously. \u201cWell you\u2019re asking your thirteen-year-old sister if you look good enough for your date, so I think you kind of do care what Val thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going out with Val. I broke up with Val. I have a new date tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chunk\u2019s arms go up in the air and she looks up to the ceiling. \u201cThank the Lord!\u201d she proclaims loudly.</p><p>My mother laughs and nods. \u201cYes. Thank the Lord,\u201d she says, relieved. She turns back toward the stove and I can\u2019t stop looking back and forth between the both of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Neither of you like Val?\u201d I know Val is a bitch, but my family seemed to like her. Especially my mom. I honestly thought she\u2019d be upset we broke up.</p><p>\u201cI hate Val,\u201d Chunk says.</p><p>\u201cGod, me, too,\u201d my mother groans.</p><p>\u201cMe three,\u201d my father says, walking past me.</p> <p>None of them are looking at me, but they\u2019re all responding like this has been a previously discussed topic.</p><p>\u201cYou mean all of you hated Val?\u201d</p><p>My father turns to face me. \u201cYour mother and I are masters at reverse psychology, Danny-boy. Don\u2019t act so surprised.\u201d</p><p>Chunk raises her hand in the air toward my father. \u201cMe, too, Dad. I reverse psychologized him, too.\u201d</p><p>My dad reaches over and high-fives Chunk\u2019s hand. \u201cWell played, Chunk.\u201d</p> <p>I lean against the frame of the door and stare at them. \u201cYou guys were just pretending to like Val? What the hell for?\u201d</p><p>My dad sits at the table and picks up a newspaper. \u201cChildren are naturally inclined to make choices that will displease their parents. If we had told you how we really felt about Val, you probably would have ended up marrying her just to spite us. Which is why we pretended to love her.\u201d</p><p>Assholes. All three of them. \u201cYou\u2019re never meeting another one of my girlfriends again.\u201d</p><p>My father laughs, but doesn\u2019t seem at all disappointed.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Chunk asks. \u201cThe girl you\u2019re actually making an effort for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damn business,\u201d I reply. \u201cNow that I know how this family works, I\u2019m never bringing her around any of you.\u201d</p> <p>I turn to head out the door and my mother calls after me. \u201cWell if it helps, we already love her, Daniel! She\u2019s a sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd beautiful,\u201d my dad says. \u201cShe\u2019s a keeper!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cY\u2019all suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Six says when she appears at her front door. She walks out of her house with her back to me, inserting her key in the lock.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to meet your parents?\u201d I ask, wondering why she\u2019s locking her door this early in the evening. She turns around and faces me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re old. They ate dinner like ten hours ago and went to bed at seven.\u201d</p><p>Blue. Her eyes are blue.</p><p>Holy shit, she\u2019s cute. Her hair is lighter than I thought it was last night in Sky\u2019s room. Her skin is flawless. It\u2019s like she\u2019s the same girl from last night, only now she\u2019s in HD. And I was right. She really does look like a fucking angel.</p> <p>She steps out of the way and I shut the screen door, still unable to take my eyes off her. \u201cI actually got here early,\u201d I say, finally replying to her first comment. \u201cHolder was dropping Sky off at her house and I swear it took them half an hour to say their good-byes. I had to wait until the coast was clear.\u201d</p><p>She slides her house key into her back pocket and nods. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I eye her up and down. \u201cDid you forget your purse?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNope. I hate purses.\u201d She pats her back pocket. \u201cAll I need is my house key. I didn\u2019t bother bringing money since this date was your idea. You\u2019re paying, right?\u201d</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Back up.</p><p>Let\u2019s assess the last thirty seconds, shall we?</p><p>She hates purses. That means she didn\u2019t bring makeup. Which means she won\u2019t constantly be reapplying that shit like Val does. It also means she\u2019s not hiding a gallon of perfume anywhere on her person. And it also means she had no plans at all to offer to pay for her half of dinner, which seems a little old-fashioned but for some reason I like it.</p><p>\u201cI love that you don\u2019t carry a purse,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI love that you don\u2019t carry one, either,\u201d she says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s in my car,\u201d I say, nudging my head toward my car.</p><p>She laughs again and begins walking toward the porch steps. I do the same until I see Sky standing just inside her room with her window wide open. I immediately grab Six by her shoulders and pull her until both of our backs are flat against the front door. \u201cYou can see Sky\u2019s window from the front yard. She\u2019ll see us.\u201d</p><p>Six glances up at me. \u201cYou\u2019re really taking this off-limits order seriously,\u201d she says in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d I whisper. \u201cHolder doesn\u2019t kid around when he forbids me to date people.\u201d</p><p>She arches a curious eyebrow. \u201cDoes Holder usually dictate who you can and can\u2019t date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re actually the first.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cThen how do you know he\u2019ll actually get mad over it?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t, really. But the thought of hiding it from him just seems sort of fun. Is it not a little bit exciting for you, hiding this date from Sky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cI guess it is.\u201d</p><p>Our backs are still pressed against the door and for some reason, we\u2019re still whispering. It\u2019s not like Sky could hear us from here, but again, the whispering makes it more fun. And I really like the sound of Six\u2019s voice when she whispers.</p><p>\u201cHow do you propose we get out of this situation, Six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says, pondering my question for a moment. \u201cNormally when I\u2019m attempting a risky, clandestine, secret date and I need to escape my house undetected, I ask myself, \u2018What would MacGyver do?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Oh, my god, this chick just mentioned MacGyver?</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I break my eyes away from hers long enough to hide the fact that I think I just fell for her and also to assess our escape route. I glance at the swing on the porch, then look back at Six when I\u2019m sure the cheesy grin is gone from my face.</p><p>\u201cI think MacGyver would take your porch swing and build an invisible force field out of grass and matches. Then he would attach a jet engine to it and fly it out of here undetected. Unfortunately I\u2019m all out of matches.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cHmmm,\u201d she says, squinting her eyes like she\u2019s coming up with some brilliant plan. \u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate inconvenience.\u201d She glances to my car parked in her driveway, then back up to me. \u201cWe could just crawl to your car so she doesn\u2019t see us.\u201d</p><p>And a brilliant plan it would be if it didn\u2019t involve a girl getting dirty. I\u2019ve learned in my six months of on-again off-again with Val that girls don\u2019t like to get dirty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get dirt on your hands,\u201d I warn her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can walk into a fancy sushi restaurant with dirty hands and jeans.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at her jeans, then back up to me. \u201cI know this great Bar-B-Q restaurant we could go to, instead. The floor is covered in discarded peanut shells. One time I saw this really fat guy eating at a booth and he wasn\u2019t even wearing a shirt.\u201d</p><p>I smile at the same time I fall a little harder for her. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>We both drop to our hands and knees and crawl our way off her porch. She\u2019s giggling and her laugh is just making me laugh. \u201cShh,\u201d I whisper when we reach the bottom of the steps. We crawl across the yard in a hurry, both of us glancing toward Sky\u2019s house every few feet. Once we reach the car, I reach up to my door handle. \u201cCrawl through the driver\u2019s side,\u201d I say to her. \u201cShe\u2019ll be less likely to see you.\u201d</p><p>I open the door for her and she crawls into the front seat. Once she\u2019s inside the car, I climb in after her and slide into my seat. We\u2019re both crouched down, which is pointless if you think about it. If Sky were to look out her bedroom window, she\u2019d see my car parked in Six\u2019s driveway. It wouldn\u2019t matter if she saw our heads or not.</p><p>Six wipes the dirt from her hands onto the legs of her jeans and it completely turns me on. She turns her head to face me and I\u2019m still staring at the dirt smeared across the thighs of her jeans. I somehow tear my gaze away and look her in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to disguise your car next time you come over,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is way too risky.\u201d</p><p>I like her comment a little too much.</p><p>\u201cConfident there\u2019ll be a next time already?\u201d I ask, smirking at her. \u201cThe date just started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cI might hate you by the end of the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I might hate you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d She props her foot up on the dash. \u201cI\u2019m unhateable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnhateable isn\u2019t even a real word.\u201d</p><p>She peers over her shoulder into the backseat, then faces forward again with a scowl. \u201cWhy does it smell like you had a harem of whores in here?\u201d She pulls her shirt up over her nose to cover up the smell.</p><p>\u201cDoes it still smell like perfume?\u201d I don\u2019t even smell it anymore. It\u2019s probably seeped into my pores and I\u2019m now immune to it.</p><p>She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d she says, her voice muffled by her shirt. \u201cRoll down a window.\u201d She makes a fake spitting sound like she\u2019s trying to get the taste of it out of her mouth and it makes me laugh.</p><p>I crank the car, then put it in reverse and begin to back out.</p><p>\u201cThe wind will mess up your hair if I roll down the windows. You didn\u2019t bring a purse, which means you didn\u2019t bring a brush, which means you won\u2019t be able to fix your hair when we get to the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>She reaches to her door and presses the button to roll down her window. \u201cI\u2019m already dirty and I\u2019d rather have messy hair than smell like a harem,\u201d she says. She rolls the window down completely, then motions for me to roll mine down as well, so I do.</p><p>I put the car in drive and press on the gas. The car immediately fills with wind and fresh air and her hair begins flying around in all directions, but she just relaxes into the seat.</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d she says, grinning at me. She closes her eyes while inhaling a deep breath of the fresh air.</p><p>I try to pay attention to the road, but she makes it pretty damn hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your brothers\u2019 names?\u201d I ask her. \u201cAre they numbers, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZachary, Michael, Aaron, and Evan. I\u2019m ten years younger than the youngest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you an accident?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cThe best kind. My mother was forty-two when she had me but they were excited when I came out a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came out a girl.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they name you Six if you were actually the fifth child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix isn\u2019t my name,\u201d she says. \u201cFull name is Seven Marie Jacobs, but I got mad at them for moving me to Texas when I was fourteen so I started calling myself Six to piss them off. They didn\u2019t really care, but I was stubborn and refused to give up. Now everyone calls me Six but them.\u201d</p><p>I love that she gave herself a nickname. My kind of girl.</p><p>\u201cQuestion still applies,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy did they name you Seven if you were actually the fifth child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason, really. My dad just liked the number.\u201d</p><p>I nod, then take a bite of food, eyeing her carefully. I\u2019m waiting for that moment. The one that always comes with girls, where the pedestal you place them on in the beginning gets kicked out from under them. It\u2019s usually the moment they start talking about ex-boyfriends or mention how many kids they want or they do something really annoying, like apply lipstick in the middle of dinner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve been waiting patiently for Six\u2019s flaws to stand out, but so far I can\u2019t find any. Granted, we\u2019ve only interacted with each other for a collective three or four hours now, so hers may just be buried deeper than other people\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a middle child?\u201d she asks. \u201cDo you suffer from middle-child syndrome?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cProbably about as much as you suffer from fifth-child syndrome. Besides, Hannah is four years older than me and Chunk is five years younger, so we have a nice spread.\u201d</p><p>She chokes on her drink with her laugh. \u201cChunk? You call your little sister Chunk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all call her Chunk. She was a fat baby.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYou have nicknames for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cYou call Sky Cheese Tits. You call Holder Hopeless. What do you call me when I\u2019m not around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I give people nicknames, I do it to their faces,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t figured yours out yet.\u201d I lean back in my seat and wonder myself why I haven\u2019t given her one yet. The nicknames I give people are usually pretty instant.</p><p>\u201cIs it a bad thing you haven\u2019t nicknamed me yet?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNot really. I\u2019m just still trying to figure you out is all. You\u2019re kind of contradictory.\u201d</p> <p>She arches an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m contradictory? In what ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them. You\u2019re cute as hell, but you don\u2019t give a shit what you look like. You look sweet, but I have a feeling you\u2019re just the right mix of good and evil. You seem really easygoing, like you aren\u2019t the type to play games with guys, but you\u2019re kind of a flirt. And I\u2019m not judging at all by this next observation, but I\u2019m aware of your reputation, yet you don\u2019t seem like the type who needs a guy\u2019s attention to stroke your self-esteem.\u201d</p><p>Her expression is tight as she takes in everything I\u2019ve just said. She reaches to her glass and takes a sip without breaking her stare. She finishes her drink, but holds the glass against her lips while she thinks. She eventually lowers it back to the table and looks down at her plate, picking up her fork.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like that anymore,\u201d she says softly, avoiding my gaze.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I hate the sadness in her voice now. Why do I always say stupid shit?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not how I used to be.\u201d</p> <p>Way to go, Daniel. Dumbass.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know you back then, so all I can do is judge the girl sitting in front of me right now. And so far, she\u2019s been a pretty damn cool date.\u201d</p><p>The smile spreads back to her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she says, looking back up at me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what type of date I\u2019d be, considering this is the first one I\u2019ve ever been on.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo need to stroke my ego,\u201d I say. \u201cI can handle the fact that I\u2019m not the first guy to ever express an interest in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a real date before. Guys tend to skip this whole part with me so they can just get to what they really want me for.\u201d</p><p>My smile disappears. I can tell by the look on her face she\u2019s being completely serious. I lean forward and look her hard in the eyes. \u201cThose guys were all fucktards.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Six. Those guys all need a good kick to the clit, because dinner-talk is by far the best part of you.\u201d</p> <p>When the sentence leaves my mouth, the smile leaves her face. She looks at me like no one\u2019s ever given her a genuine compliment before. It pisses me off.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this is the best part of me?\u201d she asks, somehow finding that teasing, flirtatious tone in her voice again. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had the pleasure of kissing me yet. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the best part of me, because I\u2019m a phenomenal kisser.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. I don\u2019t know if that was an invitation, but I want to send her my RSVP right this second. \u201cI have no doubt being kissed by you would be fantastic, but if I had to choose, I\u2019d take dinner-talk over a kiss any day.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes. \u201cI call bullshit,\u201d she says with a challenging glare. \u201cThere\u2019s no way any guy would pick dinner-talk over a good make-out session.\u201d</p><p>I attempt to return her challenging look, but she makes a good point.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I admit. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. But if I had my way, I\u2019d pick kissing you during dinner-talk. Get the best of both worlds.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head, impressed. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she says, leaning back in her seat. She folds her arms over her chest. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn those smooth moves?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my mouth with my napkin, then set it on top of my plate. I lift my elbows until they\u2019re resting on the back of the booth and I smile at her. \u201cI don\u2019t have smooth moves. I\u2019m just charismatic . . . remember?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curls up into a grin and she shakes her head like she knows she\u2019s in trouble. Her eyes are smiling at me and I realize I\u2019ve never felt like this before with any other girl. Not that I have it in my head that we\u2019re about to fall in love or we\u2019re soulmates or some shit like that. I\u2019ve just never been around a girl where being myself was actually a good thing. With Val, I was always trying my hardest not to piss her off. With past girlfriends, I always found myself holding back from all the shit I really wanted to say. I\u2019ve always felt like being myself with a girl wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing because I\u2019ll be the first to admit, I can be a little over the top.</p><p>It\u2019s different with Six, though. Not only does she get my sense of humor and my personality, but I feel like she encourages it. I feel like the real me is what she likes the most and every time she laughs or smiles at the perfect moment, I want to fist bump her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me,\u201d she says, breaking me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSo I am,\u201d I say, not bothering to look away.</p><p>She stares right back at me but her demeanor and expression grow competitive as she narrows her eyes and leans forward. She\u2019s silently challenging me to a staring contest.</p><p>\u201cNo blinking,\u201d she says, confirming my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOr laughing,\u201d I say.</p><p>And it\u2019s on. We silently stare at each other for so long, my eyes begin to water and my grip tightens on the table. I try my hardest to keep my eyes locked on hers but they want to stare at every inch of her. I want to stare at her mouth and those full, pink lips and that soft, silky blonde hair. Not to mention her smile. I could stare at her smile all day.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m staring at it right now so I\u2019m pretty sure that means I just lost the staring contest.</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d she says, right before she takes another drink of her water.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d I say bluntly. I\u2019m a little shocked I said it, but not really. I\u2019m pretty impatient and I really want to kiss her and I usually say whatever I\u2019m thinking, so . . .</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d she asks, looking at me like I\u2019m insane. She sets her glass back down on the table.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYep. Right now. I want to kiss you over dinner-talk so I can have the best of both worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I just ate onions,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s working her jaw back and forth, actually contemplating an answer. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says with a shrug. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>As soon as she gives me permission, I glance down at the table between us, wondering what the best way to do this would be. I could go sit with her on her side of the booth, but that might be invading her personal space too much. I reach in front of me and push my glass out of the way, then scoot hers to the left.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, placing my hands on top of the table as I lean toward her. She must have thought I was kidding by the way her eyes dart nervously around us, taking in the fact that we\u2019re about to experience our first kiss in public.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, this is awkward,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you really want our first kiss to be in the middle of a restaurant?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSo what if it\u2019s awkward? We\u2019ll have a do-over later. People put way too much stock in first kisses, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She tentatively places her palms facedown on the table, then pushes herself up and slowly leans in toward me. \u201cOkay, then,\u201d she says, following her words up with a sigh. \u201cBut it would be so much better if you wait until the end of our date when you walk me to my front door and it\u2019ll be dark and we could be really nervous and you could accidentally touch my boob. That\u2019s how first kisses are supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at her comment. We still aren\u2019t close enough for me to kiss her yet, but we\u2019re getting there. I lean forward a little more, but her eyes leave mine and focus on the table behind me.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, there\u2019s a woman in the booth behind you changing her baby\u2019s diaper on the table. You\u2019re about to kiss me and the last thing I\u2019ll see before your lips touch mine is a woman wiping her infant\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. Look at me.\u201d She brings her eyes back to mine and we\u2019re finally close enough that I could reach her mouth. \u201cIgnore the diaper,\u201d I command. \u201cAnd ignore the two men in the booth to our left who are swigging their beer and watching us like I\u2019m about to bend you over this table.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dart to the left, so I catch her chin in my hand and force her attention back to me. \u201cIgnore it all. I want to kiss you and I want you to want me to kiss you and I don\u2019t really feel like waiting until I walk you to your porch tonight because I\u2019ve never really wanted to kiss someone this much before.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drop to my mouth and I watch as everything around us disappears from her field of vision. Her tongue slips out of her mouth and glides nervously across her lips before it disappears again. I slide my hand from her chin to the nape of her neck and I pull her forward until our lips meet.</p><p>And holy shit, do they meet. Our mouths meld together like they used to be in love and they\u2019re just now seeing each other for the first time in years. My stomach feels like it\u2019s in the middle of a damn rave and my brain is trying to remember how to do this. It\u2019s like I suddenly forgot how to kiss, even though it\u2019s only been a day since I broke up with Val. I\u2019m pretty sure I kissed Val yesterday, but for some reason my brain is acting like this is all new and it\u2019s telling me I should be parting my lips or teasing her tongue, but the signals just aren\u2019t making it to my mouth yet. Or my mouth is just ignoring me because it\u2019s been paralyzed by the soft warmth pressed against it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is, but I\u2019ve never held a girl\u2019s lips between mine for this long without breathing or moving or taking the kiss as far as I can possibly take it.</p><p>I inhale, even though I haven\u2019t taken a breath in almost a minute. I loosen my grip on the back of Six\u2019s head and begin to slowly pull my lips from hers. I open my eyes and hers are still closed. Her lips haven\u2019t moved and she\u2019s taking in shallow, quiet breaths as I remain poised close to her face, watching her.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if she expected more of a kiss. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever had a peck last more than a minute before. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, but I love the look on her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes,\u201d I whisper, still staring at her. \u201cGive me ten more seconds to stare, because you look absolutely beautiful right now.\u201d</p><p>She tucks her bottom lip in with her teeth to hide her smile, but she doesn\u2019t move. My hand is still on the back of her head and I\u2019m silently counting down from ten when I hear the waitress pause at our table.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all ready for your ticket?\u201d</p><p>I hold up a finger, asking the waitress to give me a second. Well, five seconds to be exact. Six never moves a muscle, even after hearing the waitress speak. I count down silently until my ten seconds are up, then Six slowly opens her eyes and looks up at me.</p> <p>I back away from her, putting several inches of space between us. I keep my eyes locked with hers. \u201cYes, please,\u201d I say, giving the waitress her answer. I hear her tear off the ticket and slap it down on the table. Six smiles, then begins laughing. She backs away from me and falls back down in her booth.</p><p>I breathe and it feels like the air is all brand new.</p><p>I slowly take my seat in the booth again, watching her laugh. She scoots the ticket toward me. \u201cYour treat,\u201d she says.</p><p>I reach into my pocket and pull out my wallet, then lay cash down on top of the ticket. I stand up and reach out for Six\u2019s hand. She looks at it and smiles, then takes it. When she stands, I wrap my arm around her shoulder and pull her against me.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me how awesome that kiss was or are you going to ignore it?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head and laughs at me. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even a real kiss,\u201d she says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even try to put your tongue in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>I push open the doors to walk outside, but step aside and let her out first.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to put my tongue in your mouth,\u201d I say. \u201cMy kisses are that intense. I don\u2019t even really have to do anything. The only reason I pulled back was that I was sure we were about to experience a classic, \u2018When Harry met Sally\u2019 moment.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again.</p><p>God, I love that she thinks I\u2019m funny.</p><p>I open the passenger door for her and she pauses before climbing inside. She looks up at me. \u201cYou realize that classic scene is Sally proving a point about how easy it is for women to fake orgasms, right?\u201d</p> <p>God, I love that I think she\u2019s funny.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to take you home yet?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you have in mind next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing really,\u201d I admit. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to take you home yet. We could go to the park next to my house. They have a jungle gym.\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d she says, holding up a tight fist in front of her.</p><p>I naturally bring my fist up and bump hers. She hops into the car and I shut her door, dumbfounded over the fact that she just fist bumped me.</p><p>The girl just fist bumped me and it was probably the hottest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>I walk to my side of the car and open the door, then take a seat. Before I crank the car I turn to look at her. \u201cAre you really a guy?\u201d</p> <p>She raises an eyebrow, then pulls the collar of her shirt out and takes a quick glance down at her chest. \u201cNope. Pretty damn girl,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAre you dating someone?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving the country tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she says, her face obviously confused by my line of questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has something and I can\u2019t figure yours out. You know, that one thing about themselves that\u2019s eventually a deal-breaker.\u201d I crank the car and begin to back out. \u201cI want to know what yours is right now. My heart can\u2019t take another second of these tiny little things you do that drive me completely insane.\u201d</p><p>Her smile changes. It grows from a genuine smile to a guarded one. \u201cWe all have deal-breakers, Daniel. Some of us just hope we can keep them hidden forever.\u201d</p><p>She rolls down her window again and the noise makes it impossible to continue the conversation. I\u2019m almost positive the overwhelming scent of perfume is gone, so I\u2019m curious if her need for the noise is why she rolled down the window this time.</p><p>\u201cDo you bring all your dates here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I think about her question for a minute before answering. \u201cPretty much,\u201d I finally say after silently tallying the ends of all my dates. \u201cI did take this chick out once in eleventh grade but I took her home during the middle of the date because she got a stomach virus. I think she\u2019s the only one I never brought here.\u201d</p><p>She digs her heels into the dirt and comes to a stop in the swing. I\u2019m standing behind her, so she turns around and looks up at me. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019ve brought all but one girl here?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Then nod. \u201cYeah. But none of them has ever wanted to literally play before. We usually just make out.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve been here half an hour and already she\u2019s made me watch her on the monkey bars, push her on the merry-go-round and now I\u2019ve been pushing her while she swings for the last ten minutes. I\u2019m not complaining, though. It\u2019s nice. Really nice.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had sex out here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to take her bluntness. I\u2019ve never really met anyone who asks the same straightforward questions I would, so I\u2019m beginning to feel a little sympathetic to the people I put on the spot like this. I glance around the park until I see the makeshift wooden castle. I point to it. \u201cYou see the castle?\u201d</p><p>She turns her head to look at the castle. \u201cYou had sex in there?\u201d</p><p>I drop my arm and slide both my hands into the back pockets of my jeans. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She stands and begins to walk in that direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask her. I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s heading toward the castle, but I\u2019m almost positive it\u2019s not because she\u2019s weird and wants to have sex in the same spot I had sex with Val two weeks ago.</p><p>Does she?</p><p>God I hope not.</p><p>\u201cI want to see where you had sex,\u201d she says, matter-of-fact. \u201cCome show me.\u201d</p><p>This girl confuses the hell out of me. What\u2019s strange is how much I freaking love it. I begin jogging until I catch up with her. We walk until we reach the castle. She looks at me expectantly, so I point to the doorway. \u201cRight in there,\u201d I say.</p><p>She walks to the doorway and peeks inside. She looks around for a minute, then pulls back out. \u201cLooks really uncomfortable,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cIf I tell you something will you promise not to judge me?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to judge.\u201d</p><p>She inhales a breath, then releases it. \u201cI\u2019ve had sex with six different people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once?\u201d I say.</p><p>She shoves my arm. \u201cStop. I\u2019m trying to be honest with you here. I\u2019m only eighteen and I lost my virginity when I was sixteen. Plus, I haven\u2019t had sex in about a year, so if you add it up, that\u2019s six people in just a little over fifteen months. That\u2019s like a whole new person every two and a half months. Only sluts do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have you not had sex in over a year?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and begins to walk past me. I follow her. When she reaches the swings, she takes her seat again. I sit in the swing beside her and twist my body until I\u2019m facing her, but she faces forward.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you not had sex in over a year?\u201d I say again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like any of the boys you met in Italy?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t see her face, but her body language reveals that this could be that one thing. The thing that changes it all for me.</p><p>\u201cThere was this one boy in Italy,\u201d she says softly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to talk about him. And yes, he\u2019s why I haven\u2019t had sex in over a year.\u201d She looks back at me. \u201cLook, I know my reputation precedes me and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s why you brought me here or what you expect to happen at the end of this date, but I\u2019m not that girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>I lift my legs until my swing spins forward again. \u201cThe only thing I was hoping for at the end of this date was a kiss on your front porch,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd maybe an accidental boob grab.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t laugh. I suddenly hate that I brought her here.</p><p>\u201cSix, I didn\u2019t bring you here expecting anything. Yes, I\u2019ve brought girls here in the past but that\u2019s only because I live across the street and I come here a lot. And yes, maybe I brought all those other girls here to have a little privacy while we made out, but that\u2019s only because I more than likely just wanted them to shut up and kiss me because they were getting on my everlasting nerves. But I only brought you here because I wasn\u2019t ready to take you home yet. I don\u2019t even really want to make out with you because I like talking to you too much.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, wishing I hadn\u2019t just said all that. I know girls like guys who play the uninterested asshole part. I\u2019m usually pretty good at playing that part, but not with Six. Maybe because I usually am an uninterested asshole, but with her I\u2019m as interested and curious and hopeful as I can possibly be.</p><p>\u201cWhich house is yours?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I point across the street. \u201cThat one,\u201d I say, pointing to the one with the living room light on.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks, sounding genuinely interested. \u201cIs your family home?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, but you aren\u2019t meeting them. They\u2019re evil liars and I already told them I was never bringing you home to meet them.\u201d</p><p>I can feel her turn and look at me. \u201cYou told them you were never bringing me to meet them? So you already mentioned me?\u201d</p><p>I meet her gaze. \u201cYes. I might have mentioned you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cWhich one is your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst window on the left side of the house. Chunk\u2019s bedroom is the window on the right. The one with the light on.\u201d</p><p>She stands up again. \u201cIs your window unlocked? I want to see what your bedroom looks like.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, she\u2019s nosey.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to see my bedroom. I\u2019m unprepared. It\u2019s messy.\u201d</p><p>She begins walking toward the street. \u201cI\u2019m going anyway.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head back and groan, then stand up and follow her toward the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of work,\u201d I say as we reach my window. She presses her palms against the glass and pushes up. The window doesn\u2019t budge, so I push her aside and open it for her. \u201cI\u2019ve never snuck into my own bedroom before,\u201d I admit. \u201cI\u2019ve snuck out before, but never in.\u201d</p><p>She begins to lift herself up over the ledge, so I grab her by the waist and assist her. She throws her leg over the edge of it and slips inside. I climb in behind her, then walk to the dresser and turn on my lamp. I make a scan of the room to ensure there isn\u2019t anything I don\u2019t want her to see. I kick a pair of underwear under the bed.</p><p>\u201cI saw those,\u201d she whispers. She walks to my bed and presses her palms into the mattress, then straightens back up. She scans the room slowly, taking in everything about me. It feels weird, like I\u2019m being exposed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like your room,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a room.\u201d</p><p>She disagrees with a shake of her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that. This is where you live. This is where you sleep. This is where you feel the most privacy in your whole entire life. This is more than just a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel very private right now,\u201d I say, watching as she skims her hand across every surface of my room. She turns and looks at me, then faces me full-on.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing in this room that tells the biggest secret about you?\u201d</p><p>I laugh under my breath. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you that.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head. \u201cSo I\u2019m right. You have secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one,\u201d she asks. \u201cJust one.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll give them all to her if she keeps looking at me like this. She\u2019s so damn adorable. I walk slowly toward her and she swallows a gulp of air. I stop when I\u2019m several inches from her, then I nod my head down toward my mattress. \u201cI\u2019ve never kissed a girl on this bed,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She looks down at my mattress, then back up to me. \u201cI hope you really don\u2019t expect me to believe you\u2019ve never made out with a girl in your room before.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I stated I had never kissed a girl on this particular bed. I was being honest, because it\u2019s a brand-new mattress. I just got it last week.\u201d</p><p>I can see the change in her eyes. The heavy rise and fall of her chest. She likes that I\u2019m so close to her and she likes that I\u2019m insinuating I want to kiss her on my bed.</p><p>Her eyes fall to the bed. \u201cAre you saying you want to kiss me on your bed?\u201d</p><p>I lean in closer until my lips are right next to her ear. \u201cAre you saying you would let me?\u201d</p> <p>She sucks in a soft rush of air and I love that we\u2019re both feeling this. I want to kiss her on my bed so damn bad. I want it more than I even wanted the damn bed. Hell, I don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s on the bed. I just want to kiss her. I don\u2019t care where it is. I\u2019ll kiss her anywhere she\u2019ll allow me to kiss her.</p><p>I close the small gap between our bodies by resting my hands on her hips and pulling her to me. Her hands fly up to my forearms and she gasps. I dig my fingers into her hips and rest my cheek against hers. My mouth is still grazing her ear as I close my eyes, enjoying the feel of this.</p><p>I love the way she smells. I love the way she feels. And even though I haven\u2019t really given her an honest to God kiss yet, I already love the way she kisses.</p><p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d she whispers. My name crashes against my shoulder when it rushes out of her mouth. \u201cWill you take me home now?\u201d</p><p>I wince at her words, immediately wondering what I just did wrong. I remain still for several long seconds, waiting until the feel of her against me no longer has me completely paralyzed.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d she says, immediately easing the doubt building inside me. \u201cI just think I should go home.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is soft and sweet and I suddenly hate every single guy in her past who has ever failed to get to know this side of her.</p><p>I don\u2019t release her immediately. I turn my head slightly until my forehead is touching the side of her head. \u201cDid you love him?\u201d I ask, allowing my brilliant brain to completely ruin this moment between us.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy in Italy,\u201d I clarify. \u201cThe one who hurt you. Did you love him?\u201d</p><p>Her forehead meets my shoulder and the way she fails to respond to that question reveals her answer, but it also fills me with so many more questions. I want to ask her if she still loves him. If she\u2019s still with him. If they still talk.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, though, because I have a feeling she wouldn\u2019t be here with me right now if any of that were the case. I bring my hand up to the back of her head and I press my lips into her hair. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cThanks for buying me dinner,\u201d she says when we reach her front door.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t really give me a choice. You left your house without a penny and then you shoved the bill in my face.\u201d</p><p>She laughs as she unlocks her front door, but doesn\u2019t open it yet. She turns back around and lifts her eyes, looking at me through lashes so long and thick, I have to refrain from reaching out and touching them.</p><p>Kissing her at dinner was definitely spontaneous, but I was sure it would make this moment a breeze.</p><p>It hasn\u2019t.</p><p>If anything, I feel even more pressure to kiss her because it\u2019s already happened once tonight. And the fact that it\u2019s already happened and I know how damn good it feels makes me want it even more, but now I\u2019m scared I\u2019ve built it up too much.</p><p>I begin to lean in toward her when her lips part.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna use tongue this time?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and take a step back, completely thrown off by her comment. I rub my palms down my face and groan.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Six. I was already feeling inadequate. Now you\u2019ve just put expectations on it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smiling when I look at her again. \u201cOh, there are definitely expectations,\u201d she says teasingly. \u201cI expect this to be the most mind-blowing thing I\u2019ve ever experienced, so you better deliver.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, wondering if the moment can possibly be recovered. I doubt it. \u201cI\u2019m not kissing you now.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head. \u201cYes you are.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not. You just gave me performance anxiety.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step toward me and slides her hands between my folded arms, pushing against them until they unlock. \u201cDaniel Wesley, you owe me a do-over since you made me kiss you in a crowded restaurant next to a dirty diaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t crowded,\u201d I interject.</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cPut your hands on my face and push me against this wall and slip me some tongue! Now!\u201d</p><p>Before she can laugh at herself, my hands are casing her face and her back is pressed against the wall of her house and my lips are on hers. It happens so fast, it catches her off guard and she gasps, which causes her lips to part farther than she probably meant for them to. As soon as I caress the tip of her tongue with mine, she\u2019s clenching my shirt in two tight fists, pulling me closer. I tilt my head and take the kiss deeper, wanting to give her all the feels she can possibly get from a kiss and I want her to have them all at once.</p><p>My mouth isn\u2019t having a problem remembering what to do this time. What it\u2019s having a problem with is remembering how to slow down. Her hands are now in my hair and if she moans into my damn mouth one more time I\u2019m afraid I might carry her to the backseat of my car and try to cheapen this date.</p><p>I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. I like this girl too much already and I\u2019ll be damned if this isn\u2019t our first date and she already has me thinking about the next one. I brace my hands on the wall behind her head and I force myself to push off of her.</p><p>We\u2019re both panting. Gasping for breath. I\u2019m breathing heavier than any kiss has ever made me breathe before. Her eyes are closed and I absolutely love how she doesn\u2019t immediately open them when I\u2019m finished kissing her. I like that she seems to want to savor the way I make her feel, just like I want to savor her.</p><p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I groan and drop my forehead to hers, touching her cheek with my hand. \u201cYou make me love my name so damn much.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes and I pull back, looking down on her, still stroking her cheek. She\u2019s looking at me the same way I\u2019m looking at her. Like we can\u2019t believe our luck.</p><p>\u201cYou better not turn out to be an asshole,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you better be done with that guy in Italy,\u201d I reply.</p><p>She nods. \u201cI am,\u201d she says, although her eyes seem to tell a different story. I try not to read into it because whatever it is, it doesn\u2019t matter now. She\u2019s here with me. And she\u2019s happy about that. I can tell.</p><p>\u201cYou better not take back the girl who broke your heart last night,\u201d she adds.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNever. Not after this. Not after you.\u201d</p><p>She seems relieved by my answer.</p><p>\u201cThis is scary,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a boyfriend before. I don\u2019t know how this works. Do people become exclusive this fast? Are we supposed to pretend we\u2019re not that interested for a few more dates?\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear God.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been turned on by a girl laying claim to me before. I usually run in the other direction. She\u2019s obliterating every single thing I thought I knew about myself with every new sentence that passes those lips.</p><p>\u201cI have no interest in faking disinterest,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you want to call yourself my girlfriend half as much as I wish you would, then it would save me a whole lot of begging. Because I was literally about to drop to my knees and beg you.\u201d</p><p>She squints her eyes playfully. \u201cNo begging. It screams desperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me desperate,\u201d I say, pressing my lips to hers again. I choose to keep this kiss simple, even though I want to grab her face again and hold her against the wall. I pull away from her and we stare at each other. We stare at each other for so long I begin to worry that she\u2019s put some kind of spell on me, because I\u2019ve never wanted to just stare at a girl like I want to stare at her. Just looking at her causes my heart to burn and my chest to constrict and I\u2019m sort of freaking out that I barely know her at all and we\u2019ve just made ourselves exclusive.</p><p>\u201cAre you a witch?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Her laugh returns and I suddenly don\u2019t care if she\u2019s a witch. If this is some kind of spell she\u2019s put on me, I hope it never breaks.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea who you even are and now you\u2019re my damn girlfriend. What the hell have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>She holds her palms up defensively. \u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me. I\u2019ve gone eighteen years swearing off boyfriends and then you show up out of the blue with your vulgar mouth and terribly awkward first kisses and now look at me. I\u2019m a hypocrite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know your phone number,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know your birthday,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst girlfriend I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and I kiss her again. I notice I have to kiss her every time she laughs and she laughs a lot. Which means I have to kiss her a lot. God, I hope she doesn\u2019t laugh in front of Sky or Holder because it\u2019s going to be so damn hard not to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cYou better not tell Sky about us,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t want Holder to know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about school? I enroll tomorrow. You don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be obvious when we interact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pretend we hate each other. It could be fun.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her face up and finds my mouth again, giving me a light peck. \u201cBut how do you plan on keeping your hands off me?\u201d</p><p>I slide my other hand to her waist. \u201cI won\u2019t keep my hands off you. I\u2019ll just touch you when they aren\u2019t looking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is gonna be so much fun,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I smile and pull her against me again. \u201cDamn right it is.\u201d I dip my head and kiss her one last time. I release her, then reach behind her and turn the doorknob, pushing open her front door. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She backs up two steps until she\u2019s in her doorway. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She begins to turn and head into her house, but I grab her wrist and pull her back out. I wrap an arm around her lower back and lean in until my lips touch hers. \u201cI forgot to accidentally touch your boob.\u201d</p> <p>I catch her laugh with my mouth and graze her breast with the palm of my hand, then I immediately pull away from her. \u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s covering her laugh with her hand as she backs into her house. She closes the door and I immediately fall to my knees, then onto my back. I stare straight up at the roof of her porch, wondering what in the hell just happened to my heart.</p><p>The door slowly reopens and she looks down at me, sprawled across her front porch like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI just needed a minute to recover,\u201d I say, smiling up at her. I\u2019m not even excusing the fact that I\u2019m shamelessly affected by her. She winks, then begins to close the door.</p><p>\u201cSix, wait,\u201d I say, pushing myself up. She opens the door again and I reach up and grab the doorframe, then lean in toward her. \u201cI know I just broke up with someone last night, but I need you to know you aren\u2019t a rebound. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cI know,\u201d she says confidently. \u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>With that, she steps back into her house and closes her door.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>Motherfucking angel.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d I tell her for the fifth time.</p> <p>She grabs her backpack and groans, then stands up and pushes her chair in. \u201cWhat\u2019s your freakin\u2019 deal, Daniel? You\u2019re never in a hurry to get to school.\u201d She downs the rest of her orange juice. I\u2019m standing at the door where I\u2019ve been standing for five minutes, ready to leave. I hold open the front door and follow her outside.</p><p>Once we\u2019re in the car I don\u2019t even wait for her to shut her door before I\u2019m putting it in reverse.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, why are you in such a hurry?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cYou were just being really slow.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she needs to know is how utterly pathetic I am. So pathetic I\u2019ve been awake for two hours now, waiting until we could leave. I probably won\u2019t even see Six until lunch if we don\u2019t have classes together, so I really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m in a hurry.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think about that. I hope we do have classes together.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date last night?\u201d Chunk asks as she puts on her seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cDid you kiss her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really. What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not whatever nickname you gave her. What does everyone else call her?\u201d</p><p>I roll my head and look at her. \u201cSix. They call her Six.\u201d</p><p>Chunk scrunches up her nose. \u201cWeird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fits her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Hold up.</p><p>Do I want to?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Yes? Shit. I don\u2019t know. How screwed up is it that I broke up with a girl two days ago and I\u2019m already contemplating the possibility of loving someone else?</p><p>Well, technically, I don\u2019t think I really loved Val. I sort of thought I did on occasion, but I think if a person is really, truly in love then it has to be unconditional. How I felt about Val was definitely not unconditional. I had conditions for every single feeling I had about her. Hell, the only reason I ever asked her out in the first place is that for about fifteen seconds, I thought she was Cinderella.</p><p>After that experience in the closet last year, that mystery girl was all I could think about. I looked for her everywhere, even though I had no idea what she looked like. I was pretty sure she had blonde hair, but it was dark, so I could have been wrong. I listened to every single girl\u2019s voice I walked past to see if they sounded like her. The problem was, they all sounded like her. It\u2019s hard to memorize a voice when you don\u2019t have a face to back it up with, so I would always find small things that reminded me of her in every girl I spoke to.</p><p>With Val, I actually convinced myself she was Cinderella. I was walking past her in the hallway one afternoon on my way to History class. I\u2019d seen her in the past but never paid much attention to her because she seemed a little high-maintenance for me. I accidentally bumped her shoulder when I passed her because my head was turned and I was talking to someone else. She called out after me, \u201cWatch it, kid.\u201d</p><p>I froze in my tracks. I was too scared to turn around because hearing her use the term \u201ckid\u201d had me convinced I was about to come face to face with the girl from the closet. When I finally gained the courage to turn around, I was floored by how hot she was. I always hoped if I ever found out who Cinderella was that I\u2019d be attracted to her. But Val was way hotter than how I\u2019d been fantasizing.</p><p>I walked back up to her and made her repeat what she said. She looked shocked, but she repeated it anyway. When the words fell from her mouth again, I immediately leaned forward and kissed her. As soon as I kissed her I knew she wasn\u2019t Cinderella. Her mouth was different. Not bad different, just different. When I pulled back after realizing it wasn\u2019t her, I was a little annoyed with myself for not just letting it go. I was never going to find out who the girl was, so there was no point in dwelling on it. Plus, Val really was hot. I forced myself to ask her out that day and thus began \u201cthe relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just passed my school,\u201d Chunk says.</p><p>I slam on the brakes when I realize she\u2019s right. I kick the car into reverse and back up, then pull over to let her out. She looks out the passenger window and sighs.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, we\u2019re so early there isn\u2019t even anyone else here yet.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and look out her window, scanning the school. \u201cNot true,\u201d I say, pointing to someone pulling into a parking spot. \u201cThere\u2019s someone.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s the maintenance guy. I beat the freaking maintenance guy to school.\u201d She opens her door and steps out, then turns and leans into the car before shutting her door. \u201cDo I need to plan for you to be here to pick me up an hour early, too? Is your brain stuck in Eastern Time today?\u201d</p><p>I ignore her comment and she shuts the door, then I hit the gas and drive toward the school.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what kind of car she drives, so I pull into my usual spot and wait. There are a few other cars here, including Sky and Holder\u2019s, but I know they\u2019re at the track running like they do every morning.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t know what kind of car she drives. I also still don\u2019t know her phone number. Or her birthday. Or her favorite color or what she wants to be when she\u2019s older or why the hell she chose Italy for her foreign exchange or what her parents\u2019 names are or what kind of food she eats.</p><p>My palms begin to sweat, so I wipe them on my jeans, then grip my steering wheel. What if she\u2019s really annoying around other people? What if she\u2019s a junkie? What if . . .</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Her voice breaks me out of my near\u2013panic attack. It also calms me the hell down because as soon as I see her sliding into the front seat of my car, my unjustified fears are replaced by pure relief.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She shuts her door and pulls her leg up, turning to face me in the car. She smells so good. She doesn\u2019t smell like perfume at all . . . she just smells good. Kind of fruity.</p><p>\u201cHave you had your panic attack yet?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Confusion clouds my face. I don\u2019t have time to answer her before she begins talking again.</p><p>\u201cI had one this morning,\u201d she says, looking at everything else around us, unable to make eye contact with me. \u201cI just keep thinking we\u2019re idiots. Like maybe this connection we think we have is all in our heads and we didn\u2019t really have as much fun as we thought we did last night. I don\u2019t even know you, Daniel. I don\u2019t know your birthday, your middle name, Chunk\u2019s real name, if you have any pets, what your major will be in college. I know it\u2019s not like we made this huge commitment or got married or had sex, but you have to understand that I have never thought the idea of having a boyfriend was even remotely appealing and maybe I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that appealing, but . . .\u201d</p><p>She finally looks at me and makes eye contact. \u201cBut you\u2019re so funny and this entire past year has been the worst year of my life and for some reason when I\u2019m with you it feels good. Even though I hardly know you, the parts of you I do know I really, really like.\u201d She leans her head into the headrest and sighs. \u201cAnd you\u2019re cute. Really cute. I like staring at you.\u201d</p><p>I turn in my seat and mirror her position by resting my head against my own headrest. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cI had my panic attack right before you got in the car just now. But when you opened your door and I heard your voice, it went away. I think I\u2019m good now.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I smile back at her and we both just stare at each other for several seconds. I want to kiss her but I also kind of like just staring at her. I would hold her hand, but she\u2019s running her fingers up and down the seam of the passenger seat and I like watching her do that.</p><p>\u201cI should go inside and register for classes now,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you get second lunch.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to pretend I hate you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to pretend I hate you more.\u201d</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s about to turn, so I lean forward and slip my hand behind her neck, then pull her to me. I kiss her good morning, hello and good-bye all at once. When I pull back, I glance over her shoulder and see Sky and Holder making their way off the track and toward the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I push her head down between us. \u201cThey\u2019re coming this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>She begins humming the theme to Mission Impossible and I start laughing. I start to crouch down with her, but if they reach my car they\u2019ll see us whether our heads are down or not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get out of the car so they don\u2019t come over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she says, her voice muffled by her arms. \u201cI think you just gave me whiplash.\u201d</p><p>I lean over and kiss the back of her head. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll see you later. Lock my doors when you get out.\u201d</p><p>I open the car door just as Holder begins to head in my direction. I start walking their way to intercept them. \u201cGood run?\u201d I ask when I reach them.</p><p>They both nod, out of breath. \u201cI need my change of clothes,\u201d Sky says to Holder, pointing to her car. \u201cWant me to grab yours?\u201d Holder nods and she heads in that direction. Holder\u2019s eyes move from hers over to mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you here so early?\u201d he asks.

I think really hard, but I\u2019m drawing a blank about what could be going on tonight that I would need to go to.</p> <p>\u201cDaniel, do you even know what the hell I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo idea,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cDinner at Sky\u2019s house. Karen invited you and Val? They\u2019re having a big welcome-back thing for Sky\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>That gets my attention. \u201cYeah, of course I\u2019ll be there. Not bringing Val, though. We broke up, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but dinner is still ten hours away. You might love her again by then.\u201d</p> <p>Sky walks up and hands Holder his bag. \u201cDaniel, have you seen Six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I immediately blurt out.</p><p>Sky glances toward the school, not having noticed the defensiveness in my immediate response. \u201cShe must be registering for classes inside.\u201d She turns to Holder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go find her.\u201d She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, but Holder\u2019s eyes remain on mine.</p><p>They\u2019re narrowed.</p><p>This isn\u2019t good.</p><p>Sky walks away and I begin to walk right behind her, toward the school. Holder\u2019s hand lands on my shoulder when I pass him, so I pause. I turn around, but it takes me a few seconds to look him in the eyes. When I do, he doesn\u2019t look happy.</p> <p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow to match his expression. \u201cHolder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know what you are talking about,\u201d I reply innocently.</p><p>\u201cYou do know what I am talking about because when you are lying, you do not use contractions when you speak.\u201d</p><p>I ponder his observation for a few seconds. Is that true?</p><p>Shit. It\u2019s true.</p><p>I breathe out a heavy breath and do my best to look like I\u2019m giving him a confession. \u201cFine,\u201d I say, kicking at the dirt beneath my feet. \u201cI had sex with Val just now. In my car. I didn\u2019t want you to know because you and Sky seemed excited that we broke up.\u201d</p> <p>Tension releases from Holder\u2019s shoulders and he shakes his head. \u201cDude, I could care less who you date. You know that.\u201d He begins walking toward the school, so I follow suit. \u201cUnless it\u2019s Six,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to date Six.\u201d</p><p>I keep walking forward, even though that comment makes me want to freeze. \u201cI have no desire to date Six,\u201d I say. \u201cShe\u2019s not really that cute, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He stops in his tracks and spins around to face me. He holds up a finger like he\u2019s about to lecture me. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to talk shit about her, either.\u201d</p><p>Christ. Hiding our relationship from him may be more exhausting than it is fun. \u201cNo loving her, no hating her, no screwing her, no dating her. Got it. Anything else you want to add?\u201d</p><p>He thinks for a second, then lowers his arm. \u201cNope. That covers it. See you at lunch.\u201d He turns and walks inside. I glance back to the parking lot in time to see Six sneaking out of my car. She gives me a quick wave. I wave back, then turn and head inside.</p><p>I walk my tray toward the table and internally rejoice when I see the only available spot is right next to Six. She glances at me as I walk up and her eyes smile, but only briefly. I set my tray down across from Holder and find my way into the current conversation. Everyone is discussing the dinner at Sky\u2019s house tonight, but I\u2019ve had dinner there before. Karen doesn\u2019t know what real food is. She\u2019s vegan, so I normally turn down meals at their house. Not tonight, though.</p><p>\u201cWill there be meat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Sky nods. \u201cYeah. Jack\u2019s actually cooking, so the food should be good. I also baked a chocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>I reach across the table for the salt, even though I don\u2019t need it. It gives me an excuse to lean in ridiculously close to Six.</p><p>\u201cSo, Six. How do you like your classes?\u201d I ask casually.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see your schedule.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes like I\u2019m doing something wrong. I give her a look to let her know she has nothing to worry about. Even if I wasn\u2019t into her, I\u2019m not an asshole. I\u2019d still be making conversation with her.</p><p>\u201cIt sucks we don\u2019t have any classes together,\u201d Sky says. \u201cWho do you have for History?\u201d</p><p>Six pulls her schedule out of her pocket and hands it to me. I open it and make a quick scan of the classes, but none are the same as mine. \u201cCarson for History,\u201d I say, replying to Sky\u2019s question. I hand Six back her schedule and give her a look to let her know we don\u2019t have any classes together. She looks bummed, but says nothing.</p><p>\u201cCan you speak Italian very well?\u201d Breckin asks Six.</p><p>\u201cNot well at all. I speak better Spanish than I do Italian. I chose Italy because I had enough funding and I\u2019d rather have spent half a year there than in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d Breckin says. \u201cThe men are hotter in Italy.\u201d</p><p>Six nods. \u201cYes they are,\u201d she says appreciatively.</p><p>I immediately lose my appetite and drop my fork onto my plate. It makes a loud clanking noise, so naturally everyone turns to look at me. It\u2019s quiet and awkward and everyone is still staring, so I say the first thing on my mind. \u201cItalian men are too hairy.\u201d</p><p>Sky and Breckin laugh, but Six purses her lips together and looks back down at her plate.</p><p>God, I suck at this.</p><p>Luckily, Val walks up and takes everyone\u2019s attention off me.</p><p>Wait. Did I just say luckily? Because Val walking up is not a good thing.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d she says, glaring down at me.</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallway,\u201d she says, spinning on her heels. She heads toward the exit to the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cDo us all a favor and go see what Val wants,\u201d Sky says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t meet her out there she\u2019ll come back to the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Breckin mutters.</p><p>I\u2019m watching all their reactions and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve always reacted this way when it comes to Val or if I\u2019m only recognizing it for the first time because I finally have clarity.</p><p>\u201cWhy is everyone referring to Tessa Maynard as Val?\u201d Six asks, confused.</p><p>Breckin points over his shoulder in the direction Val walked off in. \u201cTessa is Val. Val is Tessa. Daniel can\u2019t seem to call anyone by their actual name, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Six inhales a slow breath, then looks directly at me. She looks really disgusted. \u201cYour girlfriend is Tessa Maynard? You have sex with Tessa Maynard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-girlfriend and had sex,\u201d I clarify. \u201cAnd yes. Probably coincided with the same time you were falling in love with a hairy Italian.\u201d</p><p>Six\u2019s eyes narrow, then she quickly looks away. I instantly feel bad for what I said, but I was only kidding. Sort of. We\u2019re supposed to be mean to each other. I can\u2019t tell if I really hurt her feelings or if she\u2019s just a really good actress.</p><p>I sigh, then stand up and head toward the cafeteria doors in a hurry so I can get back to the table and somehow make sure Six really isn\u2019t pissed at me.</p><p>I make it out to the hallway and Val is standing right outside the cafeteria doors. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back under one condition,\u201d she says.</p><p>I\u2019m curious what the condition is, but it doesn\u2019t really matter at this point.</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth literally drops open. It\u2019s not even that cute a mouth now that I\u2019m looking at it. I don\u2019t know how I fell for it all those other times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Daniel,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cIf you screw up one more time, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>I let my head fall backward until I\u2019m looking up at the ceiling. \u201cJesus, Tessa,\u201d I say. She\u2019s not really worthy of my nicknames anymore. I look her in the eyes again. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to take me back. I don\u2019t want to date you. I don\u2019t even want to make out with you. You\u2019re mean.\u201d</p><p>She scoffs, but stands frozen. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d she says, dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cSerious. Positive. Convinced. Enlightened. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>She throws her hands up in the air and spins around, then walks back into the cafeteria. I walk to the doors and open them. Six is staring at me from our table, so I make a quick glance around at the rest of the group. No one is paying attention, so I motion for her to come out into the hallway. She takes a quick drink of her water, then stands, making up an excuse to the rest of the table. I step out of view while she makes her way to the exit. When the doors open I immediately grab her by the wrist and pull her until we reach the lockers. I push her against them and crash my mouth to hers. Her hands immediately fly up to my hair and we rush our kisses like we might get caught.</p><p>And we really might.</p><p>After a good solid minute, she pushes lightly against my chest, so I pull away from her.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d I ask her, almost blurting out the question between heavy breaths.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cWhy would I be mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Val is Tessa and you obviously don\u2019t like Tessa very much and because I had a jealous moment and called Italian men hairy.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWe\u2019re acting, Daniel. I was actually a little impressed. And kind of turned on when you got jealous. But highly unimpressed with the fact that Val is Tessa. I can\u2019t believe you had sex with Tessa Maynard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you had sex with pretty much everyone else,\u201d I reply teasingly.</p><p>She grins. \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be at my dinner tonight?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really dumb question.\u201d</p><p>A smile spreads slowly across her face and it\u2019s so damn sexy I have to kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cI should get back,\u201d she whispers when I pull away.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should. So should I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first. I\u2019m supposed to be in the administration office clearing up an issue with my schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll go first, but I\u2019ll miss you until you get back to the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me puke,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re adorable when you puke. I bet your actual puke is even adorable. It\u2019s probably bubble-gum pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously disgusting.\u201d She laughs and reaches up to kiss me again. She pushes against my chest, then slips out from between me and the locker. She puts both of her hands on my back and pushes me toward the cafeteria doors. \u201cAct natural.\u201d</p><p>I turn and wink at her, then walk back through the doors. I casually make my way back to the table and take a seat.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Six?\u201d Breckin asks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHow should I know? I was busy making out with Val in the hallway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sky shakes her head and lays her fork down. \u201cI just lost my appetite, Daniel. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your appetite back by dinner tonight,\u201d I say.</p><p>Sky shakes her head. \u201cNot with you and Val there. You\u2019ll probably be sucking face next to my food. If you drool on my chocolate cake you aren\u2019t getting any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Cheese Tits,\u201d I say. \u201cBut Val won\u2019t be at your dinner tonight. I\u2019ll be there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you will,\u201d Breckin says under his breath.</p><p>I glance over at him and he looks at me challengingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you just mumble, Powder Puff?\u201d He absolutely hates it when I call him Powder Puff, but he should know I only give nicknames to the people I like. I think he does know that, though, because he doesn\u2019t really give me too much shit about it.</p><p>\u201cI said I bet you will,\u201d he repeats louder this time. He turns to Sky, who is seated right next to him. \u201cSix, right?\u201d</p><p>Sky nods. \u201cSix or six-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there at six,\u201d Breckin says. He looks back at me and smirks. \u201cI bet you\u2019ll be there at six, too, right, Daniel? You like six? Is six good for you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s on to us. Fucker.</p><p>\u201cSix is perfect,\u201d I say, holding his stare. \u201cMy absolute favorite time of day.\u201d</p><p>He smiles knowingly, but I\u2019m not worried. I have a feeling he\u2019s going to have just as much fun with this as I am.</p><p>\u201cAll cleared up?\u201d Sky asks Six when she returns to the table. Six nods and takes her seat. Her hand brushes across my outer thigh when she adjusts herself. I press my knee against hers and we both pick our forks up at the same time and take a bite of food.</p><p>Having her here just inches from me and not being allowed to touch her is complete torture. I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019d rather just lean over and kiss her and take Holder\u2019s ass beating than have to pretend I don\u2019t want her.</p><p>Since the moment she disappeared into her house last night I\u2019ve felt more restless than I\u2019ve ever felt before. I\u2019ve been fidgeting all day. I can\u2019t stop tapping my fingers and shaking my leg. It feels like I want to scratch at my skin when she\u2019s not around, like I\u2019m coming down from a high.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what this feels like. Like she\u2019s a drug I\u2019ve become immediately addicted to but I have none in supply. The only thing that satiates the craving is her laugh. Or her smile or her kiss or the feel of her pressed against me.</p><p>God, it\u2019s so hard not to touch her. So hard.</p><p>She begins laughing loudly at something Sky said and the craving becomes almost intolerable because of the intense need I have to catch that sound with my mouth.</p><p>I drop my fork onto my plate and lower my head into my hands and groan. \u201cStop laughing,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>She\u2019s obviously laughing too loud to hear me, so I turn toward her and say it again. \u201cSix. Stop laughing. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clamps shut and she turns to look at me. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>About that same time, Holder kicks the shit out of my knee. I scoot back and immediately pull my leg up and rub the spot he kicked. \u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d</p> <p>Holder looks at me like I\u2019m clueless. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? I told you not to be mean to her.\u201d</p><p>Ha. He thinks I\u2019m being mean? If he only knew how nice I want to be to her right now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my laugh?\u201d Six says. I can tell in her voice she knows how much I like her laugh, but she\u2019s enjoying the fact that Holder is clueless to what her laugh does to me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I grumble, scooting back toward the table.</p><p>She laughs again and the sound of it causes me to wince.</p><p>\u201cAre you always this grumpy?\u201d she asks. \u201cDo you want me to go get your girlfriend and bring her back to the table so she can put you in a better mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sky and Breckin yell in unison.</p><p>I look at Six. \u201cYou think my girlfriend could put me in a better mood?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cI think your girlfriend is a pathetic idiot for agreeing to date you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cMy girlfriend makes incredibly wise decisions. I can\u2019t wait until tonight when I get to show her just how smart she was when she decided to lay claim to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said she wasn\u2019t coming to dinner,\u201d Sky says, disappointed.</p><p>Six\u2019s hand slips under the table and she begins to gently rub at the spot on my knee that Holder just finished kicking.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d I mutter, leaning forward. I put my elbows on the table and run my hands up and down my face, attempting to appear unaffected by the fact that it feels like Six just crawled her way inside my chest and is wrapping herself around my heart.</p><p>\u201cIs lunch over yet?\u201d I say to no one in particular. \u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Holder looks at his phone. \u201cFive more minutes.\u201d He looks back up at me. \u201cAre you sick, Daniel? You\u2019re not being yourself today. It\u2019s starting to freak me out a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Six\u2019s hand is still on my knee. I casually lower my hand and slide it under the table, then place it over hers. She flips her hand over and I lace our fingers together and squeeze her hand.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say to Holder. \u201cI\u2019m just having a weird day. Girlfriends. They have that effect on you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still looking at me suspiciously. \u201cYou seriously need to make up your mind when it comes to her. It\u2019s past the point that any of us feel sorry for you, because now it\u2019s just irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t help that she used to be a slut,\u201d Six says.</p><p>\u201cSix!\u201d Sky says with a laugh. \u201cThat was so mean.\u201d</p><p>Six shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Daniel\u2019s girlfriend used to be a big, fat slut. I heard she had sex with six different guys in just over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my girlfriend that way,\u201d I say. \u201cWho gives a shit what she did in the past? I sure as hell don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Six squeezes my hand, then pulls hers away and brings her hand back up to the table. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t nice. If it helps, I heard she\u2019s a good kisser.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cPhenomenal kisser.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and everyone picks up their trays. I notice Six isn\u2019t in any hurry, so I take my time as well. Sky kisses Holder on the cheek, then walks off with Breckin toward the exit. Holder picks up both their trays and lifts his eyes to mine. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope to hell the real Daniel shows up, because you aren\u2019t making a whole lot of sense today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, pointing briefly at my head. \u201cShe\u2019s got me all screwed up in here, man. All screwed up. I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d</p><p>Holder shakes his head. \u201cThat right there is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. You seem more affected by Val today than you ever have. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d He walks off, still looking confused. I feel sort of bad for lying to him, but it\u2019s his own fault. He shouldn\u2019t try to tell me who I can date, then I wouldn\u2019t have to hide it from him.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d Six says quietly. She begins to pick up her tray, but I intercept it. I take a step toward her and look her hard in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever insult my girlfriend again. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>She tightens her lips to hide her smile. \u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to walk you to your locker. Wait for me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile becomes harder for her to hide as she nods her head. I take both of our trays and place them on the tray pile, then walk back to the table. I glance around us and don\u2019t really see anyone paying attention, so I quickly lean in and kiss her briefly on the lips, then pull away.</p><p>\u201cDaniel Wesley, you\u2019re gonna get caught,\u201d she says with a grin. She turns and begins walking toward the exit, so I discreetly place a hand on her lower back and walk next to her.</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I have to sit through another lunch like that, I\u2019ll lose my shit and you\u2019ll end up on your back on top of the table.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWhat a way with words you have.\u201d</p><p>We exit the cafeteria and I walk her to her locker. It\u2019s on the opposite hall from mine, which couldn\u2019t be more inconvenient. We don\u2019t have a single class together and I won\u2019t even see her in the hallway while we\u2019re at school. I know I haven\u2019t even been dating her for an entire day, but I already miss her.</p><p>\u201cCan I come over before dinner?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be helping Karen and Sky prep. I\u2019m going over there right after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about after dinner?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head again while she switches her books. \u201cSky crawls through my window every night. You can\u2019t be in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought your window was out of commission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to people with penises.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWhat if I told you I didn\u2019t have a penis?\u201d</p><p>She glances at me. \u201cI would probably rejoice. My experiences with people who have penises never end well.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not something my penis wants to hear you say. He has a very sensitive ego.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and shuts her locker, then leans against it. \u201cWell, maybe you should go home after school and stroke his ego a little bit until he feels better.\u201d</p><p>I cock an eyebrow. \u201cYou just made a masturbation joke.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the coolest girlfriend in the world.\u201d</p><p>She nods again. \u201cSo you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you will,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCan we sneak off and make out while everyone\u2019s eating?\u201d</p><p>She squints her eyes as if she\u2019s actually contemplating it. \u201cDon\u2019t know. We\u2019ll play it by ear.\u201d</p><p>I nod and lean my shoulder against the locker next to hers. We\u2019re just a few inches apart and we\u2019re staring at each other again. I love how she looks at me like she actually enjoys staring at me.</p><p>\u201cGive me your phone number,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you aren\u2019t planning to text me pics of your ego stroking after school.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and clutch at my heart. \u201cDammit, Six. I love every single word that comes out of your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCock,\u201d she says dryly.</p><p>She\u2019s evil.</p><p>\u201cExcept that word,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t love cock.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and opens her locker again. She takes out a pen, then turns and grabs my hand. She writes her phone number down, then puts the pen back in her locker. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight, Daniel.\u201d She begins backing away. All I can do is nod, because I\u2019m pretty sure her voice just hardcore made out with my ears. She turns and disappears down the hallway just as something appears in my line of sight.</p><p>I look to the eyes that are now glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Powder Puff?\u201d I ask him, pushing off the locker.</p><p>\u201cYou like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask, playing dumb. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m trying to play dumb. We both know who he\u2019s referring to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s adorable,\u201d he says. \u201cShe likes you, too.

Or better yet, who are you hiding it from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolder. He says I can\u2019t date her.\u201d I begin walking toward class and Breckin falls into step with me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? Because you\u2019re an asshole?\u201d</p><p>I stop and look at him. \u201cI\u2019m an asshole?\u201d</p><p>Breckin nods. \u201cYeah. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, then start walking again. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019ll screw everything up since we\u2019re all best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. It will.\u201d</p> <p>I stop walking again. \u201cWho\u2019s to say things won\u2019t work out with me and Six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just meet her? Like two days ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cShe\u2019s different. I have a good feeling about her.\u201d</p><p>Breckin studies me for a moment, then he smiles. \u201cThis should be fun. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d He turns and walks in the opposite direction, but he stops and faces me again. \u201cCall me Powder Puff again and your secret is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Powder Puff.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and points at me. \u201cSee? Such an asshole.\u201d</p> <p>He spins and heads toward his class. I pull my phone out of my pocket and open up Val\u2019s contact information. I hit delete, then add Six\u2019s number into my phone. I\u2019ll wait until I make it to my classroom before I text her.</p><p>Don\u2019t want to seem desperate.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Me: Pretend you\u2019re going to the bathroom or something.</p><p>I place my phone back down on the table and begin eating again. I\u2019ve been here almost an hour and Six and I have barely had a chance to talk. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even need Breckin to out us, because I\u2019m about to lose my patience and do it myself.</p><p>I know everyone\u2019s curious about her trip to Italy, but she seems uncomfortable talking about it. Her answers are short and clipped and I hate that I\u2019m the only one who seems to notice how much she doesn\u2019t want to bring up Italy. I also like that I\u2019m the only one who notices, because it proves that whatever connection I feel with her is more than likely genuine. I feel like I know her better than anyone else here. Maybe even better than Sky knows her.</p><p>Although it\u2019s absurd to feel that way, since I still don\u2019t even know her birthday.</p><p>Six: There\u2019s only one bathroom in the hallway. Even if I were to go there it would be obvious if you got up and followed me.</p> <p>I read her text and groan out loud.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Jack asks. He\u2019s seated next to me at the table, which is fine any other time but I really wanted Six to be in his chair. I nod, then put my phone facedown on the table.</p><p>\u201cIrritating girlfriend drama,\u201d I say.</p><p>He laughs and turns back to Holder, continuing with their conversation. Six is involved in a discussion with Sky and Karen. Breckin ended up not being able to come, which was probably a good thing. Not sure I could have handled the fact that he knows.</p><p>Right now it\u2019s just me and my impatience having a silent war at the dinner table.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d Six says loudly. \u201cI bought you all presents. I forgot.\u201d She scoots back from the table. \u201cThey\u2019re at my house. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She stands and takes two steps before turning back toward us. \u201cDaniel? They\u2019re kind of heavy. Mind giving me a hand?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t act too excited, Daniel.</p><p>I sigh heavily. \u201cI guess,\u201d I say as I scoot back from the table. I look at Holder and roll my eyes, then follow Six outside. Neither of us says a word while we make our way to the side of the house. She reaches her window, then turns around.</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d she says. Her eyes are worried, which causes me to worry.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy anyone presents. I just can\u2019t take another second of all the questions, and then seeing you across the table and knowing how much I just wish it could be the two of us is making this whole dinner really irritating. But now I don\u2019t have presents. How do I go back in there without presents?\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh, but I love that she\u2019s been just as irritated as I\u2019ve been. I was starting to worry I might have a few issues.</p><p>\u201cWe could just stay out here and never go back inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could,\u201d she says in agreement. \u201cBut they\u2019d eventually come look for us. Not to mention it would be rude, since Jack and Karen went through all this trouble to cook for me and oh, my God, what if it\u2019s true, Daniel?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me or if she\u2019s just really difficult to keep up with, but I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cWhat if what\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>She exhales a quick breath. \u201cWhat if our feelings are just reverse psychology? What if Holder had told you to date me Saturday night? You might not have been interested in me after that. What if the only reason we like each other so much is that it\u2019s forbidden? What if the second they all find out the truth, we can\u2019t stand each other?\u201d</p><p>I hate that the worry in her voice sounds genuine, because that means she actually believes the shit she\u2019s saying right now.</p><p>\u201cYou think there\u2019s a chance I only like you because I\u2019m not supposed to like you?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I grab her hand and yank her back toward the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, I don\u2019t have presents!\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and walk her up the front steps, open the door, and march her straight into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I yell. Everyone turns around and looks at us. I glance at Six and her eyes are wide. I inhale a deep breath, then turn back to the table. Specifically to Holder.</p><p>\u201cShe fist bumped me,\u201d I say, pointing at Six. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. She hates purses and she fist bumped me, then she made me push her on the damn merry-go-round. After that, she demanded to see where I had sex in the park, then she forced me to sneak into my own bedroom. She\u2019s weird and half the time I can\u2019t keep up with her, but she thinks I\u2019m funny as hell. And Chunk asked me this morning if I wanted to love her someday, and I realized I\u2019ve never hoped I could love someone more than I want to love her. So every single one of you who has an issue with us dating is going to have to get over it because . . .\u201d I pause and turn toward Six. \u201cBecause you fist bumped me and I could care less who knows we\u2019re together. I\u2019m not going anywhere and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere so stop thinking I\u2019m into you because I\u2019m not supposed to be into you.\u201d I lift my hands and tilt her face toward mine. \u201cI\u2019m into you because you\u2019re awesome. And because you let me accidentally touch your boob.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smiling wider than I\u2019ve ever seen her smile. \u201cDaniel Wesley, where\u2019d you learn those smooth moves?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNot moves, Six. Charisma.\u201d</p><p>She throws her arms around my neck and kisses me. I wait for the moment Holder yanks me away from her, but that moment doesn\u2019t come. We kiss for a solid thirty seconds before people begin clearing their throats. When Six pulls away from me, she\u2019s still smiling.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel different now that they know?\u201d I ask her. \u201cBecause it actually feels better to me.\u201d</p><p>She shoves my chest with an irritated laugh. \u201cStop! Stop saying things that make me grin like an idiot. My face has been hurting since the second I met you.\u201d</p><p>I pull her to me and hug her, then suddenly become aware that we\u2019re still standing in Sky\u2019s kitchen and everyone is still staring at us. I hesitantly turn and look at Holder to gauge his level of anger. He\u2019s never actually hit me before, but I\u2019ve seen what he can do and I sure as hell don\u2019t want to experience it.</p><p>When my eyes meet his, he\u2019s . . . smiling. He\u2019s actually smiling.</p><p>Sky has a napkin to her eyes and she\u2019s wiping tears away.</p><p>Karen and Jack are both smiling.</p><p>It\u2019s weird.</p><p>Too weird.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys talk to my parents?\u201d I ask cautiously. \u201cDid they teach you their dirty reverse psychology tricks?\u201d</p><p>Karen is the first to speak. \u201cSit down, you two. Your food is getting cold.\u201d</p><p>I kiss Six on the forehead, then take my seat back at the table. I keep glancing at Holder, but he doesn\u2019t look upset at all. He actually looks a little impressed.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is my present?\u201d Jack asks Six.</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cI decided to wait until Christmas.\u201d She picks up her glass and brings it to her lips, then glances at me. I smile at her.</p><p>Everyone else resumes whatever conversations were going on before my interruption. It\u2019s like no one is even that shocked. They act like it\u2019s completely normal. Like it\u2019s a natural thing . . . me and Six.</p><p>And I totally get it, because it is. Whatever we have is good and even though I still don\u2019t know her birthday . . . I know this is right. And based on the look on her face right now, so does she.</p><p>\u201cI really like this one,\u201d I say, looking at the picture in my hands. I\u2019m leaning against the wall, sitting on the floor in Sky\u2019s bedroom. Six is passing around pictures she took in Italy to Sky, Holder and me.</p><p>\u201cWhich pic are you looking at?\u201d she says. She\u2019s lying next to me on the floor. I look down at her and flip the photo over so she can see it. She shakes her head with a quick roll of her eyes. \u201cYou only like that one because my cleavage looks great.\u201d</p><p>I immediately turn the photo back around. She\u2019s right. It does look great. But that\u2019s not at all why I liked it at first. She looks happy in this one. Peaceful.</p><p>\u201cI took that picture the day I got to Italy,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I wasn\u2019t planning on giving it back to you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it an anniversary present,\u201d she says.</p><p>I immediately look down at the time on my phone. \u201cOh. Wow. It really is our anniversary.\u201d I readjust myself until I\u2019m leaning over her. \u201cI almost forgot. I\u2019m the worst boyfriend ever. I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t dumped me yet.\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You can remember the next one.\u201d She slips her hand to the back of my neck and pulls me forward until our lips meet.</p><p>\u201cAnniversary?\u201d Sky says, confused. \u201cExactly how long have the two of you been dating?\u201d</p><p>I pull away from Six and sit back up against the wall. \u201cPrecisely twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence follows, then of course Holder fills it. \u201cAm I the only one who has a bad feeling about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Sky says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Six so . . . nice? Happy? Spoken for? It\u2019s a good look for her.\u201d</p><p>Six sits up and wraps her arms around my neck, then pulls me to the floor with her. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve never met anyone as vulgar and inappropriate and horrible at first kisses as Daniel.\u201d She pulls my mouth to hers and kisses me while she laughs at herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is a first. A kiss and a laugh at the same time? I think I might be in heaven.</p><p>\u201cSix has a bedroom too, you know,\u201d Holder says.</p><p>Six stops laughing. And she stops kissing me.</p><p>Holder is about to be put on my shit list.</p> <p>\u201cSix doesn\u2019t allow penises in her bedroom,\u201d I reply to him while still staring down at her.</p><p>Six moves her mouth to my ear. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t expect me to stroke his ego tonight, I kind of want to kiss you on my bed.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know people could move as fast as I\u2019m moving right now. This has to be some sort of record, because my hands are under her back and knees and I\u2019m scooping her up in my arms before her sentence even completely registers. She throws her arms around my neck and squeals as I head straight for Sky\u2019s window. I put her down gently, but then practically shove her outside. I begin to follow right behind her without even telling Sky or Holder goodbye.</p><p>\u201cThey are so strange together,\u201d I hear Sky say right before I\u2019m out the window.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Holder says in agreement. \u201cBut also oddly . . . right.\u201d</p> <p>I pause.</p><p>Did Holder just compliment my relationship with Six? I don\u2019t know why I always want his approval so much, but hearing him say that fills me with this weird sense of pride. I turn around and take a step back to the window and lean inside. \u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the window and sees me leaning inside, so he rolls his eyes. \u201cGo away,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re having a moment.\u201d</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow, but doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, Holder.\u201d</p> <p>Sky shakes her head and laughs, but Holder is still looking at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cFor real,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend and I love you. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I love a guy. I love you, Holder. Daniel Wesley loves Dean Holder. Always and forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel, go make out with your girlfriend,\u201d he says, waving me off.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot until you tell me you love me, too.\u201d</p><p>His head falls back against Sky\u2019s headboard. \u201cI fucking love you, now GO AWAY!\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cI love you more.\u201d</p><p>He picks up a pillow and tosses it at the window. \u201cGet the hell out of here, dipshit. \u201d</p><p>I laugh and back away from the window.</p> <p>\u201cYou two are so strange together,\u201d Sky says to him.</p><p>I pull the window shut, then turn around to face Six. She\u2019s already in her bedroom, leaning out her window with her chin in her hands. She\u2019s grinning.</p><p>\u201cDaniel and Holder, sittin\u2019 in a tree,\u201d she says in a singsong voice.</p><p>I walk toward her and improvise the next line of the song. \u201cBut then Daniel climbs down,\u201d I finish the rest of the sentence in a hurry, \u201cand goes to Six\u2019s window and climbs inside her bedroom and throws her on the bed and kisses her until he can\u2019t take any more and has to go home and stroke his ego.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s laughing and backing into her bedroom to make room for me to climb inside.</p><p>Once I\u2019m inside, I look around and observe her room. I finally understand what she meant when she said my bedroom was more than just a room. This is like a secret glimpse into who Six really is. I feel like I could study this room and everything in it and find out everything I ever need to know about her.</p><p>Unfortunately, she\u2019s standing at the foot of her bed and she looks a little bit nervous and way more beautiful than I deserve, and I can\u2019t take my eyes off of her long enough to even study her bedroom.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at her. I can already tell this is about to be the best anniversary I\u2019ve ever had. The lights are off, so the mood is already perfect for making out. It\u2019s quiet, though. So quiet I can hear her breaths increase with each deliberately slow step I take toward her.</p><p>Shit. Maybe those are my breaths. I can\u2019t tell, because every inch closer I get requires an extra intake of air.</p><p>When I reach her, she\u2019s looking up at me with an odd mixture of peaceful anticipation. I want to push her onto the bed right now and climb on top of her and kiss the hell out of her.</p><p>I could do that, but why do the one thing she\u2019s expecting me to do?</p><p>I lean in slowly. Very slowly . . . until my mouth is so close to her neck she more than likely can\u2019t even tell if I\u2019m touching her skin or not. \u201cI have three questions I need to ask you before we do this,\u201d I say quietly, but very seriously. I pull back just far enough to see her gulp softly.</p><p>\u201cBefore we do what?\u201d she asks hesitantly.</p><p>I lift a hand to the back of her head, then pull back from her neck and position my lips close to hers. \u201cBefore we do what we both want to do. Before I lean in one more inch. And before you part your lips for me just enough for me to steal a taste. Before I put my hands on your hips and back you up until you have nowhere to go but onto your bed.\u201d</p><p>I can feel her breath teasing my lips and it\u2019s so tempting I have to force myself to lean in to her ear again so I\u2019m not so close to her mouth. \u201cBefore I slowly lower myself on top of you and our hands become curious and brave. Before my fingers slip under the hem of your shirt. Before my hand begins to explore its way up your stomach, and I discover I\u2019ve never touched skin as soft as yours.\u201d</p><p>She gasps, then exhales a shaky breath and it\u2019s almost as sexy as the fist bump.</p><p>It may even be sexier.</p><p>\u201cBefore I finally get to touch your boob on purpose.\u201d</p><p>She laughs at that one, but her laugh is cut short when I press my thumb to the center of her lips.</p><p>\u201cBefore your breaths pick up pace and our bodies are aching because everything we\u2019re feeling is just making us want more and more and more of each other . . . until I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll beg you not to ask me to slow down. So instead, I regrettably tear my mouth from yours and force myself away from your bed and you lift up unto your elbows and look at me, disappointed, because you kind of wished I would have kept going, but at the same time you\u2019re relieved I didn\u2019t, because you know you would have given in. So instead of giving in, we just stare. We watch each other silently as my heart rate begins to slow down and your breaths are easier to catch and the insatiable need is still there, but our minds are clearer now that I\u2019m not pressed against you anymore. I turn around and walk to your window and leave without even saying goodbye, because we both know if either of us speaks . . . it\u2019ll be the collective demise of our willpower and we\u2019ll cave. We\u2019ll cave so hard.\u201d</p><p>I move my hand to her cheek. She whimpers and looks like she\u2019s about to collapse onto the bed, so I wrap my other arm around her lower back and pull her against me.</p><p>\u201cSo yeah . . . three questions first.\u201d</p><p>I let go of her and immediately turn around two seconds before I hear her fall onto her bed. I walk straight to the desk chair and take a seat, for two reasons. One, I want her to think I mean business and that everything I just said to her didn\u2019t affect me like it did her. And two, because I want her more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything and my knees were about to give out on me if I didn\u2019t sit down.</p><p>\u201cQuestion number one,\u201d I say, watching her from across her room. She\u2019s lying on her back with her eyes closed and I hate that I\u2019m not watching her up close right now. \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOctober . . .\u201d\u2014She clears her throat, obviously still recovering\u2014\u201cthirty-first. Halloween.\u201d</p><p>How could the date of a birthday make me fall even harder for her? I have no idea, but it somehow does.</p><p>\u201cQuestion number two. What\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomemade mashed potatoes.\u201d</p><p>Never would have guessed that one. Glad I asked.</p><p>\u201cQuestion number three,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a big one. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>She nods, but keeps her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing in this room that tells the biggest secret about you?\u201d</p><p>As soon as the question leaves my mouth, she\u2019s completely still. Her exaggerated breaths come to a halt. She remains motionless for almost a whole minute before she slowly pushes herself up until she\u2019s seated on the edge of the bed, facing me. \u201cIt has to be something inside this room?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly.</p><p>She lifts her hand and touches a finger to her heart, pointing at it. \u201cThis,\u201d she whispers. \u201cMy biggest secret is right in here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are moist and sad and somehow with that answer, the air instantly changes between us. In a dangerous way. A terrifying way. Because it feels like her air just became my air and I suddenly want to take in fewer breaths in order to ensure she never runs out.</p><p>I stand up and walk to the bed. Her eyes follow me closely until I\u2019m directly in front of her. \u201cStand up.\u201d</p><p>She stands slowly.</p><p>I weave both hands through the locks of her hair until I\u2019m holding the back of her head. I stare at her until my heart can\u2019t take anymore, then I press my lips to hers. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve kissed her over the past day. Every time I kiss her, the feeling I get is like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. The closest I\u2019ve ever come to feeling this way is the day I was pretending to be in love with the girl in the closet. But even that day, the day I thought would surpass every day after it, doesn\u2019t come close to this.</p><p>Her mouth is warm and inviting and everything it always is when I kiss her, but it\u2019s also so much more. The fact that I have this reaction to her after one day scares the living shit out of me.</p><p>One day.</p><p>I\u2019ve been doing this with her for one day and I have no idea what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a full moon or if I have a tumor wrapped around my heart or if she really is a witch. Whatever it is still doesn\u2019t explain how this kind of thing can exist between two people this ridiculously fast . . . and actually last.</p><p>I feel like deep down my heart knows she\u2019s too good to be true. My mind and my whole body know she\u2019s too good to be true, so I kiss her harder, hoping to convince myself that this is real. It\u2019s not some fairy tale. It\u2019s not an hour of make-believe.</p><p>This is reality, but even in our imperfect reality, people don\u2019t fall for each other like this. They don\u2019t develop feelings like this for someone they barely know.</p><p>The only thing my entire thought process is proving to me right now is how much I need to grab her tight and hang on, because wherever she goes, I want to go, too. And right now, she\u2019s going backward, down onto the bed. I\u2019m easing myself on top of her in the same way I just told her this would happen. And we\u2019re kissing, just like I said we would, only this time it may just be a little more frantic and needy and holy shit.</p><p>Her skin.</p><p>It really is the softest skin I\u2019ve ever touched.</p><p>I move my hand from her waist and inch my fingers underneath the hem of her shirt, then slowly begin to work my way to her stomach.</p><p>She pushes my hand away.</p><p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d</p><p>She immediately lifts up and I immediately lift off her. She\u2019s breathing so heavily I catch myself holding my own breath, scared I\u2019m hogging too much of her air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks both regretful and embarrassed that she suddenly asked me to stop. I lift my hand and stroke her cheek reassuringly.</p><p>My eyes scroll over her features, taking in her nervous demeanor. She\u2019s afraid of what might happen between us. I can see on her face and in the way she\u2019s looking at me that she\u2019s just as scared as I am. Whatever this is between us, neither one of us was searching for it. Neither one of us knew it even existed. Neither one of us is even remotely prepared for it, but I know we both want it. She wants this to work with me as much as I want it to work with her and seeing the look in her eyes right now makes me believe that it will. I\u2019ve never believed in anything like I believe in the possibility of the two of us.</p><p>I can tell by the way she\u2019s looking at me that if I tried to kiss her again, she\u2019d let me. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s torn between the girl she used to be and the girl she is now and she\u2019s afraid if I try to kiss her again, she\u2019ll cave.</p><p>And I\u2019m afraid if I don\u2019t get up and walk away, I\u2019ll let her.</p> <p>We don\u2019t even have to speak. She doesn\u2019t even have to ask me to leave, because I know that\u2019s what I need to do. I nod, silently answering the question I don\u2019t want her to have to ask. I begin to ease off her bed and a silent thank you flashes in her eyes. I stand up, back away from her and climb out her window without a word. I walk a few feet until I reach the edge of her house, then I lean against it and slide down to the ground.</p><p>I lean my head back and close my eyes, attempting to figure out where I went right in my life to deserve her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Holder asks. I look up and he\u2019s halfway out Sky\u2019s window. Once he makes it all the way out, he turns and pulls her window shut.</p><p>\u201cRecovering,\u201d I say. \u201cI just needed a minute.\u201d</p><p>He walks toward me and takes a seat on the ground across from me, then leans against Sky\u2019s house. He pulls his legs up and rests his elbows on his knees.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re already leaving?\u201d I ask him. \u201cIt\u2019s not even nine o\u2019clock yet.\u201d</p><p>He reaches down to the ground and rips up a few blades of grass, then spins them between his fingers. \u201cGot kicked out for the night. Karen walked in and my hand was up Sky\u2019s shirt. She didn\u2019t like that too much.\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, glancing back up at me. \u201cYou and Six, huh?\u201d</p><p>Despite my effort not to smile, I do it anyway. I smile pathetically and nod. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about her, Holder. I . . . she just . . . yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d he says quietly, looking back down at the grass between his fingers.</p> <p>Neither one of us says anything else for several moments until he drops the blades of grass and wipes his hands on his jeans, preparing to stand up. \u201cWell . . . I\u2019m glad we had this talk, Daniel, but the fact that we already professed our mutual love for each other tonight is leaving me a little overwhelmed. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He stands up and begins walking toward his car.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Holder!\u201d I yell after him. \u201cBest friends forever!\u201d</p><p>He keeps walking forward, but lifts his hand in the air and flips me off.</p><p>It\u2019s almost as cool as a fist bump.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she says.</p><p>We\u2019re standing in my kitchen. Her back is pressed against the counter and I\u2019m standing in front of her with my arms on either side of her. I catch her lips with mine and shut her up. It doesn\u2019t last long because she pushes my face away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI don\u2019t think they like me.\u201d</p> <p>I bring a hand up and wrap it around the nape of her neck and look her directly in the eyes. \u201cThey like you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we don\u2019t,\u201d my dad says as he makes his way into the kitchen. \u201cWe can\u2019t stand her. In fact, we hope you never bring her back.\u201d He refills his cup with ice, then walks back to the living room.</p><p>Six\u2019s eyes follow him as he exits the room, then she looks back up at me, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cThey love you.\u201d</p><p>She points toward the living room. \u201cBut he just . . .\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s voice cuts her off when he walks back into the kitchen. \u201cKidding, Six,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cInside joke. We actually like you a lot. I tried to give Danny-boy Grandma Wesley\u2019s ring earlier but he says it\u2019s still too soon to make you a Wesley.\u201d</p><p>Six laughs at the same time she breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cYeah, maybe so. It\u2019s only been a month. I think we should wait at least two more weeks before we talk proposals.\u201d</p><p>My dad walks farther into the kitchen and leans against the counter across from us. I feel a little awkward standing so close to Six now, so I move next to her and lean against the bar.</p><p>\u201cDid you come back in here so you could think of things to say that would embarrass me?\u201d I ask. I know that\u2019s why he\u2019s standing here. I can see the glimmer in his eyes.</p><p>He laughs, then takes a drink of his tea. He scrunches his nose up. \u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cI would never do that, Danny-boy. I\u2019m not the type of dad who would tell his son\u2019s girlfriend how he talks about her incessantly. I would also never tell my son\u2019s girlfriend that I\u2019m proud of her for not having sex with him yet.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. I groan and slap myself in the forehead. I should have known better than to bring her here.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to him about the fact that we haven\u2019t had sex?\u201d Six says, completely embarrassed.</p><p>My father shakes his head. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t have to. I know because every night he comes home he goes straight to his bedroom and takes a thirty-minute shower. I was eighteen once.\u201d</p><p>Six covers her face with her hands. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d She peeks through her hands at my dad. \u201cI guess I know who Daniel gets his personality from.\u201d</p><p>My father nods. \u201cTell me about it. His mother is terribly inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>Right on cue, my mother and Chunk walk through the front door with dinner. I glare at my father, then walk toward my mother and grab the pizza boxes out of her hands. She sets her purse down and walks over to Six and gives her a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t cook for you. Busy day today,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Six replies. \u201cNothing like inappropriate conversation over pizza.\u201d</p><p>I watch as my mother spins around and eyes my father. \u201cDennis? What have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cJust telling Danny-boy how I would never embarrass him in front of Six.\u201d</p><p>My mother laughs. \u201cWell, as long as you aren\u2019t embarrassing him, then. I\u2019d hate for Six to find out about his lengthy showers every night.\u201d</p><p>I slap the table. \u201cMom! Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>She laughs and my dad winks at her. \u201cAlready covered that one.\u201d</p><p>Six walks to the table, shaking her head. \u201cYour parents actually make you seem like a gentleman.\u201d She takes a seat at the table and I sit in the chair next to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whisper to her. She looks at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I love this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would long showers embarrass you?\u201d Chunk says to me, taking a seat across from Six. \u201cI would think wanting to be clean is a good thing.\u201d She picks up a slice of pizza and begins to take a bite, but then her eyes squeeze shut and she drops the pizza onto her plate. By the look on her face, the meaning behind the long showers has just hit her. \u201cOh, gross. Gross!\u201d she says, shaking her head.</p><p>Six begins to laugh and I rest my forehead against my hand, convinced this is more than likely the most uncomfortable, embarrassing five minutes of my life. \u201cI hate all of you. Every last one of you.\u201d I quickly look at Six. \u201cExcept you, babe. I don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and wipes her mouth with a napkin. \u201cI know exactly what you mean. I hate everybody, too.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words fall from her mouth, she looks away like she didn\u2019t just punch me in the gut, rip out my intestines, and stomp them into the ground.</p><p>I hate everybody too, Cinderella.</p><p>The words I said that day in the closet are screaming loudly inside my head.</p><p>There\u2019s no way.</p><p>There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t have noticed she was Cinderella.</p><p>I bring my hands to my face and close my eyes, trying hard to remember something about that day. Her voice, her kiss, her smell. The way we seemed to connect almost instantly.</p><p>Her laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Six asks quietly. No one else can tell something major is going on with me right now, but she notices. She notices because we\u2019re in sync. She notices because we have this unspoken connection. We\u2019ve had it since the second I laid eyes on her in Sky\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>We\u2019ve had it since the second she fell on top of me in the maintenance closet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, bringing my hands down. \u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d I grip the edge of the table, then slowly turn to face her.</p><p>Soft hair.</p><p>Amazing mouth.</p><p>Phenomenal kisser.</p><p>My mouth is dry, so I reach to my cup and down a huge gulp of water. I slam my cup back down on the table, then turn and face her. I\u2019m trying not to smile, but this whole thing is slightly overwhelming. Realizing that the girl from my past that I wished I could know is the same girl from my present that I\u2019m thankful to have is practically one of the best moments of my life. I want to tell Six, I want to tell Chunk, I want to tell my parents. I want to scream it from the rooftops and print it in all the papers.</p><p>Cinderella is Six! Six is Cinderella!</p><p>\u201cDaniel. You\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she says, watching as my face grows paler and my heart pounds faster.</p><p>I look at her. Really look at her this time.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know why I haven\u2019t given you a nickname yet?\u201d</p><p>She looks confused that this is what I decide to say in the middle of my silent freak-out. She nods cautiously. I place one hand on the back of her chair and one hand on the table in front of her, then lean in toward her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I already gave you one, Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>I pull back slightly and watch her face closely, waiting on the realization she\u2019s about to have. The flashback. The clarity. She\u2019s about to wonder how the hell she failed to realize it, too.</p><p>Her eyes slowly move up my face until they meet mine. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, shaking her head.</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still shaking her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she says again with more certainty. \u201cDaniel there\u2019s no way it could . . .\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t let her finish. I grab her face and kiss her harder than I\u2019ve ever kissed her. I don\u2019t give a shit that we\u2019re seated at a dinner table. I don\u2019t care that Chunk is groaning. I don\u2019t care that my mom is clearing her throat. I keep kissing her until she begins to back away from me.</p><p>She\u2019s pushing on my chest, so I pull away from her just in time to see the regret wash over her entire face. I focus on her eyes long enough to see them squeeze shut as she stands to leave the kitchen. I watch her rush away long enough to see her stifle a sob by slapping her hand over her mouth. I remain in my seat until the front door slams shut and I realize she\u2019s gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m immediately out of my seat. I rush out the front door and run straight to her car, which is now backing out of my driveway. I slam my fist against her hood as I rush to catch up to her window. She\u2019s not looking at me. She\u2019s wiping tears away, trying her hardest not to look out the window I\u2019m banging on.</p><p>\u201cSix!\u201d I yell, repeatedly banging on her window with my fist. I see her hand reach down to put the car in drive. I don\u2019t even think. I sprint to the front of the car and slap my hands down on the hood, standing directly in front of it so she can\u2019t take off. I\u2019m watching her do everything she can to avoid looking at me.</p><p>\u201cRoll down your window,\u201d I yell.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move. She continues to cry as she focuses on everything other than what\u2019s right in front of her.</p> <p>Me.</p><p>I slap the hood of the car again until she finally brings her eyes up to meet mine. Seeing her heartache confuses the hell out of me. I couldn\u2019t have been happier finding out she was Cinderella, yet she seems embarrassed as hell that I realized it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I say, wincing from the ache that just reached my chest. I hate seeing her upset and I really hate that this is why she\u2019s upset.</p><p>She puts the car in park, then reaches a hand to her door and lowers the driver\u2019s side window. I\u2019m not so sure she still won\u2019t drive away if I move out from in front of her car. I carefully and very slowly begin to make my way toward her window, the whole time keeping an eye on her hand to ensure she doesn\u2019t put the car back into drive.</p><p>When I reach her window, I bend my knees and lower myself until I\u2019m face to face with her. \u201cDo I even need to ask?\u201d</p> <p>She looks up at the roof and leans her head against the headrest. \u201cDaniel,\u201d she whispers through her tears. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right.</p><p>She\u2019s absolutely right.</p><p>\u201cAre you embarrassed?\u201d I ask her. \u201cBecause we had sex?\u201d</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut, giving away the fact that she thinks I\u2019m judging her. I immediately reach a hand through her window and pull her gaze back to mine. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be embarrassed by that. Ever. Do you know how much that meant to me? Do you know how many times I\u2019ve thought about you? I was there. I made that choice right along with you, so please don\u2019t think for a second that I would ever judge you for what happened between us.\u201d</p><p>She begins to cry even harder. I want her to get out of the car. I need to hold her because I can\u2019t see her this upset and not do whatever I can to take it away.</p> <p>\u201cDaniel, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says through her sobs. \u201cThis was a mistake. This was a huge mistake.\u201d Her hand reaches down to the gearshift and I\u2019m already reaching into the car, trying to stop her.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, Six,\u201d I plead. She puts the car in drive and reaches to the door, then places her finger on the window button.</p><p>I make one last attempt to lean in and kiss her before the window begins to rise on me. \u201cSix, please,\u201d I say, shocked at the sadness and desperation in my own voice. She continues to raise the window until I\u2019m completely out of it and it\u2019s all the way up. I press my palms to her window and slap the glass, but she drives away.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing left for me to do but watch the back of the car as it disappears down the street.</p><p>What the hell was that?</p><p>I pull my hands through my hair and look up at the sky, confused as to what just happened.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>I hate that she had the complete opposite reaction from me when she found out who I was.</p> <p>I hate that she\u2019s embarrassed about that day, like she just wants to forget it. Like she wants to forget me.</p><p>I hate it because I\u2019ve done everything I possibly can to commit that day to my memory, like no one or nothing else I\u2019ve ever experienced.</p><p>She can\u2019t do this. She can\u2019t just push me away like this without an explanation.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>I couldn\u2019t give my parents an explanation when I went back inside to grab my keys. They were apologetic, thinking they did something wrong. They felt bad about their jokes, but I didn\u2019t even have it in me to reassure them that they weren\u2019t the problem. I couldn\u2019t reassure them, because I don\u2019t even know what the problem is.</p><p>I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t find out tonight, though. Right now.</p><p>I put my car in park and turn off the engine, relieved to see her car parked in her driveway. I get out of my car and shut my door, then head to her front door. Before I make it to her front porch, I detour to the side of the house. I know with the shape she left my house in a few minutes ago, there\u2019s no way she would have walked through her front door. She would have taken the window.</p><p>I reach her bedroom and the window is shut, as well as the curtains. The room is dark, but I know she\u2019s inside. Knocking won\u2019t do me any good, so I don\u2019t even bother. I push the window up, then slide the curtains to the side.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cI\u2019m respecting your window rule, but it\u2019s really hard right now. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. She says nothing. I know she\u2019s in her room, though. I can hear her crying, but barely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the park. I want you to meet me there, okay?\u201d</p><p>Several silent moments pass before she responds.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, go home. Please.\u201d Her voice is soft and weak, but the message behind that sad, angelic voice is like a stab to my heart. I back away from the window, then kick the side of the house out of frustration. Or anger. Or sadness or . . . shit. All of it.</p><p>I lean back into her window and grip the frame. \u201cMeet me at the goddamned park, Six!\u201d I say loudly. My voice is angry. I\u2019m angry. She\u2019s pissing me the hell off. \u201cWe don\u2019t do this kind of thing. You don\u2019t play these games. You owe me a fucking explanation.\u201d</p><p>I push away from her window and turn to walk back to my car. I make it five feet before my palms are running down my face and I\u2019m wishing I could punch the actual air in front of me. I stop walking and pause for several moments while I search for patience. It\u2019s in here somewhere.</p><p>I walk back to her window and hate that she\u2019s crying much louder now, even though she\u2019s trying to stifle the sounds with her pillow.</p><p>\u201cListen, babe,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said goddamned. And fucking. I shouldn\u2019t cuss when I\u2019m upset, but . . .\u201d I inhale a deep breath. \u201cBut dammit, Six. Please. Please just meet me at the park. If you aren\u2019t there in half an hour, I\u2019m done. I had enough of this bullshit with Val and I\u2019m not putting myself through it again.\u201d</p><p>I turn to leave and make it all the way to my car this time before pausing and kicking at the ground. I walk back to her window again. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it just now when I said I\u2019d be done if you didn\u2019t show up. If you don\u2019t show up to the park, I\u2019ll still want to be with you. I\u2019ll just be sad that you didn\u2019t show up. Because we show up, Six. It\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s me and you, babe.\u201d</p><p>I wait for a reply for a lot longer than I even need to. She never responds, so I go back to my car and climb inside, then head to the park and hope she shows up.</p><p>Twenty-seven minutes pass before her car finally pulls into a parking spot.</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised she showed up. I knew she would. Her reaction was uncharacteristic of her and I know she just needed time to let everything soak in.</p><p>I watch her as she slowly makes her way toward me, never once looking up at me. She keeps her eyes trained to the ground the whole time until she passes me. She sinks into the swing next to me and grabs the chains, then leans her head against her arm. I wait for her to speak first, knowing she more than likely won\u2019t.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I run my hands up the chain rope until they\u2019re even with my head, then I lean into my arm and mirror her position. We\u2019re both staring quietly into the dark night in front of us.</p><p>\u201cAfter you left that day,\u201d I say. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure of what you wanted me to do. I wondered if you thought about me too and if you had changed your mind. If maybe you wanted me to try and find you.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head and look at her. Her blonde hair is tucked behind her ears and her eyes are closed. Even with her eyes closed I can see the pain in her features.</p><p>\u201cFor days I wondered if that\u2019s what you wanted me to do. I waited and waited for you to come back, but you never did. I know we both said we would be better off not knowing who the other was, but honestly, you were all I could think about. I wanted you to come back so fucking bad that I spent every single fifth period in that damn closet for the rest of the semester. The last day of school was the absolute worst. When the bell rang and I had to walk out of that closet for the last time, it absolutely sucked. So much. I felt like an idiot for being so consumed by the thought of you. When I met Val, I forced myself to go forward with her because it helped to not think about that damn closet so much.\u201d</p><p>I twist the swing until I\u2019m facing her. \u201cI like you, Six. A lot. And I know this sounds all kinds of jacked up and crazy, but pretending to make love to you that day was the closest I\u2019ve ever been to actually loving someone until now.\u201d</p><p>I turn my swing to face forward again, then I stand up. I walk to her and kneel down on both knees in front of her, then wrap my arms around her waist. I look up at her and see the pain flash across her face when I touch her. \u201cSix. Don\u2019t let what happened between us become a negative thing. Please. Because that day was one of the best days of my life. Actually, it was the best day of my life.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her head away from her arm and opens her eyes, then looks directly at me. Tears are streaming down her face. It breaks my damn heart.</p><p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d she whispers through her tears. She squeezes her eyes shut and turns her head like she can\u2019t even look at me. \u201cI got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Sometimes when I\u2019m almost asleep, I\u2019ll hear something that pulls me right back into a state of high alert. I\u2019ll listen closely, wondering if I actually heard a sound or if it\u2019s just my imagination playing tricks on me. I\u2019ll hold my breath and be really still, and I\u2019ll just listen quietly.</p><p>I\u2019m quiet.</p><p>I\u2019m still.</p><p>I\u2019m holding my breath.</p><p>I\u2019m listening.</p><p>I\u2019m concentrating really hard while my head rests on her thighs. I don\u2019t know when I lowered it here, but my hands are still gripping her waist. I\u2019m trying to figure out if those words are going to hit me and completely knock my heart around like a punching bag all over again, or if it was just my imagination.</p><p>God, I hope it was my imagination.</p><p>A tear hits my cheek that just fell straight from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find out until I was already in Italy,\u201d she says, her voice coated and laced with sorrow and shame. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>In my head, I\u2019m counting backward. Counting the days and the weeks and the months and trying to make sense of what she\u2019s saying, because she\u2019s obviously not pregnant now. My mind is still churning, crunching numbers, erasing errors, crunching more numbers.</p><p>She was in Italy for almost seven months. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seven months there, three months before she left and one month since she returned.</p><p>That\u2019s almost a year.</p><p>My mind hurts. Everything hurts.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t raise him by myself. I was already eighteen when I found out, so . . .\u201d</p> <p>I immediately lift up and look at her face. \u201cHim?\u201d I ask, shaking my head. \u201cHow do you know . . .\u201d I close my eyes and blow out a steady breath, then release my grip on her waist. I stand up and turn around, then pace back and forth, absorbing everything that\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . are you saying . . .\u201d I pause, then turn and face her. \u201cAre you telling me you had a fucking baby? That we had a baby?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s crying again. Sobbing, even. Hell, I don\u2019t know if she ever even stopped. She nods like it\u2019s painful to do.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, Daniel. I was so scared.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and walks toward me, then places her hands delicately on my cheeks. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who you were, so I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. If I knew your name or what you looked like I never would have made that decision without you.\u201d</p> <p>I bring my hands up to hers, and I pull them away from my face. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say as I feel the resentment building within me. I\u2019m trying so hard to hold it back. To understand. To let it all soak in.</p><p>I just can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not tell me? It\u2019s not like you found a puppy, Six. This is . . .\u201d I shake my head, still not getting it. \u201cYou had a baby. And you didn\u2019t even bother telling me!\u201d</p><p>She grasps my shirt in her fists, shaking her head, wanting me to see her side of things. \u201cDaniel, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you! What was I supposed to do? Did you expect me to plaster flyers all over the school asking for information on who knocked me up in the maintenance closet?\u201d</p><p>I look her directly in the eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d I say in a low voice.</p><p>She takes a step back, so I take a step forward. \u201cYes, Six! That\u2019s exactly what I would have expected you to do. You should have plastered it all over the hallways, aired it on the radio, taken an ad out in the motherfucking newspaper! You get pregnant with my kid and you worry about your reputation? Are you kidding me?\u201d</p> <p>My hand covers my cheek a second after she slaps me.</p><p>The pain in her eyes can\u2019t even come close to matching the pain in my heart, so I don\u2019t feel bad for saying what I said. Even when she begins to cry harder than I knew people were capable of crying.</p><p>She rushes back to her car.</p><p>I let her go.</p><p>I walk back to the swing and I sit.</p><p>Fucking life.</p><p>Motherfucking life.</p><p>Daniel: Where are you?</p> <p>Holder: Just left Sky\u2019s house. Almost home. What\u2019s up?</p><p>Daniel: I\u2019ll be there in five.</p><p>Holder: Everything okay?</p><p>Daniel: Nope.</p><p>Five minutes later Holder is standing on his curb waiting for me. I pull onto the side of the street and he opens the passenger door, then climbs inside. I put my car in park and prop my foot on the dash, then look out my window.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised at how pissed I am. I\u2019m even surprised at how sad I am. I don\u2019t know how to separate everything I\u2019m feeling in order to get a grip on the core of what\u2019s upsetting me the most. Right now I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the fact that I didn\u2019t have a say in whatever decision she made or if it\u2019s because she was even put into that situation to have to make that kind of decision to begin with.</p><p>I\u2019m pissed I wasn\u2019t there to help her. I\u2019m pissed I was careless enough to make a girl go through something like that.</p><p>I\u2019m sad because . . . hell. I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m so mad at her. I\u2019m sad I have to know something this overwhelming and there isn\u2019t a damn thing I can do about it now, even if I wanted to. I\u2019m sad because I\u2019m sitting here in a parked car and I\u2019m about to have a breakdown in front of my best friend and I really don\u2019t want to do that but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>I punch the steering wheel the second I begin to cry. I punch it several times, over and over, until the car begins to close in on me and I need to get the hell out of it. I open the door and climb out, then turn around and kick my tire. I kick it over and over until my foot starts to go numb, then I collapse against the hood onto my elbows. I press my forehead against the cold metal of the car and focus on burying this anger.</p><p>It\u2019s not her fault.</p><p>It\u2019s not her fault.</p><p>It\u2019s not her fault.</p><p>When I\u2019m finally calm enough to return to the car, Holder is sitting quietly in the passenger seat, watching me closely.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He nods. He\u2019s probably relieved I don\u2019t want to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I wrap my fingers around the steering wheel, then crank the car. \u201cI don\u2019t care what we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>I put the car in drive.</p><p>\u201cWe could go to Breckin\u2019s house and let you get your aggression out on a video game,\u201d he suggests.</p><p>I nod, then begin to drive toward Breckin\u2019s house. \u201cYou better not fucking tell him I cried.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Holder says, leaning against the locker next to mine. \u201cDid you even sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Of course I didn\u2019t sleep. How the hell could I have slept? I knew she wasn\u2019t sleeping, so there\u2019s no way in hell I could have slept.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what happened?\u201d he asks. I shut my locker, but keep my hand on it as I look down at the floor and slowly inhale.</p><p>\u201cNo. I know I usually tell you everything, but not this, Holder.\u201d</p><p>He taps the locker next to him a couple of times with his fist, then he pushes off of it. \u201cSix isn\u2019t telling Sky anything, either. Not sure what happened, but . . .\u201d He looks at me until I make eye contact with him. \u201cI like you with her. Get it worked out, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>He walks away and I close my locker. I wait next to it for a few minutes more than necessary because my next class is down the hallway where Six\u2019s locker is. I haven\u2019t seen her since she left the park last night and I\u2019m not sure I really want to see her. I\u2019m not sure about anything. I have so many questions to ask her but just thinking about having to ask her any of them makes my chest hurt so bad I can\u2019t fucking breathe.</p><p>After the final bell rings, I decide to walk to my next class. I debated staying home from school altogether, but I figured it would be worse just sitting in my room thinking about it all day. I\u2019d rather be preoccupied for as long as I can today because I know as soon as school is out I need to confront her.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019m supposed to confront her right now, because as soon as I round the corner, my eyes land on her.</p><p>I come to a quiet stop and watch her. She\u2019s the only one in the hallway right now. She\u2019s standing still, facing her locker. I want to walk away before she sees me, but I can\u2019t stop watching her. Her whole demeanor is heartbroken and I want so bad to rush over to her and wrap my arms around her but . . . I can\u2019t. I want to scream at her and hug her and kiss her and blame her for every single jumbled-up emotion I\u2019ve spent the last day trying to process.</p><p>I sigh heavily and she turns to look at me. I\u2019m far enough away that I can\u2019t hear her crying, but close enough I can see the tears. Neither one of us moves. We just stare. Several moments pass and I can see she\u2019s hoping I say something to her.</p><p>I clear my throat and begin walking toward her. The closer I get, the louder her soft cry becomes. I get about five feet away, then I pause. The closer I get to her, the harder it is to breathe.</p><p>\u201cIs he . . .\u201d I close my eyes and pass a calming breath, then open them again and try my hardest to finish my sentence with dry eyes. \u201cWhen you talked about the boy who broke your heart in Italy . . . you were referring to him, weren\u2019t you. The baby?\u201d</p><p>I can barely see the nod of her head when she confirms my thoughts. I squeeze my eyes shut and tilt my head back.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know hearts could literally ache like this. It hurts so much I want to reach inside and rip it out of my chest so I\u2019ll never feel this again.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. Not right here. We can\u2019t stand in the hallway of a high school and have this discussion.</p><p>I turn around before I open my eyes so I don\u2019t have to see the look on her face again. I walk straight to my classroom and open the door, then walk inside without looking back at her.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still here. I don\u2019t want to be here and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll leave in half an hour. I just can\u2019t leave before then because I\u2019m scared of what she might think if I don\u2019t show up to lunch. I could text her and tell her I\u2019ll talk to her later, but I\u2019m not even sure I feel like sending her a text yet. There\u2019s still so much I have to process, I\u2019d rather just ignore it all until I find the strength to sort through everything.</p><p>I walk through the cafeteria doors and head straight to our table. There\u2019s no way I can eat lunch so I don\u2019t even bother getting food. Breckin is sitting in my usual spot next to Six, but that\u2019s probably a good thing. Not so sure I could sit by her right now, anyway.</p><p>Her eyes are focused on the textbook in front of her. She\u2019s not crying anymore. I take a seat across from her and I know she knows I just sat down, but her eyes never move. Sky and Holder are deep in conversation with Breckin, so I watch them, trying to find a spot to jump in.</p><p>I can\u2019t though, because I\u2019m completely unable to pay attention. I keep stealing glances at her to make sure she isn\u2019t crying or to see if she\u2019s looking at me. She never does either of those things.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating?\u201d Breckin says, stealing my attention.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat something,\u201d Holder says. \u201cAnd a nap might do you some good, too. Maybe you should go home.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIf you do go home, you should take Six with you,\u201d Sky says. \u201cYou both look like you could use a nap.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even respond to that with a nod. My eyes fall back to Six just in time to see a tear land on a page in front of her. She quickly swipes it away with her hand and flips the page over.</p><p>Fuck if that just didn\u2019t make me feel like complete shit.</p><p>I continue to watch her and tears continue to fall onto the pages, one by one. Her hand is always quick to wipe them away before anyone notices and she always flips to a new page before she could even possibly have read the last one.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Breckin,\u201d I say. He looks at me blankly, but doesn\u2019t make an effort to move. \u201cI want your seat. Get up.\u201d</p><p>He finally realizes what I\u2019m saying, so he quickly stands up. I stand and walk around the table, then I take a seat next to her. I sit down beside her and when I do, she brings her arms onto the table. She folds them and buries her head into the crease in her elbow. I watch as her shoulders begin to shake and dammit if I can allow her to keep feeling this way. I wrap an arm around her and lower my forehead to the side of her head and I close my eyes. I don\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t do anything. I just hold her while she cries into her arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaniel,\u201d I hear her say through her muffled tears. She lifts her head and looks up at me. \u201cDaniel, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d Her tears become sobs and her sobs become too much. It\u2019s too fucking much.</p><p>I pull her to my chest. \u201cShh,\u201d I say into her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Her body becomes limp against mine and everyone in the cafeteria is beginning to stare at us. I want to hold her and tell her how sorry I am for allowing her to walk away last night, but she needs privacy. I wrap my arm tighter around her, then scoop her legs up into my other arm. I pull her against me, then stand up and carry her out into the hallway. I keep walking until I round the corner and find our room. She\u2019s still crying against my chest, wrapped tightly around me. I open the door to the maintenance closet, then I close it behind us. I back up to the door and slide down until I meet the floor, still holding her in my arms.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d I say, lowering my mouth to her ear. \u201cI want you to try to stop crying, because I have so much I want to say to you.\u201d</p> <p>I feel her nod against my chest and I remain quiet, waiting on her to calm down. Several minutes pass before she\u2019s finally quiet enough for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I am so sorry for letting you walk away last night but I don\u2019t want you to think for one second it was because I was judging your choices. Okay? I\u2019m not about to put myself in your shoes and tell you that you made a bad choice, because I wasn\u2019t there and I have no clue how hard that must have been for you.\u201d</p><p>I adjust her and straighten out my legs so she\u2019s forced to sit up and look at me. I pull one of her legs to the other side of me until she\u2019s facing me. \u201cI\u2019m just sad, okay? That\u2019s all this is. I\u2019m allowed to be sad about this and I need you to let me be sad because this is a whole hell of a lot to process in a day.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her lips into a thin line and she nods while I wipe away her tears with both my thumbs. \u201cI have so many questions, Six. And I know you\u2019ll answer them when you\u2019re ready, but I can wait. If you need me to give you time I can.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cDaniel. He\u2019s your son. I\u2019ll answer any question you ask me. I just don\u2019t know if you want to hear the answers because . . .\u201d She squeezes her eyes shut to hold back more tears. \u201cBecause I think I made the wrong choice and it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s too late to go back now.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s crying hard again, so I wrap my arms around her and hug her.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew he was yours or that I would eventually find you I would have never done it, Daniel. I would have never given him up but I did and now you\u2019re here and it\u2019s too late because I don\u2019t know where he is and I\u2019m sorry. God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wishing she would stop. It\u2019s hurting me more to see her upset with herself than anything else about this whole situation.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Six.\u201d I pull back and look her in the eyes, holding her face firmly between my hands. \u201cYou made a choice for him. Not for yourself. Not for me. You did what was best for him and I will never be able to thank you enough for that. And please don\u2019t think this changes how I feel about you. If anything, it just lets me know that I\u2019m not crazy. For the past month I\u2019ve been thinking my feelings for you couldn\u2019t be real because there are so many of them and they\u2019re so much. Too much sometimes. I constantly have to bite my tongue when I\u2019m around you because all I\u2019ve been wanting to do lately is tell you how much I love you. But it\u2019s only been a month since we met and the only other time I\u2019ve said those words out loud to a girl was over a year ago. Right here on this floor. And you wouldn\u2019t believe how real I wanted that moment to be for us, Six. I know I didn\u2019t know you but my God, I wished I did. And now that I do know you . . . really know you . . . I know it\u2019s real. I love you. And knowing what we shared last year and now knowing what you had to go through and how it\u2019s made you exactly who you are right now . . . it just blows my mind. It blows my mind that I get to love you.\u201d</p><p>I feel her hands wiping tears from my cheeks when I lean in to kiss her. I pull her against me and she pulls me against her and I have no plans to ever let her go. I kiss her until her hands move up to my face and she pulls her lips from mine. Our foreheads meet and she\u2019s still crying, but her tears are different now. I feel like they\u2019re tears of relief rather than tears of worry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy it\u2019s you,\u201d she says, keeping her hands locked on my face. \u201cI\u2019m so happy it was you.\u201d</p> <p>I pull her against me and hold her. I hold her for so long that the bell rings and the hallway fills and empties and another bell rings and we\u2019re still sitting here together, holding on to each other when the silence in the hallway returns. I\u2019m periodically pressing kisses into her hair, stroking her back, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHe looked like you,\u201d she says quietly. Her hand is lightly trailing up and down my arm and her cheek is pressed against my chest. \u201cHe had your brown eyes and he was kind of bald, but I could tell he was going to have brown hair. And he had your mouth. You have a great mouth.\u201d</p><p>I rub my hand up her back and kiss the top of her head. \u201cHe\u2019s got it made,\u201d I say. \u201cLooks just like his daddy, hopefully acts like his mommy, and he\u2019ll have a nice Italian accent. Kid won\u2019t have any problems in life.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and hearing that sound immediately brings tears to my eyes again. I squeeze her tight against me and rest my cheek against the top of her head and sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best that it all happened like it did,\u201d I say. \u201cIf we had decided to keep him I would have ruined him with some stupid nickname. I probably would have called him Salty Balls or some shit like that. I\u2019m not cut out to be a dad yet, obviously.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019d be a great dad. And one of these days, Salty Balls will be the perfect nickname for one of our kids. Just not yet.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m the one laughing. \u201cWhat if we have all girls?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cEven better.\u201d</p> <p>I smile and keep her held close against me. After last night and being apart from her, knowing how much she was hurting, I know I\u2019ll never want to feel that way again. I never want her to feel that way again.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I just realized?\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had sex. I\u2019ve been kind of bummed because if I had sex with you, it would have made you the seventh person I\u2019ve ever had sex with and that\u2019s a lot. But you\u2019ll still be the sixth, because I was already counting you and I didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like six,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s a good number to be. It\u2019s actually my favorite number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited now that you know we\u2019ve already had sex,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m still making you wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear you down soon enough,\u201d I tease.</p><p>I bring one of my hands up to her head and I hold it while I lean forward and kiss her softly on the lips. I stay close to her mouth and make a confession. \u201cI haven\u2019t brought this up because we haven\u2019t been together that long and I didn\u2019t want to scare you off. But now that I know we have a kid together, it makes it less embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. What is it?\u201d she asks nervously.</p><p>\u201cWe graduate in less than a month. I know you and Sky and Holder were planning on going to the same college in Dallas after the summer. I had already applied to a college in Austin, but after I met you I might have applied to Dallas, too. You know . . . in case things worked out with us. I didn\u2019t like the thought of being five hours apart.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head and looks up at me. \u201cWhen did you apply?\u201d</p><p>I shrug like it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cThe night Sky had that dinner for you.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and looks at me. \u201cThat was twenty-four hours after we went out for the first time. You applied to my college after knowing me for one day?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, but technically I knew you for a whole year. If you look at it that way, it\u2019s way less creepy.\u201d</p><p>She laughs at my logic. \u201cWell? Did you get accepted?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI might have already made living arrangements with Holder, too.\u201d</p><p>She grins and it\u2019s probably the most I\u2019ve ever loved a smile. \u201cDaniel? This is serious. This thing with us. It\u2019s pretty intense, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah. I think we might really be in love this time. No more pretending.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cThings are so serious now, I think it\u2019s time I introduced you to all my brothers.\u201d</p><p>I stop nodding and start shaking my head back and forth. \u201cI may be exaggerating. I don\u2019t love you that much.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNo, you love me. You love me so much, Daniel. You\u2019ve loved me since the second I let you accidentally touch my boob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ve loved you since you forced me to stick my tongue in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve loved me since I let you kiss me in a crowded restaurant next to a dirty diaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ve loved you since you walked through Sky\u2019s bedroom door with that spoon in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cActually, you\u2019ve loved me since the first time you told me you loved me a year ago. Right here in this room.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you since the moment you fell on top of me and said you hated everybody.\u201d</p><p>She stops smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you since the moment you said you hated everybody, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to hate everybody,\u201d I say. \u201cUntil I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was unhateable.\u201d She grins.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you unhateable isn\u2019t even a real word.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes focus on mine and she takes both my hands, then laces her fingers through them. We stare at each other like we\u2019ve done so many times before, but this time I feel it in every single part of me. I feel her in every part of me and the feeling is new and heavy and intense and I realize in this moment that we just became so much more together than we could ever possibly be alone.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daniel Wesley,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI love you Seven Marie Six Cinderella Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cThank you for not turning out to be an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for never asking me to change.\u201d I lean forward and kiss the smile that just spread across her lips as I silently thank the universe for sending her back to me.</p><p>My fucking angel.</p><p>The end. </p> </body></html>"]
