Jeff had constructed the flimsy tent using clothespegs to hold up the blankets and rocks to secure the base. The space was tight, but she managed to maneuver into her sleeping bag.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this great?\u201d Jeff asked. He stuck his head out of the front opening and gazed at the dark sky and the spattering of stars that winked back at them. On second thought, Robin decided they were laughing at her, those stars. And with good reason. There probably wasn\u2019t another thirty-year-old woman in the entire state of California who would\u2019ve agreed to this craziness.</p> <p>It was the first night in their new house and Robin was exhausted. They\u2019d started moving out of the apartment before five that morning and she\u2019d just finished unpacking the last box. The beds were assembled, but Jeff wouldn\u2019t hear of doing anything as mundane as sleeping on a real mattress. After waiting years to camp out in his own backyard, her son wasn\u2019t about to delay the adventure by even one night.</p><p>Robin couldn\u2019t let him sleep outside alone and, since he hadn\u2019t met any neighbors yet, there was only one option left. Surely there\u2019d be a Mother of the Year award in this for her.</p><p>\u201cYou want to hear a joke?\u201d Jeff asked, rolling on to his back and nudging her.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She swallowed a yawn, hoping she could stay awake long enough to laugh at the appropriate time. She needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>For the next half hour, Robin was entertained with a series of riddles, nonsense rhymes and off-key renditions of Jeff\u2019s favourite songs from summer camp.</p><p>\u201cKnock knock,\u201d she said when it appeared her son had run through his repertoire.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda who thinks up these silly jokes?\u201d</p><p>Jeff laughed as though she\u2019d come up with the funniest line ever devised. Her son\u2019s enthusiasm couldn\u2019t help but rub off on Robin and some of her weariness eased. Camping was fun\u2014sort of. But it\u2019d been years since she\u2019d slept on the ground and, frankly, she couldn\u2019t remember it being quite this hard.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be warm enough?\u201d she teased. Jeff had used every blanket they owned, first to construct the tent and then to pad it. To be on the safe side, two or three more were piled on top of their sleeping bags on the off-chance an arctic frost descended upon them. It was spring, but a San Francisco spring could be chilly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answered, missing the kidding note in her voice. \u201cBut if you get cold, you can have one of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p> <p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>Now that she thought about it, she was. \u201cSure. Whatcha got?\u201d</p><p>Jeff disappeared into his sleeping bag and returned a moment later with a limp package of licorice, a small plastic bag full of squashed marshmallows and a flattened box of raisins. Robin declined the snack.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we going to buy me my dog?\u201d Jeff asked, chewing loudly on the raisins.</p><p>Robin listened to the sound and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cMom...the dog?\u201d he repeated after a few minutes.</p><p>Robin had been dreading that question most of the day. She\u2019d managed to forestall Jeff for the past month by telling him they\u2019d discuss getting a dog after they were settled in their house.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d start looking for ads in the paper first thing tomorrow,\u201d Jeff said, still munching.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure when we\u2019ll start the search for the right dog.\u201d She was a coward, Robin freely admitted it, but she hated to disappoint Jeff. He had his heart set on a dog. How like his father he was, in his love for animals.</p><p>\u201cI want a big one, you know. None of those fancy little poodles or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA golden retriever would be nice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a German shepherd,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cYour father loved dogs,\u201d she whispered, although she\u2019d told Jeff that countless times. Lenny had been gone for so many years, she had trouble remembering what their life together had been like. They\u2019d been crazy in love with each other and married shortly after their high-school graduation. A year later, Robin became pregnant. Jeff had been barely six months old when Lenny was killed in a freak car accident on his way home from work. In the span of mere moments, Robin\u2019s comfortable world had been sent into a tailspin, and ten years later it was still whirling.</p><p>With her family\u2019s help, she\u2019d gone back to school and obtained her degree. She was now a certified public accountant working for a large San Francisco insurance firm. Over the years she\u2019d dated a number of men, but none she\u2019d seriously consider marrying. Her life was far more complicated now than it had been as a young bride. The thought of falling in love again terrified her.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog did Dad have when he was a kid?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Rover was any particular breed,\u201d Robin answered, then paused to recall exactly what Lenny\u2019s childhood dog had looked like. \u201cI think he was mostly...Labrador.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Dad have any other animals?\u201d</p><p>Robin smiled at her warm memories of her late husband. She enjoyed the way Jeff loved hearing stories about his father\u2014no matter how many times he\u2019d already heard them. \u201cHe collected three more pets the first year we were married. It seemed he was always bringing home a stray cat or lost dog. We couldn\u2019t keep them, of course, because we weren\u2019t allowed pets in the apartment complex. We went to great lengths to hide them for a few days until we could locate their owners or find them a good home. For our first wedding anniversary, he bought me a goldfish. Your father really loved animals.\u201d</p><p>Jeff beamed and planted his chin on his folded arms.</p><p>\u201cWe dreamed of buying a small farm someday and raising chickens and goats and maybe a cow or two. Your father wanted to buy you a pony, too.\u201d Hard as she tried, she couldn\u2019t quite hide the pain in her voice. Even after all these years, the memory of Lenny\u2019s sudden death still hurt. Looking at her son, so eager for a dog of his own, Robin missed her husband more than ever.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dad were going to buy a farm?\u201d Jeff cried, his voice ebullient. \u201cYou never told me that before.\u201d He paused. \u201cA pony for me? Really? Do you think we\u2019ll ever be able to afford one? Look how long it took to save for the house.\u201d</p><p>Robin smiled. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to give up on the idea of you and me owning a farm, at least in the near future.\u201d</p><p>When they were first married, Robin and Lenny had talked for hours about their dreams. They\u2019d charted their lives, confident that nothing would ever separate them. Their love had been too strong. It was true that she\u2019d never told Jeff about buying a farm, nor had she told him how they\u2019d planned to name it Paradise. Paradise, because that was what the farm would be to them. In retrospect, not telling Jeff was a way of protecting him. He\u2019d lost so much\u2014not only the guidance and love of his father but all the things they could have had as a family. She\u2019d never mentioned the pony before, or the fact that Lenny had always longed for a horse....</p><p>Jeff yawned loudly and Robin marvelled at his endurance. He\u2019d carried in as many boxes as the movers had, racing up and down the stairs with an energy Robin envied. He\u2019d unpacked the upstairs bathroom, as well as his own bedroom and had helped her organize the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait to get my dog,\u201d Jeff said, his voice fading. Within minutes he was sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cA dog,\u201d Robin said softly as her eyes closed. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to break the bad news to Jeff. They couldn\u2019t get a dog\u2014at least not right away. She was unwilling to leave a large dog locked indoors all day while she went off to work and Jeff was in school. Tying one up in the backyard was equally unfair, and she couldn\u2019t afford to build a fence. Not this year, anyway. Then there was the cost of feeding a dog and paying the vet\u2019s bills. With this new home, Robin\u2019s budget was already stretched to the limit.</p><p>Robin awoke feeling chilled and warm at the same time. In the gray dawn, she glanced at her watch. Six-thirty. At some point during the night, the old sleeping bag that dated back to her high-school days had come unzipped and the cool morning air had chilled her arms and legs. Yet her back was warm and cozy. Jeff had probably snuggled up to her during the night. She sighed, determined to sleep for another half hour or so. With that idea in mind, she reached for a blanket to wrap around her shoulders and met with some resistance. She tugged and pulled, to no avail. It was then that she felt something wet and warm close to her neck. Her eyes shot open. Very slowly, she turned her head until she came eyeball to eyeball with a big black dog.</p><p>Robin gasped loudly and struggled into a sitting position, which was difficult with the sleeping bag and several blankets wrapped around her legs, imprisoning her.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she demanded, edging away from the dog. The Labrador had eased himself between her and Jeff and made himself right at home. His head rested on his paws and he looked perfectly content, if a bit disgruntled about having his nap interrupted. He didn\u2019t seem at all interested in vacating the premises.</p><p>Jeff rolled over and opened his eyes. Immediately he bolted upright. \u201cMom,\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cYou got me a dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014he isn\u2019t ours. I don\u2019t know who he belongs to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice was triumphant. \u201cHe belongs to me.\u201d His thin arms hugged the animal\u2019s neck. \u201cYou really got me a dog! It was supposed to be a surprise, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this animal came from, but he isn\u2019t ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t?\u201d His voice sagged in disappointment. \u201cBut who owns him, then? And how did he get inside the tent with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Robin rubbed the sleep from her eyes while she attempted to put her garbled thoughts in order. \u201cHe looks too well fed and groomed to be a stray. He must belong to someone in the neighborhood. Maybe he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackie!\u201d As if in response, she was interrupted by a crisp male voice. \u201cBlackie. Here, boy.\u201d</p><p>The Labrador lifted his head, but stayed where he was. Robin didn\u2019t blame him. Jeff was stroking his back with one hand and rubbing his ears with the other, all the while crooning to him softly.</p><p>With some effort, Robin managed to divest herself of the sleeping bag. She reached for her tennis shoes and crawled out of the tent. No sooner was she on her feet than she turned to find a lanky man standing a few yards from her, just on the other side of the three-foot hedge that separated the two properties. Obviously he was her neighbor. Robin smiled, but the friendly gesture was not returned. In fact, the man looked downright unfriendly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her neighbor was also an imposing man, at least six feet tall. Since Robin was only five-three, he towered head and shoulders above her. Instinctively, she stiffened her back, meeting his dark eyes. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>He barely glanced in her direction, and when he did, he dismissed her with little more than a nod. After a night on the ground, with her son and a dog for bedmates, Robin realized she wasn\u2019t looking her best, but she resented the way his eyes flicked disinterestedly over her.</p><p>Robin usually gave people the benefit of the doubt, but toward this man, she felt an immediate antipathy. His face was completely emotionless, which lent him an intimidating air. He was clearly aware of that and used it to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said again, clasping her hands tightly. She drew herself to her full height and raised her chin. \u201cI believe your dog is in the tent with my son.\u201d</p> <p>Her news appeared to surprise him; his expression softened. Robin was struck by the change. When his face relaxed, he was actually a very attractive man. For the most part, Robin hardly noticed how good-looking a man was or wasn\u2019t, but this time...she noticed. Perhaps because of the contrast with his forbidding demeanor of a moment before.</p><p>\u201cBlackie knows better than to leave the yard. Here, boy!\u201d He shouted for the Labrador again, this time including a sharp whistle loud enough to pierce Robin\u2019s eardrums. The dog emerged from the tent and approached the hedge, slowly wagging his tail.</p><p>\u201cIs that your dog?\u201d Jeff asked, dashing out behind Blackie. \u201cHe\u2019s great. How long have you had him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t bother you again,\u201d the man said, ignoring Jeff\u2019s question. Robin supposed his words were meant to be an apology. \u201cHe\u2019s well trained\u2014he\u2019s never left my yard before. I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackie wasn\u2019t any bother,\u201d Jeff hurried to explain, racing forward. \u201cHe crawled into the tent with us and made himself at home, which was all right with us, wasn\u2019t it, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Robin answered, flipping her shoulder-length auburn hair away from her face. She\u2019d had it tied back when she\u2019d gone to bed, but it had pulled free during the night. Robin could well imagine how it looked now. Most mornings it tended to resemble foam on a newly poured mug of beer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we, Blackie?\u201d Jeff knelt, and without hesitation the dog came to him, eagerly licking his face.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes revealed astonishment, however fleeting, and his dark brows drew together over his high-bridged nose. \u201cBlackie,\u201d he snapped. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>The Labrador squeezed between two overgrown laurel bushes and returned to his master, who didn\u2019t look any too pleased at his dog\u2019s affection for Jeff.</p><p>\u201cMy son has a way with animals,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>\u201cDo you live here?\u201d Jeff asked next. He seemed completely unaware of their new neighbor\u2019s unfriendliness.</p> <p>\u201cNext door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Jeff grinned widely and placed his right hand on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m Jeff Masterson and this is my mom, Robin. We moved in yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cole Camden. Welcome to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Although his words were cordial, his tone wasn\u2019t. Robin felt about as welcome as a punk-rock band at a retirees\u2019 picnic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a dog myself,\u201d Jeff went on affably. \u201cThat\u2019s why we moved out of the apartment building\u2014I couldn\u2019t have a pet there except for my goldfish.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded without comment.</p><p>Oh, great, Robin thought. After years of scrimping and saving to buy a house, they were going to be stuck with an ill-tempered next-door neighbor. His house was older than the others on the block. Much bigger, too. Robin guessed that his home, a sprawling three-story structure, had been built in the early thirties. She knew that at one time this neighborhood had been filled with large opulent homes like Cole Camden\u2019s. Gradually, over the years, the older places had been torn down and a series of two-story houses and trendy ramblers built in their place. Her neighbor\u2019s house was the last vestige of an era long past.</p><p>\u201cHave you got any kids?\u201d Jeff could hardly keep the eagerness out of his voice. In the apartment complex there\u2019d always been plenty of playmates, and he was eager to make new friends, especially before he started classes in an unfamiliar school on Monday morning.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s face hardened and Robin could have sworn the question had angered him. An uncomfortable moment passed before he answered. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any kids.\u201d His voice held a rough undertone, and for a split second Robin was sure she saw a flash of pain in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay if I played with Blackie sometimes? Just until I get my own dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cole\u2019s response was sharp, but, when Jeff flinched at his vehemence, Cole appeared to regret his harsh tone. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019d probably be best if you stayed in your own yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cYou can send Blackie over here to visit anytime you want. I like dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d A hint of a smile lifted the corners of his mouth. Then his cool gaze moved from Jeff to Robin, his face again expressionless, but she sensed that he\u2019d made up his mind about them, categorized them and come to his own conclusions.</p><p>If Cole Camden thought he could intimidate her, Robin had news for him. He\u2019d broadcast his message loud and clear. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered by her or her son, and in exchange he\u2019d stay out of her way. That was fine with her. Terrific, in fact. She didn\u2019t have time for humoring grouches.</p><p>Without another word, Cole turned and strode toward his house with Blackie at his heels.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Mr. Camden,\u201d Jeff called, raising his hand.</p><p>Robin wasn\u2019t surprised when their neighbor didn\u2019t give them the courtesy of a reply.</p><p>In an effort to distract Jeff from Cole Camden\u2019s unfriendliness, she said brightly, \u201cHey, I\u2019m starving. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll let me play with Blackie?\u201d</p><p>Robin sighed, considering the dilemma that faced her. She didn\u2019t want Cole to hurt Jeff\u2019s feelings, but it wasn\u2019t likely their neighbor would appreciate her son\u2019s affinity with his Labrador. By the same token, a neighbor\u2019s dog, even one that belonged to a grouch, would ease her guilt over not being able to provide Jeff with the dog she\u2019d promised him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Mom?\u201d Jeff prompted. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably let me play with Blackie sometimes, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, honey,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Later the same day, after buying groceries to stock their bare kitchen shelves and picking up other necessities, Robin counted the change at the bottom of her purse. She needed to be sure she had money for the subway on Monday morning. Luckily she had enough spare change for BART\u2014Bay Area Rapid Transit\u2014to last the week, but it was packed lunches for her and Jeff until her next payday, which was in two weeks.</p><p>Her finances would\u2019ve been in better shape if she\u2019d waited another year to move out of the apartment. But interest rates were at a two-year low and she\u2019d decided soon after the first of the year that if they were ever going to move out of the apartment this was the time.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jeff crashed through the back door, breathless. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Robin glanced up from the salad she was mixing. A completely disgusted look on his face, her son flung himself into a chair and propped his elbows on the table. Then he let out a forceful sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we made a bad mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing but girls in this neighborhood.\u201d He made it sound as though they\u2019d unexpectedly landed in enemy territory. \u201cI rode my bike up and down the street and all I saw were girls.\u201d He wrinkled his nose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be meeting lots of boys in school on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t taking this seriously!\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what this means. There are seven houses on this block. Six of them have kids and only one has a boy, and that\u2019s me. I\u2019m surrounded by women!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find all this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked, of course.\u201d He sighed again. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Robin asked. \u201cAre you suggesting we move back to the apartment?\u201d</p><p>Jeff considered this for only a moment. \u201cI\u2019d think we should if it wasn\u2019t for two things. We can\u2019t have a dog there. And I found a fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden way back in Mr. Camden\u2019s yard and covered by a bunch of brush. It\u2019s real neat there. I don\u2019t think he knows about it, because the word on the street is he doesn\u2019t like kids. Someone must\u2019ve built it and I\u2019m going to find out who. If there\u2019s a club going, I want in. I\u2019ve got the right\u2014I live closer to Mr. Camden than anyone else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Robin munched on a slice of green pepper and handed one to Jeff. \u201cSo you think it\u2019d be all right if we stayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Jeff conceded, \u201cat least until I find out more about the fort.\u201d</p><p>Robin was about to say something else when the doorbell chimed.</p><p>Jeff\u2019s blue eyes met hers. \u201cI bet it\u2019s one of those pesky girls,\u201d he said in disgust.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get rid of her?\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded emphatically.</p><p>Robin was smiling when she answered the front door. Jeff was right; it was a girl, one who seemed to be a couple of years younger than her son. She hadn\u2019t come alone, though. Standing with the youngster was an adult.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the woman said cheerfully, flashing Robin a warm smile. \u201cI know you\u2019ve hardly had a chance to get settled, but I wanted to introduce myself. I\u2019m Heather Lawrence and this is my daughter, Kelly. We live next door, and we\u2019d like to welcome you to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Robin introduced herself as she opened the door and invited them in. Heather was cute and perky. Her hair was cut in a short bob that bounced when she spoke. Robin knew right away that she was going to like these neighbors. Heather\u2019s warm reception was a pleasant change from the way Cole Camden had greeted her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure I\u2019m not interrupting anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Robin led her into the kitchen, where Jeff sat waiting. He cast her a look that suggested she should be shot for treason, then muttered something about forgetting that mothers were really girls in disguise. Then he headed out the front door.</p><p>Robin reached for two matching ceramic mugs and poured coffee for herself and her new friend. She offered Kelly a glass of juice, then slid into a chair across the table from the girl and her mother. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Jeff.\u201d She felt obliged to apologize. \u201cHe\u2019s at the age where he thinks girls are a plague to society.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Heather said, smiling. \u201cKelly isn\u2019t keen on boys herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re creeps. I\u2019d rather ride my bicycle than play with a boy,\u201d the girl announced. \u201cBut Mom wanted me to come over with her so she didn\u2019t look like a busybody. Right, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Heather blushed and threw her daughter a murderous glance.</p><p>Robin laughed. \u201cI thought it would take several weeks to get to know my neighbors and I\u2019ve met two in one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone else has already been over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole Camden introduced himself this morning,\u201d she explained, keeping her eyes averted to hide the resentment she felt toward her unfriendly neighbor. Even now, hours later, she couldn\u2019t help thinking about the way he\u2019d reacted to her and Jeff.</p><p>\u201cCole Camden introduced himself?\u201d Heather repeated, sounding shocked. She frowned, staring into space as though digesting the fact.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I think he would\u2019ve preferred to avoid me, but his dog wanted to make friends with Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Heather\u2019s mouth opened and closed twice. \u201cBlackie did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there something strange about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes. To say Cole keeps to himself is an understatement. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s said more than a handful of words to me in the entire two years since Kelly and I moved here. I don\u2019t know why he stays in the neighborhood.\u201d She paused to respond to her daughter, who was asking permission to go home. \u201cThank Robin for the juice, honey. Anyway,\u201d she went on, turning back to Robin when her daughter had skipped out the door, \u201che\u2019s all alone in that huge house and it\u2019s ridiculous, really. Can you imagine what his heating bills must be? Although, personally, I don\u2019t think money is much of a problem for him. But I\u2019ve never heard any details.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise Robin to learn Cole lived alone. She\u2019d barely met the man, but guessed that life held little joy for him. It was as though love, warmth and friendship had all been found lacking and had therefore been systematically dismissed.</p><p>\u201cApparently, he was married once, but he was divorced long before I came here.\u201d</p><p>Robin had dealt with unfriendly men before, but something about Cole struck her hard and deep, and she wasn\u2019t sure what it was or why he evoked such a strong feeling within her.</p><p>\u201cHe and his dog are inseparable,\u201d Heather added.</p> <p>Robin nodded, hardly listening. He\u2019d intimidated her at first, but when she\u2019d pulled herself together and faced him squarely he\u2019d loosened up a bit and, later, even seemed amused. But then Jeff had asked him about children, and Robin had seen the pain in his eyes.</p><p>As if by magic, her son\u2019s face appeared around the door. When he saw that Kelly was gone, he walked into the room, hands in his back pockets.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a dog?\u201d he asked Heather.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no. Kelly\u2019s allergic.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded as though to say that was exactly the kind of thing he expected from a girl. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a German shepherd soon, aren\u2019t we, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Robin responded, feeling wretched. After Heather left, she was going to tell Jeff the truth. She fully intended to let him have his dog, but he\u2019d have to wait a while. She\u2019d been practicing what to say. She\u2019d even come up with a compromise. They could get a cat. Cats didn\u2019t seem to mind being left on their own, and they didn\u2019t need to be walked. Although she wasn\u2019t happy about keeping a litter box in the house, Robin was willing to put up with that inconvenience. Then, when she could afford to have a fence built, they\u2019d get a dog. She planned to be positive and direct with Jeff. He\u2019d understand. At least she hoped he would.</p><p>Heather stayed only a few more minutes. The visit had been a fruitful one. Robin had learned that Heather was divorced, worked mornings in an office and provided after-school day care in an effort to spend more time with Kelly. This information was good news to Robin, and the two women agreed that Jeff would go to the Lawrence house before and after school, instead of the community center several blocks away. The arrangement suited them both; even Jeff shrugged in agreement.</p><p>Robin would\u2019ve liked to ask her new friend more about Cole, but his name didn\u2019t come up again, and she didn\u2019t want to seem too curious about him.</p> <p>After Heather left, Robin braced herself for the talk with Jeff about getting a dog. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go well. It seemed that after waiting nearly ten years, a few more months was completely unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cYou promised!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou said I could have a dog when we moved into the house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, sweetheart, but not right away.\u201d</p><p>Unusual for Jeff, tears gathered in his eyes, and he struggled to hold them back. Soon Robin felt moisture filling her own eyes. She hated disappointing Jeff more than anything. His heart was set on getting a dog right away, and he considered the offer of a cat a poor substitute.</p><p>He left the house soon afterward. In an effort to soothe his hurt feelings, Robin cooked her son\u2019s favorite meal\u2014macaroni and cheese with sliced sausage and lots of ketchup.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him on the pavement or the street when she went to check half an hour later. She stood on the porch, wondering where he\u2019d gone. His bike was inside the garage, and he\u2019d already aired his views about playing with any of the girls in the neighborhood.</p><p>It would be just like him to storm into his room in a fit of indignation and promptly fall asleep. Robin hurried upstairs to his bedroom, which was across the hall from her own.</p><p>His bed was made and his clothes hung neatly in the closet. Robin decided that in another day or two, everything would be back to normal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she turned to leave that she saw the note on his desk. Picking it up, Robin read the first line and felt a swirling sense of panic.</p><p>Dear Mom,</p><p>You broke your promise. You said I could have a dog and now you say I have to wait. If I can\u2019t have a dog, then I don\u2019t want to live with you anymore. This is goodbye forever.</p><p>Love, Jeff</p><p>Two</p><p>For a moment, Robin was too stunned to react. Her heart was pounding so hard it echoed in her ears like thunder, so loud it seemed to knock her off balance.</p><p>Rushing down the stairs, she stood on the porch, cupped her hands over her mouth and screamed frantically. \u201cJeff! Jeffy!\u201d</p><p>Cole Camden was standing on his front porch, too. He released a shrill whistle and stood waiting expectantly. When nothing happened, he called, \u201cBlackie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff!\u201d Robin tried again.</p><p>\u201cBlackie!\u201d</p><p>Robin called for Jeff once more, but her voice cracked as the panic engulfed her. She paused, placed her hand over her mouth and closed her eyes, trying to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cBlackie!\u201d Cole yelled. He looked furious about his dog\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>It took Robin only a moment to put two and two together. \u201cCole,\u201d she cried, running across the lawn toward him. \u201cI think Jeff and Blackie might have run away together.\u201d</p><p>Cole looked at her as if she was deranged, and Robin couldn\u2019t blame him. \u201cJeff left me a note. He wants a dog so badly and we can\u2019t get one right now because...well, because we can\u2019t, and I had to tell him, and he was terribly disappointed and he decided to run away.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cThe whole idea is ridiculous. Even if Jeff did run away, Blackie would never go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019d make this up?\u201d she shrieked. \u201cThe last time I saw Jeff was around four-thirty, and I\u2019d bet cold cash that\u2019s about the same time Blackie disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cThen where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew that, do you think I\u2019d be standing around here arguing with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, lady, I don\u2019t know your son, but I know my dog and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s not lady,\u201d Robin flared, clenching her hands at her sides. He was looking at her as though she were a madwoman on the loose\u2014which she was where her son was concerned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have troubled you. When I find Jeff, I\u2019ll make sure your dog gets home.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes shot sparks in her direction, but she ignored them. Turning abruptly, she ran back to her own house. Halfway there, she stopped dead and whirled around to face Cole again. \u201cThe fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fort?\u201d Cole demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe one that\u2019s in the back of your yard. It\u2019s covered with brush.... Jeff found it earlier today. He wouldn\u2019t know anywhere else to go and that would be the perfect hiding place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s been there in years,\u201d Cole said, discounting her suggestion.</p><p>\u201cThe least we can do is look.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s nod was reluctant. He led the way to his backyard, which was much larger than hers. There was a small grove of oak trees at the rear of the property and beyond that a high fence. Apparently the fort was situated between the trees and the fence. A few minutes later, in the most remote corner of the yard, nestled between two trees, Robin saw the small wooden structure. It blended into the terrain, and if she hadn\u2019t been looking for the hideaway, she would never have seen it.</p><p>It was obvious when they neared the space that someone had taken up residence. Cole lowered himself down to all fours, peered inside, then looked back at Robin with a nod. He breathed in sharply, apparently irritated by this turn of events, and crawled through the narrow entrance.</p><p>Not about to be left standing by herself, Robin got down on her knees and followed him in.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d suspected, Jeff and Blackie were huddled together in a corner. Jeff was fast asleep and Blackie was curled up by his side, guarding him. When Cole and Robin entered, the Labrador lifted his head and wagged his tail in greeting.</p><p>The fort wasn\u2019t much bigger than the tent Jeff had constructed the night before, and Robin was forced to pull her knees close and loop her arms around them. Cole\u2019s larger body seemed to fill every available bit of space.</p><p>Jeff must have sensed that his newfound home had been invaded because his eyes fluttered open and he gazed at Robin, then turned his head to stare at Cole.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cI bet I\u2019m in trouble, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Robin was so grateful to find him that all she could do was nod. If she\u2019d tried to speak, her voice would\u2019ve been shaking with emotion, which would only have embarrassed them both.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jeff,\u201d Cole said sternly. \u201cYou were going to run away from home. I see you brought everything you needed.\u201d He pushed the frying pan and atlas into the middle of their cramped quarters. \u201cWhat I want to know is how you convinced Blackie to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came on his own,\u201d Jeff murmured, but his eyes avoided Cole\u2019s. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken him on purpose\u2014he\u2019s your dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t...coerce him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you took was a frying pan and an atlas!\u201d Robin cried, staring at the cast-iron skillet and the atlas with its dog-eared pages.</p><p>Cole and Jeff both ignored her outburst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t like living here?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Jeff stiffened, then shook his head vigorously. \u201cMom told me that when we moved I could have a dog and now I can\u2019t. And...and she dragged me into a neighborhood filled with girls. That might\u2019ve been okay if I had a dog, but then she broke her promise. A promise is a promise and it\u2019s sacred. A guy would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t have a dog until later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll because of a stupid fence.\u201d</p> <p>Cole nodded. \u201cFences are important, you know. And you know what else? Your mom was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Jeff looked at Robin, who was blinking furiously to keep the tears from dripping down her face. The upheaval and stress of the move had drained her emotionally and she was an unmitigated mess. Normally, she was a calm, controlled person, but this whole drama with Jeff was her undoing. That and the fact she\u2019d hardly slept the night before in his makeshift tent.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff said, studying her anxiously, \u201care you all right?\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with both hands. \u201cI slept with a dog and you ran away and all you took was a frying pan and an atlas.\u201d That made no sense whatsoever, but she couldn\u2019t help it, and once the tears started they wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d Jeff said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you cry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI want you to have a dog, I really do, but we can\u2019t keep one locked up in the house all day and we don\u2019t have a fence and...and the way you just looked at me, I swear it was Lenny all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lenny?\u201d Cole cocked his head toward Jeff, speaking in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cLenny was my dad. He died when I was real little. I don\u2019t even remember him.\u201d</p><p>Cole shared a knowing look with her son. \u201cIt might be a good idea if we got your mother back inside the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m getting hysterical, don\u2019t you?\u201d Robin burst out. \u201cI want you both to know I\u2019m in perfect control. A woman can cry every now and then if she wants. Venting your emotions is healthy\u2014all the books say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Mom.\u201d Jeff gently patted her shoulder, then crawled out of the fort. He waited for Robin, who emerged after him, and offered her a hand. Cole and Blackie followed.</p> <p>Jeff took Robin\u2019s arm, holding her elbow as he led her to the back door of their house, as if he suspected she couldn\u2019t find her way without his guidance.</p><p>Once inside, Robin grabbed a tissue and loudly blew her nose. Her composure was shaky, but when she turned to Cole, she intended to be as reasonable as a judge. As polite as a preacher.</p><p>\u201cHave you got any aspirin?\u201d Cole asked Jeff.</p><p>Jeff nodded, and dashed up the stairs to the bathroom, returning in thirty seconds flat with the bottle. Cole filled a glass with water and delivered both to Robin. How he knew she had a fierce headache she could only guess.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you lie down for a few minutes? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel just fine, thank you,\u201d she snapped, more angry with herself for overreacting than with him for taking charge.</p><p>\u201cDo you have family close by?\u201d Again Cole directed the question to Jeff, which served to further infuriate Robin. Jeff was ten years old! She, on the other hand, was an adult. If this man had questions they should be directed to her, not her son.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Jeff answered in an anxious whisper. \u201cGrandma and Grandpa moved to Arizona last year, and my uncle lives in LA.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to lie down,\u201d Robin said forcefully. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff countered, his voice troubled, \u201cyou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were talking about frying pans and sleeping with dogs in the same breath,\u201d Cole elaborated, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI think Mr. Camden\u2019s right,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cYou need rest\u2014lots of rest.\u201d</p><p>Her own son had turned traitor on her. Robin was shocked. Jeff took her hand and led her into the family room, which was off the kitchen. He patted the quilted pillow on the sofa, wordlessly suggesting she place her head there. When she resisted, he pulled the afghan from the chair and draped it around her, tucking the ends behind her shoulders.</p><p>Robin couldn\u2019t believe she was allowing herself to be led around like a...like a puppy. As if reading her thoughts, Blackie wandered over to her side and lowered his bulk onto the carpet beside the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a neat fort you\u2019ve got there,\u201d Jeff told Cole once he\u2019d finished tucking in the blanket. Robin watched him hurry back to the kitchen, grab a plate, then load it with macaroni and cheese and hand it to Cole, apparently wanting to share his favorite meal with their neighbor.</p><p>Cole set the plate on the counter. \u201cThanks anyway, Jeff, but I\u2019ve got to get back to the house. In the future, if you\u2019re thinking about running away\u2014don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Jeff said with a mildly guilty look. \u201cMy mom turned into a basket case.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiled\u2014at least, it was as close to a smile as Robin had seen. \u201cYou\u2019re both going to be fine. She intends to get you that dog, you know. Just hang on. It\u2019ll be sooner than you think.\u201d</p><p>Jeff walked to the sliding glass door with Cole. \u201cMr. Camden, can I ask you something important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone using the fort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s expression was hopeful. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like anyone had been inside for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix years,\u201d Cole murmured absently.</p><p>\u201cThat long? How come?\u201d Jeff asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a great fort. If it\u2019s all right with you I\u2019d like to go over there sometimes. I promise not to walk in any flowerbeds or anything, and I won\u2019t leave a mess. I\u2019ll take real good care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Cole hesitated for a moment. He looked at Jeff, and Robin held her breath. Then he shook his head. \u201cMaybe sometime in the future, but not now.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s deep blue eyes brightened; apparently the refusal didn\u2019t trouble him. \u201cOkay. When I can use the fort, would it be all right if I took Blackie with me? He followed me today, you know. I didn\u2019t have to do anything to get him to tag along.\u201d Jeff paused and lowered his eyes. \u201cWell, hardly anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. As your mom said, you have a way with animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad did, too. If he hadn\u2019t died he would\u2019ve gotten me a pony and everything.\u201d</p><p>There was such pride in Jeff\u2019s voice that Robin bit her bottom lip to keep from crying all over again. Jeff and Lenny were so much alike. What she\u2019d told her son earlier was true. More and more, Jeff was starting to take on his father\u2019s looks and personality.</p><p>Cole gazed down at Jeff, and an emotion flashed in his eyes, so transient Robin couldn\u2019t recognize it. He laid his hand on Jeff\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSince your mother explained there\u2019s going to be a delay in getting you a dog, it\u2019d be okay with me if you borrowed Blackie every now and then. You have to stay in your own yard, though. I don\u2019t want him running in the neighborhood unless he\u2019s on a leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it? Thanks, Mr. Camden! I\u2019ll do everything you ask.\u201d</p><p>Robin had the feeling Jeff would\u2019ve agreed to just about any terms as long as he could see Blackie. It wasn\u2019t a dog of his own, but it was as close as he was going to get for the next few months.</p><p>Once Cole had left, Jeff joined her on the sofa, his hands folded on his lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d he muttered, his chin buried in his chest. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll never run away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not,\u201d she said. Wrapping her arms around him, she hugged him close, kissing his cheek.</p><p>\u201cGee whiz,\u201d Jeff grumbled, rubbing his face. \u201cI\u2019d never have apologized if I\u2019d known you were going to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>A week passed. Jeff liked his new school and, as Robin had predicted, found his class contained an equal number of boys and girls. With his outgoing personality, he quickly collected new friends.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, Robin was in the family room reading the paper when Jeff ambled in and sat down across from her. He took the baseball cap from his head and studied it for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSomething bothering you?\u201d she asked, lowering the paper to get a better view of her son.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDid you know Mr. Camden used to be married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard,\u201d Robin said absently. But other than Heather\u2019s remarks the previous week, she hadn\u2019t heard anything else. In fact, she\u2019d spoken to her neighbor only when she\u2019d gone to pick up Jeff every afternoon. The child-care arrangement with Heather was working beautifully, but there\u2019d been little opportunity to chat.</p><p>As for Cole, Robin hadn\u2019t seen him at all. Since he\u2019d been so kind and helpful in the situation with Jeff, Robin had revised her opinion of him. He liked his privacy and that was fine by her; she had no intention of interrupting his serene existence. The memory of their first meeting still rankled, but she was willing to overlook that shaky beginning.</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden had a son who died.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s heart constricted. It made sense: the pain she\u2019d seen when Jeff had asked him about children, the word on the street that Cole didn\u2019t like kids, the abandoned fort. \u201cI...How did you find that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJimmy Wallach. He lives two streets over and has an older brother who used to play with Bobby Camden. Jimmy told me about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Robin murmured, saddened by the information. She couldn\u2019t imagine her life without Jeff\u2014the mere thought of losing him was enough to tear her apart.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wallach heard Jimmy talking about Bobby Camden, and she said Mr. Camden got divorced and it was real bad, and then a year later Bobby died. She said Mr. Camden\u2019s never been the same since.\u201d</p><p>Robin ached for Cole, and she regretted all the uncharitable thoughts she\u2019d had that first morning.</p><p>\u201cI feel sad,\u201d Jeff whispered, frowning. His face was as intent as she\u2019d ever seen it.</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Robin returned softly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wallach seemed real surprised when I told her Mr. Camden said I could play in Bobby\u2019s fort someday. Ever since his son died, he hasn\u2019t let any kids in the yard or anything. She said he hardly talks to anyone in the neighborhood anymore.\u201d</p><p>Heather Lawrence had said basically the same thing, but hadn\u2019t explained the reason for it. Probably because she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAre you still going to barbecue hamburgers for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded, surprised by the abrupt way Jeff had changed the subject. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Next to macaroni and cheese, grilled burgers were Jeff\u2019s all-time favorite food.</p><p>\u201cCan I invite Mr. Camden over to eat with us?\u201d</p><p>Robin hated to refuse her son, but she wasn\u2019t sure a dinner invitation was a good idea. She didn\u2019t know Cole very well, but she\u2019d already learned he wasn\u2019t one to socialize with the neighbors. In addition, Jeff might blurt out questions about Cole\u2019s dead son that would be terribly painful for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff pleaded, \u201cI bet no one ever invites him to dinner and he\u2019s all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t know if that would be the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we owe him, Mom,\u201d Jeff implored. \u201cHe let me throw sticks for Blackie twice this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Camden\u2019s home,\u201d Robin said, picking up the newspaper while she weighed the pros and cons of Jeff\u2019s suggestion. Since last Sunday, Robin hadn\u2019t spoken to Cole once, and she wasn\u2019t eager to initiate a conversation. He might read something into it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and see if he\u2019s home.\u201d Before she could react, Jeff was out the front door, letting the screen door slam in his wake.</p><p>He returned a couple of minutes later breathless and excited. \u201cMr. Camden\u2019s home and he said he appreciates the invitation, but he has other plans for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Robin said, hoping she sounded sincere.</p><p>\u201cI told him we were having strawberry shortcake for dessert and he said that\u2019s his favorite.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she was relieved Cole wouldn\u2019t be showing up for dinner. The man made her feel nervous and uncertain. She didn\u2019t know why that should be, only that it was a new and unfamiliar sensation.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Robin jerked her head up from the paper. \u201cThanks for what?\u201d She hadn\u2019t read a word in five minutes. Her thoughts had been on her neighbor.</p><p>Jeff rolled his eyes. \u201cFor letting me take a piece of strawberry shortcake over to Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you could do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d He walked over to her and playfully tested her forehead with the back of his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel hot, but then, with brain fever you never know.\u201d</p><p>Robin swatted playfully at her son\u2019s backside.</p> <p>Laughing, Jeff raced outdoors, where his bicycle was waiting. A half hour later, he was back in the house. \u201cMom! Mom!\u201d he cried, racing into the kitchen. \u201cDid you know Mr. Camden owns a black Porsche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I did.\u201d She was more interested in peeling potatoes for the salad than discussing fancy cars. She didn\u2019t know enough about sports cars to get excited about them.</p><p>Jeff jerked open the bottom drawer and rooted through the rag bag until he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a large square that had once been part of his flannel pyjamas, then started back outside. \u201cHe has another car, too, an SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust where are you going, young man?\u201d Robin demanded.</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden\u2019s waxing his car and I\u2019m gonna help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ask for your help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeff said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cHe may not want you to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jeff rolled his eyes as if to suggest she was overdoing this mothering thing. \u201cCan I go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I suppose,\u201d she agreed, but her heart was in her throat. She moved into the living room and watched as Jeff strolled across the lawn to the driveway next door, where Cole was busy rubbing liquid wax on the gleaming surface of his Porsche. Without a word, Jeff started polishing the dried wax with his rag. Cole straightened and stopped smearing on the wax, obviously surprised to see Jeff. Robin bit her lip, not knowing how her neighbor would react to Jeff\u2019s willingness to help. Apparently he said something, because Jeff nodded, then walked over and sat cross-legged on the lawn. They didn\u2019t seem to be carrying on a conversation and Robin wondered what Cole had said to her son.</p><p>Robin returned to the kitchen, grateful that Cole\u2019s rejection had been gentle. At least he hadn\u2019t sent Jeff away. She peeled another potato, then walked back to the living room and glanced out the window again. This time she saw Jeff standing beside Cole, who was, it seemed, demonstrating the correct way to polish a car. He made wide circular motions with his arms, after which he stepped aside to let Jeff tackle the Porsche again. Cole smiled, then patted him on the head before walking around to the other side of the car.</p><p>Once the salad was ready, Robin ventured outside.</p><p>Jeff waved enthusiastically when he caught sight of her on the porch. \u201cIsn\u2019t she a beaut?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>It looked like an ordinary car to Robin, but she nodded enthusiastically. \u201cWonderful,\u201d she answered. \u201cAfternoon, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d He returned her greeting absently.</p><p>He wore a sleeveless gray sweatshirt and she was surprised by how muscular and tanned his arms were. From a recent conversation with Heather Lawrence, Robin had learned Cole was a prominent attorney. And he seemed to fit the lawyer image to a T. Not anymore. The lawyer was gone and the man was there, bold as could be. Her awareness of him as an attractive virile male was shockingly intense.</p><p>The problem, she decided, lay in the fact that she hadn\u2019t expected Cole to look so...fit. The sight of all that lean muscle came as a pleasant surprise. Cole\u2019s aggressive, unfriendly expression had been softened as he bantered with Jeff.</p><p>Blackie ambled to her side and Robin leaned over to scratch the dog\u2019s ears while she continued to study his master. Cole\u2019s hair was dark and grew away from his brow, but a single lock flopped stubbornly over his forehead and he had to toss it back from his face every once in a while. It was funny how she\u2019d never noticed that about him until now.</p><p>Jeff must\u2019ve made some humorous remark because Cole threw back his head and chuckled loudly. It was the first time she\u2019d ever heard him laugh. She suspected he didn\u2019t often give in to the impulse. A smile crowded Robin\u2019s face as Jeff started laughing, too.</p><p>In that moment the oddest thing happened. Robin felt something catch in her heart. The tug was almost physical, and she experienced a completely unfamiliar feeling of vulnerability....</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to roll out the barbecue for you?\u201d Jeff shouted when he saw that she was still on the porch. He\u2019d turned his baseball cap around so the bill faced backward. While he spoke, his arm continued to work feverishly as he buffed the passenger door with his rag.</p><p>\u201cNot...yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause Mr. Camden needs me to finish up this side for him. We\u2019re on a tight schedule here, and I don\u2019t have time. Cole\u2019s got a dinner date at five-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Standing on the porch, dressed in her old faded jeans, with a mustard-spotted terrycloth hand towel tucked in the waistband, Robin felt as appealing as Ma Kettle. \u201cAny time you\u2019re finished is fine.\u201d</p><p>So Cole Camden\u2019s got a date, Robin mused. Of course he\u2019s got a date, she told herself. Why should she care? And if watching Jeff and Cole together was going to affect her like this, it would be best to go back inside the house now.</p><p>Over dinner, all Jeff could talk about was Cole Camden. Every other sentence was Cole this and Cole that, until Robin was ready to slam her fist on the table and demand Jeff never mention their neighbor\u2019s name again.</p><p>\u201cAnd the best part is, he paid me for helping him wax his car,\u201d Jeff continued, then stuffed the hamburger into his mouth, chewing rapidly in his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cThat was generous of him.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded happily. \u201cBe sure and save some shortcake for him. He said not to bring it over \u2019cause he didn\u2019t know exactly when he\u2019d get home. He\u2019ll stop by, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d But Robin doubted her neighbor would. Jeff seemed to be under the impression that Cole would show up at any time; Robin knew better. If Cole had a dinner date, he wasn\u2019t going to rush back just to taste her dessert, although she did make an excellent shortcake.</p><p>As she suspected, Cole didn\u2019t come over. Jeff grumbled about it the next morning. He was convinced Cole would\u2019ve dropped by if Robin hadn\u2019t insisted Jeff go to bed at his regular time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make shortcake again soon,\u201d Robin promised, hurrying to pack their lunches. \u201cAnd when I do, you can take a piece over to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jeff muttered.</p><p>That evening, when Robin returned home from work, she found Jeff playing with Blackie in Cole\u2019s backyard.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she cried, alarmed that Cole might discover her son on his property. He\u2019d made it clear Jeff wasn\u2019t to go into his yard. \u201cWhat are you doing at Mr. Camden\u2019s? And why aren\u2019t you at Heather\u2019s?\u201d She walked over to the hedge and placed her hands on her hips in frustration.</p><p>\u201cBlackie\u2019s chain got all tangled up,\u201d Jeff said, looking sheepish. \u201cHe needed my help. I told Heather it would be okay with you and...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s untangled now,\u201d Robin pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know, but since I was here it seemed like a good time for the two of us to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay,\u201d Robin completed for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d her son said, nodding eagerly. Jeff was well aware he\u2019d done something wrong, but had difficulty admitting it.</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden doesn\u2019t want you in his yard, and we both know it.\u201d Standing next to the laurel hedge, Robin watched with dismay as Cole opened his back door and stepped outside. Blackie barked in greeting, and his tail swung with enough force to knock Jeff off balance.</p><p>When Cole saw Jeff in his yard, he frowned and cast an accusing glare in Robin\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cJeff said Blackie\u2019s chain was tangled,\u201d she rushed to explain.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get over here?\u201d Cole asked her son, and although he didn\u2019t raise his voice it was clear he was displeased. \u201cThe gate\u2019s locked and the hedge is too high for him to jump over.\u201d</p><p>Jeff stared down at the lawn. \u201cI came through the gap in the hedge\u2014the same one Blackie uses. I crawled through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas his chain really tangled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Jeff said in a voice so low Robin had to strain to hear him. \u201cAt least not much...I just thought, you know, that maybe he\u2019d like company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was all alone and so was I.\u201d Jeff lifted his eyes defiantly to his mother\u2019s, as if to suggest the fault was entirely hers. \u201cI go to Mrs. Lawrence\u2019s after school, but it\u2019s all girls there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what I said about coming into my yard?\u201d Cole asked him.</p><p>Jeff\u2019s nod was sluggish. \u201cYeah. You said maybe I could sometime, but not now. I thought...I hoped that since you let me help you wax your car, you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind,\u201d Cole said flatly.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t do it again,\u201d Robin promised. \u201cWill you, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>For a whole week Jeff kept his word. The following Monday, however, when Robin came home from the BART station, Heather told her Jeff had mysteriously disappeared about a half hour earlier. She assumed he\u2019d gone home; he\u2019d said something about expecting a call.</p><p>Unfortunately, Robin knew exactly where to look for him, and it wasn\u2019t at home. Even more unfortunate was the fact that Cole\u2019s car pulled into the driveway just as she was opening her door. Throwing aside her briefcase and purse, she rushed through the house, jerked open the sliding glass door at the back and raced across her yard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her son was nowhere to be seen, but she immediately realized he\u2019d been with Blackie. The dog wasn\u2019t in evidence, either, and she could see Jeff\u2019s favorite baseball cap on the lawn.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she called, afraid to raise her voice. She sounded as though she was suffering from a bad case of laryngitis.</p><p>Neither boy nor dog appeared.</p><p>She tried again, taking the risk of shouting for Jeff in a normal tone, praying it wouldn\u2019t attract Cole\u2019s attention. No response. Since Jeff and Blackie didn\u2019t seem to be within earshot, she guessed they were in the fort. There was no help for it; she\u2019d have to go after him herself. Her only hope was that she could hurry over to the fort, get Jeff and return to her own yard, all without being detected by Cole.</p> <p>Finding the hole in the laurel proved difficult enough. The space was little more than a narrow gap between two thick plants, and for a distressing moment, Robin doubted she was slim enough to squeeze through. Finally, she lowered herself to the ground, hunched her shoulders and managed to push her way between the shrubs. Her head had just emerged when she noticed a pair of polished men\u2019s shoes on the other side. Slowly, reluctantly, she glanced up to find Cole towering above her, eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d she said, striving to sound as though it was perfectly normal for her to be crawling into his yard on her hands and knees. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019m doing here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question did cross my mind.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cIt was the most embarrassing moment of my entire life,\u201d Robin repeated for the third time. She was sitting at the kitchen table, resisting the urge to hide her face in her hands and weep.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already said that,\u201d Jeff grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed you to even think about going into Mr. Camden\u2019s yard again? Honestly, Jeff, you\u2019ve been warned at least half a dozen times. What do I have to do? String barbed wire between our yards?\u201d</p><p>Although he\u2019d thoroughly disgraced himself, Jeff casually rotated the rim of his baseball cap between his fingers. \u201cI said I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>A mere apology didn\u2019t begin to compensate for the humiliation Robin had suffered when Cole found her on all fours, crawling through his laurel hedge. If she lived to be an old woman, she\u2019d never forget the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou put me on TV, computer and phone restriction already,\u201d her son reminded her.</p><p>That punishment could be another mistake to add to her growing list. At times like this, she wished Lenny were there to advise her. She needed him, and even after all these years, still missed him. Often, when there was no one else around, Robin found herself talking to Lenny. She wondered if she\u2019d made the right decision, wondered what her husband would have done. Without television, computer or phone, the most attractive form of entertainment left open to her son was playing with Blackie, which was exactly what had gotten him into trouble in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cBlackie belongs to Mr. Camden,\u201d Robin felt obliged to tell him. Again.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cbut he likes me. When I come home from school, he goes crazy. He\u2019s real glad to see me, Mom, and since there aren\u2019t very many boys in this neighborhood\u2014\u201d he paused as if she was to blame for that \u201c\u2014Blackie and I have an understanding. We\u2019re buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all fine and dandy, but you seem to be forgetting that Blackie doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d Robin stood and opened the refrigerator, taking out a package of chicken breasts.</p><p>\u201cI wish he was my dog,\u201d Jeff grumbled. In an apparent effort to make peace, he walked over to the cupboard, removed two plates and proceeded to set the table.</p><p>After dinner, while Robin was dealing with the dishes, the doorbell chimed. Jeff raced down the hallway to answer it, returning a moment later with Cole Camden at his side.</p><p>Her neighbor was the last person Robin had expected to see\u2014and the last person she wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff said, nodding toward Cole, \u201cit\u2019s Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, again,\u201d she managed, striving for a light tone, and realizing even as she spoke that she\u2019d failed. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019d like to talk to both of you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not giving him the opportunity to continue, Robin nodded so hard she nearly dislocated her neck. \u201cI really am sorry about what happened. I\u2019ve had a good long talk with Jeff and, frankly, I understand why you\u2019re upset and I don\u2019t blame you. You\u2019ve been very kind about this whole episode and I want you to know there won\u2019t be a repeat performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom either of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, knowing her cheeks were as red as her nail polish. Did he have to remind her of the humiliating position he\u2019d found her in earlier?</p><p>\u201cMom put me on TV, computer and phone restriction for an entire week,\u201d Jeff explained earnestly. \u201cI promise not to go into your fort again, Mr. Camden. And I promise not to go in my backyard after school, either, because Blackie sees me and gets all happy and excited\u2014and I guess I get all happy and excited, too\u2014and that\u2019s when I do stuff I\u2019m not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Cole smiled down at Jeff. Robin thought it was a rather unusual smile. It didn\u2019t come from his lips as much as his eyes. Once more she witnessed a flash of pain, and another emotion she could only describe as longing. Slowly his gaze drifted to Robin. When his dark eyes met hers, she suddenly found herself short of breath.</p><p>\u201cActually I didn\u2019t come here to talk to you about what happened this afternoon,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out of town for the next couple of days, and since Jeff and Blackie seem to get along so well I thought Jeff might be willing to look after him. That way I won\u2019t have to put him in the kennel. Naturally I\u2019m prepared to pay your son for his time. If he agrees, I\u2019ll let him play in the fort while I\u2019m away, as well.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s eyes grew rounder than Robin had ever seen them. \u201cYou want me to watch Blackie?\u201d he asked, his voice incredulous. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to pay me? Can Blackie spend the night here? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that answers your question,\u201d Robin said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cBlackie can stay here if it\u2019s okay with your mom,\u201d Cole told Jeff. Then he turned to her. \u201cWould that create a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>Once more his eyes held hers, and once more she experienced that odd breathless sensation.</p><p>\u201cI...No problem whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiled then, and this time it was a smile so potent, so compelling, that it sailed straight through Robin\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff hollered as he burst through the front door late Thursday afternoon. \u201cKelly and Blackie and I are going to the fort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly? Surely this isn\u2019t the girl named Kelly, is it? Not the one who lives next door?\u201d Robin couldn\u2019t resist teasing her son. Apparently Jeff was willing to have a \u201cpesky\u201d girl for a friend, after all.</p><p>Jeff shrugged as he opened the cookie jar and groped inside. He frowned, not finding any cookies and removed his hand, his fingertips covered with crumbs that he promptly licked off. \u201cI decided Kelly isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got Blackie\u2019s leash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to need it. We\u2019re playing Sam Houston and Daniel Boone, and the Mexican army is attacking. I\u2019m going to smuggle Blackie out and go for help. I can\u2019t use a leash for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Just don\u2019t go any farther than the Alamo and be back by dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s less than an hour!\u201d Jeff protested.</p><p>Robin gave him one of her don\u2019t-argue-with-me looks.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not hungry and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin said softly, widening her eyes just a bit, increasing the intensity of her look.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mom,\u201d Jeff said with a cry of undisguised disgust, \u201cyou don\u2019t fight fair.\u201d He hurried out the front door with Blackie trotting faithfully behind.</p><p>Smiling to herself, Robin placed the meat loaf in the oven and carried her coffee into the backyard. The early evening air was filled with the scent of spring flowers. A gentle breeze wafted over the budding trees. How peaceful it seemed. How serene. All the years of pinching pennies to save for a house of their own seemed worth it now.</p><p>Her gaze wandered toward Cole Camden\u2019s yard. Jeff, Kelly and Blackie were inside the fort, and she could hear their raised voices every once in a while.</p><p>Cole had been on her mind a great deal during the past couple of days; she\u2019d spent far too much time dwelling on her neighbor, thinking about his reputation in the neighborhood and the son he\u2019d lost.</p><p>The tranquillity of the moment was shattered by the insistent ringing of the phone. Robin walked briskly to the kitchen, set her coffee on the counter and picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin, it\u2019s Angela. I\u2019m not catching you at a bad time, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Robin assured her. Angela worked in the same department as Robin, and over the years they\u2019d become good friends. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, as if she didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to invite you to dinner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Saturday so I can meet your cousin Frank,\u201d Robin finished, rolling her eyes. Years before, Angela had taken on the task of finding Robin a husband. Never mind that Robin wasn\u2019t interested in meeting strangers! Angela couldn\u2019t seem to bear the thought of anyone spending her life alone and had appointed herself Robin\u2019s personal matchmaker.</p><p>\u201cFrank\u2019s a really nice guy,\u201d Angela insisted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t steer you wrong, you know I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Robin restrained herself from reminding her friend of the disastrous date she\u2019d arranged several weeks earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Frank all my life,\u201d Angela said. \u201cHe\u2019s decent and nice.\u201d</p><p>Decent and nice were two words Robin had come to hate. Every man she\u2019d ever met in this kind of arrangement was either decent or nice. Or both. Robin had come to think the two words were synonymous with dull, unattractive and emotionally manipulative. Generally these were recently divorced men who\u2019d willingly placed themselves in the hands of family and friends to get them back into circulation.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that Frank just got divorced?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, about six months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not interested?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to meet him. Angela, I know you mean well, and I apologize if I sound like a spoilsport, but I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve had to nurse the fragile egos of recently divorced men. Most of the time they\u2019re emotional wrecks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Frank\u2019s divorce was final months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you still want me to meet him in a year, I\u2019ll be more than happy to have you arrange a dinner date.\u201d</p><p>Angela released a ragged sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>There was a short disappointed silence. \u201cFine,\u201d Angela said in obvious frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Because she felt guilty, Robin added, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>Robin lingered in the kitchen, frowning. She hated it when her friends put her on the spot like this. It was difficult enough to say no, but knowing that Angela\u2019s intentions were genuine made it even worse. Just as she was struggling with another attack of guilt, the phone rang again. Angela! Her friend must have suspected that Robin\u2019s offer to buy the coffee was a sign that she was weakening.</p><p>Gathering her fortitude, Robin seized the receiver and said firmly, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in dating Frank. I don\u2019t want to be rude, but that\u2019s final!\u201d</p><p>Her abrupt words were followed by a brief shocked silence, and then, \u201cRobin, hello, this is Cole Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d she gasped, closing her eyes. \u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were someone else. A friend.\u201d She slumped against the wall and covered her face with one hand. \u201cI have this friend who\u2019s always trying to arrange dates for me, and she doesn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d Robin quickly explained. \u201cI suppose you have friends wanting to arrange dates for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Of course he didn\u2019t. No doubt there were women all over San Francisco who longed to go out with Cole. He didn\u2019t require a personal matchmaker. All someone like him had to do was look interested and women would flock to his side.</p><p>Her hand tightened around the receiver and a sick weightless feeling attacked the pit of her stomach. \u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to shout in your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you called to talk to Jeff,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s with Blackie and Kelly\u2014Kelly Lawrence, the little girl who lives on the other side of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a few minutes, if you\u2019d like to call then. Or if you prefer, I could run and get him, but he said something about sneaking out and going for help and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon? What\u2019s Jeff doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re playing in the fort, pretending they\u2019re Houston and Daniel Boone. The fort is now the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI see. No, don\u2019t worry about chasing after him. I\u2019d hate to see you waylaid by the Mexican army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d care for that myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>She must have sounded rushed because he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure this isn\u2019t a bad time? If you have company...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here alone.\u201d</p> <p>Another short silence, which was broken by Cole. \u201cSo everything\u2019s okay with Blackie? He isn\u2019t causing you any problems, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, everything\u2019s great. Jeff lavishes him with attention. The two of them are together practically every minute. Blackie even sleeps beside his bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you said, Jeff has a way with animals,\u201d Cole murmured.</p><p>His laugh, so tender and warm, was enough to jolt her. She had to pinch herself to remember that Cole was a prominent attorney, wealthy and respected. She was an accountant. A junior accountant at that.</p><p>The only thing they had in common was the fact that they lived next door to each other and her son was crazy about his dog.</p><p>The silence returned, only this time it had a relaxed, almost comfortable quality, as though neither wanted the conversation to end.</p><p>\u201cSince Jeff isn\u2019t around,\u201d Cole said reluctantly, \u201cI\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything important,\u201d Cole said. \u201cJust wanted to let you know when I\u2019ll be back\u2014late Friday afternoon. Will you be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know, your friend might talk you into going out with Fred after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Frank, and there isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamous last words!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you Friday,\u201d she said with a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cRight. Goodbye, Robin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Cole.\u201d</p><p>Long after the call had ended, Robin stood with her hand on the receiver, a smile touching her eyes and her heart.</p><p>\u201cMom, I need my lunch money,\u201d Jeff yelled from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute,\u201d she said. Mornings were hectic. In order to get to the Glen Park BART station on time, Robin had to leave the house half an hour before Jeff left for school.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have for breakfast?\u201d she hollered as she put the finishing touches on her makeup.</p><p>\u201cFrozen waffles,\u201d Jeff shouted back. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t drown them in syrup and I rinsed off the plate before I put it in the dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRinsed it off or let Blackie lick it for you?\u201d she asked, as she hurried down the stairs. Her son was busy at the sink and didn\u2019t turn around to look at her.</p><p>\u201cBlackie, honestly, is that maple syrup on your nose?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his name, the Labrador trotted over to her. Robin took a moment to stroke his thick fur before fumbling for her wallet to give Jeff his lunch money.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, you look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeff said without the slightest bit of concern. \u201cYou won\u2019t be late tonight, will you? Remember Mr. Camden\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, and no, I won\u2019t be late.\u201d She grabbed her purse and her packed lunch, putting it in her briefcase, and headed for the front door.</p><p>Even before Robin arrived at the subway station, she knew the day would drag. Fridays always did.</p><p>She was right. At six, when the subway pulled into the station, Robin felt as though she\u2019d been away forty hours instead of the usual nine. She found herself hurrying and didn\u2019t fully understand why. Cole was scheduled to return, but that didn\u2019t have anything to do with her, did it? His homecoming wasn\u2019t anything to feel nervous about, nor any reason to be pleased. He was her neighbor, and more Jeff\u2019s friend than hers.</p><p>The first thing Robin noticed when she arrived on Orchard Street was Cole\u2019s Porsche parked in the driveway of his house.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Jeff called as he raced across the lawn between the two houses. \u201cMr. Camden\u2019s back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d She removed her keys from her purse and opened the front door.</p><p>Jeff followed her inside. \u201cHe said he\u2019d square up with me later. I wanted to invite him to dinner, but I didn\u2019t think I should without asking you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was smart,\u201d she said, depositing her jacket in the closet on her way to the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator and took out the thawed hamburger and salad makings.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jeff sat down at the table and propped his elbows on it. \u201cAll right, I guess. What are you making for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaco salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about just tacos? I don\u2019t get why you want to ruin a perfectly good dinner by putting green stuff in it.\u201d</p><p>Robin paused. \u201cI thought you liked my taco salad.\u201d</p><p>Jeff shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, but I\u2019d rather have just tacos.\u201d Once that was made clear, he cupped his chin in his hands. \u201cCan we rent a movie tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Robin returned absently as she added the meat to the onions browning in the skillet.</p><p>\u201cBut I get to choose this time,\u201d Jeff insisted. \u201cLast week you picked a musical.\u201d He wrinkled his nose as if to suggest that being forced to watch men and women sing and dance was the most disgusting thing he\u2019d ever had to endure.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can find a compromise,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t have a silly love story in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said, doing her best not to betray her amusement. Their difference in taste when it came to movies was legendary. Jeff\u2019s favorite was an older kids\u2019 film, Scooby Doo, that he watched over and over, which Robin found boring, to say the least. Unfortunately, her son was equally put off by the sight of men and women staring longingly into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>The meat was simmering in the skillet when Robin glanced up and noted that her son was looking surprisingly thoughtful. \u201cIs something troubling you?\u201d she asked, and popped a thin tomato slice into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever noticed that Mr. Camden never mentions he had a son?\u201d</p><p>Robin set the paring knife on the cutting board. \u201cIt\u2019s probably painful for him to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded, and, with the innocent wisdom of youth, he whispered, \u201cThat man needs someone.\u201d</p><p>The meal was finished, and Robin was standing in front of the sink rinsing off the dinner plates when the doorbell rang. Robin knew it had to be Cole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Jeff cried as he raced past her at breakneck speed. He threw open the door. \u201cHi, Mr. Camden!\u201d he said eagerly.</p><p>By this time Robin had smoothed her peach-colored sweater over her hips and placed a friendly\u2014but not too friendly\u2014smile on her face. At the last second, she ran her fingers through her hair, striving for the casual I-didn\u2019t-go-to-any-trouble look, then wondered at her irrational behavior. Cole wasn\u2019t coming over to see her.</p><p>Robin could hear Jeff chatting away at ninety miles an hour, telling Cole they were renting a movie and how Robin insisted that every show he saw had to have the proper rating, which he claimed was totally ridiculous. He went on to explain that she considered choosing the film a mother\u2019s job and apparently a mere kid didn\u2019t have rights. When there was a pause in the conversation, she could envision Jeff rolling his eyes dramatically.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she stepped into the entryway and smiled. \u201cHello, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met instantly. Robin\u2019s first coherent thought was that a woman could get lost in eyes that dark and not even care. She swallowed and lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d she asked, having difficulty dragging the words out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Or it wouldn\u2019t be if she could stop her heart from pounding so furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Blackie?\u201d Jeff asked, opening the screen door and glancing outside.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring him over. I thought you\u2019d be tired of him by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired of Blackie?\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should\u2019ve known better,\u201d Cole teased.</p><p>Robin returned to the kitchen and took mugs from the cupboard, using these few minutes to compose herself.</p><p>The screen door slammed, and a moment later Cole appeared in her kitchen. \u201cJeff went to my house to get Blackie.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cDo you take cream or sugar?\u201d she asked over her shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust black, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Robin normally drank hers the same way. But for some reason she couldn\u2019t begin to fathom, she added a generous teaspoonful of sugar to her own, stirring briskly as though she feared it wouldn\u2019t dissolve.</p><p>\u201cI hope your trip went well,\u201d she said, carrying both mugs into the family room, where Cole had chosen to sit.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She sat a safe distance from him, across the room in a wooden rocker, and balanced her mug on her knee. \u201cEverything around here went without a hitch, but I\u2019m afraid Jeff may have spoiled Blackie a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what he said, they did everything but attend school together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving the dog has been wonderful for him. I appreciate your giving Jeff this opportunity. Not only does it satisfy his need for a dog, but it\u2019s taught him about responsibility.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and the canine subject of their conversation shot into the room, followed by Jeff, who was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cMom, could Mr. Camden stay and watch the movie with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Caught off guard, Robin didn\u2019t know what to say. After being away from home for several days, watching a movie with his neighbors probably held a low position on Cole\u2019s list of priorities.</p> <p>To Robin\u2019s astonishment, Cole\u2019s eyes searched hers as though seeking her approval.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be welcome...I mean, you can stay if you\u2019d like, unless...unless there\u2019s something else you\u2019d rather do,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d...we\u2019d like it if you did, but...\u201d She let whatever else she might have said fade away. She was making a mess of this, and every time she tried to smooth it over, she only stuck her foot further down her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat movie did you rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t yet,\u201d Jeff explained. \u201cMom and me had to come to an understanding first. She likes mushy stuff and gets all bent out of shape if there\u2019s an explosion or anything. You wouldn\u2019t believe the love story she made me watch last Friday night.\u201d His voice dripped with renewed disgust.</p><p>\u201cHow about if you and I go rent the movie while your mother and Blackie make the popcorn?\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s blue eyes brightened immediately. \u201cThat\u2019d be great, wouldn\u2019t it, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she agreed, and was rewarded by Jeff\u2019s smile.</p><p>Jeff and Cole left a few minutes later. It was on the tip of her tongue to give Cole instructions on the type of movie appropriate for a ten-year-old boy, but she swallowed her concerns, willing to trust his judgment. Standing on the porch, she watched as they climbed inside Cole\u2019s expensive sports car. She pressed her hand to her throat, grateful when Cole leaned over the front seat and snapped Jeff\u2019s seat belt snugly in place. Suddenly Cole looked at her; she raised her hand in farewell, and he did the same. It was a simple gesture, yet Robin felt as if they\u2019d communicated so much more.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Blackie,\u201d Robin said, \u201clet\u2019s go start the popcorn.\u201d The Lab trailed behind her as she returned to the kitchen. She placed a packet of popcorn in the microwave. It was while she was waiting for the kernels to start popping that the words slipped from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, Lenny, what do you think?\u201d Talking to her dead husband came without conscious thought. It certainly wasn\u2019t that she expected him to answer. Whenever she spoke to him, the words came spontaneously from the deep well of love they\u2019d once shared. She supposed she should feel foolish doing it, but so many times over the long years since his death she\u2019d felt his presence. Robin assumed that the reason she talked to him came from her need to discuss things with the one other person who\u2019d loved her son as much as she did. In the beginning she was sure she needed to visit a psychiatrist or arrange for grief counseling, but later she convinced herself that every widow went through this in one form or another.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grown so much in the past year, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked, and smiled. \u201cMeeting Cole has been good for Jeff. He lost a child, you know, and I suppose having Jeff move in next door answers a need for him, too.\u201d</p><p>About ten minutes later, she\u2019d transferred the popcorn to a bowl and set out drinks. Jeff and Cole came back with a movie that turned out to be an excellent compromise\u2014a teen comedy that was surprisingly witty and entertaining.</p><p>Jeff sprawled on the carpet munching popcorn with Blackie by his side. Cole sat on the sofa and Robin chose the rocking chair. She removed her shoes and tucked her feet beneath her. She was enjoying the movie; in fact, several times she found herself laughing out loud.</p><p>Cole and Jeff laughed, too. The sounds were contrasting\u2014one deep and masculine, the other young and pleasantly boyish\u2014yet they harmonized, blending with perfect naturalness.</p> <p>Soon Robin found herself watching Jeff and Cole more than the movie. The two...no, the three of them had grown comfortable together. Robin didn\u2019t try to read any significance into that. Doing so could prove emotionally dangerous, but the thought flew into her mind and refused to leave.</p><p>The credits were rolling when Cole pointed to Jeff, whose head was resting on his arms, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Cole said softly.</p><p>Robin smiled and nodded. She got up to bring the empty popcorn bowl into the kitchen. Cole stood, too, taking their glasses to the sink, then returned to the family room to remove the DVD.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to carry him upstairs for you?\u201d he asked, glancing down at the slumbering Jeff.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen he wakes up in the morning, he\u2019ll think you treated him like a little kid. Egos are fragile at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>The silence seemed to resound. Without Jeff, awake and chattering, as a buffer between them, Robin felt clumsy and self-conscious around Cole.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice of you to stay,\u201d she said, more to fill the silence than because she had anything important to communicate. \u201cIt meant a lot to Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Jeff had told her Cole had an active social life. Heather Lawrence had confirmed it by casually letting it drop that Cole was often away on weekends. Robin wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to think about it all. But if there was a woman in his life, that was his business, not hers.</p><p>\u201cIt meant a lot to me, too,\u201d he said, returning the DVD to its case.</p><p>The kitchen and family room, actually quite spacious, felt close and intimate with Cole standing only a few feet away.</p><p>Robin\u2019s fingers were shaking as she placed the bowls and soda glasses in the dishwasher. She tried to come up with some bright and witty comment, but her mind was blank.</p><p>\u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>Was that reluctance she heard in his voice? Somehow Robin doubted it; probably wishful thinking on her part. Half of her wanted to push him out the door and the other half didn\u2019t want him to leave at all. But there really wasn\u2019t any reason for him to stay. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackie.\u201d Cole called for his dog. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>The Lab didn\u2019t look pleased. He took his own sweet time lumbering to his feet and stretching before trotting to Cole\u2019s side.</p><p>Robin was about to open the door when she realized she hadn\u2019t thanked Cole for getting the movie. She turned, and his dark eyes delved into hers. Whatever thoughts had been taking shape fled like leaves scattering in the wind. She tried to smile, however weakly, but it was difficult when he was looking at her so intently. His gaze slipped to her mouth, and in a nervous movement, she moistened her lips. Before she was fully aware of how it had happened, Cole\u2019s fingers were in her hair and he was urging her mouth to meet his.</p><p>His eyes held hers, as if he expected her to stop him, then they slowly closed and their lips touched. Robin\u2019s eyes drifted shut, but that was the only response she made.</p><p>He kissed her again, even more gently than the first time. Robin moaned softly, not in protest, but in wonder and surprise. It had been so long since a man had kissed her like this. So long that she\u2019d forgotten the wealth of sensations a mere kiss could evoke. Her hands crept to his chest, and her fingers curled into the soft wool of his sweater. Hesitantly, timidly, her lips trembled beneath his. Cole sighed and took full possession of her mouth.</p><p>Robin sighed, too. The tears that welled in her eyes were a shock. She was at a loss to explain them. They slipped down her face, and it wasn\u2019t until then that she realized she was crying.</p><p>Cole must have felt her tears at the same moment, because he abruptly broke off the kiss and raised his head. His eyes searched hers as his thumb brushed the moisture from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d The question was whispered.</p><p>She shook her head vehemently.</p><p>\u201cThen why...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She couldn\u2019t explain something she didn\u2019t understand herself. Rubbing her eyes, she attempted to wipe away the evidence. She forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m nothing if not novel,\u201d she said with brittle cheerfulness. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine many women break into tears when you kiss them.\u201d</p><p>Cole looked as confused as Robin felt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She wanted to reassure him, but was having too much trouble analyzing her own reactions.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. Adamantly. That was the last thing she wanted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cole. I really am. This has never happened before and I don\u2019t understand it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best thing we can do is chalk it up to a long workweek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I\u2019d prefer to just forget it. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotionally or physically?\u201d She tried to joke, but didn\u2019t succeed.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>He was so serious, so concerned, that it was all Robin could do not to dissolve into fresh tears. She\u2019d made a world-class fool of herself with this man, not once but twice.</p><p>This man, who had suffered such a tremendous loss himself, was so gentle with her, and instead of helping, that only made matters worse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, really I am,\u201d she said raggedly, \u201cbut perhaps you should go home now.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m in the mood for?\u201d Angela Lansky said as she sat on the edge of Robin\u2019s desk early Monday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope you\u2019re going to say food,\u201d Robin teased. They had shared the same lunch hour and were celebrating a cost-of-living raise by eating out.</p><p>\u201cA shrimp salad,\u201d Angela elaborated. \u201cHeaped six inches high with big fresh shrimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking Chinese food myself,\u201d Robin said, \u201cbut, now that you mention it, shrimp salad sounds good.\u201d She opened her bottom drawer and took out her purse.</p><p>Angela was short and enviably thin with thick brown hair that fell in natural waves over her shoulders. She used clips to hold the abundant curls away from her face and looked closer to twenty than the thirty-five Robin knew her to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know just the place,\u201d Angela was saying. \u201cThe Blue Crab. It\u2019s on the wharf and worth the trouble of getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>They stopped at the bank, then headed for the restaurant. They decided to catch the Market Street cable car to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and joined the quickly growing line.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the kid doing?\u201d Angela asked. She and her salesman husband didn\u2019t plan to have children themselves, but Angela enjoyed hearing about Jeff.</p> <p>\u201cHe signed up for baseball through the park program and starts practice this week. I think it\u2019ll be good for him. He was lonely this weekend now that Blackie\u2019s back with Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t Blackie over at your place as much as before?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Robin shook her head. \u201cCole left early Saturday morning and took the dog with him. Jeff moped around for most of the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d your handsome neighbor go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d Robin asked with a soft laugh, hiding her disappointment at his disappearance. \u201cCole doesn\u2019t clear his schedule with me.\u201d</p> <p>The way he\u2019d left\u2014without a word of farewell or explanation\u2014still hurt. It was the kind of hurt that came from realizing what a complete fool she\u2019d made of herself with this worldly, sophisticated man. He\u2019d kissed her and she\u2019d started crying. Good grief, he was probably doing backflips in order to avoid seeing her again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Cole was with a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of my business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought your neighbor said Cole spent his weekends with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t remember mentioning that to Angela, but she obviously had, along with practically everything else. Robin had tried to convince herself that confiding in Angela about Cole was a clever way of thwarting her friend\u2019s matchmaking efforts. Unfortunately, the whole thing had backfired in her face. In the end, the last person she wanted to talk about was Cole, but of course Angela persisted in questioning her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Angela demanded. \u201cDid he spend his weekend with a woman or not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat he does with his time is his business, not mine,\u201d Robin reiterated. She pretended not to care. But she did. Too much. She\u2019d promised herself she wasn\u2019t going to put any stock in the kiss or the powerful attraction she felt for Cole. Within the space of one evening, she\u2019d wiped out every pledge she\u2019d made to herself. She hadn\u2019t said anything to Jeff\u2014how could she?\u2014but she was just as disappointed as he was that Cole had left for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping something might develop between the two of you,\u201d Angela murmured. \u201cSince you\u2019re obviously not interested in meeting Frank, it would be great if you got something going with your neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Robin cast her a plaintive look that suggested otherwise. \u201cCole Camden lives in the fanciest house in the neighborhood. He\u2019s a partner in the law firm of Blackwell, Burns and Dailey, which we both know is one of the most prestigious in San Francisco. And he drives a car with a name I can barely pronounce. Now, what would someone like that see in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of things,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Robin snickered. \u201cI hate to disillusion you, my friend, but the only thing Cole Camden and I have in common is the fact that my small yard borders his massive one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Angela agreed, raising her eyebrows. \u201cBut I could tell you were intrigued by him the very first time you mentioned his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Angela insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you with other men over the past few years. A guy will show some interest, and at first everything looks peachy-keen. You\u2019ll go out with him a couple of times, maybe even more, but before anything serious can develop you\u2019ve broken off the relationship without really giving it a chance.\u201d</p> <p>Robin didn\u2019t have much of an argument, since that was true, but she made a token protest just the same. \u201cI can\u2019t help it if I have high standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh standards!\u201d Angela choked back a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be the understatement of the century. You\u2019d find fault with Prince Charming.\u201d</p><p>Robin rolled her eyes, but couldn\u2019t hold back a smile. Angela was right, although that certainly hadn\u2019t slowed her matchmaking efforts.</p><p>\u201cFrom the time you started talking about your neighbor,\u201d Angela went on, \u201cI noticed something different about you, and frankly I\u2019m thrilled. In all the years we\u2019ve known each other, this is the first time I can remember you giving a man this much attention. Until now, it\u2019s always been the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in Cole,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cOh, honestly, Angela, I can\u2019t imagine where you come up with these ideas. I think you\u2019ve been reading too many romance novels.\u201d</p><p>Angela waved her index finger under Robin\u2019s nose. \u201cListen, I\u2019m on to you. You\u2019re not going to divert me with humor, or weasel your way out of admitting it. You can\u2019t fool me\u2014you\u2019re attracted to this guy and it\u2019s scaring you to death. Right?\u201d</p><p>The two women gazed solemnly at each other, both too stubborn to admit defeat. Under the force of her friend\u2019s unyielding determination, Robin was the one who finally gave in.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d she cried, causing the other people waiting for the cable car to turn and stare. \u201cAll right,\u201d she repeated in a whisper. \u201cI like Cole, but I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s winged brows arched speculatively. \u201cHe\u2019s attractive and wealthy, crazy about your son, generous and kind, and you haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also way out of my league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d quit categorizing yourself. You make it sound as though you aren\u2019t good enough for him, and that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Robin just sighed.</p><p>The cable car appeared then, its bell clanging as it drew to a stop. Robin and Angela boarded and held on tight.</p><p>Jeff loved hearing about the history of the cable cars, and Robin loved telling him the story. Andrew Hallidie had designed them because of his deep love for horses. Day after day, Hallidie had watched them struggling up and down the treacherous hills of the city, dragging heavy burdens. Prompted by his concern for the animals, he\u2019d invented the cable cars that are pulled by a continuously moving underground cable. To Jeff and to many others, Andrew Hallidie was a hero.</p><p>Robin and Angela were immediately caught up in the festive atmosphere of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The rows of fishing boats along the dock bobbed gently with the tide, and although Robin had never been to the Mediterranean the view reminded her of pictures she\u2019d seen of French and Italian harbors.</p><p>The day was beautiful, the sky blue and cloudless, the ocean sparkling the way it did on a summer day. This spring had been exceptionally warm. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for Robin to wear a winter coat in the middle of July, especially in the mornings, when there was often a heavy fog accompanied by a cool mist from the Bay. But this spring, they\u2019d experienced some lovely weather, including today\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat outside,\u201d Angela suggested, pointing at a free table on the patio.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Robin agreed cheerfully. The Blue Crab was a popular restaurant and one of several that lined the wharf. More elegant dining took place inside, but the pavement was crowded with diners interested in a less formal meal.</p><p>Once they were seated, Robin and Angela were waited on quickly and ordered their shrimp salads.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Angela said, spreading out her napkin while closely studying Robin. \u201cTell me more about your neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Robin froze. \u201cI thought we were finished with this subject. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, I\u2019d prefer not to discuss Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed, but unfortunately I was just getting started. It\u2019s unusual for you to be so keen on a man, and I know hardly anything about him. It\u2019s time, Robin Masterson, to tell all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell. I already told you everything I care to,\u201d Robin said crossly. She briefly wondered if Angela had guessed that Cole had kissed her. At the rate things were going, she\u2019d probably end up admitting it before lunch was over. Robin wished she could think of some surefire way to change the subject.</p><p>Tall glasses of iced tea arrived and Robin was reaching for a packet of sugar when she heard a masculine chuckle that reminded her instantly of Cole. She paused, savoring the husky sound. Without really meaning to, she found herself scanning the tables, certain Cole was seated a short distance away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she whispered before she could guard her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole. I just heard him laugh.\u201d</p><p>Pushing back her chair in order to get a fuller view of the inside dining area, Robin searched through a sea of faces, but didn\u2019t find her neighbor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he look like?\u201d Angela whispered.</p><p>Ten different ways to describe him shot through her mind. To say he had brown hair, neatly trimmed, coffee-colored eyes and was about six foot two seemed inadequate. To add that he was strikingly attractive further complicated the problem.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to look for,\u201d Angela insisted. \u201cCome on, Robin, this is a golden opportunity. I want to check this guy out. I\u2019m not letting a chance like this slip through my fingers. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Robin continued to scan the diners, but she didn\u2019t see anyone who remotely resembled Cole. Even if she did see him, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d point him out to Angela, although she hated to lie. Perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have to. Perhaps she\u2019d imagined the whole thing. It would\u2019ve been easy enough to do. Angela\u2019s questions had brought Cole to the forefront of her mind; they\u2019d just been discussing him and it was only natural for her to\u2014</p><p>Her heart pounded against her rib cage as Cole walked out of the restaurant foyer. He wasn\u2019t alone. A tall, slender woman with legs that seemed to go all the way up to her neck and a figure as shapely and athletic as a dancer\u2019s was walking beside him. She was blond and, in a word, gorgeous. Robin felt as appealing as milkweed in comparison. The woman\u2019s arm was delicately tucked in Cole\u2019s, and she was smiling up at him with eyes big and blue enough to turn heads.</p><p>Robin\u2019s stomach tightened into a hard knot.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Angela said anxiously, leaning toward her, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Cole was strolling past them, and in an effort not to be seen, Robin stuck her head under the table pretending to search for her purse.</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Angela muttered, lowering her own head and peeking under the linen tablecloth, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Other than the fact that she was going to be ill. Other than the fact that she\u2019d never been more outclassed in her life. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d A smile trembled on her pale lips.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing with your head under the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d believe my napkin fell off my lap?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A pair of shiny black shoes appeared. Slowly, Robin twisted her head and glanced upward, squinting at the flash of sunlight that nearly blinded her. It was their waiter. Heaving a giant sigh of relief, Robin straightened. The first thing she noticed was that Cole had left.</p><p>The huge shrimp salads were all but forgotten as Angela, eyes narrowed and elbows braced on the table, confronted her. \u201cYou saw him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in pretending otherwise, so Robin nodded.</p> <p>\u201cHe was with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just someone! The most beautiful woman in the world was draped all over his arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Angela said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re jumping to conclusions? Honestly, she could\u2019ve been anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Any fight left in Robin had long since evaporated. There was nothing like seeing Cole with another woman to bring her firmly back to earth\u2014which was right where she belonged.</p><p>\u201cShe could\u2019ve been a client.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe probably was,\u201d Robin concurred, reaching for her fork. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to manage one shrimp, let alone a whole plate of them. Heaving another huge sigh, she plowed her fork into the heap of plump pink darlings. It was then that she happened to glance across the street. Cole and Ms. Gorgeous were walking along the sidewalk, engrossed in their conversation. For some reason, known only to the fates, Cole looked across the street at that very moment. His gaze instantly narrowed on her. He stopped midstride as though shocked to have seen her.</p><p>Doing her best to pretend she hadn\u2019t seen him, Robin took another bite of her salad and chewed vigorously. When she glanced up again, Cole was gone.</p><p>\u201cMom, I need someone to practice with,\u201d Jeff pleaded. He stood forlornly in front of her, a baseball mitt in one hand, a ball in the other.</p><p>\u201cI thought Jimmy was practicing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to go home and then Kelly threw me a few pitches, but she had to go home, too. Besides, she\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I?\u201d Robin muttered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mom,\u201d Jeff answered, clearly not understanding her question. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? I\u2019ve got a chance of making pitcher for our team if I can get someone to practice with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Robin agreed, grumbling a bit. She set aside her knitting and followed her son into the backyard. He handed her his old catcher\u2019s mitt, which barely fit her hand, and positioned her with her back to Cole\u2019s yard.</p><p>Robin hadn\u2019t been able to completely avoid her neighbor in the past week, but she\u2019d succeeded in keeping her distance. For that matter, he didn\u2019t seem all that eager to run into her, either. Just as well, she supposed.</p><p>He stayed on his side of the hedge. She stayed on hers.</p><p>If he passed her on his way to work, he gave an absent wave. She returned the gesture.</p><p>If they happened to be outside at the same time, they exchanged smiles and a polite greeting, but nothing more. It seemed, although Robin couldn\u2019t be sure, that Cole spent less time outside than usual. So did she.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeff called, running to the end of their yard. \u201cSquat down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Robin shouted indignantly. \u201cI agreed to play catch with you. You didn\u2019t say anything about having to squat!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d Jeff said impatiently, \u201cthink about it. If I\u2019m going to be the pitcher, you\u2019ve got to be the catcher, and catchers have to be low to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Complaining under her breath, Robin sank to her knees, worried the grass would stain her jeans.</p><p>Jeff tossed his arms into the air in frustration. \u201cNot like that!\u201d He said something else that Robin couldn\u2019t quite make out\u2014something about why couldn\u2019t moms be guys.</p><p>Reluctantly, Robin assumed the posture he wanted, but she didn\u2019t know how long her knees would hold out. Jeff wound up his arm and let loose with a fastball. Robin closed her eyes, stuck out the mitt and was so shocked when she caught the ball that she toppled backward into the wet grass.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Jeff yelled, racing toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she shouted back, discounting his concern as she brushed the dampness from the seat of her jeans. She righted herself, assumed the position and waited for the second ball.</p><p>Jeff ran back to his mock pitcher\u2019s mound, gripped both hands behind his back and stepped forward. Robin closed her eyes again. Nothing happened. She opened her eyes cautiously, puzzled about the delay. Then she recalled the hand movements she\u2019d seen pitchers make and flexed her fingers a few times.</p><p>Jeff straightened, placed his hand on his hip and stared at her. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a signal...I think. I\u2019ve seen catchers do it on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, leave that kind of stuff to the real ballplayers. All I want you to do is catch my pitches and throw them back. It might help if you kept your eyes open, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Robin suspected she heard a tinge of sarcasm in her son\u2019s voice. She didn\u2019t know what he was getting so riled up about; she was doing her best. It was at times like these that she most longed for Lenny. When her parents had still lived in the area, her dad had stepped in whenever her son needed a father\u2019s guiding hand, but they\u2019d moved to Arizona a couple of years ago. Lenny\u2019s family had been in Texas since before his death. Robin hadn\u2019t seen them since the funeral, although Lenny\u2019s mother faithfully sent Jeff birthday and Christmas gifts.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d Squinting, Robin stuck out the mitt, prepared to do her best to catch the stupid ball, since it seemed so important to her son. Once more he swung his arms behind him and stepped forward. Then he stood there, poised to throw, for what seemed an eternity. Her knees were beginning to ache.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to throw the ball, or are you going to stare at me all night?\u201d she asked after a long moment had passed.</p><p>\u201cThat does it!\u201d Jeff tossed his mitt to the ground. \u201cYou just broke my concentration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for crying out loud, what\u2019s there to concentrate on?\u201d Robin grimaced, rising awkwardly to her feet. Her legs had started to lose feeling.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d Jeff cried, stalking toward her. \u201cKelly\u2019s only in third grade and she does a better job than you do.\u201d</p><p>Robin decided to ignore that comment. She pressed her hand to the small of her back, hoping to ease the ache she\u2019d begun to feel.</p><p>\u201cHello, Robin. Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s voice came at her like a hangman\u2019s noose. She straightened abruptly and winced at the sharp pain shooting through her back.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Camden!\u201d Jeff shouted as though Cole was a conquering hero returned from the war. He dashed across the yard, past Robin and straight to the hedge. \u201cWhere have you been all week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d He might\u2019ve been talking to Jeff, but his eyes were holding Robin\u2019s. She tried to look away\u2014but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His eyes told her she was avoiding him.</p><p>Hers answered that he\u2019d been avoiding her.</p><p>\u201cI guess you have been busy,\u201d Jeff was saying. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in days and days and days.\u201d Blackie squeezed through the hedge and Jeff fell to his knees, his arms circling the dog\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the baseball going?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Jeff sent his mother a disgusted look, then shrugged. \u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat position are you playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably outfield. I had a chance to make pitcher, but I can\u2019t seem to get anyone who knows how to catch a ball to practice with me. Kelly tries, but she\u2019s a girl and I hate to say it, but my mother\u2019s worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my best,\u201d Robin protested.</p><p>\u201cShe catches with her eyes closed,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cHow about if you toss a few balls at me?\u201d Cole offered.</p><p>Jeff blinked as if he thought he\u2019d misunderstood. \u201cYou want me to throw you a few pitches? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>The look on her son\u2019s face defied description as Cole jumped over the hedge. Jeff\u2019s smile stretched from one side of his face to the other as he tore to the opposite end of the yard, unwilling to question Cole\u2019s generosity a second time.</p><p>For an awkward moment, Robin stayed where she was, not knowing what to say. She looked up at Cole, her emotions soaring\u2014and tangling like kites in a brisk wind. She was deeply grateful for his offer, but also confused. Thrilled by his presence, but also frightened.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Jeff muttered. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, you\u2019re in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make coffee and invite me in for a chat later?\u201d Cole asked quietly.</p><p>Her heart sank. \u201cI have some things that need to be done, and...and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Jeff shouted.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you and I talked,\u201d Cole said, staring straight into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you moving or not?\u201d</p><p>Robin looked frantically over her shoulder. \u201cOh...oh, sorry,\u201d she whispered, blushing. She hurried away, then stood on the patio watching as the ball flew across the yard.</p><p>After catching a dozen of Jeff\u2019s pitches, Cole got up and walked over to her son. They spoke for several minutes. Reluctantly, Robin decided it was time to go back in.</p><p>She busied herself wiping kitchen counters that were already perfectly clean and tried to stop thinking about the beautiful woman she\u2019d seen with Cole on the Wharf.</p><p>Jeff stormed into the house. \u201cMom, would it be okay if Mr. Camden strings up an old tire from the apple tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I can use it to practice pitching, and I wouldn\u2019t have to bother you or Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have an old tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Camden has one.\u201d He ran outside again before she could comment.</p><p>Jeff was back in the yard with Cole a few minutes later, far too soon to suit Robin. She forced a weak smile. That other woman was a perfect damsel to his knight in shining armor, she thought wryly. Robin, on the other hand, considered herself more of a court jester.</p><p>Her musings were abruptly halted when Cole walked into the kitchen, trailed by her son.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for your bath, Jeff?\u201d Cole asked pointedly.</p><p>It looked for a minute as though the boy was going to argue. For the first time in recent memory, Robin would\u2019ve welcomed some resistance from him.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said. Bathing was about as popular as homework.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make any coffee,\u201d Robin said in a small voice. She simply couldn\u2019t look at Cole and not see the beautiful blonde on his arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m more interested in talking, anyway,\u201d he said. He walked purposefully to the table and pulled out a chair, then gestured for her to sit down.</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t. Instead, she frowned at her watch. \u201cMy goodness, will you look at the time?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cole headed toward her, and Robin backed slowly into the counter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going talk about that kiss,\u201d Cole warned her.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt meant nothing! We\u2019d both had a hectic week. We were tired.... I wasn\u2019t myself.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes burned into hers. \u201cThen why did you cry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. Believe me, if I knew I\u2019d tell you, but I don\u2019t. Can\u2019t we just forget it ever happened?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rose in a sigh as he threaded his long fingers through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve tried to do all week. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put it completely out of my mind,\u201d Robin said, resuming her string of untruths. \u201cI wish you\u2019d do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried,\u201d Cole told her softly. He smiled and his sensuous mouth widened as his eyes continued to hold hers. The messages were back. Less than subtle messages. You can\u2019t fool me, they said, and I didn\u2019t want to admit it either.</p> <p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>The sense of expectancy was written across his face. For the life of her, Robin couldn\u2019t tear her eyes from him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember stepping into his arms, but suddenly she was there, encompassed by his warmth, feeling more sheltered and protected than she had since her husband\u2019s death. This comforting sensation spun itself around her as he wove his fingers into her hair, cradling her head. He hadn\u2019t kissed her yet, but Robin felt the promise of it in every part of her.</p><p>Deny it though she might, she knew in her heart how badly she wanted Cole to hold her, to kiss her. He must have read the longing in her eyes, because he lowered his mouth to hers, stopping a fraction of an inch from her parted lips. She could feel warm moist breath, could feel a desire so powerful that she wanted to drown in his kiss.</p><p>From a reservoir of strength she didn\u2019t know she possessed, Robin managed to shake her head. \u201cNo...please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...please,\u201d he whispered just before his mouth settled firmly over hers.</p> <p>His kiss was the same as it had been before, only more intense. More potent. Robin felt rocked to the very core of her being. Against her will, she felt herself surrendering to him. She felt herself forgetting to breathe. She felt herself weakening.</p><p>His mouth moved to her jaw, dropping small, soft kisses there. She sighed. She couldn\u2019t help it. Cole\u2019s touch was magic. Unable to stop herself, she turned her head, yearning for him to trace a row of kisses on the other side, as well. He complied.</p><p>Robin sighed again, her mind filled with dangerous, sensuous thoughts. It felt so good in his arms, so warm and safe...but she knew the feeling was deceptive. She\u2019d seen him with another woman, one far more suited to him than she could ever be. For days she\u2019d been tormented by the realization that the woman in the restaurant was probably the one he spent his weekends with.</p><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t.\u201d Once more she pleaded, but even to her own ears the words held little conviction.</p><p>In response, Cole brought a long slow series of featherlight kisses to her lips, effectively silencing any protest. Robin trembled, breathless.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you fighting me so hard?\u201d he whispered. His hands framed her face, his thumbs stroking her cheeks. They were damp and she hadn\u2019t even known she was crying.</p><p>Suddenly she heard footsteps bounding down the stairs. At the thought of Jeff finding her in Cole\u2019s arms, she abruptly broke away and turned to stare out the darkened window, hoping for a moment to compose herself.</p><p>Jeff burst into the room. \u201cDid you kiss her yet?\u201d he demanded. Not waiting for an answer, Jeff ran toward Robin and grabbed her by the hand. \u201cWell, Mom, what do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden kissing you. He did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to deny the whole thing, but she decided to brazen it out. \u201cYou want me to rate him? Like on a scale of one to ten?\u201d</p><p>Jeff blinked, uncertain. His questioning glance flew to Cole.</p><p>\u201cShe was a ten,\u201d Cole said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cA...high seven,\u201d Robin returned.</p><p>\u201cA high seven!\u201d Jeff cried, casting her a disparaging look. He shook his head and walked over to Cole. \u201cShe\u2019s out of practice,\u201d he said confidingly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t know how to rate guys. Give her a little time and she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin gasped, astounded to be having this kind of discussion with her son, let alone Cole, who was looking all too smug.</p><p>\u201cShe hardly goes out at all,\u201d Jeff added. \u201cMy mom\u2019s got this friend who arranges dates for her, and you wouldn\u2019t believe some of the guys she\u2019s been stuck with. One of them came to the door\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin said sharply, \u201cthat\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut one of us needs to tell him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Camden was just leaving,\u201d Robin said, glaring at her neighbor, daring him to contradict her.</p><p>\u201cI was? Oh, yeah. Your mom was about to walk me to the door, isn\u2019t that right, Robin?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at Cole as he reached for her hand and gently led her in the direction of the front door. Meekly she submitted, but not before she saw Jeff give Cole a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Cole said, standing in the entryway, his hands heavy on her shoulders. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong? Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Victoria, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria?\u201d she asked, already knowing that had to be the woman with him the day she\u2019d seen him at the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYes. Victoria. I saw you practically hiding under your table, pretending you didn\u2019t notice me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...Why should I care?\u201d She hated the way her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cYes, why should you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Couldn\u2019t answer him. She told herself it didn\u2019t matter that he was with another woman. Then again, it mattered more than she dared admit.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Robin lowered her gaze. If only he\u2019d stop holding her, stop touching her. Then she might be able to think clearly. \u201cYou looked right together. She was a perfect complement to you. She\u2019s tall and blond and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold as an iceberg. Victoria\u2019s a business associate\u2014we had lunch together. Nothing more. I find her as appealing as...as dirty laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t explain. It\u2019s none of my business who you have lunch with or who you date or where you go every weekend or who you\u2019re with. Really. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I don\u2019t know why I did. It was wrong of me\u2014very wrong. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re even talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Jeff poked his head out from the kitchen. \u201cHow are things going in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI was just telling Cole how much we both appreciated his help with your pitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was having real problems until Cole came along,\u201d Jeff confirmed. \u201cGirls are okay for some things, but serious baseball isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Robin opened the front door. \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, her eyes avoiding Cole\u2019s, \u201cfor everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>She blushed, remembering the kisses they\u2019d shared. But before she could think of a witty reply, Cole brushed his lips across hers.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cole,\u201d Jeff said, hurrying to the front door. \u201cI\u2019ve got a baseball game Thursday night. Can you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Cole answered, his eyes holding Robin\u2019s. Then he turned abruptly and strode out the door.</p><p>\u201cJeff, we\u2019re going to be late for the game if we don\u2019t leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Cole isn\u2019t home yet,\u201d Jeff protested. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably a very good explanation,\u201d Robin said calmly, although she was as disappointed as Jeff. \u201cHe could be tied up in traffic, or delayed at the office, or any one of a thousand other things. He wouldn\u2019t purposely not come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he forgot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t. Come on, sweetheart, let\u2019s get a move on. You\u2019ve got a game to pitch.\u201d The emphasis came on the last word. The first game of the season and Jeff had won the coveted position of first-string pitcher. Whether it was true or not, Jeff believed Cole\u2019s tutoring had given him an advantage over the competition. Jeff hadn\u2019t told him the news yet, keeping it a surprise for today.</p><p>\u201cWhen you do see Cole, don\u2019t say anything, all right?\u201d Jeff pleaded as they headed toward the car. \u201cI want to be the one who tells him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d she said, holding up her hand. For good measure, she pantomimed zipping her mouth closed. She slid into the car and started the engine, but glanced in the rearview mirror several times, hoping Cole would somehow miraculously appear.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>The game was scheduled for the baseball diamond in Balboa Park, less than two miles from Robin\u2019s house. A set of bleachers had been arranged around the diamonds, and Robin climbed to the top. It gave her an excellent view of the field\u2014and of the parking area.</p><p>Cole knew the game was at Balboa Park, but he didn\u2019t know which diamond and there were several. Depending on how late he was, he could waste valuable time looking for the proper field.</p><p>The second inning had just begun when Heather Lawrence joined Robin. Robin smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Heather said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing nothing. It\u2019s the top of the second inning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the neighborhood Randy Johnson doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s doing great. He managed to keep his cool when the first batter got a hit off his second pitch. I think I took it worse than Jeff did.\u201d</p><p>Heather grinned and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with me. Kelly played goalie for her soccer team last year, and every time the opposing team scored on her I took it like a bullet to the chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kelly now?\u201d</p><p>Heather motioned toward the other side of the field. The eight-year-old was leaning casually against a tall fir tree. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want Jeff to know she\u2019d come to watch him. Her game was over a few minutes ago. They lost, but this is her first year and just about everyone else\u2019s, too. The game was more a comedy of errors than anything.\u201d</p><p>Robin laughed. It was thoughtful of Heather to stop by and see how Jeff\u2019s team was doing.</p><p>Heather laced her fingers over her knees. \u201cJeff\u2019s been talking quite a bit about Cole Camden.\u201d She made the statement sound more like a question and kept her gaze focused on the playing field.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Robin wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. \u201cCole was kind enough to give Jeff a few pointers about pitching techniques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of pitching techniques, you two certainly seem to be hitting it off.\u201d</p><p>Heather was beginning to sound a lot like Angela, who drilled her daily about her relationship with Cole, offering advice and unsolicited suggestions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how surprised I am at the changes I\u2019ve seen in Cole since you two moved in. Kelly\u2019s been wanting to play in that fort from the moment she heard about it, but it\u2019s only since Jeff came here that she was even allowed in Cole\u2019s yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been good for Jeff,\u201d Robin said, training her eyes on the game. Cole\u2019s relationship with her son forced Robin to examine his motives. He\u2019d lost a son, and there was bound to be a gaping hole in his heart. At first he hadn\u2019t allowed Jeff in his yard or approved of Blackie and Jeff\u2019s becoming friends. But without anything ever being said, all that had fallen to the wayside. Jeff played in Cole\u2019s yard almost every day, and with their neighbor\u2019s blessing. Jeff now had free access to the fort and often brought other neighborhood kids along. Apparently Cole had given permission. Did he consider Jeff a sort of substitute son? Robin shook off the thought.</p><p>\u201cJeff talks about Cole constantly,\u201d Heather said. \u201cIn fact, he told me this morning that Cole was coming to see him pitch. What happened? Did he get hung up at the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He must\u2019ve been delayed, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere he is! Over there.\u201d Heather broke in excitedly. \u201cYou know, in the two years we\u2019ve lived on Orchard Street, I can only recall talking to Cole a few times. He was always so standoffish. Except when we were both doing yard work, I never saw him, and if we did happen to meet we said hello and that was about it. The other day we bumped into each other at the grocery store and he actually smiled at me. I was stunned. I swear that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen that man smile. I honestly think you and Jeff are responsible for the change in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re crediting me with more than my due,\u201d Robin said, craning her head to look for Cole.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Heather argued. \u201cYou can\u2019t see the difference in him because you\u2019re new to the neighborhood, but everyone who\u2019s known him for any length of time will tell you he\u2019s like a different person.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was sitting on the bench while his team was up at bat. Suddenly he leapt to his feet and waved energetically, as though he was flagging down a rescue vehicle. His face broke into a wide, eager smile. His coach must have said something to him because Jeff nodded and took off running toward the parking area.</p><p>Robin\u2019s gaze followed her son. Cole had indeed arrived. The tension eased out of her in a single breath. She hadn\u2019t realized how edgy she\u2019d been. In her heart she knew Cole would never purposely disappoint Jeff, but her son\u2019s anxiety had been as acute as her own.</p> <p>\u201cListen,\u201d Heather said, standing, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to.\u201d Heather climbed down the bleachers. She paused when she got to the ground and wiggled her eyebrows expressively, then laughed merrily at Robin\u2019s frown.</p><p>Heather must have passed Cole on her way out, but Robin lost sight of them as Jeff raced on to the pitcher\u2019s mound for the bottom of the second inning. Even from this distance Robin could see that his eyes were full of happy excitement. He discreetly shot her a look and Robin made a V-for-victory sign, smiling broadly.</p><p>Cole vaulted up the bleachers and sat down beside her. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I was trapped in a meeting, and by the time I could get out to phone you I knew you\u2019d already left for the field. I would\u2019ve called your cell,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have the number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff and I figured it had to be something like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he\u2019s pitching!\u201d Cole\u2019s voice rang with pride.</p><p>\u201cHe claims it\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him believe that,\u201d Cole said, grinning, \u201cbut he\u2019s a natural athlete. All I did was teach him a little discipline and give him a means of practicing on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, according to Jeff you taught him everything he knows.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t miss the whole game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be others,\u201d she said, but she was grateful he\u2019d come when he had. From the time they\u2019d left the house, Robin had been tense and guarded. Cole could stand her up for any date, but disappointing Jeff was more than she could bear. Rarely had she felt this emotionally unsettled. And all because Cole had been late for a Balboa Park Baseball League game. It frightened her to realize how much Jeff was beginning to depend on him. And not just Jeff, either....</p><p>\u201cThis is important to Jeff,\u201d Cole said as if reading her mind, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t disappoint him. If it had been anyone else it wouldn\u2019t have been as important. But Jeff matters\u2014\u201d his eyes locked with hers \u201c\u2014and so do you.\u201d</p><p>Robin felt giddy with relief. For the first time since Lenny\u2019s tragic death, she understood how carefully, how completely, she\u2019d anesthetized her life, refusing to let in anyone or anything that might cause her or Jeff more pain. For years she\u2019d been drifting in a haze of denial and grief, refusing to acknowledge or deal with either. What Angela had said was true. Robin had dated infrequently and haphazardly, and kept any suitors at a safe distance.</p> <p>For some reason, she hadn\u2019t been able to do that with Cole. Robin couldn\u2019t understand what was different or why; all she knew was that she was in serious danger of falling for this man, and falling hard. It terrified her....</p><p>\u201cHave you and Jeff had dinner?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Robin turned to face him, but it was a long moment before she grasped that he\u2019d asked her a question. He repeated it and she shook her head. \u201cJeff was too excited to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. There\u2019s an excellent Chinese restaurant close by. The three of us can celebrate after the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d she whispered, thinking she should make some excuse to avoid this, and accepting almost immediately that she didn\u2019t want to avoid it at all.</p><p>\u201cCan I have some more pork-fried rice?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>Cole passed him the dish and Robin watched as her son heaped his plate high with a third helping.</p><p>\u201cYou won,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cMom, I wish you\u2019d stop saying that. It\u2019s the fourth time you\u2019ve said it. I know we won,\u201d Jeff muttered, glancing at Cole as if to beg forgiveness for his mother, who was obviously suffering from an overdose of maternal pride.</p><p>\u201cBut Jeff, you were fantastic,\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist telling him.</p><p>\u201cThe whole team was fantastic.\u201d Jeff reached for what was left of the egg rolls and added a dollop of plum sauce to his plate.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you were such a good hitter,\u201d Robin said, still impressed with her son\u2019s athletic ability. \u201cI knew you could pitch\u2014but two home runs! Oh, Jeff, I\u2019m so proud of you\u2014and everyone else.\u201d It was difficult to remember that Jeff was only one member of a team, and that his success was part of a larger effort.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure I played well, especially \u2019cause you were there, Cole.\u201d Jeff stretched his arm across the table again, this time reaching for the nearly empty platter of almond chicken.</p><p>As for herself, Robin couldn\u2019t down another bite. Cole had said the food at the Golden Wok was good, and he hadn\u2019t exaggerated. It was probably the best Chinese meal she\u2019d ever tasted. Jeff apparently thought so, too. The boy couldn\u2019t seem to stop eating.</p><p>It was while they were laughing over their fortune cookies that Robin heard bits and pieces of the conversation from the booth behind them.</p><p>\u201cI bet they\u2019re celebrating something special,\u201d an elderly gentleman remarked.</p><p>\u201cI think their little boy must have done well at the baseball game,\u201d his wife said.</p><p>Their little boy, Robin mused. The older couple dining directly behind them thought Cole and Jeff were father and son.</p><p>Robin\u2019s eyes flew to Cole, but if he had heard the comment he didn\u2019t give any sign.</p><p>\u201cHis mother and father are certainly proud of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a delight to see these young people so happy. A family should spend time together.\u201d</p><p>A family. The three of them looked like a family.</p><p>Once more Robin turned to Cole, but once more he seemed not to hear the comments. Or if he had, he ignored them.</p><p>But Cole must have sensed her scrutiny because his gaze found hers just then. Their eyes lingered without a hint of the awkwardness Robin had felt so often before.</p><p>Jeff chatted constantly on the ride home with Robin. Since she and Cole had both brought their cars, they drove home separately. They exchanged good-nights in the driveway and entered their own houses.</p><p>Jeff had some homework to finish and Robin ran a load of clothes through the washing machine. An hour later, after a little television and quick baths, they were both ready for bed. Robin tucked the blankets around Jeff\u2019s shoulders, although he protested that he was much too old for her to do that. But he didn\u2019t complain too loudly or too long.</p><p>\u201cNight, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Mom. Don\u2019t let the bedbugs bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go all sentimental on me, okay?\u201d she teased as she turned off his light. He seemed to fall asleep the instant she left the room. She went downstairs to secure the house for the night, then headed up to her own bedroom. Once upstairs, she paused in her son\u2019s doorway and smiled gently. They\u2019d both had quite a day.</p><p>At about ten o\u2019clock, she was sitting up in bed reading a mystery when the phone rang. She answered quickly, always anxious about late calls. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still awake.\u201d It was Cole, and his voice affected her like a surge of electricity.</p><p>\u201cI...was reading,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt suddenly occurred to me that we never had the chance to finish our conversation the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat conversation?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one at the front door...that Jeff interrupted. Remind me to give that boy lessons in timing, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even remember what we were talking about.\u201d She settled back against the pillows, savoring the sound of his voice, enjoying the small intimacy of lying in bed, listening to him. Her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you\u2019d just said something about how it isn\u2019t any of your business who I lunch with or spend my weekends with. I assume you think I\u2019m with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s eyes shot open. \u201cI can assure you, I don\u2019t think anything of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should explain about the weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, Cole, it really isn\u2019t my business. It doesn\u2019t matter. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some property north of here, about forty acres,\u201d he said gently, despite her protests. \u201cThe land once belonged to my grandfather, and he willed it to me when he passed away a couple of years back. This house was part of the estate, as well. My father was born and raised here. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of my free time remodeling the old farmhouse. Sometime in the future I might move out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about Cole leaving the neighborhood, ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe place still needs a lot of work, and I\u2019ve enjoyed doing it on my own. It\u2019s coming along well.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and a second later realized he couldn\u2019t see her action. \u201cIt sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any other questions you\u2019d like to ask me?\u201d His voice was low and teasing.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she denied immediately.</p> <p>\u201cThen would you be willing to admit you enjoy it when I kiss you? A high seven? Really? I think Jeff\u2019s right\u2014we need more practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Robin didn\u2019t know how to answer that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing,\u201d he said, and she could almost hear him smile.</p><p>Robin lifted the hair from her forehead with one hand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I told you how much I enjoy kissing you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease...don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. She didn\u2019t want him to tell her that. Every time he kissed her, it confused her more. Despite the sheltered feeling she experienced in his arms, something deep and fundamental inside her was afraid of loving again. No, terrified. She was terrified of falling in love with Cole. Terrified of what the future might hold.</p><p>\u201cThe first time shook me more than I care to admit,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember that Friday night we rented the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to stay away from you afterward. For an entire week I avoided you.\u201d</p><p>Robin didn\u2019t answer. She couldn\u2019t. Lying back against the pillows, she stared at the ceiling as a sense of warmth enveloped her. A feeling of comfort...of happiness.</p><p>There was a short silence, and in an effort to bring their discussion back to a less intimate\u2014less risky\u2014level, she said, \u201cThank you for dinner. Jeff had the time of his life.\u201d She had, too, but she couldn\u2019t find the courage to acknowledge it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going away this weekend to work on the property?\u201d</p><p>She had no right to ask him that, and was shocked at how easily the question emerged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d After another brief pause, he murmured, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you went on a picnic and flew a kite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you consider going with me on Saturday afternoon? You and Jeff. The three of us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...Jeff would love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you? Would you love it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything more to say, and Robin ended the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Jeff in the morning. He\u2019ll be thrilled. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Robin.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. He said her name the way she\u2019d always dreamed a man would, softly, with a mixture of excitement and need. \u201cGood night, Cole.\u201d</p><p>For a long time after they\u2019d hung up Robin lay staring at her bedroom walls. When she did flick off her light, she fell asleep as quickly as Jeff seemed to have. She woke about midnight, surprised to find the sheets all twisted as if she\u2019d tossed and turned frantically. The bedspread had slipped onto the floor, and the top sheet was wound around her legs, trapping her.</p><p>Sitting up, she untangled her legs and brushed the curls from her face, wondering what had caused her restlessness. She didn\u2019t usually wake abruptly like this.</p><p>She slid off the bed, found her slippers and went downstairs for a glass of milk.</p><p>It was while she was sitting at the table that it came to her. Her hand stilled. Her heartbeat accelerated. The couple in the Chinese restaurant. Robin had overheard them and she was certain Cole had, too.</p><p>Their little boy. A family.</p><p>Cole had lost a son. From the little Robin had learned, Cole\u2019s son had been about the same age Jeff was now when he\u2019d died. First divorce, and then death.</p><p>Suddenly it all made sense. A painful kind of sense. A panicky kind of sense. The common ground between them wasn\u2019t their backyards, but the fact that they were both victims.</p><p>Cole was trying to replace the family that had been so cruelly taken from him.</p><p>Robin was just as guilty. She\u2019d been so caught up in the tide of emotion and attraction that she\u2019d refused to recognize what was staring her in the face. She\u2019d ignored her own suspicions and fears, shoving them aside.</p><p>She and Cole were both hurting, needy people.</p><p>But once the hurt was assuaged, once the need had been satisfied, Cole would discover what Robin had known from the beginning. They were completely different people with little, if anything, in common.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you want to meet my cousin?\u201d Angela demanded, glancing up from her desk, a shocked look on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been after me for weeks to go out with Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank. Yes, I have, but that was B.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB.C.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Cole. What happened with you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pigs have wings,\u201d Angela said with more than a trace of sarcasm. She stood up and walked around to the front of her desk, leaning against one corner while she folded her arms and stared unblinkingly at Robin.</p><p>Robin knew it would do little good to try to disguise her feelings. She\u2019d had a restless night and was convinced it showed. No doubt her eyes were glazed; they ached. Her bones ached. But mostly her heart ached. Arranging a date with Angela\u2019s cousin was a sure indication of her distress.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I heard, Cole was supposed to attend Jeff\u2019s baseball game with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Robin walked to her own desk and reached for the cup of coffee she\u2019d brought upstairs with her. Peeling off the plastic lid, she cautiously took a sip.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff pitched and he played a fabulous game,\u201d Robin said, hoping her friend wouldn\u2019t question her further.</p><p>Angela continued to stare at Robin. Good grief, Robin thought, the woman had eyes that could cut through solid rock.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Robin snapped when she couldn\u2019t stand her friend\u2019s scrutiny any longer. She took another sip of her coffee and nearly scalded her lips. If the rest of her day followed the pattern set that morning, she might as well go home now. The temptation to climb back into bed and hide her head under the pillow was growing stronger every minute.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened with Cole,\u201d Angela said again.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I already told you he was at Jeff\u2019s baseball game. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is tell me what went on last night,\u201d Angela said slowly, carefully enunciating each word as though speaking to someone who was hard of hearing.</p><p>\u201cBefore or after Jeff\u2019s game?\u201d Robin pulled out her chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Robin gave up. Gesturing weakly with her hands, she shrugged, took a deep breath and poured out the whole story in one huge rush. \u201cCole was held up at the office in a meeting, so we didn\u2019t meet at the house the way we\u2019d planned. Naturally Jeff was disappointed, but we decided that whatever was keeping Cole wasn\u2019t his fault, and we left for Balboa Park without him. Cole arrived at the bottom of the second inning, just as Jeff was ready to pitch. Jeff only allowed three hits the entire game, and scored two home runs himself. Afterward Cole took us all out for Chinese food at a fabulous restaurant I\u2019ve never heard of but one you and I will have to try sometime. Our next raise, okay? Later Cole phoned and asked to take Jeff and me on a picnic Saturday. I think we\u2019re going to Golden Gate Park because he also talked about flying kites.\u201d She paused, dragged in a fresh gulp of air and gave Angela a look that said \u201cmake something out of that if you can!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Angela said after a lengthy pause.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Robin wasn\u2019t up to explaining things, so if Angela really didn\u2019t understand, that was just too bad. She only knew that she was dangerously close to letting her emotions take charge of her life. She was becoming increasingly attracted to a man who could well be trying to replace the son he\u2019d lost. Robin needed to find a way to keep from following her heart, which was moving at breakneck speed straight into Cole\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWill you introduce me to Frank or not?\u201d she asked a second time, strengthening her voice and her conviction.</p><p>Angela was still watching her with those diamond-cutting eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure!\u201d Robin echoed, dismayed. \u201cFor weeks you\u2019ve been spouting his virtues. According to you, this cousin is as close to a god as a human being can get. He works hard, buys municipal bonds, goes to church regularly and flosses his teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d Robin muttered. \u201cI made up the part about flossing his teeth. Yet when I ask to meet this paragon of limitless virtue, you say you\u2019re not sure you want to introduce me. I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am pleased,\u201d Angela said, frowning, \u201cbut I\u2019m also concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to be concerned. All you have to do is call Fred and let him know I\u2019m available Saturday evening for drinks or dinner or a movie or whatever. I\u2019ll let him decide what he\u2019s most comfortable with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Frank, and I thought you said you were going on a picnic with Cole on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Robin turned on her computer, prepared to check several columns of figures. If she looked busy and suitably nonchalant, it might prompt Angela to agree. \u201cJeff and I will be with Cole earlier in the day. I\u2019ll simply make sure we\u2019re back before late afternoon, so there\u2019s no reason to worry.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s forehead puckered. \u201cI am worried. I can\u2019t help being worried. Honestly, Robin, I\u2019ve never seen you like this. You\u2019re so...so determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been determined,\u201d Robin countered, glancing up from the computer.</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree one hundred percent,\u201d Angela said with a heavy sigh, \u201cbut not when it comes to anything that has to do with men. My thirteen-year-old niece has more savvy with the opposite sex than you do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, look how high my kite is,\u201d Jeff hollered as his box kite soared toward the heavens.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s touching the sky!\u201d Robin shouted, and laughed with her son as he tugged and twisted the string. Despite all her misgivings about her relationship with Cole, she was thoroughly enjoying the afternoon. At first, she\u2019d been positive the day would turn into a disaster. She was sure Cole would take one look at her and know she was going out with another man that evening. She was equally sure she\u2019d blurt it out if he didn\u2019t immediately guess.</p><p>Cole had been as excited as Jeff about the picnic and kite-flying expedition. The two of them had been fussing with the kites for hours\u2014buying, building and now flying them. For her part, Robin was content to soak up the sunshine.</p><p>The weather couldn\u2019t have been more cooperative. The sky was a brilliant blue and the wind was perfect. Sailboats scudding on the choppy green waters added dashes of bright color. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In contrast to all the beauty surrounding her, Robin\u2019s heart was troubled. Watching Cole, so patient and gentle with her son, filled her with contradictory emotions. Part of her wanted to thank him. Thank him for the smile that lit up Jeff\u2019s face. Thank him for throwing open the shades and easing her toward the light. And part of her wanted to shut her eyes and run for cover.</p><p>\u201cMom, look!\u201d Jeff cried as the kite whipped and kicked in the wind. Blackie raced at his side as the sleek red-and-blue kite sliced through the sky, then dipped sharply and crashed toward the ground at heart-stopping speed, only to be caught at the last second and lifted higher and higher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking, I\u2019m looking!\u201d Robin shouted back. She\u2019d never seen Jeff happier. Pride and joy shone from his face, and Robin was moved almost to tears.</p><p>Cole stood behind Jeff, watching the kite. One hand rested on the boy\u2019s shoulder, the other shaded his eyes as he gazed up at the sky. They laughed, and once more Robin was struck by the mingling of their voices. One mature and measured, the other young and excited. Both happy.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Cole jogged over to Robin\u2019s blanket and sat down beside her. He did nothing more than smile at her, but she felt an actual jolt.</p><p>Cole stretched out and leaned back on his elbows, grinning at the sun. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two seem to be enjoying this,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>If Cole noticed anything awry, he didn\u2019t comment. She\u2019d managed not to tell him about the date with Angela\u2019s cousin; she certainly didn\u2019t want him to think she was trying to make him jealous. That wasn\u2019t the evening\u2019s purpose at all. Actually she wasn\u2019t sure what she hoped to accomplish by dating Fred...Frank. She mentally shouted the name five times. Why did she keep calling him Fred? She didn\u2019t know that any more than she knew why she was going out with him. On the morning she\u2019d talked Angela into making the arrangements for her, it had seemed a matter of life and death. Now she only felt confused and regretful.</p><p>\u201cJeff says you\u2019ve got a date this evening.\u201d</p> <p>So much for her worry that she might blurt it out herself, Robin thought. She glanced at Cole. He might\u2019ve been referring to the weather for all the emotion revealed in his voice.</p><p>\u201cA cousin of a good friend. She\u2019s been after me for months to meet Frank\u2014we\u2019re having dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould this be the Frank you weren\u2019t going out with and that was final?\u201d</p><p>Robin stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou answered the phone with that when I called to inquire about Blackie. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes...\u201d Suddenly she felt an intense need to justify her actions. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Angela\u2019s been talking about him for so long and it seemed like the right thing to do. He\u2019s apparently very nice and Angela\u2019s been telling me he\u2019s a lot of fun and I didn\u2019t think it would hurt to meet him....\u201d Once she got started, Robin couldn\u2019t seem to stop explaining.</p> <p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Cole said, his eyes tender. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me any explanations.\u201d</p><p>She instantly grew silent. He was right, she knew that, yet she couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty. She was making a terrible mess of this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the jealous type,\u201d Cole informed her matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you jealous,\u201d she returned stiffly.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Cole said and shrugged. His gaze moved from her to Jeff, who was jogging across the grass. Blackie was beside him, barking excitedly.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked, but she felt obliged to explain who\u2019d be looking after her son while she was out. \u201cJeff\u2019s going to the movies with Heather and Kelly Lawrence while I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t say anything. All he did was smile. It was the same smile he\u2019d flashed at her earlier. The same devastating, wickedly charming smile.</p><p>He seemed to be telling her she could dine with a thousand different men and it wouldn\u2019t disturb him in the least. As he\u2019d said, he wasn\u2019t the jealous type. Great. This was exactly the way she\u2019d wanted him to respond, wasn\u2019t it? She could date a thousand different men, because Cole didn\u2019t care about her. He cared about her son.</p> <p>\u201cLet me know when you want to leave,\u201d he said with infuriating self-assurance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be late.\u201d</p><p>On that cue, Robin checked her watch and was surprised to note that it was well past four. They\u2019d been having so much fun, the day had simply slipped away. When she looked up, she found Cole studying her expectantly. \u201cIt\u2019s...I\u2019m not meeting Frank until later,\u201d she said, answering his unspoken question evasively while she gathered up the remains of their picnic.</p><p>An hour later, they decided to leave Golden Gate Park. Jeff and Cole loaded up the kites, as well as the picnic cooler, in the back of Cole\u2019s car. It took them another hour to get back to Glen Park because of the traffic, which made Robin\u2019s schedule even tighter. But that was hardly Cole\u2019s fault\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d arranged for an accident on the freeway.</p><p>Cole and Jeff chatted easily for most of the ride home. When they finally arrived at the house, both Robin and Jeff helped Cole unload the car. Blackie\u2019s barking only added to the confusion.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019d better get inside,\u201d Robin said, her eyes briefly meeting Cole\u2019s. She felt awkward all of a sudden, wishing Jeff was standing there as a barrier, instead of busily carrying things onto Cole\u2019s porch.</p><p>\u201cWe had a great time,\u201d she added self-consciously. She couldn\u2019t really blame her nervousness on Cole; he\u2019d been the perfect companion all day. \u201cThank you for the picnic.\u201d</p><p>Jeff joined them, his eyes narrowing as he looked at Cole. \u201cAre you gonna let her do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cGo out with that other man,\u201d Jeff said righteously, inviting Cole to leap into the argument. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re letting her get away with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff. This isn\u2019t something we should be discussing with Mr. Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured with a sigh. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d He cast a speculative glance in Cole\u2019s direction. \u201cBoth of you,\u201d he mumbled under his breath and headed for the house.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the wonderful afternoon, Cole,\u201d Robin said again.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he responded, hands in his pockets, his stance relaxed. \u201cHave a good time with Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I will,\u201d she said, squinting at him suspiciously just before she turned toward the house. Darn it, she actually felt guilty! There wasn\u2019t a single solitary reason she should feel guilty for agreeing to this dinner date with Angela\u2019s cousin, yet she did. Cole must\u2019ve known it, too, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have made that remark about having a good time. Oh, he knew all right.</p><p>As Robin was running the bath, Jeff raced up the stairs. \u201cMom, I need money for the movie.\u201d He thrust her purse into her hands. \u201cHow much are you giving me for goodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, popcorn, pop, a couple of candy bars. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff, you haven\u2019t stopped eating all day. What about the two hot dogs I just fixed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ate them, but that was fifteen minutes ago. I\u2019m hungry again.\u201d</p><p>Robin handed him fifteen dollars, prepared for an argument. That amount should be enough to pay his way into the movie and supply him with popcorn and a soda. Anything beyond that he could do without.</p><p>Jeff took the money from her and slowly shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s it, kid,\u201d she said in a firm voice.</p><p>\u201cDid I complain?\u201d Bright blue eyes gazed innocently back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. I could see it in your face.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was ready to leave a few minutes later, just as Robin was getting dressed. He stood outside her bedroom door and shouted that Kelly and her mom were there to pick him up.</p><p>\u201cHave fun. I won\u2019t be any later than ten-thirty,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I wait for you over at Cole\u2019s after the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Robin\u2019s heart skidded to a dead stop at the suggestion. The last person she wanted to face at the end of this evening was Cole Camden. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask him, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...but I\u2019m not all that excited about going to Kelly\u2019s. I\u2019m there every day, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, I\u2019m sorry. I promise I won\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can\u2019t go over to Cole\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey Leonard Masterson, don\u2019t you dare bother Cole. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. She rarely used that tone with him, but she didn\u2019t have the time or energy to argue about this.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said with an exaggerated sigh. \u201cBut could you make it home by ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to do anything stupid like fall asleep in front of Kelly,\u201d he whispered heatedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>Glancing at her clock radio, she gasped at the time. She was running late. From the moment she\u2019d made the arrangements to meet Frank, she hadn\u2019t given the reality of this evening much thought. Just forcing herself to go through with it had depleted her of energy.</p><p>Robin had always hated situations like this. Always. She was going to a strange restaurant, meeting a strange man, and for what? She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Tucking her feet into her pumps, Robin hurried to the bathroom to spray on a little perfume. Not much, just enough to give herself some confidence. She rushed down the stairs and reached for her purse.</p><p>Her hand was on the doorknob when the phone rang. For a moment, Robin intended to ignore it. It was probably for Jeff. But what if the call was from her parents? Or Frank\u2014calling to cancel? Ridiculous though it was, each ring sounded more urgent than the last. She\u2019d have to answer or she\u2019d spend all evening wondering who it was. Muttering under her breath, she dashed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>At first there was no response. \u201cRobin, it\u2019s Cole.\u201d He sounded nothing like himself. \u201cI lied.\u201d With that the line was abruptly disconnected.</p><p>Robin held the receiver away from her ear and stared at it for several seconds. He\u2019d lied? About what? Good heavens, why had he even phoned? To tell her he\u2019d lied.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to phone him back and ask what he\u2019d meant.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for something to drink?\u201d Frank Eberle asked, glancing over the wine list.</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks,\u201d Robin said. Frank had turned out to be a congenial sort, which was a pleasant surprise. He was quite attractive, with light blue eyes and a thick head of distinguished-looking salt-and-pepper hair. Angela had once mentioned he was \u201ca little bit\u201d shy, which had panicked Robin since she was a whole lot shy, at least around men. The way she\u2019d figured it, they\u2019d stare at each other most of the night, with no idea what to say. However, they did have Angela in common. Whereas with Cole, all she shared was\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her thoughts came to an abrupt halt. She refused to think about her neighbor or his last-minute phone call. She balked at the idea of dining with one man while wistfully longing for another\u2014which was exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Robin studied the menu, pretending to decide between the prime-rib special and the fresh halibut. But the entire time she stared at the menu, she was racking her brain for a topic of conversation.</p><p>Frank saved her the trouble. \u201cFor once,\u201d he said, \u201cAngela didn\u2019t exaggerate. You\u2019re a delightful surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d It was amusing to hear him echo her own reaction.</p> <p>Frank nodded, his smile reserved. \u201cWhen Angie phoned earlier in the week, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. She keeps wanting me to date her friends. And to hear her talk, she\u2019s close friends with dozens of gorgeous women all interested in meeting me.\u201d</p><p>Robin grinned. \u201cShe should run a dating service. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times she\u2019s matched me up with someone, or tried to, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a comfortable person to be around. I could sense that right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I...wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, either. Angela\u2019s raved about you for weeks, wanting to get the two of us together.\u201d Robin glanced from the menu to her companion, then back again. She felt the same misgivings every time she agreed to one of these arranged dates.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been divorced six months now,\u201d Frank volunteered, \u201cbut after fourteen years of married life, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get accustomed to dating again.\u201d</p> <p>Robin found herself agreeing. \u201cI know what you mean. It all seems so awkward, doesn\u2019t it? When Lenny and I were dating, I was in high school, and there was so little to worry about. We knew what we wanted and knew what we had to do to get there.\u201d</p><p>Frank sent her a smile. \u201cNow that we\u2019re older and\u2014\u201d he paused \u201c\u2014I hesitate to use the word wiser....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore sophisticated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, more sophisticated,\u201d Frank repeated. His hand closed around the water glass. \u201cLife seems so complicated now. I\u2019ve been out of the swing of things for so long....\u201d</p><p>The waitress came for their order then, and from that point on the evening went smoothly. The feeling of kinship she felt with Frank astonished Robin. He was obviously at ease with her, too. Before she knew it, Robin found herself telling him about Cole.</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like the kind of guy most women would leap off a bridge to meet.\u201d</p> <p>Robin nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful to Jeff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife and son.\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cHe\u2019s married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas,\u201d she rushed to explain. \u201cFrom what I understand, his wife left him and sometime later his son died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s tough,\u201d Frank said, picking up his coffee. \u201cBut that was years ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. Cole\u2019s never told me these things himself. In fact, he\u2019s never mentioned either his wife or his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never mentioned them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cI heard it from a neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s bothering you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The question was sobering. Subconsciously, from the moment Robin had learned of Cole\u2019s loss, she\u2019d been waiting for him to tell her. Waiting for him to trust her enough.</p><p>Frank and Robin lingered over coffee, chatting about politics and the economy and a number of other stimulating topics. But the question about Cole refused to fade from her mind.</p><p>They parted outside the restaurant and Frank kissed her cheek, but they were both well aware they wouldn\u2019t be seeing each other again. Their time together had been a brief respite. It had helped Frank deal with his loneliness and helped Robin understand what was troubling her about Cole.</p><p>The first thing Robin noticed when she pulled into her driveway was that Cole\u2019s house was dark. Dark and silent. Lonely. So much of her life had been like that\u2014before she\u2019d met him.</p><p>She needed to talk to him. She wanted to ask about his phone call. She wanted to ask about his wife and the son he\u2019d lost. But the timing was all wrong.</p><p>For a long moment Robin sat alone in her car, feeling both sad and disappointed.</p><p>Heather greeted her with a smile and a finger pressed to her lips. \u201cBoth kids were exhausted. They fell asleep in the living room almost as soon as we got back.\u201d</p><p>After Jeff\u2019s busy day, she could hardly believe he\u2019d lasted through the movie. \u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least,\u201d Heather assured her.</p><p>Robin yawned, completely exhausted. She wanted nothing more than to escape to her room and sleep until noon the following day.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee before you go?\u201d Heather asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Robin had been blessed with good neighbors. Heather on her right and Cole on her left....</p><p>Together Robin and Heather woke Jeff, who grumbled about his mother being late. He was too drowsy to realize it was only nine-thirty or that she\u2019d returned ahead of schedule.</p><p>After telling Heather a little about her evening, Robin guided her son across the yard and into the house. She walked upstairs with him and answered the slurred questions he struggled to ask between wide, mouth-stretching yawns.</p><p>Tugging back his quilt, Robin urged him into his bed. Jeff kicked off his shoes and reached for the quilt. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d slept in his clothes and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>Smiling to herself, Robin moved quietly down the stairs.</p><p>On impulse, she paused in the kitchen and picked up the phone. When Cole answered on the first ring, she swallowed a gasp of surprise.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said a second time.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you lie about?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Without a further word, he hung up.</p><p>A minute later, Cole was standing at her front door, hands in his back pockets. He stared at her as if it had been months since they\u2019d seen each other.</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d he said, edging his way in.</p><p>\u201cWin what? The door prize?\u201d she asked, controlling her amusement with difficulty.</p><p>Not bothering to answer her, Cole stalked to the kitchen, where he sank down in one of the pine chairs. \u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d</p><p>She sat down across from him. \u201cI really did. Frank\u2019s a very pleasant, very caring man. We met at the Higher Ground\u2014that\u2019s a cute little restaurant close to the BART station and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your phone call earlier. You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Frank?\u201d</p><p>Cole gave her a look that suggested she have her intelligence tested.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, he\u2019s very pleasant. Divorced and lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works for the city, I think. We didn\u2019t get around to talking about our careers.\u201d No doubt Cole would be shocked if he knew she\u2019d spent the greater part of the evening discussing her relationship with him!</p><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole, honestly, I don\u2019t think we should discuss my evening with Frank. Would you like some coffee? I\u2019ll make decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see him again?\u201d</p><p>Robin ignored the question. Instead she left the table and began to make coffee. She was concentrating so carefully on her task that she didn\u2019t notice Cole was directly behind her. She turned\u2014and found herself gazing into the darkest, most confused and frustrated pair of eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were so close.\u201d</p><p>His hands gripped her shoulders. \u201cWhy did you go out with him?\u201d</p><p>Surely that wasn\u2019t distress she heard in Cole\u2019s voice? Not after all that casual indifference this afternoon. She frowned, bewildered by the pain she saw in his eyes. And she finally understood. Contrary to everything he\u2019d claimed, Cole was jealous. Really and truly jealous.</p><p>\u201cDid he kiss you?\u201d he asked with an urgency, an intensity, she\u2019d never heard in his voice before.</p><p>Robin stared, frozen by the stark need she read in him.</p><p>Cole\u2019s finger rested on her mouth. \u201cDid Frank kiss you?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She shook her head and the motion brushed his finger across her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Cole asked with a brooding frown.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kiss me.\u201d She was finally able to say the words. She couldn\u2019t kiss Frank or anyone else. The only man she wanted to kiss and be kissed by was the man looking down at her now. The man whose lips were descending on hers....</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cSo, did you like this guy you had dinner with last night?\u201d Jeff asked, keeping his eyes on his bowl of cold cereal.</p><p>\u201cHe was nice,\u201d Robin answered, pouring herself a cup of coffee and joining him at the table. They\u2019d slept late and were spending a lazy Sunday morning enjoying their breakfast before going to the eleven o\u2019clock service at church.</p><p>Jeff hesitated, his spoon poised in front of him. \u201cIs he nicer than Cole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole\u2019s...nicer,\u201d Robin admitted reluctantly. Nice and nicer weren\u2019t terms she would\u2019ve used to describe the differences between Frank and Cole, but in her son\u2019s ten-year-old mind they made perfect sense.</p><p>A smile quivered at the edges of Jeff\u2019s mouth. \u201cI saw you two smooching last night,\u201d he said, grinning broadly.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Robin demanded\u2014a ridiculous question. It could only have happened when Cole had come over to talk to her. He\u2019d confessed how jealous he\u2019d been of Frank and how he\u2019d struggled with the emotion and felt like a fool. Robin had been convinced she was the one who\u2019d behaved like an idiot. Before either of them could prevent it, they were in each other\u2019s arms, seeking and granting reassurance.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was asleep, but I heard Cole talking and I wanted to ask him what he was gonna do about you and this other guy, so I came downstairs and saw you two with your faces stuck together.\u201d</p><p>The boy certainly had a way with words.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look like you minded, either. Cole and me talked about girls once, and he said they aren\u2019t much when they\u2019re ten, but they get a whole lot more interesting later on. He said girls are like green apples. At first they\u2019re all sour and make your lips pucker, but a little while later they\u2019re real good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Robin muttered, not at all sure she liked being compared to an apple.</p><p>\u201cBut when I got downstairs I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cbecause, well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded and sipped her coffee in an effort to hide her discomfort.</p><p>Jeff picked up his cereal bowl and drank the remainder of the milk in loud gulps. He wiped the back of his hand across his lips. \u201cI suppose this means you\u2019re going to have a baby now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robin was too horrified to speak. The swallow of coffee got stuck in her throat and she started choking. Trying to help her breathe, Jeff pounded her back with his fist, which only added to her misery.</p><p>By the time she caught her breath, tears were streaking down her face.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Mom?\u201d Jeff asked, his eyes wide with concern. He rushed into the bathroom and returned with a wad of tissue.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, wiping her face. It took her a moment or two to regain her composure. This was a talk she\u2019d planned on having with him soon\u2014but not quite yet. \u201cJeff, listen...kissing doesn\u2019t make babies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t? But I thought...I hoped...You mean you won\u2019t be having a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...Not from kissing,\u201d she whispered, taking in deep breaths to stabilize her pulse.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the next thing you\u2019re gonna tell me is we\u2019ll have to save up for a baby the way we did for the house and now the fence before we get me a dog.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was getting too complicated. \u201cNo, we wouldn\u2019t have to save for a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the holdup?\u201d her son demanded. \u201cI like the idea of being a big brother. I didn\u2019t think much about it until we moved here. Then when we were having dinner at the Chinese restaurant I heard this grandma and grandpa in the booth next to us talking, and they were saying neat things about us being a family. That\u2019s when I started thinking about babies and stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin said, rubbing her hands together as she collected her thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that. Before there\u2019s a baby, there should be a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d Jeff returned, looking at her as if she\u2019d insulted his intelligence. \u201cYou\u2019d have to marry Cole first, but that\u2019d be all right with me. You like him, don\u2019t you? You must like him or you wouldn\u2019t be kissing him that way.\u201d</p><p>Robin sighed. Of course she liked Cole, but it wasn\u2019t that simple. Unfortunately she wasn\u2019t sure she could explain it in terms a ten-year-old could understand. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember ever seeing you kiss a guy like that. You looked real serious. And when I was sneaking back up the stairs, I heard him ask you to have dinner alone with him tonight and that seemed like a real good sign.\u201d</p><p>The next time Cole kissed her, Robin thought wryly, they\u2019d have to scurry into a closet. The things that child came up with...</p><p>\u201cYou are going to dinner with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? I\u2019ll ask him to marry you if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff!\u201d she cried, leaping to her feet. \u201cAbsolutely not! That\u2019s between Cole and me, and neither of us would appreciate any assistance from you. Is that clearly understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he sighed, but he didn\u2019t look too pleased. He reached for a piece of toast, shredding it into thirds. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to marry him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Cole\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to us.\u201d</p><p>Her son was staring at her intently, his baseball cap twisted around to the back of his head. Now that she had his full attention, Robin couldn\u2019t find the words to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than you realize, sweetie.\u201d She made a show of glancing at the clock. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s time to change and get ready for church.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded and rushed up the stairs. Robin followed at a much slower pace, grateful to put an end to this difficult and embarrassing subject.</p> <p>The minute they were home from the service, Jeff grabbed his baseball mitt. \u201cJimmy Wallach and I are going to the school yard to practice hitting balls. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said absently. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going grocery shopping, so if I\u2019m not home when you get back you know what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Robin Masterson, aren\u2019t you?\u201d a tall middle-aged woman asked as she maneuvered her grocery cart alongside Robin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Robin said. The other woman\u2019s eyes were warm and her smile friendly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you must be\u2014I\u2019ve seen you from a distance. I\u2019m Joyce Wallach. Jimmy and Jeff have become good friends. In fact, they\u2019re at the school yard now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Robin said, pleased to make the other woman\u2019s acquaintance. They\u2019d talked on the phone several times, and she\u2019d met Joyce\u2019s husband once, when Jimmy had spent the night. The boys had wanted to play on the same baseball team and were disappointed when they\u2019d been assigned to different teams. It had been Jimmy who\u2019d told Jeff about the death of Cole\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to invite you to the house for coffee,\u201d Joyce went on to say, \u201cbut I started working part-time and I can\u2019t seem to get myself organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Working full-time, keeping up with Jeff and her home was about all Robin could manage herself. She didn\u2019t know how other mothers were able to accomplish so much.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place to sit down here,\u201d Joyce said, and her eyes brightened at the idea. \u201cDo you have time to chat now?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cSure. I\u2019ve been wanting to meet you, too.\u201d The Wallachs lived two streets over, and Robin fully approved of Jimmy as a friend for Jeff. He and Kelly had become friends, too, but her ten-year-old son wasn\u2019t as eager to admit being buddies with a girl. Kelly was still a green apple in Jeff\u2019s eye, but the time would come when he\u2019d appreciate having her next door.</p><p>\u201cI understand Jeff\u2019s quite the baseball player,\u201d Joyce said at the self-service counter.</p><p>Robin smiled. She poured herself a plastic cup of iced tea and paid for it. \u201cJeff really loves baseball. He was disappointed he couldn\u2019t play with Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey separate the teams according to the kid\u2019s year of birth. Jimmy\u2019s birthday is in January so he\u2019s with another group.\u201d She frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t really make much sense, does it?\u201d She chuckled, and Robin couldn\u2019t help responding to the soft infectious sound of Joyce\u2019s laughter. She found herself laughing, too.</p><p>They pulled out chairs at one of the small tables in the supermarket\u2019s deli section.</p><p>\u201cI feel like throwing my arms around you,\u201d Joyce said with a grin. \u201cI saw Cole Camden at Balboa Park the other day and I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. It was like seeing him ten years ago, the way he used to be.\u201d She glanced at Robin. \u201cJeff was with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole came to his first game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She nodded slowly, as if that explained it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s told you, but there\u2019s been a marked difference in Cole lately. I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to see it. Cole\u2019s gone through so much heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole\u2019s been wonderful for Jeff,\u201d Robin said, then swallowed hard. She felt a renewed stab of fear that Cole was more interested in the idea of having a son than he was in a relationship with her.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling you\u2019ve both been wonderful for him,\u201d Joyce added.</p><p>Robin\u2019s smile was losing its conviction. She lowered her eyes and studied the lemon slice floating in her tea.</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I knew Cole quite well before the divorce,\u201d Joyce went on to say. \u201cLarry, that\u2019s my husband, and Cole played golf every Saturday afternoon. Then Jennifer decided she wanted out of the marriage, left him and took Bobby. Cole really tried to save that marriage, but the relationship had been in trouble for a long time. Cole doted on his son, though\u2014he would\u2019ve done anything to spare Bobby the trauma of a divorce. Jennifer, however\u2014\u201d Joyce halted abruptly, apparently realizing how much she\u2019d said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to launch into all of this\u2014it\u2019s ancient history. I just wanted you to know how pleased I am to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Since Cole had told her shockingly little of his past, Robin had to bite her tongue not to plead with Joyce to continue. Instead, she bowed her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>Then she looked up with a smile as Joyce said, \u201cJimmy\u2019s finally got the friend he\u2019s always wanted. There are so few boys his age around here. I swear my son was ready to set off fireworks the day Jeff registered at the school and he learned you lived only two blocks away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff claimed he couldn\u2019t live in a house that\u2019s surrounded by girls.\u201d Robin shook her head with a mock grimace. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t met Jimmy, I might\u2019ve had a mutiny on my hands.\u201d</p><p>Joyce\u2019s face relaxed into another warm smile. She was energetic and animated, gesturing freely with her hands as she spoke. Robin felt as if she\u2019d known and liked Jimmy\u2019s mother for years.</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much turnover in this neighborhood. We\u2019re a close-knit group, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve discovered. Heather Lawrence is a real sweetie. I wish I had more time to get to know her. And Cole, well...I realize that huge house has been in his family forever, but I half expected him to move out after Jennifer and Bobby were killed.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed was punctuated by Robin\u2019s soft, involuntary gasp. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I couldn\u2019t understand why Cole\u2019s still living in the house on Orchard Street. Is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, after that\u2014about Jennifer and Bobby.\u201d It was difficult for Robin to speak. Each word felt as if it had been scraped from the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI assumed you knew they\u2019d both been killed,\u201d Joyce said, her eyes full of concern. \u201cI mean, I thought for sure that Cole had told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew about Bobby. Jimmy said something to Jeff, who told me, but I didn\u2019t have any idea that Jennifer had died, too. Heather Lawrence told me about the divorce, but she didn\u2019t say anything about Cole\u2019s wife dying....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Heather knows. She moved into the neighborhood long after the divorce, and Cole\u2019s pretty close-mouthed about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did all this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive or six years ago now. It was terribly tragic,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cJust thinking about it makes my heart ache all over again. I don\u2019t mean to be telling tales, but if there\u2019s any blame to be placed I\u2019m afraid it would fall on Jennifer. She wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who\u2019s easy to know or like. I shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead, and I don\u2019t mean to be catty, but Jen did Cole a favor when she left him. Naturally, he didn\u2019t see it that way\u2014he was in love with his wife and crazy about his son. Frankly, I think Cole turned a blind eye to his wife\u2019s faults because of Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Perhaps having a neighbor fill in the details of Cole\u2019s life was the wrong thing to do; Robin no longer knew. Cole had never said a word to her about Jennifer or Bobby, and she didn\u2019t know if he ever would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJen was never satisfied with Cole\u2019s position as a city attorney,\u201d Joyce explained. \u201cWe\u2019d have coffee together every now and then, and all she\u2019d do was complain how Cole was wasting his talents and that he could be making big money and wasn\u2019t. She had grander plans for him. But Cole loved his job and felt an obligation to follow through with his commitments. Jennifer never understood that. She didn\u2019t even try to sympathize with Cole\u2019s point of view. She constantly wanted more, better, newer things. She didn\u2019t work herself, so it was all up to Cole.\u201d Joyce shrugged sadly.</p><p>\u201cJen was never happy, never satisfied,\u201d she went on. \u201cShe hated the house and the neighborhood, but figured out that all the whining and manipulating in the world wasn\u2019t going to do one bit of good. Cole intended to finish out his responsibilities to the city, so she played her ace. She left him, taking Bobby with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t Cole try to gain custody of Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He knew, and so did everyone else, that Jennifer was using their son as a pawn. She was never the motherly type, if you know what I mean. If you want the truth, she was an alcoholic. There were several times I dropped Bobby off at the house and suspected Jen had been drinking heavily. I was willing to testify on Cole\u2019s behalf, and I told him so. He was grateful, but then the accident happened and it was too late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe accident?\u201d A heaviness settled in her chest. Each breath pained her and brought with it the memories she longed to forget, memories of another accident\u2014the one that had taken her husband.</p><p>\u201cIt was Jennifer\u2019s fault\u2014the accident, I mean. She\u2019d been drinking and should never have been behind the wheel. The day before, Cole had been to see his attorneys, pleading with them to move quickly because he was afraid Jennifer was becoming more and more irresponsible. But it wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d moved out that Cole realized how sick she\u2019d become, how dependent she was on alcohol to make it through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Robin whispered. \u201cCole must\u2019ve felt so guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Joyce returned, her voice quavering. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if Cole would survive that first year. He hid inside the house and severed relationships with everyone in the neighborhood. He was consumed by his grief. Later he seemed to come out of it a little, but he\u2019s never been the same.</p><p>\u201cThe irony of all this is that eventually Jen would\u2019ve gotten exactly what she wanted if she\u2019d been more patient. A couple of years ago, Cole accepted a partnership in one of the most important law firms in the city. He\u2019s made a real name for himself, but money and position don\u2019t seem to mean much to him\u2014they never have. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he walked away from the whole thing someday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right. Cole told me not long ago that he has some property north of here that he inherited from his grandfather. He\u2019s restoring the house, and he said something about moving there. It\u2019s where he spends most of his weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if that was it,\u201d Joyce said, nodding. \u201cThere were rumors floating around the neighborhood that he spent his weekends with a woman. Anyone who knew Cole would realize what a crock that is. Cole isn\u2019t the type to have a secret affair.\u201d</p><p>Robin felt ashamed, remembering how she\u2019d been tempted to believe the rumor herself.</p><p>\u201cFor a long time,\u201d Joyce murmured, \u201cI wondered if Cole was ever going to recover from Jennifer\u2019s and Bobby\u2019s deaths, but now I believe he has. I can\u2019t help thinking you and Jeff had a lot to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...think he would gradually have come out of his shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but the changes in him lately have been the most encouraging things so far. I don\u2019t know how you feel about Cole or if there\u2019s anything between you, but you couldn\u2019t find a better man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...I\u2019m falling in love with him,\u201d Robin whispered, voicing her feelings for the first time. The words hung there, and it was too late to take them back.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s absolutely wonderful, I really do!\u201d Joyce said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Now that the shock had worn off, Robin was forced to confront her anger. Cole had told her none of this. Not a single word. That hurt. Hurt more than she would\u2019ve expected. But the ache she felt was nothing compared to the grief Cole must face each morning, the pain that weighed down his life.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cI\u2019ve really done it now, haven\u2019t I? I knew I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. You\u2019re upset and it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Robin whispered, making an effort to bring a smile to her dry lips and not succeeding. \u201cI\u2019m grateful we met, and more than grateful you told me about Jennifer, and about Cole\u2019s son.\u201d The knowledge produced a dull ache in Robin\u2019s heart. She felt grief for Cole and a less worthy emotion, too\u2014a sense of being slighted by his lack of trust in her.</p><p>She was so distressed on the short drive home that she missed the turn and had to take a side street and double back to Orchard Street.</p><p>As she neared the house, she saw that Cole was outside watering his lawn. He waved, but she pretended not to see him and pulled into her driveway. Desperate for some time alone before facing Cole, Robin did her best to ignore him as she climbed out of the car. She needed a few more minutes to gather her thoughts and control her emotions.</p><p>She was almost safe, almost at the house, when Cole stopped her.</p> <p>\u201cRobin,\u201d he called, jogging toward her. \u201cHold on a minute, would you?\u201d</p><p>She managed to compose herself, squaring her shoulders and drawing on her dignity.</p><p>His wonderful eyes were smiling as he hurried over. Obviously he hadn\u2019t noticed there was anything wrong. \u201cDid Jeff happen to say anything about seeing us kiss last night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her mouth was still so dry she had to swallow a couple of times before she could utter a single syllable. \u201cYes, but don\u2019t worry, I think I\u2019ve got him squared away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat!\u201d he teased, snapping his fingers. \u201cI suppose this means I don\u2019t have to go through with the shotgun wedding?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, keeping her eyes lowered, fearing he\u2019d be able to read all the emotion churning inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u201d she said, forcing a lightness into her tone.</p><p>\u201cRobin?\u201d He made her name a question and a caress. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, shifting the bag of groceries from one arm to the other. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with the same feigned cheerfulness.</p><p>Cole took the bag from her arms. Robin knew she should have resisted, but she couldn\u2019t; she felt drained of strength. She headed for the house, knowing Cole would follow her inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked a second time, setting the groceries on the kitchen counter.</p><p>It was difficult to speak and even more difficult, more exhausting, to find the words that would explain what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got a lot to do if we\u2019re going out for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear something fancy. I\u2019m taking you to a four-star restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething fancy?\u201d Mentally she reviewed the contents of her closet, which was rather lacking in anything fancy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to be outclassed by Frank,\u201d Cole said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going to wine and dine you and turn your head with sweet nothings.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to do any of those things to turn her head. She was already dangerously close to being in love with him, so close that she\u2019d blurted it out to a woman she\u2019d known for a total of twelve minutes.</p><p>Abruptly switching her attention to the bag of groceries, Robin set several packages on the counter. When Cole\u2019s hands clasped her shoulders, her eyes drifted shut. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Cole turned her around to face him. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dinner, the wine, the...sweet nothings.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes held. As if choreographed, they moved into each other\u2019s arms. With a groan that came from deep in his throat, Cole kissed her. His hands tangled in the auburn thickness of her hair. His lips settled on hers with fierce protectiveness.</p><p>Robin curled her arms tightly around his neck as her own world started to dip and spin and whirl. She was standing on tiptoe, her heart in her throat, when she heard the front door open.</p><p>Moaning, she dragged her mouth from Cole\u2019s and broke away just as her son strolled into the kitchen.</p><p>Jeff stopped, his brow furrowed, when he saw the two of them in what surely looked like suspicious circumstances.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. Hi, Cole.\u201d He went casually to the refrigerator and yanked open the door. \u201cAnything decent to drink around this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d Robin suggested.</p><p>Jeff rolled his eyes. \u201cFunny, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few more sacks of groceries in the car. Would you get them for me?\u201d He threw her a disgruntled look, until Robin added, \u201cYou\u2019ll find a six-pack of soda in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He raced out of the house and returned a minute later, carrying one sack and sorting through its contents as he walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Cole said, placing his hand on Jeff\u2019s shoulder. He glanced at Robin and his eyes told her they\u2019d continue their discussion at a more opportune moment.</p><p>Robin started emptying the sacks, hardly paying attention as Jeff and Cole brought in the last couple of bags. Cole told her he\u2019d pick her up at six, then left.</p><p>\u201cCan I play with Blackie for a while?\u201d Jeff asked her, a can of cold soda clenched in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Robin answered, grateful to have a few minutes alone.</p><p>Robin cleared the counters and made Jeff a sandwich for his lunch. He must\u2019ve become involved in his game with Cole\u2019s dog because he didn\u2019t rush in announcing he was hungry.</p><p>She went outside to stand on her small front porch and smiled as she watched Jeff and Blackie. Her son really had a way with animals\u2014like his father. Every time Robin saw him play with Cole\u2019s Labrador, she marveled at how attuned they were to each other.</p><p>She smiled when she realized Cole was outside, too; he\u2019d just finished watering his lawn.</p><p>\u201cJeff, I made a sandwich for you,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. Hey, Mom, watch,\u201d he yelled as he tossed a ball across the lawn. Blackie chased after it, skidding to a stop as he caught the bright red ball.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Blackie,\u201d Jeff urged. \u201cThrow me the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t do that,\u201d Robin said in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cSure, he can. Watch.\u201d</p><p>And just as Jeff had claimed, Blackie leapt into the air, tossed his head and sent the ball shooting into the street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Jeff hollered.</p><p>It was Cole\u2019s reaction that Robin noticed first. A horrified look came over his face and he threw down the hose. He was shouting even as he ran. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like her son, Robin had been so caught up in Blackie\u2019s antics that she hadn\u2019t seen the car barreling down the street, directly in Jeff\u2019s path.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cJeff!\u201d Robin screamed, fear and panic choking her. Her hands flew to her mouth in relief as Cole grabbed Jeff around the waist and swept him out of the path of the speeding car. Together they fell backward onto the wet grass. Robin ran over to them.</p><p>\u201cJeff, how many times have I told you to look before you run into the street? How many times?\u201d Her voice was high and hysterical. \u201cYou deserve the spanking of your life for that stunt!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw the car,\u201d Jeff protested loudly. \u201cI did! I was going to wait for it. Honest.\u201d He struggled to his feet, looking insulted at what he obviously considered an overreaction.</p><p>\u201cGet into the house,\u201d Robin demanded, pointing furiously. She was trembling so badly she could barely speak.</p><p>Jeff brushed the grass from his jeans and raised his head to a dignified angle, then walked toward the house. Not understanding, Blackie followed him, the ball in his mouth, wanting to resume their play.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, boy,\u201d Jeff mumbled just loudly enough for her to hear. \u201cMy mother had some kind of anxiety attack that I\u2019m gonna get punished for.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s recovery was slower than Jeff\u2019s. He sat up and rubbed a hand across his eyes. His face was ashen, his expression stark with terror.</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s all right. Jeff isn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Robin assured him. She slipped to her knees in front of him.</p><p>Cole nodded without looking at her. His eyes went blank and he shook his head, as if to clear his mind.</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d Robin said softly, \u201care you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d He gave her a faint smile, but his eyes remained glazed and distant. He placed one hand over his heart and shook his head again. \u201cFor a minute there I thought Jeff hadn\u2019t seen that car and...I don\u2019t know...If that boy had been hurt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for acting so quickly,\u201d Robin whispered, gratitude filling her heart. She ran her hands down the sides of his face, needing to touch him, seeking a way to comfort him, although her heart ached at his words. So many times over the past few weeks, she\u2019d suspected\u2014and feared\u2014that Cole\u2019s feelings had more to do with replacing the family he\u2019d lost than love for her and Jeff.</p><p>With a shudder, Cole locked his arms around her waist and pulled her close, burying his face in the curve of her neck as he dragged deep gulps of air into his lungs.</p> <p>\u201cCome inside and I\u2019ll get us some coffee,\u201d Robin suggested.</p><p>Cole murmured agreement, but he didn\u2019t seem in any hurry to release her. Nor she him. Her hands were in his hair and she rested her cheek against his, savoring these moments of closeness now that the panic was gone.</p><p>\u201cI lost my son,\u201d Cole whispered and the words seemed to be wrenched from the deepest part of his soul. His voice held an agony only those who had suffered such a loss could understand. \u201cIn a car accident six years ago.\u201d</p><p>Robin kissed the crown of his head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Cole broke away from her, slowly raising his eyes to meet hers. Mingled with profound grief was confusion. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoyce Wallach.\u201d</p><p>Cole closed his eyes. \u201cI could use that coffee.\u201d</p><p>They both stood, and when Cole wrapped his arm around her waist Robin couldn\u2019t be sure if it was to lend support or to offer it.</p> <p>Inside the house, Jeff was sitting at the bottom of the stairs, his knees under his chin. Ever loyal, Blackie lay beside him.</p><p>Jeff looked up when Robin opened the front door. \u201cI saw the car,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re getting upset over nothing. I hope you realize that. Hey, what\u2019s wrong with Cole?\u201d he asked abruptly. He glanced from Robin to their neighbor and then back to his mother. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>In some way, Robin supposed, he had.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, sport?\u201d Cole asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you when we fell, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He bit his lip, eyes lowered.</p><p>Cole frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound all that certain. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded reluctantly. \u201cI will be once I find out what my mother plans to do to me. I really was gonna stop at the curb. Honest.\u201d</p><p>The kid would make an excellent attorney, Robin thought wryly.</p><p>\u201cI think I might\u2019ve overreacted,\u201d Cole said. He held open his arms and Jeff flew into them without a second\u2019s hesitation. Briefly Cole closed his eyes, as though in silent thanksgiving for Jeff\u2019s safety.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d Jeff murmured. \u201cI would\u2019ve stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d Robin said.</p><p>Cole released Jeff and sighed deeply, then looked at Robin. \u201cYou said something about coffee?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get it in a minute. Jeff, you can go outside, but from now on if you\u2019re playing ball with Blackie, do it in the backyard. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom,\u201d her son said eagerly. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d he paused \u201c\u2014you mean that\u2019s it? You aren\u2019t going to ground me or anything? I mean, of course you\u2019re not because I did everything I was supposed to\u2014well, almost everything. Thanks, Mom.\u201d He tossed the red ball in the air and caught it deftly with one hand. \u201cCome on, Blackie, we just got a pardon from the governor.\u201d</p><p>Robin followed the pair into the kitchen and watched as Jeff opened the sliding glass door and raced into the backyard with Blackie in hot pursuit. Reassured, she poured two mugs of coffee while Cole pulled out one of the kitchen chairs. She carried the mugs to the table, then sat down across from him.</p><p>Cole reached for her hand, lacing her fingers with his own. He focused his concentration on their linked hands. \u201cBobby was my son. He died when he was ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s age,\u201d Robin said as a chill surrounded her heart.</p><p>\u201cBobby was so full of life and laughter I couldn\u2019t be around him and not smile.\u201d</p><p>Talking about Bobby was clearly difficult for Cole, and Robin longed to do or say something that would help. But she could think of nothing to ease the agony etched so deeply on his face.</p><p>\u201cHe was the kind of boy every father dreams of having. Inquisitive, sensitive, full of mischief. Gifted with a vivid imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot like Jeff,\u201d she said, and her hands tightened around the mug.</p><p>Cole nodded. \u201cBobby used to tell me I shouldn\u2019t worry about Jennifer\u2014she was my ex-wife\u2014because he, my ten-year-old son, was taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>Robin held her breath as she watched the fierce pain in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me this.\u201d Not if it was going to rip open wounds that weren\u2019t properly healed.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve told you before this,\u201d he said, frowning slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that even now, after all this time, it\u2019s difficult to talk about my son. For a good many years, I felt as though part of me had died with Bobby. The very best part of me. I don\u2019t believe that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff reminds you a lot of Bobby, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Robin doubted Cole fully grasped that he was transferring his love from one boy to the other.</p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. \u201cBobby had a huskier build and was taller than Jeff. His sport was basketball, but he was more of a spectator than a participant. His real love was computers. Had he lived, I think Bobby would have gone into that field. Jen never understood that. She wanted him to be more athletic, and he tried to please her.\u201d Cole\u2019s gaze dropped to his hands. \u201cJennifer and I were divorced before the accident. She died with him. If there\u2019s anything to be grateful for in their deaths, it\u2019s the knowledge that they both went instantly. I couldn\u2019t have stood knowing they\u2019d suffered.\u201d He paused long enough to take a sip of the coffee, and grimaced once. \u201cYou added sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might need it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have so much to thank you for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the afternoon Jeff ran away?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t likely to forget it. With Jeff around, Robin always figured she didn\u2019t need exercise to keep her heart in shape. Her son managed to do it with his antics.</p><p>\u201cI left on a business trip to Seattle soon afterward,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She nodded. That was when Jeff had looked after Blackie for him.</p><p>\u201cLate one afternoon, when the meeting was over and dinner wasn\u2019t scheduled for another couple of hours, I went for a stroll,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt was still light and I found myself on the waterfront. The sky was a vivid blue and the waters green and clear. It\u2019s funny I\u2019d remember that, but it\u2019s all so distinct in my memory. I stood alone on the pier and watched as a ferry headed for one of the islands, cutting a path through the waves. Something brought Bobby to my mind, although he\u2019s never far from my thoughts, even now. The most amazing thing happened that afternoon. It\u2019s difficult to find the words to explain.\u201d He hesitated, as though searching for a way to make Robin understand. Then apparently he gave up the effort and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Robin said in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, standing there at the end of the pier...I don\u2019t know. For the first time since I lost my son, I felt his presence more than I did his absence. It was as if he was there at my side, pointing out the Olympic Mountains and asking questions. Bobby was always full of questions. My heart felt lighter than it had in years\u2014as though the burden of pain and grief had been lifted from my shoulders. For no reason whatsoever, I started to smile. I think I\u2019ve been smiling ever since. And laughing. And feeling.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got back to the hotel, I had the sudden urge to hear your voice. I didn\u2019t have any excuse to call you, so I phoned on the pretense of talking to Jeff and checking up on Blackie. But it was your voice I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>Robin smiled through the unexpected rush of tears, wondering if Cole realized what he was saying. It might\u2019ve been her voice he thought he wanted to hear, but it was Jeff he\u2019d called.</p><p>\u201cI discovered a new freedom on that Seattle pier. It was as if, in that moment, I was released from the past. I can\u2019t say exactly what changed. Meeting you and Jeff played a big role in it, I recognize that much, but it was more than that. It was as if something deep inside me was willing to admit that it was finally time to let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad for you,\u201d Robin whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, I never allowed myself to grieve properly or deal with the anger I felt toward Jennifer. She was driving at the time and the accident was her fault. Yet deep in my heart I know she\u2019d never purposely have done anything to hurt Bobby. She loved him as much as I did. He was her son, too.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I met you that I knew I had to forgive her. I was never the kind of husband she needed and I\u2019m afraid I was a disappointment to her. Only in the last few years of our marriage was I willing to accept that she suffered from a serious emotional and mental illness. Her addiction to alcohol was as much a disease as cancer. I didn\u2019t understand her illness, and because of that we all suffered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself,\u201d Robin said, but she doubted Cole even heard her.</p><p>\u201cAfter the accident, the anger and the grief were a constant gnawing pain. I refused to acknowledge or deal with either emotion. Over the years, instead of healing, I let the agony of my loss grow more intense. I closed myself off from friends and colleagues and threw myself into work, spending far more time in the office than I did at home. Blackie was virtually my only companion. And then a few years ago I started working on my place in the country. But the pleasure that gave me came from hard physical work, the kind that leaves you too tired to think.\u201d His features softened and he smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten what it was like to fly a kite or laze in the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you suggested the picnic with Jeff and me?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and his dark eyes seemed almost boyish. \u201cThe last time I was in Golden Gate Park was with Bobby, shortly before the accident. Deciding to have a picnic there was a giant step for me. I half expected to feel pangs of grief, if not a full-blown assault. Instead I experienced joy\u2014and appreciation for the renewal I felt. Laughter is a gift I\u2019d forgotten. You and Jeff helped me see that, as well.\u201d</p> <p>Everything Cole was saying confirmed her worst fears.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Jeff roared into the kitchen with Blackie at his heels. \u201cIs there anything to eat? Are you guys still going out to dinner? I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d bring me, would you?\u201d</p><p>Cole chuckled, then leapt to his feet to playfully muss Jeff\u2019s hair. \u201cNot this time, sport. Tonight\u2019s for your mother and me.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, as Robin stood in front of the bathroom mirror, she had her reservations about this dinner date. She was falling in love with a man who hadn\u2019t fully dealt with the pain of losing his wife and his son. Perhaps she recognized it in Cole because she saw the same thing in herself. She loved Lenny and always would. He\u2019d died years ago, and she still found herself talking to him, refusing to involve herself in another relationship. A part of her continued to grieve and she suspected it always would.</p><p>Examining herself in the mirror, Robin surveyed her calf-length skirt of soft blue velvet and white silk blouse with a pearl necklace.</p> <p>She was fussing with her hair, pinning one side back with combs and studying the effect, when Jeff wandered in. He leaned casually against the doorway, a bag of potato chips in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, you look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d She decided she\u2019d spent enough time on her hair and fastened her pearl earrings. Jeff was disappointed about not joining them, but he\u2019d been a good sport\u2014especially after Cole promised him lunch at a fish-and-chip place on the Wharf the following Saturday.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing your pearls,\u201d Jeff mumbled, his mouth full.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Robin said, turning to face him. \u201cDo they look all right?\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s halfhearted shrug didn\u2019t do a lot to boost Robin\u2019s confidence. \u201cI suppose. I don\u2019t know about stuff like that. Mrs. Lawrence could probably tell you.\u201d He popped another potato chip in his mouth and crunched loudly. \u201cMy dad gave you those earrings, didn\u2019t he? And the necklace?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor our first wedding anniversary.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cI thought so.\u201d His look grew reflective. \u201cWhen I grow up and get married, will I do mushy stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Robin said, not bothering to disguise her amusement. \u201cAnd lots of other things, too. Like taking your wife out to dinner and telling her how beautiful she is and how much you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck!\u201d Jeff wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou really know how to ruin a guy\u2019s appetite.\u201d With that he turned to march down the stairs, taking his potato chips with him.</p><p>Robin stood at the top of the staircase. \u201cCole will be here any minute, so you can go over to Kelly\u2019s now,\u201d she called down.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I put my plate in the dishwasher. Is there anything you want me to tell Kelly\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that I won\u2019t be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can\u2019t come with you?\u201d Jeff tried one more time.</p> <p>Robin didn\u2019t give him an answer, knowing he didn\u2019t really expect one. After a moment, Jeff grumbled, more for show than anything, then went out the front door to their neighbor\u2019s.</p><p>Robin returned to the bathroom and smiled into the mirror, picturing Jeff several years into the future and seeing Lenny\u2019s handsome face smiling back at her. She was warmed by the image, certain that her son would grow into as fine a young man as his father had been.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m wearing the pearls for Cole, do you?\u201d she asked her dead husband, although she knew he wouldn\u2019t have objected. She ran the tips of her fingers over the earrings, feeling reassured.</p><p>The doorbell chimed just as Robin was dabbing perfume on her wrists. She drew in a calming breath, glanced quickly at her reflection one last time, then walked down the stairs to answer the door.</p><p>Cole was dressed in a black pin-striped suit and looked so handsome that her breath caught. He smiled as she let him in, but for the life of her she couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say.</p><p>His eyes held hers as he reached for her hands. Slowly he lowered his gaze, taking in the way she\u2019d styled her hair, the pearl necklace and the outfit she\u2019d chosen with such care.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking the same about you,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>His mouth tilted in a grin. \u201cIf I kiss you, will it ruin your lipstick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you, anyway,\u201d he said in a husky murmur. Tenderly he fit his mouth to hers, slipping his fingers through her hair. The kiss was gentle and thorough and slow. A single kiss, and she was like clay ready to be molded. The realization struck her hard\u2014when Cole touched her, Robin felt alive all the way to the soles of her feet. Alive. Healthy. A red-blooded woman. He released her, and she was shocked to find she was trembling. From the inside out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mussed your hair,\u201d he apologized. His hands slid under the soft cloud of hair to her nape.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got lipstick on your mouth,\u201d she said with a quaver, reaching up to wipe it away. \u201cThere. It\u2019ll only take me a moment to fix my hair,\u201d she said, picking up her purse and moving to the hallway mirror.</p><p>He stood behind her, hands on her shoulders as she brushed her hair, then carefully tucked the loose curls back into place with the tortoiseshell combs.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked when she\u2019d finished.</p><p>Robin nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>Cole led her outside to his car and held the passenger door. He dropped a quick kiss on her unsuspecting lips, then hurried around the car, his movements lighthearted, and got into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re having dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Heather Lawrence in case she needs to get hold of you, but otherwise it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Robin wasn\u2019t sure what to think. A number of San Francisco\u2019s restaurants were internationally famous, but her knowledge of fancy dining places was limited. She assumed this one was somewhere in the heart of the city, until he exited from the freeway heading south along Highway 101 toward the ocean.</p><p>\u201cCole?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, casting her a swift glance that didn\u2019t conceal the mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \u201cI promise you dinner will be worth the drive.\u201d</p><p>The restaurant sat high on a cliff, with a stunning view of the surf battering the jagged rocks below.</p><p>Cole parked the Porsche, then came around to help her out, taking the opportunity to steal another kiss. It was with obvious reluctance that he let her go. His arm around her waist, he directed her toward the doors leading into the elegant restaurant. The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 escorted them to a table that overlooked the water and with a flourish presented them with elaborate menus.</p><p>Robin scanned the entr\u00e9es, impressed with the interesting variations on basic themes. She was less impressed with the prices\u2014a single dinner cost as much as an entire week\u2019s worth of lunches. For her and Jeff.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said fancy you weren\u2019t joking, were you?\u201d she whispered, biting her lip.</p><p>Cole lowered his menu and sent her a vibrant smile. \u201cTonight is special,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. If I wasn\u2019t having dinner with you, I\u2019d probably have eaten a toasted cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup with Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Their waiter appeared and they ordered wine\u2014a bottle of sauvignon blanc. Then they each chose the restaurant\u2019s specialty\u2014a scallop and shrimp saut\u00e9\u2014which proved as succulent and spicy as the menu had promised.</p><p>They talked through dinner and afterward, over steaming cups of Irish coffee. It astonished Robin that they had so much to say to each other, although they hadn\u2019t touched on the issue closest to her heart. But she hesitated to broach the subject of Cole\u2019s relationship with Jeff. She didn\u2019t want to risk the delightful camaraderie they were sharing tonight. Their conversation could have gone on for hours and in fact did. They talked about books they\u2019d read, recent movies they\u2019d seen, music they liked. It came as a pleasant surprise to discover that their tastes were similar.</p><p>All evening they laughed, they argued, they talked, as if they\u2019d been friends most of their lives. Cole grinned so often, it was hard for Robin to remember that at one time she\u2019d actually wondered if the man ever smiled.</p><p>Robin told Cole about her job and how much she enjoyed accounting. She voiced her fears about not being the kind of mother she wanted to be for Jeff. \u201cThere are so many things I want to share with him that I don\u2019t have time for. There just aren\u2019t enough hours in a day.\u201d</p><p>Cole talked about his career goals and his dreams. He spoke of the forty acres willed to him by his grandfather and how he\u2019d once hoped to close himself off from the world by moving there.</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t going to now?\u201d Robin asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I no longer have any reason to hide. The house is nearly finished and I may still move there, but I\u2019ll maintain my work schedule.\u201d He stared down into his coffee. \u201cI was approached last week about running for the state senate.\u201d</p><p>Robin\u2019s heart swelled with pride. \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not the right man for politics. I\u2019ll support someone else, but a political career doesn\u2019t interest me. It never has, although I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>A band started playing then, and several couples took to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Cole asked, nodding in that direction.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cole, I don\u2019t know. The last time I danced was at my cousin\u2019s wedding ten years ago. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll step all over your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game if you are.\u201d</p><p>She was reluctant but agreed to try. They stood, and she moved naturally into his embrace, as if they\u2019d been partners for years. Robin\u2019s eyes slowly closed when Cole folded her in his arms, and in that moment she experienced a surge of joy that startled her with its intensity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dance ended, but they didn\u2019t leave the floor.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how lovely you are?\u201d Cole asked, his mouth close to her ear.</p><p>Grinning, Robin nodded. \u201cTwice. Once when you picked me up at the house and once during the meal. I know you\u2019re exaggerating, but...\u201d She shrugged, then added, \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I feel beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a woman\u2019s ever paid me a higher compliment.\u201d</p> <p>She raised her eyes and was shocked by the powerful emotions in his.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we leave now?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIf it was up to me I\u2019d spend the rest of the night here with you in my arms, but I have this sudden need to kiss you, and if I do it here and do it properly we\u2019re going to attract a lot of attention.\u201d</p><p>Cole quickly paid the bill and he hurried Robin to the car. The minute they were settled inside, he reached for her. He did as he\u2019d promised, kissing her until she was breathless. Her arms clung to him as his mouth sought hers once more.</p> <p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not making you cry this time,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThat still embarrasses me,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened before. I still don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t know if I ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt touched me in a way I can\u2019t explain. It helped me realize I was going to love you. After Jennifer and Bobby, I doubted there was any love left in me. You taught me otherwise. Jeff taught me otherwise. My heart is full and has been almost from the time we met.\u201d He took her hand and pressed her palm to his heart. \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s beating so hard,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous? About what?\u201d</p><p>Cole slid a hand into his pocket and brought out a small black velvet box.</p><p>Robin\u2019s heart started to pound in double time. \u201cCole?\u201d she said anxiously, not sure what she should think or how she should act.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Robin.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cI knew it the moment I heard your voice when I called from Seattle. And every moment since has convinced me how right this is.\u201d He opened the box and revealed the largest diamond Robin had ever seen. Slowly he raised his eyes to hers. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cYou mean this whole evening...you arranged this whole evening because you intended to ask me to marry you?\u201d Robin asked, pressing the tips of her fingers to her trembling lips. Despite her fears a gentle gladness suffused her heart.</p><p>\u201cSurely it isn\u2019t that much of a surprise?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never made an effort to hide how I feel about you or how much I enjoy Jeff.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to what Cole might think, his proposal did come as a surprise. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA simple yes would suit me,\u201d Cole urged warmly.</p><p>\u201cBut...Oh, Cole, it would be so easy to marry you, so easy to join my life and Jeff\u2019s to yours and never look back. But I don\u2019t know if it would be right for us or for you. There\u2019s so much to consider, so many factors to weigh, in a decision this important. I\u2019d like nothing better than to just say yes, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking for time?\u201d Cole\u2019s eyes seemed to penetrate hers, even in the dark.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d For now, that seemed the simplest thing to say, although her hesitation was based on something much deeper. Cole had rediscovered a peace within himself since meeting her and Jeff; he\u2019d told her so that very afternoon. She was tempted to say yes, to turn away from her doubts and agree to marry him. Cole had been so good for Jeff, so wonderful to her.</p><p>\u201cI hate to disappoint you,\u201d she murmured sadly.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re thinking, exactly how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Somehow she doubted it. But knowing she couldn\u2019t delay it any longer, she jumped in with both feet. \u201cI was...just thinking about what you told me this afternoon. How you\u2019d recently dealt with the loss of Jennifer and Bobby. While you were talking, I couldn\u2019t help feeling your exhilaration. You\u2019ve obviously found a newborn sense of freedom. I think the question you need to ask yourself is if this rebirth you\u2019ve experienced is what prompted the idea of marrying again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cFalling in love with you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cole,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt must seem like fate to have Jeff and me move in next door, and it gets more complicated with Jeff being the same age as Bobby....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it does all appear too convenient, but if I was just looking for a woman and a child, then Heather Lawrence would\u2019ve filled the bill. It\u2019s you I fell in love with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can you be so sure?\u201d she countered quickly. \u201cWe barely know each other.\u201d</p><p>Cole smiled at her doubts. \u201cThe first time we kissed was enough to convince me I was going to love you. It was the Friday night after I returned from Seattle, remember?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded, wincing a little.</p><p>\u201cI was so stunned by the effect that kiss had on me, I avoided you for an entire week afterward. If you want the truth, I was terrified. You\u2019ll have to remember, up until that time I was convinced I was incapable of ever falling in love again. One kiss, and I felt jolted to the core. You hit me hard, Robin, and I needed time to step back and analyze what was happening. That\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t have any qualms about giving you however long you need to sort out what you\u2019re feeling. I want you to be very sure.\u201d</p><p>Robin released a pent-up sigh. Cole folded her in his arms and his chin brushed against her hair while his hands roved in wide circles across her back. The action was soothing and gentle. She was beginning to feel more confident in his love, but she had to be careful. She wanted him to love her, because she was so much in love with him.</p><p>Cole tucked a finger under her chin and lifted her face to his. As their eyes met, he slanted his mouth over hers in a wildly possessive kiss, a kiss filled with undisguised need.</p><p>When he broke away, Robin was trembling. She buried her face in his neck and drew several deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take some time to think about things,\u201d Cole whispered against her hair, \u201cthen I wanted to give you something else to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had a chance to check those figures on\u2014\u201d Angela began, then stopped abruptly, waving her hand in front of Robin\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cA chance to check what figures?\u201d Robin asked, making a determined effort to focus. She knew she\u2019d been acting like a sleepwalker most of the morning, but she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Cole\u2019s proposal.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you today?\u201d Angela demanded. \u201cEvery time I look over here, I find you staring into space with this perplexed expression on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...just thinking,\u201d Robin muttered.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, girl, you know better than that. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d Angela leaned against the edge of Robin\u2019s desk and crossed her arms, taking her usual aggressive stance. \u201cI\u2019ve known you far too long. From everything you haven\u2019t said, I\u2019d guess your handsome neighbor\u2019s involved. What\u2019s he done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole? What makes you ask anything so ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>Angela frowned, shaking her head. Then she stretched out her hands and made a come-hither motion. \u201cTell Mama everything,\u201d she intoned. \u201cYou might as well get it over with and tell me now, because you know that sooner or later I\u2019m going to drag it out of you. What kind of friend would I be if I didn\u2019t extract your deepest darkest secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me to dinner,\u201d Robin admitted, knowing that Angela was right. Sooner or later, she\u2019d wheedle it out of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he take you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, wanting to keep that to herself. \u201cIt was outside the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere outside the city?\u201d Angela pressed.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, I don\u2019t know. Somewhere along the coast on Highway 101.\u201d</p><p>Angela uncrossed her arms and started pacing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Cliffhouse, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think it might have been,\u201d Robin murmured, concentrating on the task in front of her. The one she should\u2019ve finished hours earlier. The one she couldn\u2019t seem to focus on, even now.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d Angela cried, pointing her index finger at the ceiling, like a detective in a comic spoof.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Robin cried.</p><p>\u201cIf Cole took you to the Cliffhouse, he did it for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. The food was fabulous. By the way, you were right about Frank, he\u2019s exceptionally nice,\u201d Robin said in an effort to interrupt her friend\u2019s line of thought.</p><p>\u201cYou already told me what you think of Frank, remember?\u201d Angela said. \u201cCole took you to dinner at the Cliffhouse,\u201d she repeated slowly, as though reviewing a vital clue in a murder mystery.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I think his choice of restaurant had something to do with Frank,\u201d Robin inserted, tossing her sleuth friend a red herring.</p><p>\u201cSo Cole was jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Robin said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cWell, maybe a little,\u201d she amended, knowing Angela would never believe her if she denied it completely. \u201cI mean, Cole did invite me to dinner as soon as he learned I was dining with Frank, so I guess you could say he was a little jealous. But not much. Cole\u2019s not the jealous type\u2014he told me that himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Angela was frowning as she walked back to her desk. Her look remained thoughtful for the rest of the morning, although she didn\u2019t question Robin again. But when they left for lunch, she showed a renewed interest in the subject of Cole.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jeff?\u201d she began as they stood in line in the employees cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Robin said as she reached for a plastic tray.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask about Jeff once a week or so, then sit back and listen for the next fifteen minutes while you tell me about the latest craziness,\u201d Angela said heatedly. \u201cIt never fails. You\u2019ve told me about him running away with a frying pan and an atlas. You\u2019ve bragged about what a fabulous pitcher he\u2019s turning out to be, and you\u2019ve given me a multitude of details about every game he\u2019s played. After you tell me all about his athletic ability, you generally mention how good he is with animals and all the tricks he\u2019s taught Blackie in the past week.\u201d</p><p>Robin tried to respond but Angela ignored her and kept talking. \u201cToday I innocently ask how Jeff is, and what do I get? Fine. All right, Robin, tell me what happened with Cole Camden before I go crazy trying to figure it out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I need to figure out myself,\u201d Robin said. She paused to study the salads before selecting a mound of cottage cheese and setting it on her tray.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d Angela cried, throwing her arms in the air. \u201cYou hate cottage cheese. You never eat it unless you\u2019re upset and looking for ways to punish yourself.\u201d She took the small bowl from Robin\u2019s tray and replaced it with a fresh fruit salad, shaking her head the entire time.</p><p>The problem with Angela was that she knew Robin all too well.</p><p>They progressed a little farther down the line. Robin stood in front of the entr\u00e9es, but before she chose one, she glanced at her friend. \u201cYou want to pick one of these for me, too?\u201d she asked dryly.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do, before you end up requesting liver and onions.\u201d</p><p>Angela picked the lasagne, thick with melted cheese and spicy tomato sauce. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for ways to punish yourself, girl, there are tastier methods.\u201d</p><p>Despite her thoughtful mood, Robin smiled.</p><p>Once they\u2019d paid for their lunches, Angela led her to a window table that offered a certain amount of privacy. Robin busied herself arranging her dishes and set the tray aside.</p><p>Angela sat directly across from her, elbows braced on either side of her lunch. \u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything else you\u2019d care to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you and Cole, of course. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw you like this. It\u2019s as if...as if you\u2019re trapped in some kind of maze and can\u2019t find your way out.\u201d</p><p>The description was so apt that Robin felt a tingling sensation along her spine. She did feel hopelessly lost. Her mind was cluttered, her emotions confused. She had one foot in the present, one in the past, and didn\u2019t know which way to turn.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Frank on Sunday afternoon,\u201d Angela continued, dipping her fork into a crisp green salad. \u201cHe said he enjoyed the evening you spent with him, but doubted you\u2019d be seeing each other again because it\u2019s obvious to him that you\u2019re in love with Cole Camden. In fact, Frank said you talked about little else the entire evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said all that?\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s right, isn\u2019t he? You are in love with Cole, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d Angela persisted. \u201cIt\u2019s written all over you. You\u2019ve got that glazed look and you walk around in a trance, practically bumping into walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I need an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a doctor,\u201d Angela whispered, leaning across the table. \u201cOr maybe a lawyer...That\u2019s it!\u201d she said loudly enough to attract the attention of several people at nearby tables. \u201cCole took you to bed, and now you\u2019re so confused you don\u2019t know what to do. I told you I\u2019d stumble on the answer sooner or later.\u201d Her eyes flashed triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Robin declared, half rising from the table. She could feel the color crowding into her cheeks as she glanced around the cafeteria. When she sat back down, she covered her face with both hands. \u201cIf you must know, Cole asked me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>A moment of shocked silence followed before Angela shrieked with pure delight. \u201cThat\u2019s fabulous! Wonderful! Good grief, what\u2019s wrong with you? You should be in seventh heaven. It isn\u2019t every day a handsome, wealthy, wonderful man proposes to you. I hope you leapt at the chance.\u201d She hesitated, suddenly still. \u201cRobin? You did tell him you\u2019d marry him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Robin swallowed and shook her head. \u201cNo. I asked him for some time to think about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about things?\u201d Angela squealed. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to think about? He\u2019s rich. He\u2019s handsome. He\u2019s in love with you and crazy about Jeff. What more could you possibly want?\u201d</p> <p>Tears brimmed in Robin\u2019s eyes as she looked up to meet her friend\u2019s avid gaze. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s more in love with the idea of having a family than he is with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cole coming?\u201d Jeff asked, working the stiffness out of his baseball mitt by slamming his fist into the middle of it several times.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robin said, glancing at their neighbor\u2019s house as they walked to the car. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him in the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Robin said, sliding into the driver\u2019s seat of her compact. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been busy.\u201d</p><p>Jeff fingered the bill of his baseball cap, then set the cap on his head. \u201cI saw him yesterday and told him about the game, and he said he might come. I hope he does.\u201d</p><p>Secretly Robin hoped Cole would be there, too. Over the past five days, she\u2019d missed talking to him. She hadn\u2019t come to any decision, but he hadn\u2019t pressed her to make one, willing to offer her all the time she needed. Robin hadn\u2019t realized how accustomed she\u2019d grown to his presence. How much she needed to see him and talk to him. Exchange smiles and glances. Touch him...</p><p>When she was married to Lenny, they were two people very much in love, two people who\u2019d linked their lives to form one whole. But Lenny had been taken from her, and for a long time afterward Robin had felt only half alive.</p><p>All week she\u2019d swayed back and forth over Cole\u2019s proposal, wondering if she should ignore her doubts. Wondering if she could ignore them. Sleepless nights hadn\u2019t yielded the answer. Neither had long solitary walks in Balboa Park while Jeff practiced with his baseball team.</p><p>\u201cCole said\u2014\u201d Jeff started to say, then stopped abruptly as his hands flew to his head. A panicky look broke out on his face and he stared at Robin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you forget something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lucky hat!\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cIt\u2019s on my dresser. We have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a baseball cap?\u201d Robin didn\u2019t disguise how silly she considered that idea. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a baseball cap. What\u2019s wrong with that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. You have to understand, Mom, it\u2019s my lucky hat. I\u2019ve been wearing it ever since we played our first game. I had that very same hat on when I hit my first two home runs. I can\u2019t play without it,\u201d he explained frantically. \u201cWe have to go back. Hurry, or we\u2019ll be late for the game. Turn here,\u201d he insisted, pointing at the closest intersection.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she said, trying to reason with her son. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the hat that makes you play well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were going to say something like that,\u201d he muttered, \u201cand even if it\u2019s true, I want to be on the safe side, just in case. We\u2019ve got to go back and get that hat!\u201d</p><p>Knowing it would only waste valuable time to argue, Robin did as he requested. After all, his whole career as a major-league pitcher hung in the balance!</p><p>She was smiling as she entered her driveway. Sitting in the car while Jeff ran inside for his lucky cap, Robin glanced over at Cole\u2019s place. His car was gone. It\u2019d been gone since early that morning, and she suspected he was at the property, working on his house. Jeff would be disappointed about Cole missing his game, but he\u2019d understand.</p><p>Jeff came barreling out of the house, slamming the front door. He leapt into the car and fastened his seat belt. \u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d he said anxiously, \u201clet\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d As if she\u2019d caused the delay, Robin thought to herself, amused by her son\u2019s sudden impatience.</p><p>By the time they arrived at Balboa Park, the car park was filled to overflowing. Robin was fortunate enough to find a space on the street, a minor miracle in itself. Perhaps there was something to this magic-cap business after all.</p><p>Jeff ran across the grass, hurrying toward his teammates, leaving Robin to fend for herself, which was fine. He had his precious cap and was content.</p><p>The bleachers were crowded with parents. Robin found a seat close to the top and had just settled in place when she saw Cole making his way toward her. Her heart did an immediate flip-flop and it wasn\u2019t until he sat next to her that she was able to speak.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were working up on the property this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss seeing Jeff pitch? Wild horses couldn\u2019t have kept me away.\u201d He was smiling at her with that cocky heart-stopping smile of his.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d she asked. She couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off him. He looked too good to be true, and his dark gaze was filled with warmth and tenderness. How could she help getting lost in eyes that generous? It seemed impossible to resist him any longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you like crazy,\u201d he whispered, and the humor seemed to drain out of him as his eyes searched hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel this alone. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to relax once she\u2019d said that. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHave you been thinking about what I said last weekend?\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve made up your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She kept her face lowered, not wanting him to see her confusion.</p><p>He tilted her chin with one finger, forcing her to meet his eyes. \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t ask you and then I couldn\u2019t seem to stop myself. I won\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a weak smile, and Cole looked around him, clearly wanting to kiss her, but not in front of such a large gathering. The funny part was, Robin didn\u2019t care about being seen. She was so hungry for the reassurance of his touch, it didn\u2019t matter to her that they were in the middle of a crowded park.</p><p>\u201cI see Jeff\u2019s wearing his lucky hat,\u201d Cole said, clasping her hand and giving her fingers a comforting squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Jeff tells me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe panicked when he realized he was wearing the wrong one, and I had to make a U-turn in the middle of the street because he\u2019d left the guaranteed-to-pitch-well baseball cap on his dresser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame him. The luck has lasted through five games now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if it\u2019ll last until he reaches the pros,\u201d Robin said, sharing a smile with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing all right?\u201d Cole asked unexpectedly.</p><p>She nodded, although it wasn\u2019t entirely true. Now that she was with Cole, every doubt she\u2019d struggled with all week vanished like fog under an afternoon sun. Only when they were apart was she confronted by her fears.</p><p>\u201cAfter Jeff\u2019s finished here, let\u2019s do something together,\u201d Cole suggested. \u201cThe three of us.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to refuse him anything.</p><p>\u201cCome to think of it, didn\u2019t I promise Jeff lunch? I seem to recall making a rash pledge to buy him fish and chips because we were leaving him with Heather and Kelly when we went to dinner last week.\u201d</p><p>Robin grinned. \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019re remembering that correctly,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They went to a cheerful little fish-and-chip restaurant down by the Wharf. The weather had been chilly all morning, but the sun was out in full force by early afternoon. Jeff was excited about his team\u2019s latest win and attributed it to the luck brought to them by his cap.</p><p>After a leisurely lunch, the three of them strolled along the busy waterfront. Robin bought a loaf of fresh sourdough bread and a small bouquet of spring flowers. Jeff found a plastic snake he couldn\u2019t live without and paid for it with his allowance.</p><p>\u201cJust wait till Jimmy Wallach sees this!\u201d he crowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more curious to see how Kelly Lawrence reacts,\u201d Robin said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Kelly likes snakes,\u201d Jeff told them cheerfully. \u201cJimmy was over one day and I thought I\u2019d scare Kelly with a live garden snake, but Jimmy was the one who started screaming. Kelly said snakes were just another of God\u2019s creatures and there was nothing to be afraid of. Isn\u2019t it just like a girl to get religious about a snake?\u201d</p><p>Jeff raced down the sidewalk while Cole and Robin stood at the end of the pier, the bread and flowers at their feet.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Cole said, as his fingers gently touched her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted, gazing out at the cool green waters of San Francisco Bay. But Cole was right; she hadn\u2019t been sleeping well.</p><p>\u201cI see so much of myself in you,\u201d Cole said softly.</p> <p>His words surprised her. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain mostly. How many years has Lenny been dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. In some ways I\u2019m still grieving him.\u201d She couldn\u2019t be less than honest with Cole.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you can love another man, are you? At least not with the same intensity that you loved Jeff\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all. I...I just don\u2019t know if I can stop loving him.\u201d</p><p>Cole went very still. \u201cI never intended to take Lenny away from you or Jeff. He\u2019s part of your past, an important part. Being married to Lenny, giving birth to Jeff, contributed to making you what you are.\u201d He paused, and they both remained silent.</p> <p>\u201cBobby had been buried for six years before I had the courage to face the future. I hung on to my grief, carried it with me everywhere I went, dragging it like a heavy piece of luggage I couldn\u2019t travel without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that way about Lenny,\u201d she said, ready to argue, not heatedly or vehemently, but logically, because what he was saying simply wasn\u2019t true. She mourned her dead husband, felt his absence, but she hadn\u2019t allowed this sense of loss to destroy her life.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you aren\u2019t grieving as deeply as you once were,\u201d Cole amended. \u201cBut I wonder if you\u2019ve really laid your husband to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d she answered with a nod of her head, not wanting to talk about Lenny.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound unsympathetic,\u201d Cole said, his tone compassionate. \u201cI understand, believe me I do. Emotional pain is familiar territory for us both. It seems to me that those of us who sustain this kind of grief are afraid of what lies beyond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely woman, Robin. Witty. Intelligent. Outgoing. I\u2019m sure one of the first questions anyone asks you is how long it\u2019s been since your husband died. And I\u2019ll bet when you tell them, they seem surprised.\u201d</p><p>That was true, and Robin wondered how Cole had guessed.</p> <p>\u201cMost young widows remarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that because I didn\u2019t immediately fling myself back into matrimonial bliss I\u2019m a candidate for therapy? Come on, Cole, even you must realize how ridiculous that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven me?\u201d he asked, chuckling.</p><p>Jeff came loping toward them, his face flushed with excitement. \u201cThey\u2019re filming a movie,\u201d he cried, pointing toward a congested area farther down the pier. \u201cThere\u2019s cameras and actors and everything. Can I go watch some more?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cJust don\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Promise. Here, Mom, hold my snake.\u201d He entrusted her with his precious package before racing back down the pier.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fine boy, Robin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you already. You and Blackie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does his mother feel?\u201d</p><p>The knot in her throat thickened. \u201cShe loves you, too.\u201d</p><p>Cole grinned. \u201cShe just isn\u2019t sure if she can let go of her dead husband to take on a live one. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>His words hit their mark. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid you want to marry me because Jeff reminds you of Bobby. Or because you\u2019ve created a fantasy wife and think I\u2019ll fit the role.\u201d</p><p>Her words seemed to shock him. \u201cNo. You\u2019ve got that all wrong. Jeff is a wonderful plus in this relationship, but it\u2019s you I fell in love with. It\u2019s you I want to grow old with. You, and you alone, not some ideal. If you want to know the truth, I think you\u2019re stirring up all this turmoil because you\u2019re afraid of ever marrying again. The little world you\u2019ve made is tidy and safe. But is this what Lenny would\u2019ve wanted for you?\u201d He gripped her firmly by the shoulders. \u201cIf Lenny were standing beside you right now and you could ask him about marrying me, what would he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could seek Lenny\u2019s advice, what would he tell you? Would he say, \u2018Robin, look at this guy. He\u2019s in love with you. He thinks the world of Jeff, and he\u2019s ready to embark on a new life. This is an opportunity too good to pass up. Don\u2019t be a fool. Marry him.\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like something my friend Angela would say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to like this friend of yours\u2014just as long as she doesn\u2019t try to set you up with any more of her divorced cousins,\u201d Cole said, laughing. His eyes grew warm as he gazed at her, and she suspected he was longing to take her in his arms and kiss her doubts away. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he looked over his shoulder and sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go see what Jeff\u2019s up to. I\u2019ll leave you to yourself for a few minutes. I don\u2019t mean to pressure you, but I do want you to think about what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t pressuring me,\u201d she whispered, staring out over the water.</p><p>Cole left her then, and her hands clutched the steel railing as she raised her eyes to the sky. \u201cOh, Lenny,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>\u201cCole wants me to ask your advice.\u201d Robin continued to look up at the cloudless blue sky. \u201cOh, Lenny, I honestly don\u2019t know what\u2019s right for Jeff and me anymore. I love Cole. I love you. But at the same time I can\u2019t help wondering about Cole\u2019s motives....\u201d</p><p>Robin paused, waiting. Not that she expected an answer. Lenny couldn\u2019t give her one. He never did; he never would. But unlike the other times she\u2019d spoken to him, she needed a response, even though expecting one was totally illogical.</p><p>With every breath she took, Robin knew that, but the futility of it hit her, anyway. Her frustration was so hard and unexpectedly powerful that it felt like a body blow. Robin closed her eyes, hoping the heat of the sun would take away this bitter ache, this dreadful loneliness.</p><p>She felt so empty. Hollow all the way through.</p><p>Her fists were clenched at her sides as tears fell from her eyes. Embarrassed, she glanced around, grateful that the film crew had attracted most of the sightseers. No one was around to witness her distress.</p><p>Anger, which for so many years had lain dormant inside her, gushed forth in an avalanche of grief and pain. The tears continued to spill down her cheeks. Her lips quivered. Her shoulders shook. Her hands trembled. It was as if the emotion was pounding against her chest and she was powerless to do anything but stand there and bear it.</p><p>Anger consumed her now. Consumed her because she hadn\u2019t allowed it to when Lenny was killed. It had been more important to put on a brave front. More important to hold herself together for Jeff and for Lenny\u2019s parents. More important to deal with the present than the past.</p><p>Lenny had died and Robin was furious with him for leaving her alone with a child to raise. Leaving her alone to deal with filing taxes and taking out the garbage and repairing leaking pipes. All these years she\u2019d managed on her own. And she\u2019d bottled the anger up inside, afraid of ever letting it go.</p><p>\u201cRobin.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s voice, soft and urgent, reached out from behind her. At the sound, she turned and walked into his arms, sobbing, needing his comfort and his love in equal measure. Needing him as she\u2019d never needed anyone before.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long he held her. He was whispering soothing words to her. Gentle words. But she heard none of them over the sound of her own suffering.</p><p>Once she started crying, Robin couldn\u2019t seem to stop. It was as if a dam had burst inside her and the anguish, stored for too many years, came pouring out.</p><p>Cole\u2019s arms were securely wrapped around her, shielding her. She longed to control this outburst, longed to explain, but every time she tried to speak her sobbing only grew worse.</p><p>\u201cLet it out,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t answer,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI asked him...Lenny never answers me...because he can\u2019t. He left me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to die,\u201d Cole told her.</p><p>\u201cBut he did...he did.\u201d</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t argue with her. He simply held her, stroking the back of her head as though reassuring a small child.</p><p>It took several minutes for Robin to compose herself enough to go on. \u201cPart of me realizes that Lenny didn\u2019t want to leave me, didn\u2019t want to die. But he did and I\u2019m so angry at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat anger is what makes us human,\u201d Cole said. He continued to comfort her and, gradually, bit by bit, Robin felt her composure slip back into place.</p><p>She sensed Jeff\u2019s presence even before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat wrong with my mom?\u201d he asked Cole.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dealing with some emotional pain,\u201d Cole explained, speaking as one adult to another.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>Robin hadn\u2019t wanted her son to see her crying and made a concerted effort to break away from Cole, to reassure Jeff herself. Cole loosened his hold, but kept his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jeff. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>Her son had developed the irritating habit of talking to Cole and not to her when she was upset. They\u2019d done it that day her son had run away to the fort. Jeff and Cole had carried on an entire conversation about her while she was in their midst then, too.</p><p>Cole led her to a bench and they all sat down.</p><p>Jeff plopped down next to her and reached for her hand, patting it several times. Leaning toward Cole, he said earnestly, \u201cChocolate might help. One time Mom told me there wasn\u2019t anything in this world chocolate couldn\u2019t cure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d actually said that? Robin started to smile. Wrapping her arms around her son, she hugged him close, loving him so much her heart seemed about to burst.</p><p>Jeff wasn\u2019t all that keen on being cuddled, especially in public, but although he squirmed he put up with his mother\u2019s sudden need to hold him.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, Jeff rolled his eyes and once more directed his comments to Cole. \u201cShe gets weird like this every once in a while. Remember what happened that day I ran away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Cole said, and Robin smiled at the trace of amusement she heard in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cWill you stop excluding me from this conversation? I\u2019m going to be all right. I just had this...urge to cry, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Jeff muttered to Cole.</p><p>\u201cBut Jeff\u2019s right,\u201d Robin said, ignoring her son\u2019s comment. \u201cSomething chocolaty would definitely help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay by yourself for a couple of minutes?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I...don\u2019t know exactly what came over me, but I\u2019m going to be just fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d He kissed her, his lips gentle against her cheek.</p><p>The two of them left and once more Robin was alone. She didn\u2019t really understand why the pain and anger had hit her so hard now, after all this time. Except that it had something to do with Cole. But the last place she would ever have expected to give in to her grief was on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf with half of San Francisco looking on.</p><p>Jeff returned less than a minute later, running to her side with a double-decker chocolate ice cream cone. \u201cCole\u2019s bringing two more for him and me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI told the guy it was an emergency and he gave me this one right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of you,\u201d Robin said, wondering what the vendor must have thought. Smiling, she ran her tongue over the ice cream, savoring the cold chocolate. As profoundly as she\u2019d wept, she felt almost giddy with relief now, repressing the impulse to throw back her head and laugh.</p><p>Cole arrived, and with Jeff on her left and Cole on her right she sat on the concrete bench and ate her ice cream cone.</p><p>\u201cI told you this would work,\u201d Jeff told Cole smugly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd to think I scoffed at your lucky baseball cap,\u201d she teased, feeling much better.</p><p>When they finished the cones, Cole gathered up their packages and led them back to where he\u2019d parked his car.</p><p>Blackie was there to greet them the instant they returned to Orchard Street. Jeff ran into the backyard to play with the dog, and Cole walked Robin to her door. He accepted her offer of coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to be leaving soon for my property,\u201d he said, watching her closely. He sat down at the table, his hands cupping the mug as though to warm them. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. She walked over and stood beside him and pressed a hand to his strong jaw. \u201cI realize you delayed going up there today because of Jeff and his baseball game. We\u2019re both grateful.\u201d</p><p>Cole placed his hand over hers and harshly expelled his breath. \u201cI feel responsible for what you went through there on the pier. I should never have said what I did. I\u2019m sorry, Robin, it wasn\u2019t any of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only said what I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIf I did, it was because of what happened to me in Seattle. It\u2019s quite a coincidence that both of us would come to grips with our pain while standing on a pier\u2014me in Seattle, you here in San Francisco. I went home with this incredible sense of release. For the first time since Bobby and Jennifer\u2019s deaths, I surrendered my grief. In a way it was as though I reached up and God reached down and together we came to an understanding.\u201d</p> <p>That so completely described what Robin had been feeling that for a long moment she couldn\u2019t say anything. What Cole had said earlier about carrying the pain, dragging it everywhere, was right on the mark, too. He understood; he\u2019d done the same thing himself. A surge of love swelled within her.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear this,\u201d he was saying. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t mean to pressure you. But once I returned from Seattle and realized I was falling in love with you I started thinking about having another baby.\u201d He hesitated and took a gulp of his coffee. Then he stood up abruptly, nearly knocking the chair backward. \u201cI\u2019d better go before I say or do something else I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Robin followed him into the entryway, not wanting him to leave, but not quite ready to give him what he needed.</p><p>He paused at the screen door and his eyes immediately found hers. He couldn\u2019t seem to keep himself from touching her, brushing an auburn curl from her cheek. His knuckles grazed her skin lightly, and Robin\u2019s eyes closed of their own accord at the sensation that shot through her. Her heart was full, and she seemed to have all the answers now\u2014except to the one question that was the most important in her life. And Jeff\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime next week,\u201d Cole said roughly, pulling his hand away. Without another word, he walked out the door, pausing at the top of the porch steps.</p><p>He called for his dog and in response both Blackie and Jeff came running.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, are you?\u201d Jeff asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Blackie for the rest of the weekend. You think you can get along without him till Monday, sport?\u201d</p><p>Jeff shrugged and stuck his fingers in the hip pockets of his blue jeans. \u201cI suppose. Where are you taking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my property.\u201d Cole didn\u2019t turn toward Robin. It was as if he had to ignore her in order to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Jeff said enthusiastically. \u201cI remember you said something about it once. You\u2019re building a house, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemodelling one. My grandfather lived there as a boy and he left it to me, only it\u2019s been a lot of years since anyone\u2019s cared for that old house properly and there\u2019s plenty of work that needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work for you,\u201d Jeff piped up eagerly. He made a fist and flexed his arm, revealing the meager muscles. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like much, but I\u2019m strong. Ask anyone.\u201d</p><p>Cole tested Jeff\u2019s muscles, pretending to be impressed. \u201cYes, I can tell you\u2019re strong, and I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t ask for a harder worker.\u201d Jeff beamed until Cole added regretfully, \u201cI\u2019ll take you up there another time, sport.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s face fell.</p><p>Before she even realized what she was doing, Robin moved onto the porch. \u201cCole.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her, but the movement seemed reluctant.</p><p>Perhaps it was because she didn\u2019t want to be separated from him any more than he wanted to be away from her. Perhaps it was the thought of Jeff\u2019s disappointment when he\u2019d already had so many other disappointments in his life. Perhaps it was this newborn sense of freedom she was just beginning to experience.</p><p>She stepped toward Cole. \u201cCould Jeff and I go up to the property with you?\u201d</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t wait for Cole to answer before leaping excitedly into the air. \u201cHey, Mom, that\u2019s a great idea! Really great. Can we, Cole? Blackie and I can help you, and Mom can...Well, she can do things like make us some grub and bring us lemonade and other stuff women do when their men are working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you both know I pound a mean hammer,\u201d Robin felt obliged to inform them. If she was going to Cole\u2019s farm, she fully intended to do her share.</p><p>Cole looked perplexed for a moment, as if he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard her correctly. \u201cI\u2019d love to have you come\u2014if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Robin just nodded. All she knew was that she couldn\u2019t bear to be separated from him any longer.</p><p>\u201cBe warned\u2014the house is only half done. The plumbing isn\u2019t in yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll manage, won\u2019t we, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeff said eagerly. \u201cAnyway, boys got it easy.\u201d</p><p>Cole laughed. \u201cHow long will it take you to pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready now, aren\u2019t we, Blackie?\u201d Jeff almost jitterbugged across the front lawn in his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes to throw some things together,\u201d Robin said, grinning. Jeff was smiling, too, from ear to ear, as he dashed past her into the house and up the stairs.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes held Robin\u2019s in silent communication\u2014until Jeff came bursting out of the house, dragging his sheets and quilt with him, straight from his bed.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d she cried, aghast, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took everything off my bed. I can go without plumbing, but I need my sleep.\u201d He piled the bedding at their feet. \u201cYou two can go back to looking at each other. I\u2019ll get everything else we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d Robin groaned, casting Cole an apologetic glance. \u201cI\u2019ll pack my own things, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get your sheets, too?\u201d he called from inside the house.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She scooped up the bedding and hurried into the house, taking the stairs two at a time. She discovered Jeff sitting on the edge of her bed, his expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to marry Cole?\u201d her son asked.</p><p>At the unexpectedness of the question, Robin\u2019s heart flew to her throat, then slid back into place. Briefly she wondered if Cole had brought up the subject with her son, but instinctively knew he hadn\u2019t. \u201cW-what makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cLots of things. Every time I turn around you two are staring at each other. Either that or kissing. I try to pretend I don\u2019t notice, but it\u2019s getting as bad as some of those movies you like. And when you were crying on the pier, I saw something. Cole had his arms around you and he was looking real sad. Like...like he wished he could do the crying for you. It\u2019s the same look Grandpa sometimes gives Grandma when he figures out that she\u2019s upset, and she doesn\u2019t even have to talk. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Robin said, casually walking over to her dresser drawer and taking out a couple of old sweatshirts. \u201cAnd what would you think if I said I was considering marrying Cole?\u201d</p><p>Robin expected shouts of glee and wild shrieks, but instead her son crossed his arms over his chest and moved his mouth in odd ways, stretching it to one side and then the other. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She folded and refolded one of the sweatshirts, her heart pounding in anticipation. \u201cIt would mean a lot of changes for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many other people are involved in this?\u201d</p><p>Robin hesitated, not understanding Jeff\u2019s concern. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I get an extra set of grandparents in this deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...probably. I haven\u2019t talked to Cole about that yet, but I assume so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means extra gifts on my birthday and at Christmas. I say we should go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey Leonard Masterson, you shock me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s how a kid thinks.\u201d</p><p>Robin shook her head in dismay at her son\u2019s suddenly materialistic attitude toward her possible marriage. She was still frowning as she stepped outside.</p><p>Cole was in his garage, loading up the trunk of his SUV when Robin joined him. She handed him one small suitcase and a bag of groceries she\u2019d packed at the last minute.</p><p>Cole stowed them away, carefully avoiding her eyes. \u201cI guess you said something to Jeff about us?\u201d She could hear amusement in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought down a paper bag full of clothes and asked what kind of presents he could expect from my parents at Christmas. He also asked if there were any aunts or uncles in the deal.\u201d Robin\u2019s embarrassment must have showed, because Cole started chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThat boy\u2019s got a mercenary streak in him I knew nothing about,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Cole was still grinning. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, drawing an unsteady breath, eager for this adventure to begin. Jeff and Blackie were already in the backseat when Robin slipped into the front to wait for Cole.</p> <p>\u201cAre we going to sing camp songs?\u201d Jeff asked, leaning forward. He didn\u2019t wait for a response, but immediately launched into the timeless ditty about bottles of beer on the wall. He sang ninety-nine verses of that, then performed a series of other songs until they left the freeway and wound up on a narrow country road with almost no traffic.</p><p>Jeff had tired of singing by then. \u201cKnock knock,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Robin said, falling in with his game.</p><p>\u201cEisenhower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEisenhower who?\u201d</p><p>Jeff snickered. \u201cEisenhower late, how about you?\u201d With that, the ten-year-old broke into belly-gripping guffaws, as if he should be receiving awards for his ability to tell jokes.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s mouth was twitching and Robin had to admit she was amused, too.</p><p>\u201cThe turnoff for the ranch is about a mile up the road,\u201d Cole explained. \u201cNow remember, this is going to be a lot like camping. It\u2019s still pretty primitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d Robin said, smiling at him.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Cole slowed, about to turn down the long driveway. It was then that Robin saw the sign. Her heart jumped into her throat and her hands started to shake.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she screamed. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Cole slammed on the brakes, catapulting them forward. \u201cRobin, what is it?\u201d</p><p>Robin threw open the front door and leapt out of the car, running to the middle of the road. She stared at the one word on the sign even as the tears filled her eyes.</p><p>Cole\u2019s farm was named Paradise.</p> <p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cRobin, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Cole said for the third time, his dark eyes worried.</p><p>\u201cI bet my allowance she\u2019s crying again,\u201d Jeff muttered, poking his head out the side window. \u201cSomething weird\u2019s going on with my mother. She\u2019s been acting goofy all day. Why do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d Cole said as he continued to study Robin.</p><p>For her part, Robin couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the sign. Jeff was right about her crying; the tears streamed unrestrained down her face. But these were tears of joy. Tears of gratitude. Tears of acknowledgment. It was exactly as Cole had described. She\u2019d reached up and God had reached down and together they\u2019d come to an understanding. She\u2019d finally resolved her dilemma.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, Robin hurled her arms around Cole\u2019s neck. Her hands roamed his face. His wonderful, wonderful face.</p><p>Because her eyes were blurred with emotion, she couldn\u2019t accurately read Cole\u2019s expression, but it didn\u2019t matter. Her heart spilled over with love for him.</p><p>\u201cRobin...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish, but began spreading a long series of kisses across his face, starting with his eyelids. \u201cI love you, I love you,\u201d she repeated between kisses, moving from his cheek to his nose and downward.</p><p>Cole put his arms around her waist and pulled her closer. Robin was half-aware of the car door slamming and Jeff marching up the road to join them.</p><p>\u201cAre you two getting all mushy on me again?\u201d</p><p>Robin barely heard her son. Her mouth had unerringly found Cole\u2019s.</p><p>The unexpected sharp sound of a hand clap brought her out of her dream world. The kiss ended, and her eyes immediately went to Jeff, who was looking very much like a pint-size adult. His face and eyes were stern.</p><p>\u201cDo the two of you know where you\u2019re standing?\u201d Jeff demanded as though he\u2019d recently been hired by the state police to make sure this type of thing didn\u2019t happen. \u201cThere are proper places to kiss, but the middle of the road isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Cole said, his eyes devouring Robin. He clearly didn\u2019t want to release her and did so with a reluctance that tugged at her heart.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Jeff said, taking his mother by the hand and leading her back to the car. He paused in front of the door and frowned. \u201cMaybe she has a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d Cole said, grasping her hand, \u201ccan you explain now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the sign\u2014Paradise. Tell me about it. Tell me why your grandfather named his place Paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Cole said, puzzled. \u201cHe lived here his whole life and always said this land was all he\u2019d ever needed. From what I remember, he once told me he thought of this place as the Garden of Eden. I can only assume that\u2019s why he named it Paradise.\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded, unsurprised by his explanation. \u201cWhen Lenny and I were first married, we talked...we dreamed about someday buying some land and raising animals. Enough land for Jeff to have a pony and for me to have a huge garden. We decided this land would be our own piece of heaven on earth and...from that we came up with the idea of naming it Paradise.\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head slowly, and she could tell he didn\u2019t completely understand.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon, when I was standing on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, you suggested I talk over my feelings about our getting married with Lenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I suggested,\u201d Cole reminded her, \u201cwas that you imagine what he\u2019d say to advise you. I certainly didn\u2019t expect you to really communicate with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this won\u2019t make any sense to you, but I\u2019ve talked to Lenny lots of times over the years. This afternoon, what hit me so hard was the fact that Lenny would never answer me. That realization was what finally forced me to deal with the pain. To forgive Lenny for dying.\u201d</p><p>Jeff was looking at her in confusion, his mouth open and eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cHere you were wanting to marry me and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I had trouble believing your proposal was prompted by anything more than the desire to replace the family you\u2019d lost. I do love you, and I desperately wanted to believe you loved me\u2014and Jeff. But I wasn\u2019t sure....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically. \u201cYes. With all my heart, I\u2019m confident that marrying you would be the right thing for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to marry Cole!\u201d Jeff cried. \u201cGood grief, all you had to do was ask me and I would\u2019ve told you. We belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do, don\u2019t we?\u201d Robin whispered. \u201cCole,\u201d she said, taking both his hands with her own. \u201cI\u2019d consider it a very great honor to become your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff?\u201d Cole said, tearing his eyes away from Robin.</p><p>The boy\u2019s face shone and his eyes sparkled. \u201cI\u2019d consider it a very great honor to become your son.\u201d</p><p>Cole brushed his lips across Robin\u2019s and then reached for Jeff, hauling him into his arms and squeezing him tight. Blackie started barking then, wanting out of the car. Robin quickly moved to open the passenger door, and the black Lab leapt out. She crouched down and wrapped her arms around his thick neck, hugging him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a whole family now, Blackie,\u201d she said happily.</p><p>Two hours later, just at dusk, Robin was standing in the middle of the yard. She\u2019d loved everything about Paradise, just as she\u2019d known she would. The house and property were nothing like the place she and Lenny had dreamed about, but she hadn\u2019t expected them to be. The four-bedroom house was much larger than anything they\u2019d ever hoped to own. The land was covered with Ponderosa pine, and the rocky ground was more suitable to grazing a few sheep or cattle than planting crops.</p><p>Cole was showing Jeff the barn, and Robin had intended to join them, but the evening was redolent with a sweet-smelling breeze and she\u2019d stopped to breathe in the fresh cool air. She folded her arms and stood there, smiling into the clear sky. A multitude of twinkling stars were just beginning to reveal themselves.</p><p>Cole walked quietly up behind her, and slipped his arms around her waist, pulling her against him. \u201cHave I told you how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last fifteen minutes? No, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen allow me to correct that situation.\u201d He nibbled the back of her neck gently. \u201cI love you to distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He sighed then and whispered hoarsely, \u201cIt was a difficult decision to marry me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Robin agreed with a nod.</p><p>\u201cHad I given you so many reasons to doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, turning in his arms. She pressed her palms against his jaw. \u201cI had to be sure in my heart that you weren\u2019t trying to replace the son you\u2019d lost with Jeff. And I had to be equally certain you loved me for myself and not because I was Jeff\u2019s mother and we came as a package deal.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head decisively. \u201cJeff\u2019s a great kid, don\u2019t get me wrong, but there\u2019s never been any question in my mind about how I felt. The first time we met, you hit me square between the eyes. I didn\u2019t mean to fall in love again. I didn\u2019t even want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I did, either,\u201d Robin confessed.</p><p>\u201cPast experience taught us both that loving someone only causes pain. I loved Jennifer, but I could never make her happy. When we divorced I accepted my role in the breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she had a drinking problem, Cole. You can\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not entirely, but I accept a portion of the blame for what went wrong. It tore me apart to see Bobby caught in the middle, and in an effort to minimize the pain I didn\u2019t fight for custody. He was an innocent victim of the divorce, and I didn\u2019t want him to suffer any further distress. I was willing to do anything I could to spare him. Later, when I realized how serious Jennifer\u2019s problem with alcohol had become, I tried to obtain custody, but before I could get the courts to move on it, the accident happened. Afterward, I was left facing the guilt of having waited too long.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of ever marrying again, having children again, terrified me. I couldn\u2019t imagine making myself vulnerable a second time.\u201d He paused, and a slow, gentle smile spread across his face, smoothing away the tension. \u201cAll of that changed when I met you. It was as if life was offering me another chance. And I knew I had to grab hold of it with both hands or live with regret forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Jeff said as he dashed into the yard. \u201cAre you two at it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking,\u201d Robin explained.</p><p>\u201cYour mouths are too close together for talking.\u201d He strolled past them, Blackie trotting at his side. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you thought about making me anything to eat, did you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made sandwiches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. Are there enough for Blackie to have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. There\u2019s juice and some corn chips in the kitchen, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jeff repeated, hurrying into the house.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Robin asked Cole.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he stated emphatically, \u201cbut my appetite doesn\u2019t seem to be for food. How long will you keep me waiting to make you my wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to call my parents and my brother so we can arrange everything. It\u2019s important to me that we have a church wedding. It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, but I\u2019d like to invite a handful of good friends and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make the arrangements? I\u2019m not sure. Three, possibly four months to do it properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne month,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, one month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you exactly thirty days to arrange whatever you want, but that\u2019s as long as I\u2019m willing to wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCole\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swept her into his arms then and his mouth claimed hers in a fury of desire. Robin found herself trembling and she clutched his shirt, her fingers bunching the material as she strove to regain her equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cCole...\u201d She felt chilled and feverish at the same time. Needy, yet wealthy beyond her wildest dreams.</p><p>\u201cOne month?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cOne month,\u201d she agreed, pressing her face against his broad warm chest. They\u2019d both loved, profoundly, and lost what they\u2019d valued most. For years, in their own ways, they\u2019d sealed themselves off from others, because no one else could understand their pain. Then they\u2019d discovered each other, and nothing would ever be the same again. Their love was the mature love that came when one had suffered and lost and been left to rebuild a shattered life. A love that was stronger than either could have hoped for.</p><p>\u201cDo you see what I was telling you?\u201d Jeff muttered to Blackie, sitting on the back porch steps. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re going to have to put up with this for a while.\u201d</p><p>Blackie munched on a corn chip, apparently more interested in sharing Jeff\u2019s meal than listening to his comments.</p><p>\u201cI can deal with it, if you can,\u201d Jeff continued. \u201cI suspect I\u2019ll be getting at least one brother out of this deal, and if we\u2019re lucky maybe two. A sister would be all right, too, I guess\u2014\u201d he sighed deeply \u201c\u2014but I\u2019ll have to think about that. Girls can be a real headache, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>The dog wagged his tail as Jeff slipped him another corn chip. \u201cAnd you know what, Blackie? It\u2019s gonna be Father\u2019s Day soon. My very first. And I\u2019ve already got a card picked out. It\u2019s got a picture of a father, a mother and a boy with a baseball cap. And there\u2019s a dog on it that looks just like you!\u201d</p><p>THE COURTSHIP OF CAROL SOMMARS</p><p>In loving memory of</p><p>David Adler, Doug Adler and Bill Stirwalt</p><p>Beloved Cousins</p><p>Beloved Friends</p><p>Special thanks to</p><p>Pat Kennedy and her endearing Italian mother,</p><p>and Ted Macomber and Bill Hall</p><p>for the contribution of their rap music</p><p>and all the lessons about living with teenage boys</p><p>One</p><p>Carol Sommars swore the entire house shook from her fifteen-year-old son\u2019s sound system, which was blasting out his favorite rap song.</p><p>I\u2019m the Wizard MC and I\u2019m on the mike</p><p>I\u2019m gonna tell you a story that I know you\u2019ll like</p><p>\u2019Cause my rhymes are kickin\u2019, and my beats do flash</p><p>When I go to the studio, they pay me cash</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Carol screamed from the kitchen, covering her ears. She figured a squad of dive-bombers would\u2019ve made less of a racket.</p><p>Realizing that Peter would never be able to hear her above the din, she marched down the narrow hallway and pounded on his door.</p><p>Peter and his best friend, Jim Preston, were sitting on Peter\u2019s bed, their heads bobbing in tempo with the music. They both looked shocked to see her.</p><p>Peter turned down the volume. \u201cDid you want something, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, please, that music is too loud.\u201d</p><p>Her son and his friend exchanged a knowing glance, no doubt commenting silently on her advancing age.</p><p>\u201cMom, it wasn\u2019t that bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>Carol met her son\u2019s cynical look. \u201cThe walls and floors were vibrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mrs. Sommars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jim. I just thought I\u2019d save the stemware while I had a chance.\u201d Not to mention warding off further hearing loss...</p><p>\u201cMom, can Jim stay for dinner? His dad\u2019s got a hot date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Carol said, casting her son\u2019s friend an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m teaching my birthing class, but Jim can stay some other evening.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. Then, in an apparent effort not to be outdone by his friend, he added, \u201cMy mom goes out on hot dates almost every weekend herself.\u201d</p><p>Carol did an admirable job of disguising her laugh behind a cough. Oh, sure! The last time she\u2019d gone out had been...she had to think about it...two months ago. And that had been as a favor to a friend. She wasn\u2019t interested in remarrying. Bruce had died nearly thirteen years earlier, and if she hadn\u2019t found another man in that time, she wasn\u2019t going to now. Besides, there was a lot to be said for the benefits of living independently.</p><p>She closed Peter\u2019s bedroom door and braced her shoulder against the wall as she sighed. A jolt of deafening music brought her upright once more. It was immediately lowered to a respectable level, and she continued back to the kitchen.</p><p>At fifteen, Peter was moving into the most awkward teenage years. Jim, too. Both boys had recently obtained their learner\u2019s permits from the Department of Motor Vehicles and were in the same fifth-period driver training class at school.</p><p>Checking the time, Carol hurried into the kitchen and turned on the oven before popping two frozen meat pies inside.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, can we drive Jim home now?\u201d</p><p>The operative word was we, which of course, meant Peter would be doing the driving. He was constantly reminding her how much practice he needed if he was going to pass the driving part of the test when he turned sixteen. The fact was, Peter used any excuse he could to get behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. These \u201cpractice\u201d runs with Peter demanded nerves of steel.</p><p>Actually, his driving skill had improved considerably in the last few weeks, but the armrest on the passenger side of the car had permanent indentations. Their first times on the road together had been more hair-raising than a horror movie\u2014another favorite pastime of her son\u2019s.</p><p>Thanks to Peter, Carol had been spiritually renewed when he\u2019d run the stop sign at Jackson and Bethel. As if to make up for his mistake, he\u2019d slammed on the brakes as soon as they\u2019d cleared the intersection, catapulting them both forward. They\u2019d been saved from injury by their seat belts.</p><p>They all clambered into her ten-year-old Ford.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s going to buy me a truck as soon as I get my license,\u201d Jim said, fastening his seat belt. \u201cA red four-by-four with flames painted along the sidewalls.\u201d</p><p>Peter tossed Carol an accusing glare. With their budget, they\u2019d have to share her cantankerous old sedan for a while. The increase in the car insurance premiums with an additional driver\u2014a male teenage driver\u2014meant frozen meat pies every third night as it was. As far as Carol was concerned, nurses were overworked, underpaid and underappreciated.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014hide!\u201d</p><p>Her heart vaulted into her throat at the panic in her son\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelody Wohlford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please, just scoot down a little, would you?\u201d</p><p>Still not understanding, she slid down until her eyes were level with the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d Peter instructed from between clenched teeth. He placed his hand on her shoulder, pushing her down even farther. \u201cI can\u2019t let Melody see me driving with my mother!\u201d</p><p>Carol muttered under her breath and did her best to keep her cool. She exhaled slowly, reminding herself this, too, shall pass.</p><p>Peter\u2019s speed decreased to a mere crawl. He inadvertently poked her in the ribs as he clumsily lowered the window, then draped his left elbow outside. Carol bit her lower lip to prevent a yelp, which probably would\u2019ve ruined everything for her son.</p><p>\u201cHey, Melody,\u201d he said casually, raising his hand.</p><p>The soft feminine greeting drifted back to them. \u201cHello, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelody,\u201d Jim said, leaning across the backseat. He spoke in a suave voice Carol hardly recognized.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jimmy,\u201d Melody called. \u201cWhere you guys off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving Jim home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jim added, half leaning over Carol, shoving her forward so that her head practically touched her knees. \u201cMy dad\u2019s ordered me a truck, but it hasn\u2019t come in yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Carol said in a strangled voice. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Mom,\u201d Peter muttered under his breath, pressing down on the accelerator and hurrying ahead.</p><p>Carol struggled into an upright position, dragging in several deep gulps of oxygen. She was about to deliver a much-needed lecture when Peter pulled into his friend\u2019s driveway. Seconds later, the front door banged open.</p><p>\u201cJames, where have you been? I told you to come directly home after school.\u201d</p><p>Carol blinked. Since this was the boys\u2019 first year of high school and they\u2019d come from different middle schools, Carol had never met Jim\u2019s father. Now, however, didn\u2019t seem the appropriate moment to leap out and introduce herself.</p><p>Alex Preston was so angry with Jim that he barely glanced in their direction. When he did, he dismissed her and Peter without a word. His dark brows lifted derisively over gray eyes as he scowled at his son.</p><p>Carol suspected that if Jim hadn\u2019t gotten out of the car on his own, Alex would have pulled him through the window.</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t help noting that Alex Preston was an imposing man; he had to be easily six-two. His forehead was high and his jaw well-defined. But his eyes were what immediately captured her attention. They held his son\u2019s with uncompromising authority.</p><p>There was an arrogant set to his mouth that Carol found herself disliking. Normally she didn\u2019t make snap judgments, but one look told her she wasn\u2019t going to get along with Jim\u2019s father, which was unfortunate since the boys had become such fast friends.</p><p>Not that it really mattered. Other than an occasional phone conversation, there\u2019d be no reason for them to have any contact with each other.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know much about the man, other than his marital status (single\u2014divorced, she assumed) and the fact that he ran some sort of construction company. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you I was going out tonight,\u201d Alex was saying. \u201cThe least you could\u2019ve done was have the consideration to let me know where you were.

She felt like jumping out of the car and informing him that they had no intention of staying anyway. \u201cWe should leave now,\u201d she said to Peter with as much dignity as she could muster.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Peter called to his friend.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Jim called back, still looking chagrined.</p> <p>Peter had reversed the car out of the driveway and was headed toward the house before either of them spoke.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Jim was supposed to go home right after school?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cHow could I know something like that?\u201d Peter flared. \u201cI asked him over to listen to my new CD. I didn\u2019t know his dad was going to come unglued over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just being a parent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but at least you don\u2019t scream at me in front of my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Mr. Preston blow his cool before. He sure was mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be so hard on him,\u201d she said, feeling generous despite her earlier annoyance. Adults needed to stick together. \u201cHe was obviously worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom, Jim\u2019s fifteen! You shouldn\u2019t have to know where a kid is every minute of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Peter was diplomatic enough not to respond to that.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d arrived at the house and Carol had changed clothes for her class, their dinner was ready.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Peter said thoughtfully as she brought a fresh green salad to the table. \u201cYou should think about going out more yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean on dates and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff?\u201d Carol repeated, swallowing a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d He sighed loudly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t lost it yet, you know.\u201d</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t sure she did. But she was fairly certain he meant to compliment her, so she nodded solemnly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to use Oil of Olay.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although she didn\u2019t appreciate such close scrutiny of her skin.</p><p>\u201cI was looking at your hair and I don\u2019t see any gray, and you don\u2019t have fat folds or anything.\u201d</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she laughed.</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m serious. You could probably pass for thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks...I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Jim\u2019s dad is going out with someone who\u2019s twenty-one, and Jim told me she\u2019s tall and blond and pretty with great big...you know.\u201d He cupped his hands over his chest.</p><p>Carol sat down at the table. Leaning her elbows on it, she dangled her fork over her plate. \u201cAre you suggesting I find myself a twenty-one-year-old guy with bulging muscles and compete with Jim\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Peter said scornfully. \u201cWell, not exactly. I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re not over the hill. You could be dating a whole lot more than you do. And you should before...well, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Carol pierced a fork full of lettuce and offered a convenient excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to get involved with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a bite of his own salad. \u201cIf the right guy came along, you\u2019d make time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Preston does. Jim says his dad\u2019s always busy with work, but he finds time to date lots of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but most of the women he sees are too young to vote.\u201d Instantly feeling guilty for the catty remark, Carol shook her head. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t nice. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Peter said, sounding mature beyond his years. \u201cThe way I see it, though, you need a man.\u201d</p><p>That was news to her. \u201cWhy? I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I won\u2019t be around much longer, and I hate the thought of you getting old and gray all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be alone. Grandma will move in with me and the two of us will sit side by side in our rocking chairs and crochet afghans. For entertainment we\u2019ll play bingo every Saturday afternoon.\u201d Even as she spoke, Carol realized how ridiculous that was.</p><p>\u201cGrandma would drive you crazy in three days,\u201d Peter said with a know-it-all smile, waving his fork in her direction. \u201cBesides, you\u2019d get fat eating all her homemade pasta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Carol agreed, unwilling to argue the point. \u201cBut I have plenty of time before I have to worry about it. Anything can happen in the next few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried now,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou\u2019re letting your life slip through your fingers like...like the sand in an hourglass.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes connected with her son\u2019s. \u201cHave you been watching soap operas again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Peter cried, \u201cyou\u2019re not taking me seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, trying to hide the smile that raised the corners of her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s just that my life is full. I\u2019m simply too busy to spend time developing a relationship.\u201d One look from her son told her he didn\u2019t accept her explanation. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d she told him, setting her fork aside, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019m a big girl. When and if I decide to see another man, I promise it\u2019ll be someone muscular so you can brag to your friends. Would a wrestler be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least you could\u2019ve done was get married again,\u201d he muttered, his patience clearly strained. \u201cDad would\u2019ve wanted that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Any mention of Peter\u2019s father brought with it a feeling of terror and guilt. They\u2019d both been far too young and foolish to get married. They were high school seniors when Carol learned she was pregnant. Given her very traditional Catholic family, marriage had seemed the only option. She\u2019d also believed her love and their baby would change Bruce. For those reasons, Carol had agreed to marry him. But from that point to the moment Bruce had died in a terrible car accident three years later, Carol\u2019s life had been a living hell. She\u2019d have to be crazy to even consider remarriage.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she said, pointedly glancing at her watch and pushing her plate away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to end this conversation so abruptly, but I\u2019ve got to get to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being stubborn, but fine. It\u2019s your decision.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t have time to argue. She dumped the remainder of her meal in the garbage, rinsed off her plate and stuck it in the dishwasher. She left Peter after giving him instructions to take care of his own dishes, then she hurried into the bathroom.</p><p>She refreshed her makeup and ran a brush though her shoulder-length dark hair, then examined her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d she muttered, eyeing herself critically. Thirty-four wasn\u2019t exactly retirement age.</p><p>Releasing her breath, Carol let her shoulders fall. \u201cWho are you kidding?\u201d she said with a depressed sigh. She faced the mirror and glared at her image again. Peter might not think she needed Oil of Olay, but the dew was definitely off the rose.</p><p>Tugging at the skin on her cheekbones until it was stretched taut, she squinted at her reflection, trying to remember what she\u2019d looked like at eighteen. Young. Pretty. Stupid.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t any one of those now. And even if she\u2019d had the opportunity, she wouldn\u2019t go back. She\u2019d made plenty of mistakes, but there wasn\u2019t a single, solitary thing she\u2019d change about her current life. Although after Peter got his driver\u2019s license, she might modify that thought.</p><p>No, the only option open to her was the future, and she\u2019d face that, sagging skin and all.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cut into her musings. \u201cCan I invite a friend over tonight?\u201d</p><p>Carol opened the bathroom door and frowned at her son. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even ask that. You know the rules. No one\u2019s allowed here when I\u2019m not home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cNo exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing this now. I have a class to teach, and I\u2019m already five minutes behind schedule.\u201d She blamed Peter for that. If he hadn\u2019t tried to convince her how attractive she was, she wouldn\u2019t be late in the first place.</p><p>Class went well. They were into the third week of the eight-week course sponsored by Ford Hospital in a suburb of Portland, Oregon. The couples were generally first-time parents, and their eagerness and excitement for the adventure that lay before them filled each session with infectious enthusiasm.</p><p>If Carol had known when she was carrying Peter that he was to be her one and only pregnancy, she would\u2019ve taken time to appreciate it more.</p><p>Since she was the last to leave the building, Carol turned off the lights and hauled her material out to her car. The parking lot was well lit, and she hurried through the rain, sliding inside the car. She drew in a deep breath and turned the ignition key. The Ford coughed and objected before roaring to life. Her car had been acting a little funny lately, but it was nothing she could pinpoint. Satisfied that there wasn\u2019t anything too terribly wrong, she eased into traffic on the busy street.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d stopped for the red light at the first intersection that her car released a series of short pathetic coughs, only this time it really sounded...sick.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she cried as the light turned green. Pushing down on the accelerator, she leaped ahead, but it was apparent that the problem, whatever it might be, was serious.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d she said, \u201cI get the message. You need a mechanic and fast.\u201d A quick glance down the business-lined thoroughfare revealed there wasn\u2019t a single service station in sight.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she moaned. \u201cHow about if I promise not to let Peter behind the wheel for a while. Will that help?\u201d</p><p>The ailing car belched loudly and a plume of black smoke engulfed the rear end.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re not interested in a deal.\u201d Turning into the first driveway she happened upon, Carol found herself in a restaurant parking lot. The minute she entered an empty space, the car uttered one last groan and promptly died. And of course she\u2019d left her cell phone charging\u2014at home.</p><p>For a full minute Carol just sat here. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d Her car disagreed. Climbing out, she walked around it, as if she\u2019d magically discover a cure lying on the ground. The rain was coming down in sheets, and within seconds, she was drenched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In an act of angry frustration, she kicked a tire, then yelped when the heel of her pump broke off. She wanted to weep.</p><p>With no other alternative, she limped into the restaurant, intent on heading for the ladies\u2019 room. Once she composed herself, she\u2019d deal with the car and call Peter to tell him she was going to be late.</p><p>Alex thought that if his date giggled one more time, he\u2019d have to walk away from the table. Thanks to this woman, he was going slowly insane. He should know by now never to accept a blind date.</p><p>The first thing Bambi did when they were seated at the restaurant was to pick up the saltshaker and start discussing the \u201camazing\u201d qualities of crystal.</p> <p>It took Alex five minutes to make the connection. The saltshaker was made of crystal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about hot tubs,\u201d Bambi said, leaning forward to offer him a generous view of her ample breasts.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re...hot, all right,\u201d Alex murmured, examining the menu without much enthusiasm. His friend\u2014at least someone he used to consider a friend\u2014claimed Bambi was every man\u2019s dream. Her name should have been his first clue. Once they\u2019d met, he\u2019d learned her given name was Michelle, but she\u2019d started calling herself Bambi because she loved forest animals so much. Animals like deer and chipmunks and hamsters.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that in all the years he\u2019d been camping, he had yet to stumble upon a single family of hamsters grazing in a meadow.</p><p>When the waitress came to take their order, it took Bambi five minutes to explain how she wanted her salad served. Okay, he was exaggerating. Four minutes. He ordered a steak and asked for it rare.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on a diet,\u201d Bambi said, once the waitress had left.</p><p>He smiled benignly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m fat, Alex?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her big brown eyes appealed to him to lie if he must. Once more she bunched her full breasts together and leaned toward him. It was more than obvious that she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. He suspected that he was supposed to swoon at the sight.</p><p>\u201cYou do think I\u2019m fat, don\u2019t you?\u201d Bambi asked, pouting prettily.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alex told her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that to be nice,\u201d she purred, and demurely lowered her lashes against the high arch of her cheek.</p><p>Alex smoothed out the linen napkin on his lap, thinking he was getting old. Far too old for someone like Bambi/Michelle. His teenage son might appreciate her finer qualities, but he suspected even James had better sense than that.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a hot tub?\u201d</p><p>Alex was so caught up in his thoughts, mentally calculating how long it would take to get through dinner so he could drive her home, that he didn\u2019t immediately realize she\u2019d directed the question at him.</p><p>\u201cI love hot tubs,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI even carry a swimsuit with me just in case my date has a tub. See?\u201d She reached inside her purse and held up the skimpiest piece of material Alex had seen in his entire life. It was all he could do not to grab it out of her hand and shove it back in her purse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a hot tub,\u201d he said, making a strenuous effort to remain civil.</p><p>\u201cOh, that poor, pathetic thing,\u201d Bambi said, looking past him to the front of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>Bambi used this opportunity to lean as far forward as possible, drape her breasts over his arm and whisper, \u201cA bag lady just came into the restaurant. She\u2019s drenched, and I think she might be hurt because she\u2019s limping pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>Although he really wasn\u2019t interested, Alex glanced over his shoulder. The instant his gaze connected with the woman Bambi was referring to, he twisted his chair around for a better view. \u201cThat\u2019s no bag lady,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was with my son and his best friend this afternoon. I think she\u2019s another friend of theirs.\u201d He paused. \u201cShe might be in some kind of trouble.\u201d He wasn\u2019t in the business of rescuing maidens in distress, but someone had to do something. \u201cWill you excuse me a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d Bambi cried, reaching out for his arm, stopping him. Half the restaurant turned to stare at them\u2014including the woman at the front. Even from halfway across the room, Alex could feel her eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t involve yourself in other people\u2019s problems,\u201d Bambi insisted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d He pulled his arm free.</p><p>\u201cHoney, one look at her and I can tell you she\u2019s no kid.\u201d</p><p>Disregarding Bambi\u2019s unsought advice, Alex dropped his napkin on the table, stood and walked away.</p><p>\u201cHello, again,\u201d he said when he reached his son\u2019s friend. Bambi was right about one thing. She looked terrible\u2014nothing like the way she\u2019d looked earlier. Her hair fell in wet tendrils that dripped on her jacket. Her mascara had left black streaks down her face, and she held the heel of her shoe in one hand. \u201cI\u2019m James\u2019s dad\u2014we met briefly this afternoon.\u201d He held out his hand to her. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she said stiffly, clearly resenting this intrusion. She glanced longingly at the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d she echoed. \u201cWhat could possibly be wrong?\u201d</p><p>She thrust out her chin proudly, but he resisted the urge to shake some sense into her. Sarcasm always set his teeth on edge. \u201cI\u2019d like to help if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but no thanks. Listen, I think you\u2019d better get back to your date.\u201d She nodded toward Bambi, and a smile quivered at the corners of her mouth. She had difficulty meeting his eyes.</p><p>Briefly Alex wondered what she found so amusing. But then again...he knew.</p><p>\u201cI thought she was supposed to be tall,\u201d she said next, and it sounded like she was trying not to laugh outright. Alex didn\u2019t appreciate her sense of humor, but he wasn\u2019t going to respond in kind. She was the one standing there looking like a drowned rat. Not him.</p><p>Her brows rose as she studied Bambi. \u201cActually two out of three isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>Alex had no idea what she was talking about. His expression must have said as much because she added, \u201cJim was telling Peter how your date for this evening was tall and blond and had big\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped abruptly, and Alex could swear she was blushing. A bright pink color started creeping up her neck and into her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>Bambi apparently wasn\u2019t about to be the center of their conversation while sitting down. She pushed back her chair, joined them near the hostess desk and slipped her arm through Alex\u2019s. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d care to introduce us, Alex darling.\u201d</p><p>Alex wanted to roll his eyes at the way she referred to him as \u201cdarling.\u201d They\u2019d barely met. He doubted Bambi knew his last name. He certainly didn\u2019t remember hers.</p><p>Since he wasn\u2019t sure of anyone\u2019s name, Alex gestured toward Carol and said, \u201cThis is a friend of my son\u2019s....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol Sommars,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>Alex was surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Peter had a sister.\u201d</p><p>Carol shot him a look. \u201cI\u2019m not his sister. I\u2019m his mother.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cHis mother,\u201d Alex echoed, clearly distressed. \u201cBut I thought...I assumed when you were with the boys that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got to be way over thirty!\u201d the blonde with her arm wrapped around Alex\u2019s exclaimed, eyeing Carol as possible competition.</p><p>Unwilling to be subjected to any debate over her age, Carol politely excused herself and headed blindly toward the ladies\u2019 room. The way her luck had been going this evening, it shouldn\u2019t be any shock that she\u2019d run into Alex Preston of all people\u2014and his infamous \u201chot date.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Carol examined herself in the mirror, she groaned and reached for her purse, hoping to repair the worst of the damage. No wonder Alex had mistaken her for a teenager. She looked like Little Orphan Annie on a bad day.</p><p>To add to her consternation, he was waiting for her when she left the restroom.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cWe got off to a bad start. Can I do something to help?\u201d</p><p>Carol thanked him with a smile. \u201cI appreciate that, but I don\u2019t want to ruin your evening. My car broke down and I don\u2019t have my cell. I\u2019m just going to call the auto club from here and have them deal with it.\u201d She already had the phone number and a quarter in her hand. The pay phone was just outside the restrooms.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Carol was grateful when he left. She was horrified by the way she\u2019d spoken to him earlier and wanted to apologize\u2014later. Alex had caught her at a bad moment, but he\u2019d made up for it by believing she was Peter\u2019s sister. That was almost laughable, but exceptionally flattering.</p><p>She finished her call and tried three frustrating times to get through to Peter, but the line was busy. Sitting in the restaurant foyer, she decided to give her son a few more minutes before calling again.</p><p>Alex strolled toward her. \u201cIs the auto club coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d she answered cheerfully, flashing him a smile.</p><p>\u201cDid you get hold of Peter?\u201d</p><p>Her facade melted away. \u201cI tried three times and can\u2019t get through. He\u2019s probably talking to Melody Wohlford, the love of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact James on my cell and have him get in touch with Peter for you. That way, you won\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She was more gracious this time. \u201cKnowing Peter, he could be on the phone for hours.\u201d</p><p>Alex stepped away and returned a minute later. \u201cJim was talking to Peter. Fortunately we have call waiting so I got through to him.\u201d He shook his head slightly. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their algebra homework together, which is probably good because Jim needs all the help he can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case it\u2019s the blind leading the blind.\u201d</p><p>Alex grinned, and the mouth she\u2019d found so arrogant and haughty earlier now seemed unusually appealing. His smile was sensual and affable at the same time and Carol liked it a whole lot. It had been a good many years since she\u2019d caught herself staring at a man\u2019s mouth. Self-conscious, she dragged her gaze away and looked past him into the restaurant.</p><p>Alex glanced uncomfortably at his table, where the other woman was waiting impatiently. \u201cWould you like to join us and have something to eat?\u201d he asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Carol said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s gray eyes reached out to hers in blatant appeal. \u201cPlease join us.\u201d</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t sure what was going on between Alex and his date, and she was even less sure about putting herself in the middle of it, but...Oh, well, why not?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed in a tentative voice.</p><p>Alex immediately looked grateful. He glanced back at the woman who was glaring at him, clearly displeased that he was paying so much attention to Carol.</p><p>However, if her disapproval bothered him, he didn\u2019t show it. He led Carol back to the table and motioned for the waitress to bring a menu. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have coffee.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the waitress was gone, Alex introduced the two women. \u201cBambi, Carol. Carol, Bambi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to make your acquaintance,\u201d Bambi said formally, holding out her hand. Carol thought she\u2019d never seen longer nails. They were painted a fire engine red and were a good inch in length.</p><p>\u201cAlex and I have sons the same age,\u201d Carol explained. Her coffee arrived, and she quickly took a sip to disguise her uneasiness.</p> <p>\u201cEat your dinner, Alex,\u201d Bambi instructed. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to let our evening be ruined by Carol\u2019s problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Carol said hurriedly. \u201cBy all means, don\u2019t let me keep you from your meal.\u201d</p><p>Alex reached for the steak knife. \u201cIs Peter trying out for track this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m positive that\u2019s the only reason he\u2019s managed to keep his grades up. He knows the minute he gets a D, he\u2019s off the team. Who knows what\u2019ll happen next year when he takes chemistry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim\u2019s decided to take chemistry his junior year, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took chemistry,\u201d Bambi told them. \u201cThey made us look inside a worm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s biology,\u201d Carol said kindly.</p><p>\u201cOh, maybe it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to apologize for the way I blew up this afternoon,\u201d Alex continued. \u201cI felt bad about it afterward. Yelling at Jim in front of his friends was not the thing to do. It\u2019s just that there are times my son frustrates me no end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I feel the same way about Peter when he does something I\u2019ve specifically asked him not to do.\u201d Feeling guilty for excluding Bambi from the conversation, Carol turned toward her and asked, \u201cDo you have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no. I\u2019m not even married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChildren can be extremely wonderful and extremely frustrating,\u201d Carol advised Bambi, who seemed far more interested in gazing lovingly at Alex.</p><p>\u201cJim only has one chore around the house during the week,\u201d Alex went on to say. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to take out the garbage. Every week it\u2019s the same thing. Garbage starts stacking up against the side of the refrigerator until it\u2019s as high as the cabinets, and Jim doesn\u2019t even notice. I end up having to plead with him to take it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd two days later he does it, right? Peter\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><p>Alex leaned forward and braced his forearms against the table, pushing his untouched steak aside. \u201cLast week, I didn\u2019t say a word, wanting to see how long it would take him to notice. Only when something began to stink did he so much as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass the salt,\u201d Bambi said, stretching her arm between Carol and Alex and reaching for it herself. She shook it over her salad with a vengeance, then slammed it down on the table.</p><p>Apparently Alex felt contrite for having ignored his date. He motioned toward her salad. \u201cBambi\u2019s on a diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not fat!\u201d Bambi cried. \u201cYou said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...no, I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you needed to be on a diet, I was just...making small talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t discuss my eating habits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the protein?\u201d Carol asked, examining Bambi\u2019s plate of greens. \u201cYou should be having some protein\u2014eggs, lean meat, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Bambi flared. \u201cJenny Craig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a nurse, and I work with pregnant women, and nutrition is such an important part of pregnancy that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not in the least.\u201d Every time Carol opened her mouth, it seemed she made an even worse mess of the situation. \u201cLook, I think the auto club might need some help finding me. If you\u2019ll both excuse me, I\u2019ll wait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Bambi said pointedly. \u201cYou\u2019re over thirty, so you can take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. The rain was coming down so hard it was jitterbugging across the asphalt parking lot. Standing just inside the restaurant doorway, Carol buried her hands in her pockets and shivered. She hadn\u2019t been there more than a few minutes when Alex joined her.</p><p>Before she could say anything, he thrust his hands in his own pockets, sighed and said, \u201cI gave her money for a taxi home.\u201d</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t on account of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave her another of his warm sensual smiles. \u201cIt was a blind date. I should\u2019ve known better than to let myself get talked into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out on one a while ago, and it was a disaster, too.\u201d It got worse the longer she was single. Her friends seemed to believe that since she\u2019d been alone for so many years, she should be willing to lower her standards. \u201cHow long have you been single?\u201d she asked Alex.</p><p>\u201cTwo years. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Peter keeps telling me. According to him, I\u2019m about to lose it and need to act fast. I haven\u2019t figured out precisely what it is, but I have a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim keeps telling me the same thing. Between him and Barney\u2014that\u2019s the guy who arranged this date\u2014they\u2019re driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. My brother\u2019s wife calls me at least once a week and reads me ads from the personal columns. She\u2019s now progressed to the Internet, as well. The one she picked out last week really got me. It was something like\u2014Male, thirty-five, dull and insecure, seeks exciting, wealthy female any age who\u2019s willing to love too much. Likes string cheese and popcorn. If you can do Sudoku for Dummies, I\u2019m the man for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should introduce him to Bambi.\u201d</p><p>They laughed together, and it felt natural.</p><p>\u201cGive me your car keys,\u201d Alex said suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll check it out and if it\u2019s something minor, I might be able to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is. When the engine died, it sounded pretty final.\u201d Nevertheless, she handed him her key ring and stood under the shelter while Alex ran across the parking lot to test her car. She stood on her tiptoes and watched him raise the hood, disappear under it for a few minutes and then close it and come running back to her.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, rubbing the black grease from his hands with a white handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cExcuse us, please,\u201d a soft feminine voice purred from behind Carol. Bambi slithered past them, her arm looped through that of a much older gentleman. She cast Carol a dirty look and smiled softly in Alex\u2019s direction before turning her attention to her most recent admirer. \u201cNow, what were you saying about your hot tub?\u201d</p><p>The two were barely out of earshot when Alex started to chuckle. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take her long, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d Carol felt obliged to say. \u201cI feel terrible...as though I personally ruined your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he countered. \u201cOn the contrary, you saved me. By the time you arrived, I was trying to figure out how long my patience was going to hold out. I had the distinct impression that before the evening was over I was going to be fighting her off.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughed. It didn\u2019t require much imagination to see Bambi in the role of aggressor. Come to think of it, Carol had dealt with a handful of Bambi\u2019s male counterparts over the years.</p><p>The rain had diminished and it was drizzling when the auto club van arrived. Alex walked the driver to Carol\u2019s car, and together the two men tried to determine what was wrong with her faithful Ford. They decided that whatever the problem was, it couldn\u2019t be fixed then and there and that the best thing to do was call a tow truck.</p><p>Carol agreed and signed on the dotted line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a lift home,\u201d Alex volunteered.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She was already in his debt; one more thing wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Within minutes, they were sitting inside Alex\u2019s car with the heater running full blast. Carol ran her hands up and down her arms to warm them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a minute. If I wasn\u2019t such a slave to fashion,\u201d she said with self-deprecating humor, \u201cI would\u2019ve worn something heavier than this cotton jacket. But it\u2019s the same pale green as my slacks and they go so well together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like Jim. It was forty degrees yesterday morning, and he insisted on wearing a shirt from last summer.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other, and Carol was conscious of how close they were in the snug confines of Alex\u2019s sports car. Her dark eyes met his warm gray ones. Without warning, the laughter faded from Alex\u2019s lips, and he studied her face. After viewing the damage earlier, Carol knew her hair hung in springy ringlets that resembled a pad used to scrub pots and pans. She\u2019d done the best she could, brushing it away from her face and securing it at the base of her neck with a wide barrette she\u2019d found in the bottom of her purse. Now she was certain the tail that erupted from her nape must be sticking straight out.</p><p>A small lump lodged in her throat, as though she\u2019d tried to swallow a pill without water. \u201cYou never did get your dinner, did you?\u201d she asked hastily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I owe you. Please...stop somewhere and let me treat you. It\u2019s after nine\u2014you must be starved.\u201d She glanced at her watch and felt a blush heat her cheeks. It\u2019d been longer than she could recall since a man had unsettled her quite this much.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy. I\u2019ll make myself a sandwich once I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist, you can have me over to eat sometime. All right? When it comes to dinner, Jim and I share the duties. A good home-cooked meal would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t have any choice but to agree, and she did so by nodding her damp head briskly until she realized she was watering the inside of his car. \u201cOh, sure, I\u2019d like that.\u201d She considered saying that she came from a large Italian family and was an excellent cook, but that would sound too much like the personal ads her sister-in-law, Paula, insisted on reading to her.</p><p>\u201cYou do cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Once more she held her tongue. Whereas a few moments earlier she\u2019d been cold, now she felt uncomfortably warm. Her hands were clammy and her stomach was filled with what seemed like a swarm of bees.</p><p>They chatted amicably on the rest of the drive to her house. When Alex pulled into her driveway, she turned and smiled at him, her hand on her door handle. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful for all your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...I\u2019m sorry about what happened with Bambi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said, then chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call later, all right? To check on your car....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The question seemed to hang between them, heavy with implication. It was the \u201call right\u201d that told her he was referring to something beyond the state of her car.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said almost flippantly, feeling more than a little light-headed.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about this man who brings color back to my little girl\u2019s cheeks,\u201d Angelina Pasquale said to Carol as she carried a steaming plate of spaghetti to the table.</p><p>Carol\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know how to cook for three or four; it was twelve or fifteen servings for each and every Sunday dinner. Her two older sisters lived in California now, and only Tony and Carol and their families came religiously for Sunday dinner. Her mother, however, continued to cook as if two or three additional families might walk in unannounced for the evening meal.</p> <p>\u201cMama, Alex Preston and I just met last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what Peter said.\u201d The older woman wiped her hands on the large apron tied around her thick waist. Her dark hair, streaked with gray, was tucked into a neat bun. She wore a small gold crucifix that had been given to her by Carol\u2019s father forty-two years earlier.</p><p>Carol brought the long loaves of hot bread from the oven. \u201cAlex is Jim\u2019s father. You remember Peter\u2019s friend, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he is. Preston might be an English name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnglish,\u201d Angelina said as if she was spitting out dirty dishwater. \u201cYou gonna marry a non-Italian again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Carol said, silently laughing, \u201cAlex helped me when my car broke down. I owe him dinner, and I insisted on taking him out to repay him. We\u2019re not stopping off at the church to get married on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s not even Catholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Carol cried. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest clue where he attends church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taking a man to dinner instead of cooking for him is bad enough. But not even knowing if he\u2019s Catholic is asking for trouble.\u201d She raised her eyes as if pleading for patience in dealing with her youngest daughter; when she lowered her gaze, they fell to Carol\u2019s feet. She folded her hands in prayerlike fashion. \u201cYou wear pointed-toe shoes for this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wear these for Alex. I happen to like them\u2014they\u2019re in style.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna deform your feet. One day, you\u2019ll trip and end up facedown in the gutter like your cousin Celeste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m not going to end up in a gutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin Celeste told her mother the same thing, and we both know what happened to her. She had to marry a foot doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, please don\u2019t worry about my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t let anyone say your mama didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>Carol had to leave the room to keep from laughing. Her mother was the delight of her life. She drove Carol crazy with her loony advice, but Carol knew it was deeply rooted in love.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d Angelina said, surveying the table, \u201ctell everyone dinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Peter was in the living room with his younger cousins, who were watching the Dodgers play Kansas City in a hotly contested baseball game.</p> <p>\u201cDinner\u2019s on the table, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Mom. It\u2019s the bottom of the eighth, with two out.\u201d Peter\u2019s intense gaze didn\u2019t waver from the screen. \u201cBesides, Uncle Tony and Aunt Paula aren\u2019t back from shopping yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll eat later.\u201d Carol\u2019s brother Tony and his wife had escaped for the afternoon to Clackamas Town Center, a large shopping mall south of Portland, and they weren\u2019t expected back until much later.</p><p>\u201cJust a few more minutes,\u201d Peter pleaded.</p><p>\u201cMama made zabaglione,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>The television went off in a flash, and four children rushed into the dining room, taking their places at the table like a rampaging herd of buffalo. Peter was the oldest by six years, which gave him an air of superiority over his cousins.</p><p>Sunday dinner at her mother\u2019s was tradition. They were a close-knit family and helped one another without question. Her brother had lent her his second car while hers was being repaired. Carol didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do without him. She\u2019d have her own car back in a few days, but Tony\u2019s generosity had certainly made her life easier.</p><p>Mama treasured these times with her children and grandchildren, generously offering her love, her support and her pasta. Being close to her family was what had gotten Carol through the difficult years following Bruce\u2019s death. Her parents had been wonderful, helping her while she worked her way through college and the nursing program, caring for Peter when she couldn\u2019t and introducing her to a long list of nice Italian men. But after three years of dealing with Bruce\u2019s mental and physical abuse, she wasn\u2019t interested. The scars from her marriage ran deep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say grace now,\u201d Angelina said. They all bowed their heads and closed their eyes.</p><p>No one needed any encouragement to dig into the spaghetti drenched in a sauce that was like no other. Carol\u2019s mother was a fabulous cook. She insisted on making everything from scratch, and she\u2019d personally trained each one of her three daughters.</p><p>\u201cSo, Peter,\u201d his grandmother said, tearing off a thick piece from the loaf of hot bread. \u201cWhat do you think of your mother marrying this Englishman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Grandma, it\u2019s not like that. Mr. Preston called and Mom\u2019s treating him to dinner \u2019cause he gave her a ride home. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was what she said when she met your father. \u2018Ma,\u2019 she told me, \u2018it\u2019s just dinner.\u2019 The next thing I know, she\u2019s standing at the altar with this non-Italian and six months later the priest was baptizing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa! Please,\u201d Carol cried, embarrassed at the way her mother spoke so freely\u2014although by now she should be used to it.</p><p>\u201cPreston.\u201d Her mother muttered the name again, chewing it along with her bread. \u201cI could accept the man if he had a name like Prestoni. Carol Prestoni has a good Italian ring to it...but Preston. Bah.\u201d</p><p>Peter and Carol exchanged smiles.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s real nice, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>Angelina expertly wove the long strands of spaghetti around the tines of her fork. \u201cYour mama deserves to meet a nice man. If you say he\u2019s okay, then I have to take your word for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, it\u2019s only one dinner.\u201d Carol wished she\u2019d never said anything to her mother. Alex had called the night before, and although he sounded a little disappointed that she wouldn\u2019t be making the meal herself, he\u2019d agreed to let her repay the favor with dinner at a local restaurant Monday night. Her big mistake was mentioning it to her mother. Carol usually didn\u2019t say anything to her family when she was going out on a date. But for some reason, unknown even to herself, she\u2019d mentioned Alex as soon as she\u2019d walked in the door after church Sunday morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat color eyes does this man have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Carol answered and poured herself a glass of ice water.</p><p>Peter turned to his mother. \u201cHow\u2019d you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I just recall they were...that color.\u201d Carol felt her cheeks flush. She concentrated on her meal, but when she looked up, she saw her mother watching her closely. \u201cHis eyes are sort of striking,\u201d she said, mildly irritated by the attention her mother and her son were lavishing on her.</p><p>\u201cI never noticed,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cA boy wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Angelina told him, \u201cbut your mother, well, she looks at such things.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t entirely true, but Carol wasn\u2019t about to claim otherwise.</p><p>As soon as they were finished with the meal, Carol\u2019s mother brought out the zabaglione, a rich sherry-flavored Italian custard thick with eggs. Angelina promptly dished up six bowls.</p><p>\u201cMama, zabaglione\u2019s high in fat and filled with cholesterol.\u201d Since her father\u2019s death from a heart attack five years earlier, Carol worried about her mother\u2019s health, although she wasn\u2019t sure her concern was appreciated.</p><p>\u201cSo zabaglione\u2019s got cholesterol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mama, cholesterol clogs the veins. It could kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t eat zabaglione, then I might as well be dead.\u201d</p><p>Smiling wasn\u2019t what Carol should have done, but she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>When the dishes were washed and the kitchen counters cleaned, Carol and her mother sat in the living room. Angelina rocked in the chair her mother\u2019s mother had brought from Italy seventy years earlier. Never one for idle hands, she picked up her crocheting.</p><p>It was a rare treat to have these moments alone with her mother, and Carol sat on the sofa, feet tucked under her, head back and eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cWhen am I gonna meet this Englishman of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Carol said with a sigh, opening her eyes, \u201cyou\u2019re making me sorry I ever mentioned Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to tell me about him. I would have asked because the minute you walked in the house I could see a look in your eyes. It\u2019s time, my bambina. Peter is growing and soon you\u2019ll be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d</p><p>Her mother discredited that comment with a shake of her head. \u201cYou need a husband, one who will give you more children and bring a sparkle to your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s heart started thundering inside her chest. \u201cI...I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever remarry, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah!\u201d the older woman said. A few minutes later, she murmured something in Italian that Carol could only partially understand, but it was enough to make her blush hotly. Her mother was telling her there were things about a man that she shouldn\u2019t be so quick to forget.</p><p>The soft Italian words brought a vivid image to Carol\u2019s mind\u2014an image of Alex holding her in his arms, gazing down at her, making love to her. It shocked her so much that she quickly made her excuses, collected Peter and drove home.</p><p>Her pulse rate hadn\u2019t decreased by the time she arrived back at her own small house. Her mother was putting too much emphasis on her dinner date with Alex...far more than necessary or appropriate.</p><p>As soon as Peter went over to a neighbor\u2019s to play video games, Carol reached for the phone. When voice mail kicked in on the fourth ring, she immediately hung up.</p><p>On second thought, this was better, she decided, and dialed again, planning to leave a message. \u201cYou\u2019re a coward,\u201d she muttered as she pushed down the buttons.</p><p>Once more the recorded message acknowledged her call. She waited for the greeting, followed by a long beep.</p><p>\u201cHello...Alex, this is Carol...Carol Sommars. About our dinner date Monday night...I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m going to have to cancel. Something...has come up. I apologize that thisissuchshortnotice. Bye.\u201d The last words tumbled together in her haste to finish.</p><p>Her face was flushed, and sweat had beaded on her upper lip as she hung up the phone. With her hand on the receiver, she slowly expelled her breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mother was right. Alex Preston was the one man who could bring the light back into her eyes, and she\u2019d never been more frightened in her life.</p><p>Three</p><p>Carol\u2019s hand remained closed around the telephone receiver as she heaved in a giant breath. She\u2019d just completed the most cowardly act of her life.</p><p>Regretting her actions, she punched out Alex\u2019s phone number again, and listened to the recorded message a third time while tapping her foot. At the beep, she paused, then blurted out, \u201cI hope you understand...I mean...oh...never mind.\u201d With that, she replaced the receiver, pressed her hand over her brow, more certain than ever that she\u2019d just made a world-class idiot of herself.</p> <p>Half an hour later, Carol was sorting through the dirty clothes in the laundry room when Peter came barreling into the house.</p><p>He paused in the doorway, watching her neatly organize several loads. \u201cHey, Mom, where\u2019s the TV guide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the television?\u201d she suggested, more concerned about making sure his jeans\u2019 pockets were empty before putting them in the washer.</p><p>\u201cFunny, Mom, real funny. Why would anyone put it there?\u201d</p><p>Carol paused, holding a pair of dirty jeans to her chest. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where it belongs?\u201d she said hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but when\u2019s the last time anyone found it there?\u201d</p><p>Not bothering to answer, she dumped his jeans in the washing machine. \u201cDid you look on the coffee table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not there. It isn\u2019t by the chair, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so keen to watch, anyway? Shouldn\u2019t you be doing your homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any...well, I do, but it\u2019s a snap.\u201d</p><p>Carol threw another pair of jeans into the churning water. \u201cIf it\u2019s so easy, do it now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t until Jim gets home.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Alex\u2019s son, Carol hesitated. \u201cI...see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, it\u2019s time for wrestling, but I don\u2019t know what channel it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrestling?\u201d Carol cried. \u201cWhen did you become interested in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim introduced me to it. I know it looks phony and stuff, but I get a kick out of those guys pounding on each other and the crazy things they say.\u201d</p><p>Carol turned and leaned against the washer, crossing her arms. \u201cPersonally I\u2019d rather you did your homework first, and if there\u2019s any time left over you can watch television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d prefer that,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou\u2019re a mom\u2014you\u2019re supposed to think that way. But I\u2019m a kid, and I\u2019d much rather watch Mr. Muscles take on Jack Beanstalk.\u201d</p><p>Carol considered her son\u2019s argument for less than two seconds. \u201cDo your homework.\u201d</p> <p>Peter sighed, his shoulders sagging. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say that.\u201d Reluctantly he headed toward his bedroom.</p><p>With the wash taken care of, Carol ventured into the backyard, surveying her neatly edged flower beds. Besides perennials, she grew Italian parsley, basil and thyme and a few other herbs in the ceramic pots that bordered her patio. One of these days she was going to dig up a section of her lawn and plant an honest-to-goodness garden.</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d Peter was shouting her name from inside the house.</p><p>She turned, prepared to answer her son, when she saw Alex walk out the back door toward her. Her heart did a somersault, then vaulted into her throat and stayed there for an uncomfortable moment.</p><p>\u201cHello, Alex,\u201d she managed to say, suspecting that her face had the look of a cornered mouse. She would gladly have given six months\u2019 mortgage payments to remove her messages from his voice mail. It wasn\u2019t easy to stand there calmly and not run for the fence.</p><p>\u201cHello, Carol.\u201d He walked toward her, his gaze holding hers.</p><p>He sounded so...relaxed, so calm, but his eyes were a different story. They were like the eyes of an eagle, sharp and intent. They\u2019d zeroed in on her as though he was about to swoop down for the kill.</p><p>For her part, Carol was a wreck. Her hands were clenched so tightly at her sides that her fingers ached. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, embarrassed by the way her voice pitched and heaved with the simple question.</p><p>A brief smile flickered at the edges of Alex\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...well, I can guess, but I think it would be best if you just came out and said it.\u201d She took a couple of steps toward him, feeling extraordinarily brave for having done so.</p><p>\u201cWill you offer me a cup of coffee?\u201d Alex asked instead.</p><p>The man was full of surprises. Just when she was convinced he was about to berate her for behaving like an utter fool, he casually suggested she make coffee. Perhaps he often confronted emotionally insecure women who left him nonsensical messages.</p><p>\u201cCoffee? Of course...come in.\u201d Pleased to have something to occupy her hands, Carol hurried into the kitchen. Once she\u2019d added the grounds to the filter and filled the coffeemaker with water, she turned and leaned against the counter, hoping to look poised. She did an admirable job, if she did say so herself\u2014at least for the first few minutes. After all, she\u2019d spent the last thirteen years on her own. She wasn\u2019t a dimwit, although she\u2019d gone out of her way to give him that impression, and she hadn\u2019t even been trying. That disconcerted her more than anything.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Alex said. He opened her cupboard and took down two ceramic mugs.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d Carol decided playing dumb might help. It had worked with Bambi, and who was to say it wouldn\u2019t with her? However, she had the distinct notion that if she suggested they try out a hot tub, Alex would be more than willing.</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you won\u2019t have dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>Carol was completely out of her element. She dealt with pregnancy and birth, soon-to-be mothers and terrified fathers, and she did so without a pause. But faced with one handsome single father, she was a worthless mass of frazzled nerves. Fearing her knees might give out on her, she walked over to the table, pulled out a chair and slumped into it. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly say I wouldn\u2019t go out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you say?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze, unable to meet his. \u201cThat...something came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He twisted the chair around and straddled it. The coffeemaker gurgled behind her. Normally she didn\u2019t even notice it, but now it seemed as loud as the roar of a jet plane.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll reschedule. Tuesday evening at six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I have a class...I teach a birthing class to expectant parents on Tuesday evenings.\u201d Now that was brilliant! Who else would attend those classes? But it was an honest excuse. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019d been when my car broke down in the parking lot of the restaurant where I met you...last Tuesday...remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I helped you,\u201d Alex reminded her. \u201cAs I recall, you claimed you wanted to repay me. Fact is, you insisted on it. You said I\u2019d missed my dinner because of you and that you\u2019d like to make it up to me. At first it was going to be a home-cooked meal, but that was quickly reduced to meeting at a restaurant in separate cars, and now you\u2019re canceling altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...did appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something about me that bothers you? Do I have bad breath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDandruff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she cried. She couldn\u2019t very well explain that their one meeting had jolted to life a part of her that had lain dormant for years. To say Alex Preston unsettled her was an understatement. She hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about him from the moment he\u2019d dropped her off at the house. Every thought that entered her mind was linked to those few minutes they\u2019d spent alone in his car. She was an adult, a professional, but he made her forget everything\u2014except him. In thinking about it, Carol supposed it was because she\u2019d married so young and been widowed shortly afterward. It was as though she didn\u2019t know how to behave with a man, but that wasn\u2019t entirely true, either. For the past several years, she\u2019d dated numerous times. Nothing serious of course, but friendly outings with \u201csafe\u201d men. One second with Alex, and she\u2019d known instantly that an evening with him could send her secure, tranquil world into a tailspin.</p><p>\u201cWednesday then?\u201d</p><p>Carol looked warily across the kitchen, wanting to weep with frustration. She might as well be a good sport about it and give in. Alex wasn\u2019t going to let her off the hook without a fuss.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and for emphasis, nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Wednesday evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Alex stood and twisted the chair back around. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d He sent her one of his smiles and was gone before the coffee finished brewing.</p><p>Once she was alone, Carol placed her hands over her face, feeling the sudden urge to cry. Closing her eyes, however, was a mistake, because the minute she did, her mother\u2019s whispered words, reminding her of how good lovemaking could be, saturated her thoughts. That subject was the last thing Carol wanted to think about, especially when the man she wanted to be making love with was the one who had so recently left her kitchen.</p><p>Abruptly she stood and poured herself a cup of coffee. It didn\u2019t help to realize that her fingers were shaking. What was so terrific about men and sex, anyway? Nothing that she could remember. She\u2019d been initiated in the backseat of a car at eighteen with the boy she was crazy in love with. Or the boy she thought she was in love with. More likely it had been hormones on the rampage for both of them.</p><p>After she\u2019d learned she was pregnant, Carol was never convinced Bruce had truly wanted to marry her. Faced with her hotheaded father and older brother, he\u2019d clearly regarded marriage as the more favorable option.</p><p>In the last of her three years with Bruce, he\u2019d been drunk more than he was sober\u2014abusive more than he was considerate. Lovemaking had become a nightmare for her. Feeling violated and vaguely sick to her stomach, she would curl up afterward and lie awake the rest of the night. Then Bruce had died, and mingled with the grief and horror had been an almost giddy sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a man in my life,\u201d she said forcefully.</p><p>Peter was strolling down the hallway to his room and stuck his head around the doorway. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Carol wanted to swallow her tongue. \u201cNothing important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d Peter told Carol on Wednesday when she finished with her makeup.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, smiling at him. Her attitude toward this evening out with Alex had improved now that she\u2019d had time to sort through her confused emotions. Jim\u2019s father was a nice guy, and to be honest, Carol didn\u2019t know what had made her react the way she did on Sunday. She was a mature adult, and there was nothing to fear. It wasn\u2019t as though she was going to fall into bed with the man simply because she was attracted to him. They\u2019d have the dinner she owed him and that would be the end of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But, as much as she would\u2019ve liked to deny it, Alex was special. For the first time since she could remember, she was physically attracted to a man. And what was wrong with that? It only went to prove that she was a normal, healthy woman. In fact, she should be grateful to Alex for helping her realize just how healthy she was.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Preston taking you?\u201d Peter asked, plopping himself down on the edge of the tub.</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m taking him, and I thought we\u2019d go to Jake\u2019s.\u201d Jake\u2019s was a well-known and well-loved Portland restaurant renowned for its Cajun dishes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking Mr. Preston to Jake\u2019s?\u201d Peter cried, his voice shrill with envy. \u201cAre you bringing me back anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d As it was, she was stretching her budget for the meal.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom\u2014Jake\u2019s? You know that\u2019s my favorite restaurant in the whole world.\u201d He made it sound as though he were a global traveler and connoisseur of fine dining.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you there on your birthday.\u201d The way she had every year since he was ten.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s another five months,\u201d Peter grumbled.</p><p>She gave him what she referred to as her \u201cMother Look,\u201d which generally silenced him.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll eat frozen pot pie for the third time in a week. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighed with feeling. \u201cYou go ahead and enjoy your \u00e9touff\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will.\u201d She generally ordered the shrimp dish, which was a popular item on the menu.</p><p>Peter continued to study her, his expression revealing mild surprise. \u201cGee, Mom, don\u2019t you have a heart anymore? I used to be able to get you with guilt, but you hardly bat an eyelash anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve got a heart. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the wallet to support it.\u201d</p> <p>Peter seemed about to speak again, but the doorbell chimed and he rushed out of the tiny bathroom to answer it as though something dire would happen if Alex was kept waiting more than a few seconds.</p><p>Expelling a sigh, Carol surveyed her appearance in the mirror one last time, confident that she looked her best. With a prepared smile on her face, she headed for the living room.</p><p>The instant she appeared, Alex\u2019s gaze rushed to hers. The impact of seeing him again was immediate. It was difficult to take her eyes off him. Instead, she found herself thinking that his build suggested finely honed muscles. He was tall, his shoulders were wide and his chest solid. Carol thought he was incredibly good-looking in his pin-striped suit. His face was weathered from working out of doors, his features bronzed by the sun.</p><p>So much for the best-laid plans, Carol mused, shaking from the inside out. She\u2019d planned this evening down to the smallest detail. They would have dinner, during which Carol would subtly inform him that she wasn\u2019t interested in anything more than a casual friendship, then he\u2019d take her home, and that would be the end of it. Five seconds after she\u2019d walked into the living room, she was thinking about silk sheets and long, slow, heart-melting kisses.</p><p>Her mother was responsible for this. Her outrageous, wonderful mother and the softly murmured Italian words that reminded Carol she was still young and it was time to live and love again. She was alive, all right. From the top of her head to the bottom of her feet, she was alive.</p><p>\u201cHello, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s taking you to Jake\u2019s,\u201d Peter muttered, not bothering to hide his envy. \u201cShe can\u2019t afford to bring me anything, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she chastised, doubting Alex had heard him.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, taking an additional moment to gather her composure while she reached for her jacket and purse. Glancing at her son, she felt obliged to say, \u201cYou know the rules. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to phone,\u201d he said, making a show of rolling his eyes as if to suggest she was going overboard on this parental thing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back early.\u201d</p><p>Alex cupped her elbow as he directed her to the door. \u201cNot too early,\u201d he amended.</p><p>By the time they were outside, Carol had bridled her fears. Her years of medical training contributed to her skill at presenting a calm, composed front. And really, there wasn\u2019t a reason in the world she should panic....</p><p>They talked amicably on the drive into downtown Portland, commenting on such ordinary subjects as the weather, when her car would be fixed and the approach of summer, which they both dreaded because the boys would be constantly underfoot.</p><p>Alex managed to find parking on the street, which was a feat in its own right. He opened her car door and took her hand, which he didn\u2019t release.</p><p>Since Carol had made a reservation, they were immediately seated in a high-backed polished wood booth and greeted by their waiter, who brought them a wine list and recited the specials of the day.</p><p>\u201cJim tells me you\u2019re buying him a truck,\u201d Carol said conversationally when they\u2019d placed their order.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019d like to believe.\u201d</p><p>Carol hesitated. \u201cYou mean you aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to the best of my knowledge,\u201d Alex admitted, grinning.</p><p>Once more, Carol found herself fascinated by his smile. She found herself wondering how his mouth would feel on hers. As quickly as the thought entered her mind, she discarded it.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Jim it\u2019s going to be the latest model, red with flames decorating the sidewalls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy likes to dream,\u201d Alex said, leaning back. \u201cIf he drives any vehicle during the next two years, it\u2019ll be because he\u2019s impressed me with his grades and his maturity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alex,\u201d Carol said with a sigh, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how relieved I am to hear that. For weeks, Peter\u2019s been making me feel as though I\u2019m an abusive mother because I\u2019m not buying him a car\u2014or, better yet, a truck. Time and time again he\u2019s told me that you\u2019re buying one for Jim and how sharing the Ford with me could damage his self-esteem, which might result in long-term counseling.\u201d</p><p>Alex laughed outright. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he added, \u201cJim isn\u2019t Jim anymore, he\u2019s James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. He noticed that his learner\u2019s permit listed his name as James Preston, and he\u2019s insisting everyone call him that. Actually, I think he came up with the idea after I spoke to him about driving and his level of maturity. Apparently, James is more mature-sounding than Jim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Carol returned, smiling. \u201cWell, at least if Peter does end up having to go to a counselor, he\u2019ll have company.\u201d</p><p>Their wine arrived and they both commented on its delicious flavor and talked about the quality of Walla Walla area wineries.</p><p>Their meal came soon after. The steaming \u00e9touff\u00e9e was placed before her, and she didn\u2019t experience the slightest bit of guilt when she tasted the first bite. It was as delicious as she remembered.</p><p>\u201cHave you been a nurse long?\u201d Alex asked, when their conversation lagged.</p><p>\u201cEight years. I returned to school after my husband was killed, and nursing was a natural for me. I was forever putting Band-Aids on my dolls and treating everyone from my dog to my tolerant mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I have a cold, I\u2019ll know who to call,\u201d Alex teased.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. And when I\u2019m ready to put the addition on the house, I\u2019ll contact you,\u201d Carol told him.</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>The evening wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as Carol had feared. Alex was easy to talk to, and with the boys as common ground, there was never a lack of subject matter. Before Carol was aware of it, it was nearly ten.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said, sliding from the booth. \u201cI told Peter I\u2019d check in with him. Excuse me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Alex said, standing himself.</p><p>Carol was in the foyer on her cell, waiting for Peter to answer when she looked over and saw that Alex was using his own cell phone.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you said you were going to phone,\u201d he said, sounding offended. \u201cDo you know what time it is? When you say you\u2019re going to phone you usually do. James is worried, too. Where have you guys been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s\u2014you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, sweetheart, the evening got away from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Peter said and paused. \u201cSo you like Mr. Preston?\u201d</p><p>Carol hedged. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll go out with him again? What did you guys talk about? Just how long does it take to eat dinner, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, this isn\u2019t the time or place to be having this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there any leftovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Her son sighed as if he\u2019d actually been counting on her to bring home her untouched dinner\u2014a reward for the supreme sacrifice of having to eat chicken pot pie, which just happened to be one of his favorites.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be home? I mean, you don\u2019t have to rush on my account or anything, but you\u2019d never let me stay out this late on a weeknight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before eleven,\u201d she promised, ignoring his comment about the lateness of the hour. Sometimes Peter forgot who was the adult and who was the child.</p><p>\u201cYou do like Mr. Preston, don\u2019t you?\u201d His tone was too smug for comfort.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d She was about to replace the receiver when she heard him call her name. \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d she said sharply, impatiently.</p><p>He hesitated, apparently taken aback by her brusqueness. \u201cNothing, I just wanted to tell you to wake me up when you get home, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, feeling guilty.</p><p>She met Alex back at their table. \u201cEverything okay at home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better.\u201d There was no need to inform Alex of the inquisition Peter had attempted. \u201cWhat about Jim\u2014James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s surviving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we should think about getting home,\u201d Carol suggested, eager now to leave. The evening had flown by. At some point during dinner, her guard had slipped and she\u2019d begun to enjoy his company. There\u2019d been none of the terrible tension that had plagued her earlier.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Alex said with enough reluctance to alarm her. He\u2019d obviously enjoyed their time as much as she had.</p><p>They had a small disagreement over the check, which Alex refused to let her take. He silenced her protests by reminding her that she owed him a home-cooked meal and he wasn\u2019t accepting any substitutes. After a couple of glasses of wine and a good dinner, Carol was too mellow to put up much of an argument.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let Peter know,\u201d she said as they walked toward the car. Alex held her hand, and it seemed far too natural, but she didn\u2019t object. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Peter discovers you paid, he\u2019ll want to know why I didn\u2019t bring anything home for him.\u201d</p><p>Alex grinned as he unlocked his car door and held it open. He rested his hand on the curve of her shoulder. \u201cYou will make me that dinner sometime, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Before she realized what she was doing, Carol found herself nodding. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to compose herself by the time he\u2019d walked around the front of the car and joined her.</p> <p>Neither of them spoke on the drive back to her house. Carol\u2019s mind was filled with the things she\u2019d planned to tell him. The things she\u2019d carefully thought out before-hand\u2014about what a nice time she\u2019d had, and how she hoped they\u2019d stay in touch and what a good boy Jim\u2014James\u2014was and how Alex was doing a wonderful job raising him. But the trite, rehearsed words refused to come.</p><p>Alex pulled into her driveway and turned off the engine. The living room was dark and the curtains drawn. The only illumination was the dim light on her front porch. When Alex turned to face her, Carol\u2019s heart exploded with dread and wonder. His look was warm, eager enough to make her blood run hot...and then immediately cold.</p><p>\u201cI had a good time tonight.\u201d He spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d How weak she sounded, how tentative...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>They were the words she\u2019d feared\u2014and longed for. The deep restlessness she\u2019d experienced since the night her car had broken down reverberated within her, echoing through the empty years she\u2019d spent alone.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d She tried to remind herself of what her life had been like with Bruce. The tireless lies, the crazy brushes with danger as though he were courting death. The anger and impatience, the pain that gnawed at her soul. She thought of the wall she\u2019d so meticulously constructed around her heart. A wall years thick and so high no man had ever been able to breach it. \u201cI...don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Words could never explain her fear.</p><p>\u201cLet me revise my statement,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI need to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she cried. \u201cThis was only supposed to be one night...to thank you for your help. I can\u2019t give you any more...I just can\u2019t and...\u201d Her breath scattered, and her lungs burned within her chest. She couldn\u2019t deny the things he made her feel.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>But there was. Except he wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>He reached up and placed his calloused palm against her cheek.</p><p>Carol flinched and quickly shut her eyes. \u201cNo...please, I have to go inside...Peter\u2019s waiting for me.\u201d She grabbed the door handle, and it was all she could do not to escape from the car and rush into the house.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said huskily, removing his hand from her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, opening her eyes, and her startled gaze collided with his. She watched as he slowly appraised her, taking in her flushed face and the rapid rise and fall of her breasts. He frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine...really. Thank you for tonight. I had a marvelous time.\u201d</p><p>His hand settled over hers. \u201cYou\u2019ll see me again.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was safely inside her living room and her heart was back to normal that Carol realized his parting words had been a statement of fact.</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cSo, Dad, how did dinner go with Mrs. Sommars?\u201d James asked as he poured himself a huge bowl of cornflakes. He added enough sugar to make eating it worth his while, then for extra measure added a couple of teaspoons more.</p><p>Alex cupped his steaming mug of coffee as he considered his son\u2019s question. \u201cDinner went fine.\u201d It was afterward that stayed in his mind. Someone had hurt Carol and hurt her badly. He\u2019d hardly touched her and she\u2019d trembled. Her dark brown eyes had clouded, and she couldn\u2019t seem to get out of his car fast enough. The crazy part was, Alex felt convinced she was attracted to him. He knew something else\u2014she didn\u2019t want to be.</p><p>They\u2019d spent hours talking over dinner, and it had seemed as though only a few moments had passed. There was no need for pretense between them. She didn\u2019t pretend to be anything she wasn\u2019t, and he was free to be himself as well. They were simply two single parents who had a lot in common. After two years of dealing with the singles scene, Alex found Carol a refreshing change. He found her alluringly beautiful and at the same time shockingly innocent. During the course of their evening, she\u2019d argued with him over politics, surprised him with her wit and challenged his opinions. In those few hours, Alex learned that this intriguing widow was a charming study in contrasts, and he couldn\u2019t wait to see her again.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sommars is a neat lady,\u201d James said, claiming the kitchen chair across from his father. \u201cShe\u2019s a little weird, though.\u201d</p><p>Alex looked up from his coffee. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe listens to opera,\u201d James explained between bites. \u201cSings it, too\u2014\u201d he planted his elbows on the tabletop, leaned forward and whispered \u201c\u2014in Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Alex was impressed.</p><p>\u201cAt the top of her voice. Peter told me she won\u2019t let him play his rap CDs nearly as loud as she does her operas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe injustice of it all.\u201d</p><p>James ignored his sarcasm. \u201cPeter was telling me his grandmother\u2019s a real kick, too. She says things like \u2018Eat your vegetables or I\u2019m calling my uncle Vito in Jersey City.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Alex laughed, glanced at his watch and reluctantly got to his feet. He finished the last of his coffee, then set the mug in the sink. \u201cDo you have your lunch money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m not a kid anymore. You don\u2019t have to ask me stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Alex pressed.</p><p>James stood and reached inside his hip pocket. His eyes widened. \u201cI...guess I left it in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your driver\u2019s permit, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>Alex held up both hands. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He was all the way to the front door when James\u2019s shout stopped him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to pick me up from track practice, all right?\u201d</p><p>Alex pointed his finger at his son and calmly said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Alex complained.</p><p>James shrugged and leaned his shoulder against the door leading into the kitchen. \u201cIn case you\u2019re interested, Mrs. Sommars will be there, too.\u201d</p><p>Alex was interested. Very interested.</p><p>He left the house and climbed inside his work van, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with his hands on the steering wheel. He mulled over the events of the night before. He\u2019d dated several women recently. Beautiful women, intelligent women, wealthy women. A couple of them had come on hot and heavy. But not one had appealed to him as strongly as this widow with the dark, frightened eyes and the soft, delectable mouth.</p><p>A deep part of him yearned to stroke away the pain she held on to so tightly, whatever its source. He longed to watch the anxiety fade from her eyes when she settled into his arms. He wanted her to feel secure enough with him to relax. The urge to hold her and kiss her was strong, but he doubted Carol would let him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Peggy, bear down...push...as hard as you can,\u201d Carol urged the young mother-to-be, clutching her hand. Peggy did as Carol asked, gritting her teeth, arching forward and lifting her head off the hospital pillow. She gave it everything she had, whimpering softly with the intensity of the labor pain. When the contraction had passed, Peggy\u2019s head fell back and she took in several deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job,\u201d Carol said, patting her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer before my baby\u2019s born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Carol assured her. \u201cThe doctor\u2019s on his way now.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes drifted closed. \u201cWhere\u2019s Danny? I need Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d Carol had sent her patient\u2019s husband out for a much-needed coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Carol smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny wants a son so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be just as happy with a little girl.\u201d</p><p>Peggy smiled, but that quickly faded as another contraction started. She reached for Carol\u2019s hand, her face marked by the long hours she\u2019d struggled to give birth. Carol had spent the past hour with her. She preferred it when they weren\u2019t so busy and she could dedicate herself to one patient. But for more days than she cared to remember, the hospital\u2019s five labor rooms had been full, and she spent her time racing from one to the other.</p><p>Peggy groaned, staring at a focal point on the wall. The technique was one Carol taught in her classes. Concentrating on a set object helped the mother remember and practice the breathing techniques.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing just fine,\u201d Carol said softly. \u201cTake a deep breath now and let it out slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore...I can\u2019t,\u201d Peggy cried. \u201cWhere\u2019s Danny? Why\u2019s he taking so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back any second.\u201d Now that her patient was in the final stages of labor, the pains were stronger and closer together.</p><p>Danny walked into the room, looking pale and anxious...and so very young. He moved to the side of the bed and reached for his wife\u2019s hand, holding it to his cheek. He seemed as relieved as Peggy when the contraction eased.</p><p>Dr. Adams, old and wise and a hospital institution, sauntered into the room, hands in his pockets, smiling. \u201cSo, Peggy, it looks like we\u2019re going to finally have that baby.\u201d</p><p>Peggy grinned sheepishly. \u201cI told Dr. Adams yesterday I was sure I was going to be pregnant until Christmas. I didn\u2019t think this baby ever wanted to be born!\u201d</p><p>Phil Adams gave his instructions to Carol, and within a few minutes the medical team had assembled. From that point on, everything happened exactly as it should. Before another hour had passed, a squalling Danny, Jr., was placed in his father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cPeggy...oh Peggy, a son.\u201d Tears of joy rained down the young man\u2019s face as he sobbed unabashedly, holding his son close.</p><p>Although Carol witnessed scenes such as this day in and day out, the thrill of helping to bring a tiny being into the world never left her.</p><p>When her shift was over, she showered and changed clothes, conscious of the time. She had to pick Peter up from track practice on her way home, and she didn\u2019t want to keep him waiting, although she was the one likely to be twiddling her thumbs.</p><p>The first thing Carol noticed when she pulled into the school parking lot was a van with Preston Construction printed in large black letters on the side. Alex. She drew in a shaky breath, determined to be friendly but reserved. After the way she\u2019d escaped from his car the night before, it was doubtful he\u2019d want anything to do with her, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fact was, she couldn\u2019t blame him. She wasn\u2019t sure what had come over her. Then again, she did know...and she didn\u2019t want to dwell on it.</p><p>She parked a safe distance away, praying that either Peter would be finished soon and they could leave or that Alex wouldn\u2019t notice her arrival. She lowered the window to let in the warm breeze, then turned off the ignition and reached for a magazine, burying her face in its pages. For five minutes nothing happened.</p><p>When the driver\u2019s side of the van opened, Carol realized her luck wasn\u2019t going to hold. She did her best to concentrate on a recipe for stuffed pork chops and pretend she hadn\u2019t seen Alex approach her. When she glanced up, he was standing beside her car. Their eyes met for what seemed the longest moment of her life.</p><p>\u201cHello again.\u201d He leaned forward and rested his hands on her window.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only his smile that intrigued her, but his eyes. Their color was like a cool mist rising off a pond. Would this attraction she felt never diminish, never stop? Three brief encounters, and she was already so tied up in knots she couldn\u2019t think clearly.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d His eyes were relentless, searching for answers she couldn\u2019t give him to questions she didn\u2019t want him to ask.</p><p>She glanced away. \u201cGood. How about yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d He rubbed a hand along the back of his neck. \u201cI was going to call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if you\u2019d like to attend the Home Show with me Friday night. I thought we could have dinner afterward.\u201d</p><p>Carol opened her mouth to refuse, but he stopped her, laying his finger across her lips, silencing her. The instant his hand touched her, the warm, dizzy feeling began. As implausible, as preposterous as it seemed, a deep physical sensation flooded her body. And all he\u2019d done was lightly press his finger to her lips!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say no,\u201d Alex said, his voice husky.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t, at least not then. \u201cI...I\u2019ll have to check my schedule.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although it was an effort.</p><p>\u201cGood...I\u2019ll talk to you then.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d removed his finger, sliding it across her moist lips, that Carol breathed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t pick me up from track?\u201d Peter complained the next morning. \u201cHow else am I supposed to get home? Walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom track practice, of all things.\u201d She added an extra oatmeal cookie to his lunch because, despite everything, she felt guilty about asking him to find another way home. She was such a coward.</p><p>\u201cMom, coach works us hard\u2014you know that. I was so stiff last night I could barely move. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Regretfully, Carol did. A third cookie went into the brown-paper sack.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than picking me up?\u201d</p><p>Escaping a man. If only Alex hadn\u2019t been so gentle. Carol had lain awake half the night, not knowing what was wrong with her or how to deal with it. This thing with Alex, whatever it was, perplexed and bewildered her. For most of her life, Carol had given and received countless hugs and kisses\u2014from relatives, from friends. Touching and being touched were a natural part of her personality. But all Alex had done was press his finger to her lips, and her response...her response still left her stunned.</p><p>As she lay in bed, recalling each detail of their brief exchange, her body had reacted again. He didn\u2019t even need to be in the same room with her! Alone, in the wee hours of the morning, she was consumed by the need to be loved by him.</p><p>She woke with the alarm, in a cold sweat, trembling and frightened, convinced that she\u2019d be a fool to let a man have that kind of power a second time.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Peter said impatiently. \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was it you wanted to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked why you aren\u2019t going to be at track this afternoon. It\u2019s a simple question.\u201d</p><p>Intuitively Carol knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to escape Alex, and she\u2019d be a bigger fool than she already was even to try.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said, and handed him his lunch.</p><p>Peter stood frozen, studying her. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not coming down with a fever?\u201d</p><p>If only he knew...</p><p>When Carol pulled into the school parking lot later that same day, she saw Alex\u2019s van in the same space as the day before. Only this time he was standing outside, one foot braced against it, fingers tucked in his pockets. His jeans hugged his hips and fit tight across his thighs. He wore a checked work shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows.</p><p>When she appeared, he lowered his foot and straightened, his movement leisurely and confident.</p><p>It was all Carol could do to slow down and park her car next to his. To avoid being placed at a disadvantage, she opened her door and climbed out.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d she said, smiling so brightly her mouth felt as though it would crack.</p><p>\u201cHello again.\u201d</p><p>A lock of his dark hair fell over his forehead, and he threaded his fingers through its thickness, pushing it away from his face.</p><p>His gaze tugged at hers until their eyes met briefly, intently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warmer today than it was yesterday,\u201d she said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>Carol lowered her eyes to his chest, thinking she\u2019d be safe if she practiced what she preached. Find a focal point and concentrate. Only it didn\u2019t work as well in situations like this. Instead of saying what had been on her mind most of the day, she became aware of the pattern of his breathing, and how the rhythm of her own had changed, grown faster and more erratic.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rushed to his. \u201cAbout...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday night.\u201d</p><p>She wished it could be the way it had been in the restaurant. There was something about being with a crowd that relaxed her. She hadn\u2019t felt intimidated.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t think seeing each other is such a good idea. It\u2019d be best if we...stayed friends. I can foresee all kinds of problems if we started dating, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Home Show\u2019s going to cause problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...our seeing each other will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t care less. If anything, they approve. I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019d be any problems. I like you and you like me\u2014we\u2019ve got a lot in common. We have fun together. Where\u2019s the problem in that?\u201d</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t very well explain that when he touched her, even lightly, tiny atoms exploded inside her. Whenever they were within ten feet of each other, the air crackled with sensuality that grew more intense with each encounter. Surely he could feel it, too. Surely he was aware of it.</p><p>Carol held a hand to her brow, not knowing how to answer him. If she pointed out the obvious, she\u2019d sound like a fool, but she couldn\u2019t deny it, either.</p><p>\u201cI...just don\u2019t think our seeing each other is a good idea,\u201d she repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he countered. \u201cIn fact, it appeals to me more every minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alex, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Other cars were filling the parking lot, and the two of them had quickly become the center of attention. Carol glanced around self-consciously, praying he\u2019d accept her refusal and leave it at that. She should\u2019ve known better.</p><p>\u201cCome in here,\u201d Alex said, opening the side panel to his van. He stepped inside and offered her his hand. She joined him before she had time to determine the wisdom of doing so.</p><p>Alex closed the door. \u201cNow, where were we...ah, yes. You\u2019d decided you don\u2019t want to go out with me again.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t quite accurate, but she wasn\u2019t going to argue. She\u2019d rarely wanted anything more than to continue seeing him, but she wasn\u2019t ready. Yet...Bruce had been dead for thirteen years. If she wasn\u2019t ready by now, she never would be. The knowledge hit her hard, like an unexpected blow, and her eyes flew to his.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d He moved toward her. The walls of the van seemed to close in around her. She could smell the scent of his after-shave and the not unpleasant effects of the day\u2019s labor. She could feel the heat coming off his body.</p><p>Emotion thickened the air, and the need that washed through her was primitive.</p><p>She backed as far as she could against the orderly rows of tools and supplies stacked on the shelves. Alex towered above her, studying her with such tenderness and concern that she had to repress the urge to weep.</p><p>\u201cAre you claustrophobic?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>His eyes settled on her mouth, and Carol felt her body\u2019s reaction. She unconsciously held her breath so long that when she released it, it burned her chest. If she hadn\u2019t been so frightened, she would have marveled at what was happening between them, enjoyed the sensations.</p><p>Gently Alex whisked back a strand of hair from her face. At his touch, Carol took a deep breath, but he seemed to gain confidence when she didn\u2019t flinch away from him. He cupped her cheek.</p><p>Her eyes momentarily drifted shut, and she laid her own hand over his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>She knew it and was unwilling to dredge up the determination to stop him.</p><p>His hands slipped to her shoulders as he slowly drew her forward. She considered ending this now. At the least amount of resistance, he would have released her; she didn\u2019t doubt that for a second. But it was as if this moment had been preordained.</p><p>At first all he did was press his lips to hers. That was enough, more than enough. Her fingers curled into his shirt as he swept his mouth over hers.</p><p>She whimpered when he paused.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>Her breathing was shallow.</p><p>His was harsh.</p><p>He hesitated and lifted his head, eyes wide and shocked, his brow creased with a frown. Whatever he\u2019d decided, he didn\u2019t share, letting her draw her own conclusions.</p><p>Her hands were braced against his chest when he sought her mouth again. This time, the force of his kiss tilted back her head as he fused their lips together, giving her no choice but to respond. The heat, hot enough to scorch them both, intensified.</p><p>He kissed and held her, and her lungs forgot it was necessary to breathe. Her heart forgot to beat. Her soul refused to remember the lonely, barren years.</p><p>From somewhere far, far away, Carol heard voices. Her ears shut out the sound, not wanting anything or anyone to destroy this precious time.</p><p>Alex groaned, not to communicate pleasure but frustration. Carol didn\u2019t understand. Nor did she comprehend what was happening when he released her gradually, pushing himself away. He turned and called, \u201cThe door\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door?\u201d she echoed. It wasn\u2019t until then that she realized Alex was talking to the boys. Peter and Jim were standing outside the van, wanting in. She\u2019d been so involved with Alex that she hadn\u2019t even heard her own son calling her name.</p><p>\u201cPlease open that door,\u201d she said, astonished by how composed she sounded. The trembling hadn\u2019t started yet, but it would soon, and the faster she made her escape, the better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will in just a minute.\u201d He turned back to her and placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re going with me on Friday night. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>He cradled her face with his hands and kissed her once more, forcefully.</p><p>She gasped with shock and pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with you, Carol. We\u2019ve got something good between us, and I\u2019m not about to let you run away from it.\u201d</p><p>Standing stock-still, all she could do was nod.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose, then turned again and slid open the van door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with Mrs. Sommars?\u201d Jim demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve been standing out here for the past five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Peter said, studying her through narrowed eyes. \u201cEveryone else has gone home. Did you know you left your keys in the ignition?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...Mr. Preston was showing me his...van.\u201d She was sure her face was as red as a fire truck, and she dared not meet her son\u2019s eyes for fear he\u2019d know she\u2019d just been kissed. Good heavens, he probably already did.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Peter asked her.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why?\u201d Stepping down onto the pavement she felt as graceful as a hippo. James climbed in when she\u2019d climbed out; she and Peter walked over to her car.</p><p>\u201cI think you might be coming down with something,\u201d Peter said as he automatically sat in the driver\u2019s seat, assuming he\u2019d be doing the honors. He snapped the seat belt into place. \u201cThere were three cookies in my lunch, and no sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were?\u201d Carol distinctly remembered spreading peanut butter on the bologna slices\u2014Peter\u2019s favorite sandwich. She must have left it on the kitchen countertop.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, I traded off two of the cookies.\u201d He adjusted the rearview mirror and turned the key. He was about to pull out of the parking space when a huge smile erupted on his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you and Mr. Preston are getting along so well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Alex sat at his cluttered desk with his hands clasped behind his head, staring aimlessly into space. He\u2019d finally kissed her. He felt like a kid again. A slow, easy smile spread across his face, a smile so full, his cheeks ached. What a kiss it had been. Seductive enough to satisfy him until he could see her again. He was going to kiss her then, too. He could hardly wait.</p><p>The intercom buzzed. \u201cMr. Powers is here.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s smile brightened. \u201cSend him in.\u201d He stood and held out his hand to Barney, his best friend. They\u2019d been in college together, roommates their senior year, and had been close ever since. Barney was a rare kind of friend, one who\u2019d seen him through the bad times and the good times and been there for both in equal measure.</p><p>\u201cAlex, great to see you.\u201d He helped himself to a butterscotch candy from the bowl on the edge of the desk and sat down. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d It was on the tip of his tongue to tell Barney about Carol, but everything was so new, he didn\u2019t know if he could find the words to explain what he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Alex arched his eyebrows. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBambi. She said you dumped her at the restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that. It wouldn\u2019t have worked, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Barney said, unwrapping the candy and popping it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a hot tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe claimed you left with another woman. A bag lady?\u201d</p><p>Alex chuckled. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you needn\u2019t worry, because ol\u2019 Barn has met Ms. Right and is willing to share the spoils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarn, listen...\u201d</p><p>Barney raised his hand, stopping him. \u201cShe\u2019s perfect. I swear to you she\u2019s bright, beautiful and buxom. The three b\u2019s\u2014who could ask for anything more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, that\u2019s what you told me about Bambi,\u201d Alex countered, amused by his friend\u2019s attempts to find him a wife. It wouldn\u2019t be quite as humorous if Barney could stay married himself. In the past fifteen years, his friend had gone through three wives. Each of them bright, beautiful and buxom.</p><p>They might\u2019ve been the best of friends, but when it came to women, their tastes were as dissimilar as could be. Barney went for breasts, whereas Alex was far more interested in brains.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to let me introduce her, aren\u2019t you? I mean, the least you can do is meet Babette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d The guy had an obsession with B-words, Alex thought. The next woman would probably be named Brandy. Or Barbie.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even have a drink with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, not interested.\u201d</p><p>Barney leaned back and crossed his legs, sucking on the butterscotch candy for a few seconds before he spoke. \u201cShe was first runner-up for Miss Oregon several years back. Does that tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Alex said, reaching for a candy himself. \u201cShe looks terrific in a swimsuit and is interested in world peace.\u201d</p><p>Barney slowly shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. I thought you were ready to get back into dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, buddy, take a tip from me. Play the field, sample the riches available, then settle down. I\u2019m happier when I\u2019m married, and you will be, too. Frankly, with your looks and money, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have much of a problem. There are plenty of willing prospects out there. Only I notice you aren\u2019t doing anything to meet one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to, with you around. You\u2019re worse than a matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>Barney ignored that. \u201cIt\u2019s time, Alex. You said so yourself. Just how long are you going to wait? Gloria\u2019s been gone two years now. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d At the mention of his late wife, Alex felt a twinge of pain. Time had healed the worst of it, but he\u2019d always remember the agony of watching the woman he loved die.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to give you Babette\u2019s phone number?\u201d his friend asked gently.</p><p>Alex shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t bother to introduce me to any more of your women friends.\u201d</p><p>Barney\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cBut you just admitted I was right, that it\u2019s time to get out there and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the bag lady Bambi was telling you about?\u201d Alex asked, interrupting his friend before he could deliver the entire five-minute lecture.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mom, I like Mr. Preston,\u201d Peter announced over dinner as though this was a secret he\u2019d been waiting to share.</p><p>\u201cHe seems very nice,\u201d Carol agreed, reaching for a slice of tomato. She didn\u2019t want to say anything more to encourage this topic, so she changed it. \u201cHow was school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. James was telling me about all the neat things him and his dad do together, like camping and fishing and stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle Tony takes you with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot camping or fishing and besides, it\u2019s not the same,\u201d Peter murmured. \u201cUncle Tony\u2019s my uncle.\u201d</p><p>Carol paused, her fork over the plump red tomato. \u201cNow, that was profound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cGoing camping with Mr. Preston would be like having a dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d She took a bite of her roast, then braced her elbows on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Peter lapsed into silence as he mulled over his thoughts. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that James and I talked it over and we decided we\u2019d like it if the two of you got married.\u201d</p><p>Carol was so shocked by her son\u2019s statement that she stopped eating. Peter was staring at her intently, waiting for some sign or reaction.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he pressed. \u201cIs it going to happen? I can tell you like each other.\u201d</p><p>Chewing furiously, Carol waved her fork at her son, letting it speak for her. The meat, which had been so tender a moment before, took on the quality of leather. The faster she chewed, the more there seemed to be.</p><p>\u201cYou may think I\u2019m still a kid and I don\u2019t know much,\u201d Peter continued, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t take James and me long to figure out what was going on inside his dad\u2019s van.\u201d</p><p>The piece of meat finally slid down Carol\u2019s throat. She blinked, uncertain if she could speak normally.</p><p>Peter was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cI wish you could\u2019ve seen your face when Mr. Preston opened the door of the van.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t bother to disguise his amusement. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been arguing with James, I would\u2019ve started laughing right then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArguing with James?\u201d Those three words were all she could force past her lips. From the moment the two boys had met on the first day of high school, they\u2019d been the best of friends. In all the months since September, Carol couldn\u2019t remember them disagreeing even once.</p><p>\u201cWe had an argument when we couldn\u2019t get his dad to open the van,\u201d Peter admitted, his mouth twitching. \u201cYour face was so red, and you had this stunned look, like an alien had hauled you inside his spaceship.\u201d Peter\u2019s deepening voice vibrated with humor.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she demanded, furiously spearing another piece of meat. \u201cWhat did you argue about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe argued over what his father was doing with you in that van. What kind of son would I be if I didn\u2019t defend your...honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did James say?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cThat his dad wouldn\u2019t do anything you didn\u2019t want him to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were fighting words?\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged again. \u201cIt was the way he said them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Peter scooped himself a second helping of the scalloped potatoes. \u201cGetting back to the marriage part. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you need to finish your peas and carrots.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes rushed to hers, but only for a moment. Then he grinned. \u201cOh, I get it\u2014you want me to mind my own business. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think about it, Mom. Promise me you\u2019ll at least do that much. Meeting Mr. Preston could be the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you\u2019re finished with your dinner, I want you to stack the dirty dishes in the dishwasher,\u201d Carol said without a pause. She ate the last bite of her roast, although it tasted more like rubber.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I mention Mr. Preston, are you going to give me another job to do?\u201d</p><p>Her son was a quick study, Carol would grant him that.</p><p>\u201cBut you are going to see him again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cThe garbage should be taken out, and I noticed that the front flower beds should be weeded. I know you worked out there last Saturday, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Peter cried, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cEnough\u2014I get the message.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d she said and got up to carry her plate to the sink.</p><p>Carol waited until Peter was busy with his homework and the dishes were done before she snuck into the kitchen and turned off the light. Then she called Alex. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d do if James answered.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d She cupped her hand over the receiver and kept her eye on the doorway in case Peter strolled past.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk long. Listen, did James happen to have a heart-to-heart discussion with you about...us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. He said something about the two of them having a talk about you and me. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she whispered, ignoring his question. \u201cOver dinner Peter threw a grenade at my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech\u2014don\u2019t interrupt me. He said the two of them argued when you didn\u2019t open the van door and afterward decided it would be just great if the two of us...that\u2019s you and me...got married.\u201d She could barely get the words past the growing lump in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cNow that you mention it, James did say something along those lines.\u201d</p><p>Carol pressed her back to the kitchen wall, suddenly needing its support. \u201cHow can you be so casual about this?\u201d she burst out.</p><p>\u201cCasual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son announced that he knew what was going on inside the van and that I should\u2019ve seen my face and that fishing and camping with you would be like having a father.\u201d She paused long enough to draw in a breath.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then when I try to calmly warn you what these two are plotting, you make it sound like...I don\u2019t know...like we\u2019re discussing basketball or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarol, slow down, I can barely understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can\u2019t understand me\u2014I\u2019m upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, this is clearly disturbing you. We need to talk about it. Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go out for lunch, for heaven\u2019s sake\u2014I\u2019m a nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll meet you in the hospital cafeteria at noon.\u201d</p><p>Just then Peter strolled nonchalantly into the kitchen. He stood in the doorway, turned on the light and stared curiously at his mother.</p><p>\u201cSure, Mama, whatever you say,\u201d Carol said brightly\u2014too brightly.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Alex echoed chuckling. \u201cOkay, I get the picture. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at noon.\u201d</p> <p>Agreeing to meet Alex at the hospital was a mistake. Carol should have realized it immediately, but she\u2019d been so concerned with the shocking news Peter had delivered over dinner that she didn\u2019t stop to consider what could happen once she was spotted with Alex in the gossip-rich cafeteria at Ford Memorial.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Carol murmured as she joined him at a table for two, sliding her orange tray across from his. A couple of nurses from surgery walked past, glanced at Alex, then at Carol, and then back at Alex. Carol offered her peers a weak smile. Once she returned to the obstetrics ward, she was in for an inquisition that could teach the Spaniards a lesson.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been here long.\u201d Alex grinned and reached for his ham sandwich. \u201cHow much time do you have?\u201d</p><p>Carol checked her watch. \u201cForty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He opened a carton of milk. \u201cAll right. Do you want to tell me what upset you so much about last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefresh my memory.\u201d</p><p>Carol released a slow sigh. Several more of her friends had seen her and Alex, including Janice Mandle, her partner in the birthing classes. By this time, the probing stares being sent their way were rattling Carol\u2019s shaky composure. \u201cApparently James and Peter have come to some sort of agreement...about you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Humor flashed through his eyes like a distant light.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is serious. We\u2019ve gone out to dinner once, and our sons are talking about where the four of us are going to spend our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that bothers you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does! And it should bother you, too. They already have expectations about how our relationship\u2019s going to develop. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a healthy situation, and furthermore, they know about Friday night.\u201d She took a bite of her turkey sandwich and picked up her coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou mean that we\u2019re going to the Home Show?\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded. \u201cYes, but I think we should forget the whole thing. We\u2019re looking at potential trouble here, and I for one have enough problems in my life without dealing with the guilt of not giving my son a father to take him fishing.\u201d She breathed deeply, then added, \u201cMy brother doesn\u2019t camp or fish. Actually no one in our family does.\u201d</p><p>Alex held his sandwich in front of his mouth. He frowned, his eyes studying hers, before he lowered his hands to the plate. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Carol shook her head, losing patience. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said after a thoughtful pause. \u201cExplain to me what taking Peter fishing has to do with us seeing each other Friday night and your brother Tony who doesn\u2019t camp and hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish,\u201d Carol corrected, \u201calthough he doesn\u2019t hunt, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat part makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Curious stares seemed to come at Carol from every corner of the room. Alex had finished his sandwich, and Carol wasn\u2019t interested in eating any more of hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go outside?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Once they\u2019d disposed of their trays, Carol led him onto the hospital grounds. The weather had been beautiful for April. It wouldn\u2019t last much longer. The rains would return soon, and the \u201cRose City\u201d would blossom into the floral bouquet of the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>With her hands in the front pockets of her uniform, Carol strolled in the sunshine, leading them away from the building and toward the parking lot. She saw his van in the second row and turned abruptly in the opposite direction. That construction van would be nothing but a source of embarrassment to her now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pond over this way.\u201d With its surrounding green lawns, it offered relative privacy.</p><p>An arched bridge stretched between its banks, and goldfish swam in the cold water. Sunlight rippled across the pond, illuminating half, while the other half remained in enigmatic shadow. In some ways, Carol felt her budding relationship with Alex was like sun and shadow. When she was with him, she felt as though she was stepping into the light, that he drew her away from the shade. But the light was brilliant and discomfiting, and it illuminated the darkest corners of her loneliness, revealing all the imperfections she hadn\u2019t noticed while standing numbly in the shadows.</p><p>Although gentle, Alex had taught her painful lessons. Until she met him, she hadn\u2019t realized how hungry she was to discover love in a man\u2019s arms. The emptiness inside her seemed to echo when she was with him. The years hadn\u2019t lessened the pain her marriage had brought into her life, but seemed to have intensified her self-doubts. She was more hesitant and uncertain now than she\u2019d been the year following Bruce\u2019s death.</p><p>With his hand on her elbow, Alex guided her to a park bench. Once they were seated, he reached for her hand, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about the boys,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and lowered her eyes. She couldn\u2019t help being worried, but Alex didn\u2019t understand her fears and revealed no distress of his own. That being the case, she couldn\u2019t dwell on the issue.</p><p>He raised her fingers to his mouth. \u201cI suppose what I\u2019m about to say is going to frighten you even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, it needs to be said.\u201d He placed his finger across her lips to silence her, and who could blame him, she mused. It had worked so well the first time. \u201cThe boys are going to come to their own conclusions,\u201d he continued, \u201cand that\u2019s fine, they would anyway. For Peter to talk so openly with you about our relationship is a compliment. Apparently he felt comfortable enough to do so, and that reflects well on the kind of mother you are.\u201d</p><p>Carol hadn\u2019t considered it in those terms, but he was right. She and Peter were close.</p><p>\u201cNow, about you and me,\u201d Alex went on, \u201cwe\u2019re both adults.\u201d</p><p>But Carol felt less mature than an adolescent when it came to Alex. She trembled every time she thought of him, and that was far more often than she would\u2019ve liked. When he touched and kissed her, her hormones went berserk, and her heart seemed to go into spasms. No wonder she was frightened by the things Alex made her experience.</p><p>\u201cI like you, and I\u2019m fairly confident you like me.\u201d</p><p>She agreed with a sharp nod, knowing it wouldn\u2019t do any good to deny it.</p><p>\u201cThe fact is, I like everything about you, and that feeling increases whenever we\u2019re together. Now, if it happens that this attraction between us continues, then so be it. Wonderful. Great. It would be a big mistake for us to allow two teenage boys to dictate our relationship. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Once more, Carol nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He stood, bringing her with him. \u201cNow we both have to get back to work.\u201d Tucking her hand in the crook of his arm, he strode back toward the parking lot, pausing when he came to his van. He opened the door, then turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me we should seal our agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeal it? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d But she did.... His wonderful, mist-gray eyes were spelling out exactly what he meant.</p><p>He caressed her cheek, then traced the outline of her lips. Whatever it was about his touch that sent her heart into such chaos, Carol couldn\u2019t understand. She reacted by instinct, drawing his finger between her lips, touching it with the tip of her tongue. The impact of her action showed in his eyes with devastating clarity.</p><p>He leaned forward and slipped his finger aside, replacing it with his mouth. His kiss was exquisitely slow and wildly erotic.</p><p>When he broke away they were both shaking. Carol stared up at him, her breath ragged, her lips parted and eager.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to work....\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Alex said, \u201cme, too.\u201d But he didn\u2019t make any effort to leave.</p><p>Instead he angled his head and dropped tiny kisses on her neck, then her ear, taking the lobe in his mouth before trailing his lips in heart-stopping increments back to hers. She was ready for him this time, more than ready.</p><p>The sound of a car door slamming somewhere in the distance abruptly returned them to the real world. Carol leaped back, her eyes startled, her breathing harsh and uneven. She smoothed her hands down the front of her uniform, as though whisking away wrinkles. She\u2019d been kissing him like a lover and in broad daylight! To her chagrin, Alex didn\u2019t look at all dismayed by what had happened between them, just pleased.</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t done that,\u201d she said, knowing he wasn\u2019t the only one to blame\u2014but at the moment, the most convenient. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, baby, I don\u2019t regret a thing.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back inside.\u201d But she had to wait until the flush of desire had left her face and her body had stopped trembling.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d Alex said with a smile of supreme confidence, \u201cthat if kissing you is this good, then when we finally make love it\u2019ll be downright dangerous.\u201d With that, he climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, closed the door and started the engine.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me,\u201d Carol\u2019s mother complained Friday evening. \u201cAll week I waited for you to phone and tell me about your date with the non-Italian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama,\u201d Carol said, glancing at the kitchen clock. Alex was due to pick her up for the Home Show in ten minutes. Peter was staying overnight at a friend\u2019s, and she was running behind schedule as it was. The last thing she wanted to do was argue with her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou should be sorry. I could have died this week and you wouldn\u2019t have known. Your uncle in Jersey City would\u2019ve had to call you and tell you your mother was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, Peter started track this week, and we\u2019ve gotten home late every single night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t keep me in suspense. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Carol paused. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour date with that Englishman. Did he take you to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Sometimes the things her mother said actually shocked Carol. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame. Are you seeing him again? But don\u2019t wear those shoes with the pointed toes or he\u2019ll think you\u2019re a loose woman. And to be on the safe side, don\u2019t mention your cousin Celeste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I can\u2019t talk now. Alex will be here any minute\u2014we\u2019re going to the Home Show. His company has a booth there, and it\u2019d be impolite to keep him waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll convert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m not marrying Alex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d her mother said with a breathless sigh, \u201cbut then again, who knows?\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed, and Carol, who\u2019d been dreading this evening from the moment she\u2019d agreed to it, was flooded with a sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cBye, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Angelina said her farewells and added something about bringing Alex over to try her pasta. Carol was putting down the receiver by the time her mother had finished issuing her advice.</p><p>The doorbell rang again as Carol hurried into the living room. She rushed to open the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to answer. My mother was on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she give you any advice?\u201d Alex teased.</p><p>\u201cJust a little. She said it might not be a good idea if I mentioned my cousin Celeste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Carol laughed a little nervously. Alex looked too good to be true, and the warm, open appreciation in his eyes did wonders for her self-esteem.</p><p>\u201cYou were worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>Carol could feel the blush in her cheeks. She wasn\u2019t used to having men compliment her, although her family was free with praise and always had been. This was different, however. Alex wasn\u2019t family.</p><p>His eyes compelled her forward, and she stepped toward him without question, then halted abruptly, realizing she\u2019d very nearly walked into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll...get my purse.\u201d She turned away, but his hand at her shoulder turned her back.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex...I don\u2019t think we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>But that was all the protest she was allowed. She closed her eyes as he ran his hand through her hair, then directed her mouth to his with tender restraint. He kissed her lightly at first, until she was pliant and willing in his arms....</p><p>When he pulled away from her, she slowly, languorously, opened her eyes to meet his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he groaned. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here before we end up doing something we\u2019re not ready to deal with yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carol asked, blinking, still too dazed to think coherently.</p><p>\u201cI think you know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>They were in Alex\u2019s car before either of them spoke again. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019ve got to stop at the office and pick up some more brochures,\u201d Alex said. \u201cWe\u2019re running low already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay,\u201d Carol told him. It was a good thing she was sitting down because her legs seemed too weak to support her. She was sure her face was flushed, and she\u2019d rarely felt this shaky.</p><p>Her mind became her enemy as Alex headed toward the freeway. Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how he\u2019d felt against her. So strong and warm. A thin sheen of perspiration moistened her upper lip, and she swiped at it, eager to dispel the image that refused to leave her mind.</p><p>\u201cHow far is your office?\u201d Carol asked after several strained minutes had passed. Alex seemed unusually quiet himself.</p><p>\u201cAnother quarter of an hour.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing how else to resume the conversation, she dropped it after that.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s staying with Dale tonight?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. James, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>That was followed by ten more minutes of silence. Then Alex exited the freeway.</p><p>Carol curled her fingers around the armrest when he stopped at the first red light. The district was an industrial area and well lit.</p><p>As soon as he pulled into a side street, she saw his company sign. She\u2019d never asked about his business and was impressed when she saw a small fleet of trucks and vans neatly parked in rows outside. He was apparently far more successful than she\u2019d assumed.</p><p>Unlocking the door, Alex let her precede him inside. He flicked a switch, and light immediately flooded the office. One entire wall was lined with filing cabinets. Three desks, holding computers, divided the room. Carol didn\u2019t have time to give the room more than a fleeting glance as Alex directed her past the first desk and into another large office. She saw his name on the door.</p><p>The room was cluttered. The top of his desk looked as if a cyclone had hit it.</p><p>\u201cThe brochures are around here someplace,\u201d he muttered, picking up a file on a corner of the credenza. \u201cHelp yourself to a butterscotch candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d As Carol reached for one, her gaze fell on the two framed photographs hidden behind a stack of computer printouts. The top of a woman\u2019s head showed on one of the photos, but that was all she could see. The second one was of James.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get organized one of these days,\u201d Alex was saying.</p><p>Curious, Carol moved toward the credenza and the two photographs. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d She asked, lifting the picture of the woman. She was beautiful. Blond. Blue-eyed. Wholesome. Judging by the hairstyle and clothes, the picture had been taken several years earlier.</p><p>Alex paused. \u201cThat\u2019s Gloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was your wife?\u201d</p><p>Alex nodded, pulled out the high-backed cushioned chair and sank into it. \u201cShe died two years ago. Cancer.\u201d</p><p>It was all Carol could do to hold on to the picture. The pain in his voice stabbed through her.</p><p>\u201cI...I thought you were divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alex said quietly.</p><p>Carol continued to study the beautiful woman in the photo. \u201cYou loved her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much that when the time came, I wanted to die with her. Yes, I loved her.\u201d</p><p>With shaking hands, Carol replaced the photograph. Her back was to Alex, and she briefly closed her eyes. She made a rigorous effort to smile when she turned to face him again.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said breezily.</p><p>\u201cYou look pale all of a sudden. I thought you knew.... I assumed James or Peter had told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014neither of them mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if this comes as a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Alex nodded, sighed and reached for her hand, pulling her down into his lap. \u201cI figured you\u2019d understand better than most what it is to lose someone you desperately love.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cGloria had problems when James was born,\u201d Alex began. His hold on Carol\u2019s waist tightened almost painfully, but she was sure he wasn\u2019t aware of it. \u201cThe doctors said there wouldn\u2019t be any more children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, please, there\u2019s no need to tell me this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to know. It\u2019s important to me....\u201d</p><p>Carol closed her eyes and pressed her forehead against the side of his head. She knew intuitively that he didn\u2019t often speak of his late wife, and that he found it difficult to do so now.</p><p>Alex wove his fingers into her hair. \u201cIn the years after Jim\u2019s birth, Gloria\u2019s health was never good, but the doctors couldn\u2019t put their finger on what was wrong. She was weak and tired a lot of the time. It wasn\u2019t until Jim was in junior high that we learned she had leukemia\u2014myelocytic leukemia, one of the most difficult forms to treat.\u201d He paused and drew in an unsteady breath.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she pleaded, her hands framing his face. \u201cDon\u2019t, please\u2014this is obviously so painful for you.\u201d But the moment her eyes met his, she knew nothing she said or did would stop him. She sensed that only sharing it now, with her, would lessen the trauma of his memories.</p><p>\u201cWe did all the usual things\u2014the chemotherapy, the other drugs\u2014but none of it helped, and she grew steadily worse. Later, when it was clear that nothing else could be done, we opted for a bone-marrow transplant. Her sister and mother flew in from New York, and her sister was the better match. But...that didn\u2019t work, either.\u201d</p><p>Carol stroked his cheek, yearning to do anything she could to lessen the pain.</p><p>He hesitated and drew in a quavering breath. \u201cShe suffered so much. That was the worst for me to deal with. I was her husband, and I\u2019d sworn to love and protect her, and there wasn\u2019t a thing I could do...not a single, solitary thing.\u201d</p><p>Tears moistened Carol\u2019s eyes, and she struggled to keep them at bay.</p><p>Alex\u2019s voice remained firm and controlled, but Carol recognized the pain he was experiencing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what courage was until I watched Gloria die,\u201d he whispered. He closed his eyes. \u201cThe last three weeks of her life, it was obvious she wasn\u2019t going to make it. Finally she fell into a coma and was put on a respirator. The doctors knew she\u2019d never come out of it and so did the nurses. I could see them emotionally removing themselves, and I couldn\u2019t bear it. I became a crazy man, refusing to leave her side, letting no one care for her but me. I held on to her hand and silently willed her to live with every breath I took. I honestly believe I kept her alive by the sheer force of my will. I was afraid to leave her, afraid that when I did, she\u2019d slip silently into death. Eventually that was exactly what happened. I left her because Jim needed me and because I knew that at some point I\u2019d have to leave. I sat in the hospital waiting room with my son, telling him about his mother, and suddenly a pain, an intense stabbing pain, shot through me\u2014\u201d he hesitated and gave a ragged sigh \u201c\u2014and in that instant, I knew she was gone. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. A few minutes later, a nurse came for me. I can remember that scene so vividly\u2014my mind\u2019s played it back so many times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI stood up and Jim stood with me, and I brought my son as close to my side as I could, looked the nurse in the eye and said, \u2018She\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t she?\u2019 The nurse nodded and Jim started to cry and I just stood there, dazed and numb. I don\u2019t remember walking back to Gloria\u2019s room, but somehow I found myself there. I lifted her into my arms and held her and told her how sorry I was that I\u2019d been so stubborn and selfish, keeping her with me those three weeks, refusing to let her die. I told her how I would much rather have been with her, how I\u2019d wanted to hold her hand as she stepped from one life into the next.\u201d</p><p>By now Carol was weeping softly, unabashedly.</p><p>Alex\u2019s fingers stroked her hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you to cry,\u201d he whispered, and his regret seemed genuine. \u201cYou would have liked her.\u201d</p><p>Carol had felt the same way from the first moment she\u2019d seen Gloria\u2019s photograph. Nodding, she hid her face in the strong curve of his neck.</p> <p>\u201cCarol,\u201d he whispered, caressing her back, \u201clook at me.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled and shook her head, unwilling to let him witness the strength of her emotion. It was one thing to sit on his lap, and entirely another to look him in the eye after he\u2019d shared such a deep and personal part of himself.</p><p>His lips grazed the line of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried softly, her protest faint and nearly inaudible, \u201cdon\u2019t touch me...not now.\u201d He\u2019d come through hell, suffered the torment of losing his wife, and he needed Carol. He was asking for her. But her comfort could only be second-best.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he countered, lifting her head so he could look at her. Against her will, against her better judgment, her gaze met his. His eyes were filled with such hunger that she all but gasped. Again and again, they roamed her face, no doubt taking in the moisture that glistened on her cheeks, the way her lips trembled and the staggering need she felt to comfort him. Even if that comfort was brief, temporary, a momentary solace.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I upset you.\u201d He wove his fingers into her hair and directed her lips to his. His mouth was warm and moist and gentle. No one had ever touched her with such tenderness and care. No kiss had ever affected her so deeply. No kiss had ever shown her such matchless beauty.</p><p>Tears rained down Carol\u2019s face. Sliding her fingers through his hair, she held him close. He was solid and muscular and full of strength. His touch had filled the hollowness of her life and, she prayed, had helped to ease his own terrible loneliness.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d he breathed, sounding both stunned and dismayed, \u201cwhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...so sorry,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>Confused and uncertain, Carol turned to face him. \u201cYou are? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor rushing you. For thinking of my own needs instead of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She shook her head, incapable of expressing what she felt.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still too shaken to speak.</p><p>He placed his hands on the curve of her shoulder and kissed the crown of her head. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Reluctantly her eyes slid to his.</p><p>\u201cFor listening, for being here when I needed you.\u201d</p><p>All she could manage in response was a tremulous smile.</p> <p>For the rest of the evening, Alex was a perfect gentleman. He escorted her to the Home Show, where they spent several hours wandering from one display to another, discussing the ideas and products represented. They strolled hand in hand, laughing, talking, debating ideas. Carol was more talkative than usual; it helped disguise her uneasiness. She told him about her plan to dig up a portion of her back lawn and turn it into an herb garden. At least when she was talking, her nerve endings weren\u2019t left uncovered and she didn\u2019t have to deal with what had happened a few hours before...</p><p>After they\u2019d toured the Home Show, Alex took her out to eat at a local Greek restaurant. By that time of the evening, Carol should have been famished, since they were having dinner so late. But whatever appetite she\u2019d had was long gone.</p><p>When Alex dropped her off at the house, he kissed her good-night, but if he was expecting an invitation to come inside, he didn\u2019t receive one.</p><p>Hours later, she lay staring at the ceiling, while shadows of the trees outside her window frolicked around the light fixture like dancing harem girls. Glaring at the clock radio, Carol punched her pillow several times and twisted around so she lay on her stomach, her arms cradling her head. She should be sleepy. Exhausted. Drained after a long, trying week. Her job took its toll in energy, and normally by Friday night, Carol collapsed the moment she got into bed, waking refreshed Saturday morning.</p><p>She would\u2019ve liked to convince herself that Alex had nothing to do with this restless, trapped feeling. She tried to analyze what was bothering her so much. It wasn\u2019t as though Alex had never kissed her before this evening. The impact he had on her senses shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise. She\u2019d known from the first night they\u2019d met that Alex had the power to expose a kaleidoscope of emotions within her. With him, she felt exhilarated, excited, frightened, reborn.</p><p>Perhaps it was the shock of passion he\u2019d brought to life when he\u2019d kissed her. No, she mused, frowning, she\u2019d yearned for him to do exactly that even before they\u2019d arrived at his office.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes closed, she tried to force her body to relax. She longed to snap her fingers and drift magically into the warm escape of slumber. It was what she wanted, what she needed. Maybe in the morning, she\u2019d be able to put everything into perspective.</p><p>Closing her eyes, however, proved to be a mistake. Instead of being engulfed by peace, she was confronted with the image of Alex\u2019s tormented features as he told her about Gloria. I figured you\u2019d understand better than most what it is to lose someone you desperately love.</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes flew open. Fresh tears pooled at the edges as her sobs took control. She\u2019d loved Bruce. She\u2019d hated Bruce.</p><p>Her life ended with his death and her life had begun again.</p><p>It was the end; it was the beginning.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been tears when he\u2019d died\u2014not at first but later. Plenty of tears, some of profound sadness, and others that spoke of regrets. But there was something more. A release. Bruce had died, and at the same moment, she and Peter had been set free from the prison of his sickness and his abuse.</p><p>The tears burned her face as she sobbed quietly, caught in the horror of those few short years of marriage.</p><p>Bruce shouldn\u2019t have died. He was too young to have wasted his life. Knowing he\u2019d been drunk and with another woman hadn\u2019t helped her deal with the emotions surrounding his untimely death.</p><p>I figured you\u2019d understand better than most what it is to lose someone you desperately love. Only Carol didn\u2019t know. Bruce had destroyed the love she\u2019d felt for him long before his death. He\u2019d ravaged all trust and violated any vestiges of respect. She\u2019d never known love the way Alex had, never shared such a deep and personal commitment with anyone\u2014not the kind Alex had shared with Gloria, not the kind her mother had with her father.</p><p>And Carol felt guilty. Guilty. Perhaps if she\u2019d been a better wife, a better mother, Bruce would have stopped drinking. If she\u2019d been more desirable, more inventive in the kitchen, a perfect housekeeper. Instead she felt guilty. It might not be rational or reasonable but it was how she felt.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Peter asked as he let himself in the front door the next morning. He dumped his sleeping bag on the kitchen floor, walked over to Carol and dutifully kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d Carol said, helping herself to a second cup of coffee. She didn\u2019t dare look in the mirror, suspecting there were dark smudges under her eyes. At most, she\u2019d slept two hours all night.</p><p>\u201cHow did things go with Mr. Preston?\u201d</p><p>Carol let the steam rising from her coffee mug revive her. \u201cYou never told me James\u2019s mother had died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t? She had leukemia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d Carol muttered. She wasn\u2019t angry with her son, and Alex\u2019s being a widower shouldn\u2019t make a whole lot of difference, but for reasons she was only beginning to understand, it did.</p><p>\u201cJames said it took his dad a long time to get over his mother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt her throat muscles tighten. He wasn\u2019t over her, not really.</p><p>\u201cJames keeps a picture of her in his room. She was real pretty.\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded, remembering the bright blue eyes smiling back at her from the framed photograph in Alex\u2019s office. Gloria\u2019s warmth and beauty were obvious.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d work in the backyard this morning,\u201d Carol said, as a means of changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cAw, Mom,\u201d Peter groaned. \u201cYou know I hate yard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we tackle everything now, it won\u2019t overwhelm us next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to plant a bunch of silly flowers again? I don\u2019t get it. Every year you spend a fortune on that stuff. If you added it all up, I bet you could buy a sports car with the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy who a sports car?\u201d she challenged, arms akimbo.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d Peter clearly didn\u2019t want to argue. \u201cJust tell me what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s attitude could use an overhaul, but Carol wasn\u2019t in the best of moods herself. Working with the earth, thrusting her fingers deep into the rich soil, was basic to her nature and never more than now.</p><p>The sun was out when Carol, dressed in her oldest pair of jeans and a University of Oregon sweatshirt, knelt in front of her precious flower beds. She\u2019d tied a red bandanna around her head, knotting it at the back.</p><p>Peter brought his portable CD player outside and plugged it into the electrical outlet on the patio. Next, he arranged an assortment of CDs in neat piles.</p><p>Carol glanced over her shoulder and groaned inwardly. She was about to be serenaded with music that came with words she found practically impossible to understand. Although maybe that was a blessing...</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Peter yelled and started running toward the kitchen.</p><p>That was funny. Carol hadn\u2019t even heard the phone ring. Ignoring her son, she knelt down, wiping her wrist under her nose. The heat was already making her perspire. Bending forward, she dug with the trowel, cultivating the soil and clearing away a winter\u2019s accumulation of weeds.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of Alex\u2019s voice, Carol twisted around to confront him. \u201cAlex,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He joined her, kneeling beside her on the lush, green grass. His eyes were as eager as if it had been weeks since he\u2019d seen her instead of a few hours.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded again, digging more vigorously than necessary. She didn\u2019t want to have this conversation. It was too soon. She hadn\u2019t fully recovered from their last encounter and was already facing another one.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away,\u201d he said, his voice harsh and husky at once, and tinged with a hint of anger as if the lack of control bothered him. \u201cYou were upset last night, and we both ignored it instead of talking about it the way we should have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were imagining things,\u201d she said, offering him a false smile.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. I felt guilty, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I told you about Gloria and didn\u2019t ask about your husband. It would\u2019ve been the perfect time for you to tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Carol\u2019s stomach lurched. \u201cThat was a long time ago...and best forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved him and were saddened by his death, and I should\u2019ve realized that talking about Gloria would be especially painful for you. I should have been more sensitive.\u201d</p><p>She shut her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to feel guilty. You talked openly and honestly, and I appreciated knowing about your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Alex conceded, \u201cbut I frightened you, and now you\u2019re feeling confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d She continued to work, dragging the trowel through the damp soil.</p> <p>Alex chuckled softly. He gripped her shoulders and turned her toward him as he scanned her features. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lie, Carol Sommars. Because you blush every time you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d As if on cue, she felt her cheeks grow pink. Carol groaned inwardly, furious with Alex and even more so with herself.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t ridiculous.\u201d He paused, and his mouth quivered as he studied her. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the boys?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s chuckle deepened. \u201cDon\u2019t try changing the subject\u2014it isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, Mom, you\u2019ll never guess what!\u201d</p><p>Grateful for the distraction, Carol dragged her eyes away from Alex and turned to her son, who stood on the patio, looking exceptionally pleased.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames and Mr. Preston brought over one of those fancy, heavy-duty tillers. They\u2019re going to dig up that garden space you\u2019ve been talking about for the past two summers.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s gaze flew back to Alex\u2019s, full of unspoken questions.</p><p>\u201cYou said something last night about wanting to grow an herb garden, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why...I mean, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d She felt flustered and surprised and overwhelmed that he\u2019d take a casual comment seriously and go out of his way to see that her wish was fulfilled.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t have to, but I want to. Peter and James and I are your willing servants, isn\u2019t that right, boys?\u201d Neither bothered to answer, being far more interested in sorting through the CDs Peter had set out.</p> <p>Two hours later, Carol had been delegated to the kitchen by all three men, who claimed she was a world-class nuisance.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Peter said, \u201cdo something constructive like make lunch. You\u2019re in the way here.\u201d</p><p>Slightly taken aback by her son\u2019s assessment of her role, Carol muttered under her breath and did as he asked. Her ego suffered further when James sent his friend a grateful glance. Even Alex seemed pleased to have her out from under their capable feet.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Alex entered the kitchen. He paused when he saw her stacking sandwiches on a platter. He walked over to her, slipped his arms around her waist and nuzzled her neck.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she protested in a fierce whisper, \u201cthe boys will see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what they\u2019re thinking is bad enough without you adding fuel to the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too busy to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care!\u201d</p><p>His growl was low as he slid his hand from her navel up her midriff. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll...I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do\u2014but it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d Her threat was an empty one, and Alex knew it as well as she did. She was trembling the way she always did when he touched her. The more intimate the caress, the more she shivered.</p><p>\u201cI told the boys I was coming inside to pester you, and I\u2019m nothing if not a man of my word,\u201d Alex informed her, clearly relishing her shyness.</p><p>\u201cAlex...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI already know\u2014this isn\u2019t the time or the place. I agree, but I don\u2019t have to like it.\u201d Slowly and with great reluctance, he released her.</p><p>Carol was aware of every nuance of this man. He made the most innocent caress sweet with sensations. His touch only created a need for more. Much more.</p><p>Once he\u2019d released her, Carol sighed with relief\u2014or was it regret? She no longer had any idea. She carried the platter of sandwiches to the table and brought out a pitcher of fresh lemonade.</p><p>Alex pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cI like watching you move,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI like touching you even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex...please don\u2019t. You\u2019re making me blush.\u201d</p><p>He laughed lightly. \u201cI like that, too. Being with you makes me feel alive again. I hadn\u2019t realized how...desensitized I\u2019d become to life. The first time we kissed I discovered what I\u2019d been missing. All those arranged dates, all those wasted evenings\u2014and all that time you were right under my nose and I didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think I\u2019ll put out two kinds of chips,\u201d Carol said, completely unsettled by the way he spoke so openly, so frankly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d His eyes were dark, filled with the promise of things to come. \u201cSo beautiful...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, please.\u201d She leaned against the counter, overwhelmed by his words.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I feel as though I\u2019ve been granted a second chance at life. Tell me I\u2019m not behaving like an idiot. Tell me you feel it, too.\u201d</p><p>She did feel everything he did, more profoundly than she dared let him know. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been alone too long,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople in situations like ours must think these kinds of thoughts all the time.\u201d</p><p>Her comment didn\u2019t please him. He frowned and slowly stood. \u201cYou may find this difficult to believe, Carol, but there hasn\u2019t been anyone since Gloria who made me feel the things you do. And trust me, there\u2019ve been plenty who tried.\u201d</p><p>Gulping, Carol whirled around and made busy work opening a bag of potato chips.</p><p>Alex joined her, leaning against the counter and facing her so she couldn\u2019t ignore him. \u201cYou, on the other hand, don\u2019t even need to touch me to make me respond. You might not want to admit it, but it\u2019s the same for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you decide to pester someone, you don\u2019t do it by half measures, do you?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>He slid his lips across hers. \u201cAre you ready to admit it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He bent forward and kissed her again.</p><p>Carol\u2019s knees buckled and she swayed toward him.</p><p>Alex instantly reached for her. Without question, without protest, Carol fell into his arms, so hungry for his touch, she felt as if she were on fire.</p><p>The sound of someone clearing his throat was followed by, \u201cHey, we\u2019re not interrupting anything, are we?\u201d Peter was standing just inside the kitchen. \u201cIn case you two haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s lunchtime.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Alex pressed one knee down on the green and stretched out his putter, judging the distance to the hole with a sharp eye. He\u2019d been playing golf with Barney every Sunday afternoon for years.</p><p>\u201cSo when do I get to meet this female dynamo?\u201d Barney asked after Alex had successfully completed the shot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Alex said as he retrieved his golf ball. He inserted the putter back inside his bag before striding toward the cart.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Barney echoed. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you and this woman? I swear you\u2019ve been a different man since you met her. You stare off into space with this goofy look on your face. I talk to you and you don\u2019t hear me, and when I ask you about her, you get defensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not defensive, I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, buddy, listen to the voice of experience. You\u2019re not in love, you\u2019re in lust. I recognize that gleam in your eye. Ten to one you haven\u2019t slept with her yet. So I recommend that you get her in the sack and be done with it before you end up doing something foolish.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s gaze fired briefly as he looked at his friend. How did Barney know the progress of his relationship with Carol?</p><p>\u201cI have every intention of sleeping with her. Only I plan to be doing that every night for the rest of my life. Carol\u2019s not the type of woman to have a fling, and I refuse to insult her by suggesting one.\u201d</p><p>Barney stared at Alex as if seeing him for the first time. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever realized what an old-fashioned guy you are. Apparently you haven\u2019t noticed, but the world\u2019s become a lot more casual. Our clothes are casual, our conversations are casual and yes, even our sex is casual. In case you hadn\u2019t heard, you don\u2019t have to marry a woman to take her to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue in this vein,\u201d Alex said, \u201cand you\u2019re going to become a casual friend.\u201d</p><p>Barney rolled his eyes dramatically. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>If three wives hadn\u2019t been able to change Barney\u2019s attitude, Alex doubted he could, either. \u201cAs I recall, the last time we had this conversation,\u201d Alex reminded him, \u201cyou said settling down was the thing to do. I\u2019m only following your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not yet,\u201d Barney said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t played the field enough. There are riches out there\u2014\u201d he gestured with his hands \u201c\u2014female gold nuggets just waiting to be picked up, then set gently back in place for the next treasure-hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like Bambi and what was the name of the other one? Barbie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being clever,\u201d Barney snickered. \u201cI have your best interests at heart, and frankly I\u2019m concerned. Two years after Gloria\u2019s gone, you suddenly announce it\u2019s time to start dating again. Man, I was jumping up and down for joy. Then you go out with a grand total of ten different women\u2014most of them only once\u2014and calmly inform me you\u2019ve met the one. You plan to marry her, just like that, and you haven\u2019t even slept with her yet. How are you going to find out if you\u2019re sexually compatible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re compatible, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may think so now, but bingo, once she\u2019s got a wedding band, it\u2019s a totally different story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying, would you?\u201d Alex eased his golf cart into his assigned space. From the day he\u2019d decided to look for another wife, Barney had been a constant source of amusement. The problem was, his most hilarious moments had come in the form of women his friend had insisted he meet.</p><p>\u201cBut, Alex, I am worried about you,\u201d Barney muttered as he lifted his clubs from the back of the cart. \u201cYou don\u2019t know women the way I do. They\u2019re scheming, conniving, money-hungry, and how they get their clutches into you is by marriage. Don\u2019t be so eager to march up the aisle with Carol. I don\u2019t want you to go through what I have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After three wives, three divorces and child support payments for two separate families, Barney was speaking from experience\u2014of a particularly negative sort.</p><p>\u201cGloria was special,\u201d his longtime friend said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find another one like her. So if it\u2019s those qualities that attract you to Carol, look again. You may only be seeing what you want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna yell?\u201d Angelina Pasquale shouted from the doorway of the kitchen into the living room where her grandchildren were squabbling. \u201cThen let\u2019s have a contest. But remember\u2014I\u2019ve been doing it longer. They can hear me all the way in Jersey City.\u201d</p><p>Peter and his younger cousins ceased their shouting match, and with a nod of her head, Angelina returned to the kitchen, satisfied that a single threat from her was enough to bring about peace that would last through the afternoon.</p> <p>Carol was busy slicing tomatoes for the salad, and her sister-in-law, Paula, was spreading garlic butter on thick slices of French bread.</p><p>The sauce was warming on the stove, and the water for the long strands of fresh pasta was just starting to boil. The pungent scent of basil and thyme circled the kitchen like smoke from a campfire. From Carol\u2019s earliest memory, her mother had cooked a pot of spaghetti sauce every Saturday evening. The unused portion from Sunday\u2019s dinner was served in a variety of ways during the week. Leftover pot roast became something delectable with her mother\u2019s sauce over top. And chicken with Mama\u2019s sauce rivaled even the Cajun chicken at Jake\u2019s restaurant.</p><p>\u201cSo, Carol,\u201d her mother began, wiping her hands on the ever-present apron. She took a large wooden spoon and stirred the kettle of simmering sauce. \u201cI suppose your English friend thinks good spaghetti sauce comes from a jar,\u201d she said disparagingly. This was her way of letting Carol know the time had come to invite Alex and his son to Sunday dinner.</p><p>\u201cMama, Alex plays golf on Sundays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery Sunday?\u201d</p> <p>Carol nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s never tasted my sauce.\u201d Angelina shook her head as though to suggest Alex had wasted much of his life walking from green to green when he could\u2019ve been having dinner at her house.</p><p>Adding serving utensils to the salad, Carol set the wooden bowl on the dining room table.</p><p>Tony, Carol\u2019s brother, sauntered into the kitchen and slipped his arms around Paula\u2019s waist. \u201cHow much longer until dinner? The natives are getting restless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven minutes,\u201d Angelina answered promptly. She tasted the end of the wooden spoon and nodded in approval.</p><p>Carol returned to the kitchen and noticed that her mother was watching her under the guise of waiting for the water to boil. The question Carol had expected all day finally came.</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna marry this non-Italian?\u201d her mother asked, then added the noodles, stirring with enough energy to create a whirlpool in the large stainless-steel pot.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Carol cried. \u201cI barely know Alex. We\u2019ve only gone out a handful of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but your eyes are telling me something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing my eyes are interested in is some of that garlic bread Paula\u2019s making,\u201d Carol said, hoping to divert her mother\u2019s attention from the subject of Alex.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Her sister-in-law handed her a slice. \u201cBut it\u2019s no substitute for a man.\u201d Paula turned her head to press a quick kiss on her husband\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands slipped further around Paula\u2019s waist as he whispered in his wife\u2019s ear. From the way her sister-in-law\u2019s face flooded with warm color, Carol didn\u2019t need much of an imagination to guess what Tony had said.</p><p>Carol looked away. She wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the earthy exchange between her brother and his wife; instead, she felt a peculiar twinge of envy. The realization shocked her. In all the years she\u2019d been alone, Carol had never once longed for a pair of arms to hold her or for a man to whisper suggestive comments in her ear. Those intimacies were reserved for the happily married members of her family.</p><p>Yet, here she was, standing in the middle of her mother\u2019s kitchen, yearning for Alex to stroll up behind her, circle her waist and whisper promises in her ear. The image was so vivid that she hurried into the living room to escape it.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until later, when the dishes were washed, that Carol had a chance to sort through her thoughts. Tony and Peter were puttering around in the garage. Paula was playing a game of Yahtzee with the younger children. And Angelina was rocking in her chair, nimble fingers working delicate yarn into a sweater for her smallest grandchild.</p><p>\u201cSo are you gonna tell your mama what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d she asked Carol out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Carol fibbed. She couldn\u2019t discuss what she didn\u2019t understand. For the first time, she felt distanced from the love and laughter that was so much a part of Sunday dinner with her family. For years she\u2019d clung to the life she\u2019d built for herself and her son. These few, short weeks with Alex had changed everything.</p><p>Alex had discovered all her weaknesses and used them to his own advantage. Digging up the earth for her herb garden was a good example. She could\u2019ve asked her brother to do it for her. Eventually she probably would have. But Tony did so much to help her already that she didn\u2019t want to burden him with another request. It wasn\u2019t as if tilling part of the backyard was essential. But one casual mention to Alex, and next thing she knew, there was freshly tilled earth waiting for basil and Italian parsley where before there\u2019d been lawn.</p><p>\u201cYou like this man, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Carol responded with a tiny nod of her head.</p><p>A slow, easy smile rose from her mother\u2019s mouth to her eyes. \u201cI thought so. You got the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a woman falling in love. Don\u2019t fight it so hard, my bambina. It\u2019s time you met a man who brings color to your cheeks and a smile to your lips.\u201d</p><p>But Carol wasn\u2019t smiling. She felt confused and ambivalent. She was crazy about Alex; she prayed she\u2019d never see him again. She couldn\u2019t picture her life with him; she couldn\u2019t picture her life without him.</p><p>\u201cI lit a candle in church for you,\u201d her mother whispered. \u201cAnd said a special prayer to St. Rita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod and I had a good talk, and He told me it\u2019s predestined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s predestined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and this non-Italian,\u201d her mother replied calmly.</p><p>\u201cMama, that doesn\u2019t make the least bit of sense. For years you\u2019ve been telling me to marry a rich old man with one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. You said everyone loves a rich widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep looking for the rich old man, but when you find him, introduce him to me. With any luck his first wife made spaghetti sauce with tomato soup and he\u2019ll worship at my feet.\u201d</p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t keep from smiling. She wasn\u2019t so sure about her mother lighting candles on her behalf or deciding that marrying Alex was predestined, but from experience she\u2019d learned there wasn\u2019t any point in arguing.</p><p>Tony, Paula and their two children left around five. Usually Carol headed for home around the same time, but this afternoon she lingered. The 1940s war movie on television held Peter\u2019s attention, and her eyes drifted to it now and again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she felt the moisture on her cheeks that she realized she was crying.</p><p>Doing what she could to wipe away the tears so as not to attract attention to herself, she focused on the television screen. Her mother was right; she was falling in love, head over heels in love, and it was frightening her to death.</p><p>Silently Angelina set her knitting aside and joined Carol on the sofa. Without a word, she thrust a tissue into Carol\u2019s hand. Then she wrapped her arm around her daughter\u2019s shoulders and pressed her head tenderly to her generous bosom. Gently patting Carol\u2019s back, Angelina whispered soothing words of love and encouragement in a language Carol could only partially understand.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t see Carol again until Monday afternoon when he pulled into the high school parking lot. He angled his van in front of the track, four spaces down from her car. He waited a couple of minutes, hoping she\u2019d come and see him of her own free will. He should\u2019ve known better. The woman wasn\u2019t willing to give an inch.</p><p>Deciding to act just as nonchalant, Alex opened his door, walked over to the six-foot-high chain-link fence and pretended to be watching the various groups participate in field events. Neither James nor Peter was trying out for any of those positions on the team.</p><p>Then he walked casually toward Carol, who was determined, it seemed, to ignore him, hiding behind the pages of a women\u2019s magazine.</p><p>\u201cHello, Carol,\u201d he said after a decent interval.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014Alex.\u201d She held the magazine rigidly in place.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d The hesitation was long enough to imply that she would indeed mind. Regardless, he opened the passenger door and slid inside her car. Only then did Carol bother to close the magazine and set it down.</p><p>By now, Alex told himself, he should be accustomed to her aloof attitude toward him. It was like this nearly every time they were together. She\u2019d never shown any real pleasure at seeing him. He had to break through those chilly barriers each and every encounter. The strangest part was that he knew she was as strongly attracted to him as he was to her. And not just in the physical sense. Their lives were like matching bookends, he thought.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>She nodded and glanced away, as though she thought that sharing even a small part of her life with him was akin to admitting she enjoyed his company.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it would be too much to hope that you missed me the last couple of days?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Alex was almost embarrassed by the way his heart raced. \u201cYou missed me,\u201d he repeated, feeling like a kid who\u2019d been granted free rein in a candy store.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carol said, clearly disconcerted. \u201cI meant it would be too much to hope I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman sure knew how to deflate his pride.</p><p>\u201cIt really was thoughtful of you to dig up that area in my backyard on Saturday. I\u2019m grateful, Alex.\u201d</p><p>Crossing his arms, Alex leaned against the back of the seat and tried to conceal his injured pride with a lazy shrug. \u201cIt was no trouble.\u201d Especially since the two boys had done most of the work, leaving him free to \u201cpester\u201d Carol in the kitchen. With everything in him, he wished they were back in that kitchen now. He wanted her in his arms the way she\u2019d been on Saturday afternoon, her lips moist and swollen with his kisses, her eyes dark with passion.</p><p>\u201cThe boys will be out any minute,\u201d Carol said, studying the empty field.</p><p>Alex guessed this was his cue to leave her car, but he wasn\u2019t taking the hint. When it came to Carol Sommars, he was learning that his two greatest allies were James and Peter.</p><p>It was time to play his ace.</p><p>Alex waited until the last possible minute. Both boys had walked onto the parking lot, their hair damp from a recent shower. They were chatting and joking and in a good mood. Climbing out of Carol\u2019s car, Alex leaned against the fender in a relaxed pose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPeter, did you say something about wanting to go camping?\u201d he said, casting Carol a defiant look. \u201cJames and I were thinking of heading for the Washington coastline this coming weekend and thought you and your mother might like to go with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d James asked, delighted and surprised.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened with excitement. \u201cCamping? You\u2019re inviting Mom and me to go camping?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the word camping, Carol opened her car door and vaulted out. Her eyes narrowed on Alex as if to declare a foul and charge him a penalty.</p> <p>\u201cAre you two free this weekend?\u201d Alex asked with a practiced look of innocence, formally extending the invitation. The ball was in her court, and he was interested in seeing how she volleyed this one.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Peter shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carol said at the same moment. \u201cWe already have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d her son moaned. \u201cCome on, Mom, Mr. Preston just offered to take us camping with him and James. What could possibly be more important than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to paint the living room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Paint the living room? I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Peter slapped his hands against his thighs and threw back his head. \u201cYou know how I feel about camping,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cGive your mother time to think it over,\u201d Alex urged, confident that Carol would change her mind or that Peter would do it for her. \u201cWe can talk about it tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>James gave Peter the okay signal, and feeling extraordinarily proud of himself, Alex led the way to his van, handing his son the keys.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to let me drive?\u201d James asked, sounding more than a little stunned. \u201cVoluntarily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount your blessings, boy, and drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p> <p>Carol was furious with Alex. He\u2019d played a faultless game, and she had to congratulate him on his fine closing move. All day she\u2019d primed herself for the way she was going to act when she saw him again. She\u2019d allowed their relationship to progress much further than she\u2019d ever intended, and it was time to cool things down.</p><p>With her mother lighting candles in church and having heart-to-heart talks with God, things had gotten completely out of hand. Angelina barely complained anymore that Alex wasn\u2019t Catholic, and worse, not Italian. It was as if those two prerequisites no longer mattered.</p><p>What Carol hadn\u2019t figured on was the rush of adrenaline she\u2019d experienced when Alex pulled into the school parking lot. She swore her heart raced faster than any of the runners on the track. She\u2019d needed every ounce of determination she possessed not to toss aside the magazine she\u2019d planted in the car and run to him, bury her face in his chest and ask him to explain what was happening to her.</p><p>Apparently Alex had read her perfectly. He didn\u2019t appear at all concerned about her lack of welcome. That hadn\u2019t even fazed him. All the arguments she\u2019d amassed had been for naught. Then at the last possible minute he\u2019d introduced the subject of this camping trip, in what she had to admire was a brilliant move. Her chain of resistance was only as strong as the weakest link. And her weakest link was Peter.</p><p>Grudgingly she had to admire Alex.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Peter cried, restless as a first grader in the seat beside her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about it, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the camping trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the chance of a lifetime. The Washington coast\u2014I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s fabulous\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo paint the living room? We could do that any old time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, please.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a minute or so. The he asked, \u201cDo you remember when I was eleven?\u201d</p><p>Here it comes, Carol mused darkly. \u201cI remember,\u201d she muttered, knowing it would\u2019ve been too much to expect him not to drag up the lowest point of her life as a mother.</p><p>\u201cWe were going camping then, too, remember?\u201d</p><p>He said remember as though it was a dirty word, one that would get him into trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me an overnight camping trip and signed us up for an outing through the Y? But when we went to the meeting you got cold feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, they gave us a list of stuff we were supposed to bring, and not only did I not have half the things on the list, I didn\u2019t even know what they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have asked,\u201d Peter cried.</p><p>\u201cIt was more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because we were going to hike at our own pace? They said we\u2019d get a map. We could\u2019ve found the camp, Mom, I know we could have.\u201d</p><p>Carol had had visions of wandering through the woods for days on end with nothing more than a piece of paper that said she should head east\u2014and she had the world\u2019s worst sense of direction. If she could get lost in a shopping mall, how would she ever find her way through dense forest?</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the worst part,\u201d Peter murmured. \u201cRight there in the middle of the meeting you leaned over and asked me what it would cost to buy your way out of the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t leave for anything less than a laser tag set,\u201d Carol said, tormented by the unfairness of it all. The toy had been popular and expensive at the time and had cost her a pretty penny. But her son had conveniently forgotten that.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I sold my soul that day,\u201d Peter said with a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cPeter, honestly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until then that I realized how much I was missing by not having a dad.\u201d</p><p>The kid was perfecting the art of guilt.</p><p>\u201cNow, once again,\u201d he argued, \u201cI have the rare opportunity to experience the great out-of-doors, and it\u2019s like a nightmare happening all over again. My own mother\u2019s going to pull the rug out from under my feet.\u201d</p><p>Carol stopped at a red light and pretended to play a violin. \u201cThis could warp your young mind for years to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just might,\u201d Peter said, completely serious.</p><p>\u201cTwenty years from now, when they lock those prison doors behind you, you can cry out that it\u2019s all my fault. If only I\u2019d taken you camping with Alex and James Preston, then the entire course of your life would have been different.\u201d</p><p>A short pause followed her statement.</p><p>\u201cSarcasm doesn\u2019t suit you, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Peter was right, of course, but Carol was getting desperate. At the rate this day was going, she\u2019d end up spending Saturday night in front of a campfire, fighting off mosquitoes and the threat of wild beasts.</p><p>Because she felt guilty, despite every effort not to, Carol cooked Peter his favorite chicken-fried steak dinner, complete with gravy and mashed potatoes.</p><p>After the dishes had been cleared and Peter was supposed to be doing his homework, Carol found him talking on the phone, whispering frantically. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess that her son was discussing strategies with James. The three of them were clearly in cahoots against her.</p><p>Carol waited until Peter was in bed before she marched into the kitchen and righteously punched out Alex\u2019s phone number. She\u2019d barely given him a chance to answer before she laid into him with both barrels.</p><p>\u201cThat was a rotten thing to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, feigning innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou know darn well what I\u2019m talking about. Peter\u2019s pulled every trick in the book from the moment you mentioned this stupid camping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to come or is this war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s war right now, Mister Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Does the victor get spoils? Because I\u2019m telling you, Carol Sommars, I intend to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alex,\u201d she said with a sigh, leaning against the wall. She slid all the way down to the floor, wanting to weep with frustration. \u201cHow could you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. I got the idea when you told me it was too much to hope that you\u2019d miss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know anything about camping. To me, roughing it is going without valet service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Trusting Alex wasn\u2019t at the top of her priority list at the moment. He\u2019d pulled a fast one on her, and she wasn\u2019t going to let him do it again.</p><p>\u201cIs Peter sleeping?\u201d Alex asked softly.</p><p>\u201cIf he isn\u2019t, he should be.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand where this conversation was heading.</p><p>\u201cJames is asleep, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the cold shoulder you gave me this afternoon, I need something to warm my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry a hot water bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. Keep the door unlocked and I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Alex Preston, listen to me, I\u2019m not dressed for company and\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was too late. He\u2019d already disconnected.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Standing in front of her locked screen door, Carol had no intention of letting Alex inside her home. It was nearly eleven, and they both had to work in the morning. When his car pulled into the driveway, she braced her feet apart and stiffened her back. She should be furious with him. Should be nothing; she was furious!</p><p>But when Alex climbed out of his car, he stood in her driveway for a moment, facing the house. Facing her. The porch light was dim, just bright enough to outline his handsome features.</p><p>With his hands in his pockets, he continued to stand there, staring at her. But that seemed such an inadequate way to describe the intensity of his gaze as his eyes locked with her own. Not a muscle moved in the hard, chiseled line of his jaw, and his eyes feasted on her with undisguised hunger. Even from the distance that separated them, Carol saw that his wonderful gray eyes had darkened with need.</p><p>He wanted her.</p><p>Heaven help her, despite all her arguments to the contrary, she wanted him, too.</p><p>Before he\u2019d marched two steps toward her, Carol had unlocked the screen door and held it open for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going camping,\u201d she announced, her voice scarcely audible. Her lips felt dry and her hands moist. Once she\u2019d stated her position, her breath escaped with a ragged sigh. She thought of ranting at him, calling him a coward and a cheat to use her own son against her the way he had, but not a word made it from her mind to her lips.</p><p>Alex turned and shut the front door.</p><p>The only light was a single lamp on the other side of the room.</p><p>They didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to force you to go camping,\u201d Alex whispered. \u201cIn fact, I...\u201d He paused as he lowered his eyes to her lips, and whatever he intended to say trailed into nothingness.</p><p>Carol felt his eyes on her as keenly as she had his mouth.</p><p>In an effort to break this unnatural spell, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have answered him had her life depended on it. Her back was pressed to the door, and she flattened her hands against it.</p><p>Not once during her marriage had Carol felt as she did at that moment. So...needy. So empty.</p><p>He came to her in a single, unbroken movement, his mouth descending on hers. Carol wound her arms around him and leaned into his solid strength, craving it as never before. Again and again and again he kissed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlex.\u201d She tore her lips from his. \u201cAlex,\u201d she breathed again, almost panting. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong....\u201d</p><p>She could feel his breath against her neck and his fingers in her hair, directing her mouth back to his, kissing her with such heat, Carol thought she\u2019d disintegrate.</p><p>Her tears came in earnest then, a great profusion that had been building inside her for years. Long, lonely, barren years.</p><p>With the tears came pain, pain so intense she could hardly breathe. Agony spilled from her heart. The trauma that had been buried within her stormed out in a torrent of tears that she could no more stop than she could control.</p> <p>Huge sobs shook her shoulders, giant hiccupping sobs that she felt all the way to her toes. Sobs that depleted her strength. Her breathing was ragged as she stumbled toward the edge of hysteria.</p><p>Alex was speaking to her in soft, reassuring whispers, but Carol couldn\u2019t hear him. It didn\u2019t matter what he said. Nothing mattered.</p><p>She clutched his shirt tighter and tighter. Soon there were no more tears to shed, no more emotion to be spent. Alex continued to hold her. He slid his arms all the way around her, and although she couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying, his voice was gentle.</p><p>Once the desperate crying had started to subside, Carol drew in giant gulps of air in a futile effort to gain control of herself.</p><p>Slowly Alex guided her to the sofa and sat her down, then gathered her in his arms and held her tenderly.</p> <p>Time lost meaning to Carol until she heard the clock chime midnight. Until then she was satisfied with being held in Alex\u2019s arms. He asked no questions, demanded no explanations. He simply held her, offering comfort and consolation.</p><p>This newfound contentment in his arms was all too short-lived, however. Acute embarrassment stole through the stillness, and fresh tears stung Carol\u2019s eyes. Her mind, her thoughts, her memories were steeped in emotions too strong to bear.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019ll make some coffee,\u201d she whispered, unwinding her arms from him, feeling she had to escape.</p><p>\u201cForget the coffee.\u201d</p><p>She broke away and got shakily to her feet. Before he could stop her, she hurried into the kitchen and supported herself against the counter, not sure if she could perform the uncomplicated task of making a pot of coffee.</p><p>Alex followed her into the darkened room. He placed one hand on her shoulder and gently turned her around, so she had no choice but to face him. \u201cI want to talk about what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...please.\u201d She leveled her eyes at the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head emphatically. \u201cNot now. Please not now.\u201d</p><p>A long, desperate moment passed before he gently kissed the crown of her head. \u201cFine,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot now. But soon. Very soon.\u201d</p><p>Carol doubted she could ever discuss what had happened between them, but she didn\u2019t have the strength or the courage to say so. That would only have invited argument.</p><p>\u201cI...I think you should go.\u201d</p><p>His nod was reluctant. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A bold-faced lie if ever there was one. She would never be the same again. She was mortified to the very marrow of her bones by her behavior. How could she ever see him again? And then the pain, the memories came rushing back...</p> <p>No, she wouldn\u2019t be all right, but she\u2019d pretend she was, the same way she\u2019d been pretending from the moment she married Bruce.</p><p>The message waiting for Alex when he returned to his office the following afternoon didn\u2019t come as any surprise. His secretary handed him the yellow slip, and the instant he saw Carol\u2019s name, he knew. She was working late that evening and asked if he could pick up Peter from track and drop him off at the house.</p><p>The little coward! He sat at his desk, leaned back in his chair and frowned. He hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her the night before. Hadn\u2019t wanted to walk out of her kitchen without being assured she was all right. Carol, however, had made it clear that she wanted him to leave. Equally apparent was the fact that his being there had only added to her distress. Whatever Carol was facing, whatever ghost she\u2019d encountered, was ugly and traumatic.</p><p>So he\u2019d left. But he hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about her all day. The thought of her had filled every waking minute.</p><p>Even now, hours later, he could remember in vivid detail the way she\u2019d started to unfold and blossom right before his eyes. Because of him. For him.</p><p>His frown deepened. She\u2019d never talked about her marriage. Alex assumed it had to be the source of her anguish, but he didn\u2019t know why. He didn\u2019t even know her late husband\u2019s name. Questions bombarded him, and he cursed the lack of answers.</p><p>And now, his sweet coward had gone into hiding.</p><p>\u201cWill you talk to her, Mr. Preston?\u201d Peter begged as he climbed inside the van in the school parking lot. \u201cMom\u2019s never gone camping, and I think she\u2019d probably like it if she gave it half a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Alex promised.</p><p>Peter sighed with relief. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Sounding both confident and proud, James said, \u201cMy dad can be persuasive when he wants to be.\u201d</p><p>Alex intended to be very persuasive.</p><p>\u201cI tried to reason with Mom this morning, and you know what she said?\u201d Peter\u2019s changing voice pitched between two octaves.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Doesn\u2019t that sound just like a woman? And I thought Melody Wohlford was hard to understand.\u201d</p><p>Alex stifled a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you boys what I\u2019m going to do. We\u2019ll pick up hamburgers on the way home, and I\u2019ll drop you both off at my house. Then I\u2019ll drive over to your place, Peter, and wait for your mother there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d James said, nodding his approval.</p><p>\u201cBut while I\u2019m gone, I want you boys to do your homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d James echoed. \u201cJust do whatever it takes to convince Mrs. Sommars to come on our camping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>Carol let herself in the front door, drained from a long, taxing day at the hospital and exhausted from the sleepless night that had preceded it. That morning, she\u2019d been tempted to phone in sick, but with two nurses already out due to illness, there wasn\u2019t anyone to replace her. So she\u2019d gone to work feeling emotionally and physically hungover.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019m home,\u201d she called. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Walking into the kitchen, she deposited her purse on the counter and hurried toward her son\u2019s bedroom. She\u2019d contacted Alex and asked that he bring Peter home, with instructions to phone back if he couldn\u2019t. She hadn\u2019t heard from him, so she\u2019d assumed he\u2019d pick up her son and drop him off at the house.</p><p>Peter\u2019s room was empty, his bed unmade. An array of clean and dirty clothes littered his floor. Everything was normal there.</p><p>This was what she got for trying to avoid Alex, Carol mused, chastising herself. Peter was probably still waiting at the high school track, wondering where she could possibly be.</p><p>Sighing, she hurried back into the kitchen and reached for her purse. She had to get him his own cell phone, she decided\u2014it would help in situations like this.</p><p>The doorbell rang as she walked through the living room. Impatiently she jerked open the door and her eyes collided with Alex\u2019s. She gasped.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d he said in the warm, husky way that never failed to affect her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d He had, but she wasn\u2019t about to admit it. \u201cApparently you didn\u2019t get my message.... Peter must still be at the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s at my house with James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That hardly expressed the instant dread she felt. They were alone, and there was no escape, at least not by the most convenient means\u2014Peter.</p><p>Alex stepped into the house and for the first time, she noticed he was carrying a white paper bag. Her gaze settled on it and she frowned.</p><p>\u201cTwo Big Macs, fries and shakes,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cFor whom?\u201d</p><p>Alex arched his eyebrows. \u201cUs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d He honestly expected her to sit down and eat with him? It would be impossible. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\u2014very hungry. If you don\u2019t want to eat, that\u2019s fine. I will, and while I\u2019m downing my dinner, we can talk.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t do any good to argue, and Carol knew it. Without another word, she turned and walked to the kitchen. Alex followed her, and his movements, as smooth and agile as always, sounded thunderous behind her. She was aware of everything about him. When he walked, when he breathed, when he moved.</p><p>His eyes seemed to bore holes in her back, but she ignored the impulse to turn and face him. She couldn\u2019t bear to look him in the eye. The memory of what had happened the night before made her cheeks flame.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked in that husky, caring way of his.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she answered cheerfully. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her heart was pounding, clamoring in her ears. \u201cI\u2019m...sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be, since you\u2019re the cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m...sure you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d She got two plates from the cupboard and set them on the table.</p><p>As she stepped past him, Alex grabbed her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play word games with you. We\u2019ve come too far for that...and we\u2019re going a lot further.\u201d</p><p>Unable to listen to his words, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Carol.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it. She lowered her head, eyes still shut.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>Naturally he could afford to be generous. He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d dissolved in a frenzy of violent tears and emotion. She was just grateful that Peter had slept through the whole episode.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d she cried and broke away. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have ignored what happened? Why do you have to drag it up now?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDo you enjoy embarrassing me like this? Do you get a kick out of seeing me miserable?\u201d She paused, breathless, her chest heaving. \u201cPlease, just go away and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Her fierce words gave birth to a brief, tense silence.</p><p>Grasping her chin between his thumb and forefinger, Alex lifted her head. Fresh emotion filled her chest, knotting in her throat as her eyes slid reluctantly to his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened last night,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least not entirely.\u201d His voice was gruff, angry, emotional. \u201cAll I know is that I\u2019ve never felt closer to anyone than I did to you\u2014and I\u2019ve never felt more helpless. But we\u2019ve got something special, Carol, and I refuse to let you throw it away. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip, sniffled, then slowly nodded.</p><p>The tension eased from Alex, and he reached for her, gently taking her in his arms. She went without question, hiding her face against his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Long, lazy moments passed before he spoke. \u201cI want you to tell me about your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried and frantically shook her head.</p><p>He was silent again, and she could feel him withdrawing from her\u2014or maybe she was the one withdrawing. She wanted to ask him to be patient with her, to give her breathing room, time to analyze what was happening between them.</p><p>Just when she was ready to speak, she felt him relax. He chuckled softly, his warm breath mussing her hair. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll strike a bargain with you. If you go camping with me this weekend, I\u2019ll drop the subject\u2014not forever, mind you, but until you\u2019re comfortable enough to talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>Carol raised her head, her eyes meeting his. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a black heart, Alex Preston.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cWhen it comes to courting you, I\u2019ve learned I need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Carol muttered as she headed up the steep trail into the trees. The surf pounded the Washington beach far below. But directly in front of her was a narrow path that led straight into the rain forest.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait for you guys, do we?\u201d James whined. He and Peter were obviously eager to do some exploring on their own.</p><p>Carol was about to launch into a long list of cautions when Alex spoke. \u201cFeel free,\u201d he told the two boys. \u201cCarol and I will be back at camp in time for dinner. We\u2019ll expect you to be there then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes both boys were out of sight, and Carol resumed the increasingly difficult climb. A mountain goat would\u2019ve had trouble maneuvering this path, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Alex said behind her. Breathless from the physical exertion required by the steep incline, Carol paused and took a couple of minutes to breathe deeply.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you get all hot and sweaty for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop,\u201d she cried, embarrassed and yet amused by his words.</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>To complicate things, Alex moved with grace and skill, even while carrying a backpack. So far, he hadn\u2019t even worked up a sweat. Carol, on the other hand, was panting. She hadn\u2019t realized how out of shape she was until now.</p><p>\u201cThe view had better be worth all this effort,\u201d she said with a moan five minutes later. The muscles in her calves were beginning to protest, and her heart was pounding so hard it echoed in her ears.</p><p>To make matters worse, she\u2019d worn the worst possible combination of clothes. Not knowing what to expect weather-wise, she\u2019d donned heavy boots, jeans and a thick sweatshirt, plus a jacket. Her head was covered with a bright pink cap her mother had knitted for her last Christmas. Should they happen upon a snowstorm, Carol was prepared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth the climb,\u201d Alex promised. \u201cDo you want me to lead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she said, dismissing his offer. \u201cI\u2019d never be able to keep up with you.\u201d</p><p>A little while later, Carol staggered into a clearing. She stopped abruptly, astonished by the beauty that surrounded her. The forest she\u2019d just left was dense with a variety of evergreens. Huge limbs were draped with mossy green blankets that hung down so far they touched the spongy ground. Moss-coated stumps dotted the area, some sprouting large white mushroom caps. Wildflowers carpeted the earth and a gentle breeze drifted through the meadow and, catching her breath, Carol removed her hat in a form of worship.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThis is wonderful...I feel like I\u2019m standing in a cathedral...this makes me want to pray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I wanted you to see,\u201d Alex said, resting his hand on the curve of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d she whispered in disbelief. \u201cYou mean there\u2019s something better than this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Carol pulled off her jacket, stuffed her hat into one of the pockets and tied the sleeves around her waist. Eagerly she trailed Alex along the winding narrow pathway.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a freshwater cove about a mile from here,\u201d he explained, turning back to look at her. \u201cAre you up to the trek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She felt invigorated. More than that, she felt elated. Alive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a good sport about all this,\u201d Alex said, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cI knew I was going to be okay when I saw that you\u2019d pitched the tents close to the public restrooms. I\u2019m not comfortable unless I\u2019m near something that goes flush in the night.\u201d</p><p>Alex laughed. They hiked for another twenty minutes and eventually came to the edge of a cliff that fell sharply into the water. The view of bright green waves, contrasted by brilliant blue skies, was beautiful enough to bring tears to Carol\u2019s eyes. The park department had set up a chain-link fence along the edge, as well as a rough-hewn bench that had been carved out of an old tree trunk.</p><p>Alex gestured for her to sit down. Spreading her coat on the bench, Carol sat down and gazed out at the vista before her.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would be.\u201d He slipped off his pack and set it in front of them. Then he unfastened the zipper and removed a folded plastic bag that resembled the ones Carol used to line her garbage cans.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA garbage bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Well, that was what it looked like.</p><p>Next, he took out a whistle, which he held up for her inspection. \u201cA whistle,\u201d he announced unnecessarily. Finally he found what he was searching for and placed a thick chocolate bar and two apples on the bench.</p><p>\u201cWithout appearing completely stupid,\u201d Carol said, biting into her apple, \u201cmay I ask why you hauled a garbage bag all the way up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case we get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she cried in alarm. She\u2019d assumed Alex knew his way back to their campsite. He\u2019d certainly implied as much.</p><p>\u201cEven the best of hikers have been known to get lost. This is just a precaution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen...I mean, I thought you were experienced.\u201d</p><p>He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, this is no time to joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. The garbage bag, the whistle and the chocolate are all part of the hug-a-tree program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHug-a-tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way of preparing children, or anyone else for that matter, in case they get lost in the woods. The idea is to stay in one place\u2014to literally hug a tree. The garbage bag is for warmth. If you slip inside it, feet first, and crouch down, gathering the opening around your neck, you can keep warm in near-freezing temperatures. It weighs practically nothing. The whistle aids rescuers in locating whoever\u2019s lost, and the reason for the candy is obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to tell me we\u2019re chowing down on our limited food rations?\u201d Carol bit into her apple again before Alex could change his mind and take it away from her.</p><p>\u201cIndeed we are, but then we\u2019re practically within sight of the campground, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in any danger of getting lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Too ravenous to care, Carol peeled the paper from the chocolate bar and took a generous bite.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for that,\u201d Alex murmured, setting aside his apple.</p><p>Carol paused, the candy bar in front of her mouth. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could kiss you and taste the chocolate on your lips.\u201d He reached for her, and his mouth found hers with such need, such hunger, that Carol groaned. Alex hadn\u2019t touched her in days, patiently giving her time to determine the boundaries of their relationship. Now she was starving for him, eager for his kiss, his touch.</p><p>His kiss was slow, so slow and deliberate. When he lifted his head Carol moaned and sagged against him.</p><p>\u201cYou taste sweet,\u201d he whispered, tugging at her lower lip with his teeth. \u201cEven sweeter than I expected. Even sweeter than chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Her sleeping bag and air mattress didn\u2019t look as comfortable as a bed at the Hilton, but they appeared adequate, Carol decided later that night. At least Alex had enough equipment for the four of them. All Carol and Peter owned was one GI Joe sleeping bag, decorated with little green army men, and Carol wasn\u2019t particularly excited about having to sleep in that.</p><p>They\u2019d hiked and explored most of the afternoon. By the time everything was cleared away after dinner, dusk had settled over Salt Creek Park. Carol was out of energy, but Peter and James insisted they couldn\u2019t officially call it camping unless everyone sat around the campfire, toasted marshmallows and sang silly songs. And so a lengthy songfest had ensued.</p><p>Carol was yawning when she crawled inside the small tent she was sharing with Peter. Alex and James\u2019s larger tent was pitched next to theirs. By the dim light of the lantern hanging from the middle of the tent, Carol undressed, cleaned her face and then slipped into the sleeping bag.</p><p>\u201cIs it safe yet?\u201d Peter yelled impatiently from outside the tent.</p><p>\u201cSafe and sound,\u201d Carol returned. She\u2019d just finished zipping up the bag when Peter pulled back the flap and stuck his head in.</p><p>Smiling, he withdrew, and she heard him whisper something to James about how unreasonable women could be. Carol didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done that could be considered unreasonable, and she was too drained to ask.</p><p>\u201cGood night, everyone,\u201d Carol called out when Peter dimmed the lantern.</p><p>There was a mixed chorus of \u201cgood nights.\u201d Content, she rolled onto her stomach and closed her eyes.</p><p>Within minutes Carol was fast asleep.</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p>She woke sometime later as her name was whispered close to her ear. Jerking her head up, she saw Alex kneeling just inside the tent, fully dressed. A shaft of moonlight showed her that he\u2019d pressed his finger to his lips, indicating she should be quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her lack of enthusiasm and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t wait until morning?\u201d she said, yawning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by morning,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGet dressed and meet me in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand what was so important that she couldn\u2019t see it by the light of day.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not out here in five minutes,\u201d he warned in a husky voice from outside her tent, \u201cI\u2019m coming in after you.\u201d</p><p>Carol grumbled as she scurried around looking for her clothes. It was difficult to pull on her jeans in the cramped space, but with a few acrobatic moves, she managed. Before she crawled out, she tapped Peter\u2019s shoulder and told him she\u2019d be back in a few minutes.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t seem to care one way or the other.</p><p>Alex was waiting for her. His lazy smile wrapped its way around her heart and squeezed tight. For all her moaning and complaining about this camping trip, Carol was having a wonderful time.</p><p>\u201cThis had better be good,\u201d she warned and ingloriously yawned.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he promised. He held a flashlight and a blanket in one hand and reached for hers with the other. Then he led her toward the beach. Although she was wearing her jacket, the wind made her shiver. Alex must have noticed, because he slid his arm around her shoulder and drew her closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d She found herself whispering, not sure why.</p><p>\u201cTo a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rock,\u201d she repeated, incredulous. \u201cYou woke me from a sound sleep so I could see a rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot see, sit on one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do this at noon in the warm sun?\u201d she muttered, laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re going to look at the stars.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s step faltered. \u201cDo you mean to tell me you rousted me from a warm, cozy sleeping bag in the middle of the night to show me a few stars? The very same stars I could see from my own bedroom window?\u201d</p><p>Alex chuckled. \u201cAre you always this testy when you just wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she told him. Yawning again, she covered her mouth with one hand.</p> <p>Although the campsite was only a few feet away, it was completely hidden behind a clump of trees. Carol could hear the ocean\u2014presumably at the bottom of some nearby cliff\u2014but she couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should choose a tree now. Which one looks the friendliest to you?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cA tree? Whatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hug. Didn\u2019t you tell me this afternoon that if I ever get lost in the woods a tree is my friend? If we get separated, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever find my way back to camp.\u201d</p><p>Alex dropped a kiss on her head. \u201cI won\u2019t let you out of my sight for a minute, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I trusted a guy, I was eighteen and I was pregnant three weeks later.\u201d She meant it as a joke, but once the words were out they seemed to hang in the air between them.</p> <p>\u201cYou were only eighteen when you got married?\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded, pulled her hand free from his and shoved it in the pocket of her jacket. She could feel herself withdrawing from him. She drew inside herself a little more.</p><p>They walked in silence for several minutes.</p><p>Suddenly Alex aimed the flashlight at the ground and paused. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver there?\u201d Carol asked. She squinted but couldn\u2019t see any rock.</p><p>\u201cJust follow me,\u201d Alex said. \u201cAnd no more wisecracks about what happened the last time you listened to a guy. I\u2019m not your first husband, and it would serve us both well if you remembered that.\u201d His words were light, teasing, but they sent Carol reeling.</p><p>He reached for her hand, lacing his fingers through hers. She could almost hear the litany of questions in Alex\u2019s mind. He wanted her to tell him about Bruce. But no one fully knew what a nightmare her marriage had been. Not even her mother. And Carol wasn\u2019t about to drag out all the pain for Alex to examine.</p><p>Within a couple of minutes, Alex had located \u201chis\u201d rock. At first Carol thought it looked like all the other rocks, silhouetted against the beach.</p> <p>He climbed up the side, obviously familiar with its shape and size, then offered Carol his hand. Once they were perched on top, he spread out the blanket and motioned for her to sit down.</p><p>Carol did and pulled her knees under her chin.</p><p>Alex settled down beside her. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, pointing toward the heavens, \u201ccan you see that outside your bedroom window?\u201d</p><p>Having forgotten the purpose of this outing, Carol cast her gaze toward the dark sky, then straightened in wonder and surprise. The sky was so heavy with stars\u2014hundreds, no, thousands of them\u2014that it seemed to sag down and touch the earth. \u201cOh, Alex,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWorth waking up for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell worth it,\u201d she said, thanking him with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d think so.\u201d His returning smile flew straight into her heart.</p><p>She\u2019d been struck by so much extraordinary beauty in such a short while that she felt almost overwhelmed. Turning her head slightly, she smiled again at this man who had opened her eyes to life, to beauty, to love and whispered fervently, \u201cThank you, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the hike in the rain forest, for the view of the cove, for ignoring my complaints and showing me the stars, for...everything.\u201d For coming into her life. For leading her by the hand. For being so patient with her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Lost in the magic, Carol closed her eyes and inhaled the fragrant scent of the wind, the ocean and the night. Rarely had she experienced this kind of contentment and uncomplicated happiness.</p><p>When the breeze came, the trees whispered, and the sound combined with the crashing of the surf below. The scents of pine and sea drifted over her. Throwing back her head, Carol tried to take it all in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I appreciated how truly beautiful you are until now,\u201d Alex murmured. His face was carved in severe but sensual lines, and his eyes had darkened with emotion.</p><p>Carol turned, and when she did, he brushed back the curls from her cheek. His hand lingered on her face, and Carol covered it with her own, closing her eyes at all the sensations that accompanied his touch.</p><p>He brought his free hand to her hair, which he threaded through his fingers as though the texture was pure silk. He traced her lower lip with his finger. Unable to resist, Carol circled it with the tip of her tongue....</p><p>Time seemed to stand still as Alex\u2019s eyes sought and held hers.</p><p>He kissed her, and it was excruciatingly slow. Exquisitely slow.</p><p>He pressed warm kisses in the hollow of her neck and slipped his hands inside her jacket, circling her waist and bringing her closer. \u201cThe things you do to me,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cThe things I do to you?\u201d She rested her forehead against his own. \u201cThey can\u2019t compare to what you do\u2014have always done\u2014to me.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with the beginnings of a smile, and Carol leaned forward just enough to kiss him again.</p><p>Under her jacket Alex slid his hands up her back. He stopped abruptly, went still and tore his mouth from hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Carol asked, lifting her head. Her hands were on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a bra, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You said I had only five minutes to dress, so I hurried.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned into hers, then moved lower to the snap of her jeans. \u201cDid you...take any other shortcuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna find out?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head wildly. \u201cI...I promised myself when you agreed to go camping that I\u2019d do everything I could to keep my hands off you.\u201d Although she was still in his arms, Carol had to strain to hear him.</p><p>\u201cI think that was a wise decision,\u201d she murmured, looking up at him. Alex\u2019s expression was filled with surprise. An inner happiness she\u2019d banished from her life so long ago she hadn\u2019t known it was missing pulsed through her now.</p><p>When he finally released her, Carol was so weak with longing that she clung to him, breathing deeply.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d he said, watching her closely as she shifted positions. She climbed onto his lap, wrapped her legs around his waist and threw her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cOh...Carol.\u201d Alex moaned and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d she whispered, kissing him deeply. He didn\u2019t speak again for a long, long time. Neither did she...</p><p>Thursday afternoon, with a stethoscope around her neck, Carol walked down the hospital corridor to the nurses\u2019 station. Her steps were brisk and her heart heavy. She hadn\u2019t talked to Alex since late Sunday, when he\u2019d dropped Peter and her at the house after their camping trip. There could be any number of excellent reasons why he hadn\u2019t called or stopped by. Maybe he was simply too busy; that made sense. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to see her again; perhaps he\u2019d decided to start dating other women. Younger women. Prettier women. He was certainly handsome enough. Perhaps aliens had captured him, and he was trapped in some spaceship circling uncharted universes.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it translated into one glaring, inescapable fact. She hadn\u2019t seen or heard from Alex in four days. However, she reminded herself, she didn\u2019t need a man to make her happy. She didn\u2019t need a relationship.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a call for you on line one,\u201d Betty Mills told her. \u201cWant me to take a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the person give a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex Preston. He sounds sexy, too,\u201d Betty added in a succulent voice. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s that handsome guy you were having lunch with a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s heart slammed against her ribs\u2014first with alarm and then with relief. She\u2019d done everything she could to ignore the gaping hole in her life without Alex there. All it would\u2019ve taken was a phone call\u2014she could have contacted him. She could\u2019ve asked Peter to talk to James. She could\u2019ve driven over to his house. But she\u2019d done none of those things.</p><p>\u201cCarol? Do you want me to take a message or not?\u201d Betty asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>Betty laughed. \u201cI would, too, if I were you.\u201d With that, she turned and marched away.</p><p>Carol moved to the nurses\u2019 station and was grateful no one else was around to overhear her conversation. \u201cThis is Carol Sommars,\u201d she said as professionally as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cCarol, it\u2019s Alex.\u201d</p><p>His words burned in her ears. \u201cHello, Alex,\u201d she said, hoping she didn\u2019t sound terribly stiff. Her pulse broke into a wild, absurd rhythm at his voice, and despite her best efforts, a warm sense of happiness settled over her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to call you at the hospital, but I haven\u2019t been able to reach you at home for the past few nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d Busy trying to escape the loneliness. Busy ignoring questions she didn\u2019t want to answer. Busy hiding.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Alex said impatiently. \u201cAre you avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I thought you...if you want the truth, I assumed you\u2019d decided not to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot see you,\u201d he repeated loudly. \u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m nuts about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her mouth trembled, but whether it was from irritation or sheer blessed relief, Carol didn\u2019t know. If he was nuts about her, why had he neglected her all week? Why hadn\u2019t he at least left her a message?</p><p>\u201cYou honestly haven\u2019t figured out how I feel about you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been at the school in the past few days, and since I didn\u2019t hear from you it made sense\u2014to me, anyway\u2014that you wanted to cool things down, and I don\u2019t blame you. Things are getting much too hot and much too...well, fast, and personally I thought that...well, that it was for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d he demanded, his voice exploding over the wire. \u201cWhen I get home the first thing I\u2019m going to do is kiss some sense into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Houston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other?\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishing I was in Portland, mostly. A friend of mine, another contractor, is involved in a huge project here and ran into problems. There must\u2019ve been five messages from him when we returned from the camping trip. He needed some help right away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about James?

His name is Barney.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely Carol did remember either Alex or James mentioning the man, but she couldn\u2019t remember where or when she\u2019d heard it. \u201cHow...long will you be gone?\u201d She hated the way her voice fell, the way it made her need for him all too evident.</p><p>\u201cAnother week at least.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart catapulted to her feet, then gradually righted itself. \u201cA week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it any better than you do. I can\u2019t believe how much I miss you. How much I needed to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt that, too, only she hadn\u2019t been willing to admit it, even to herself.</p><p>There was a slight commotion on Alex\u2019s end of the line and when it cleared, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll try to call you again, but we\u2019re working day and night and this is the first real break I\u2019ve had in three days. I\u2019m glad I got through to you.\u201d</p><p>Her grip tightened on the receiver. \u201cI\u2019m glad, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to go. Bye, Carol. I\u2019ll see you Thursday or so of next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Alex...and thanks for phoning.\u201d She was about to hang up when she realized there was something else she had to say. She cried his name, desperate to catch him before he hung up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she said, sighing with relief. \u201cI\u2019ve...I want you to know I...I\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his chuckle was as warm and melodious as a hundred-voice choir. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s something. Keep next Thursday open for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a date.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday evening of the following week, Carol was teaching her birthing class. Ten couples were sprawled on big pillows in front of her as she led them through a series of exercises. She enjoyed this work almost as much as she did her daytime job at the hospital. She and Janice Mandle each taught part of the class, with Carol handling the first half.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s doing exceptionally well tonight,\u201d Carol said, praising the teams. \u201cOkay, partners, I have a question for you. I want you to tell me, in number of seconds, how long you think a typical labor pain lasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty seconds,\u201d one young man shouted out.</p><p>\u201cLonger,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cSixty seconds,\u201d yelled another.</p><p>Carol shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNinety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too sure about that,\u201d Carol said, smiling. \u201cLet\u2019s stick with ninety seconds. That\u2019s a nice round number, although in the final stages of labor it\u2019s not unusual for a contraction to last much longer.\u201d</p> <p>The pregnant women eyed each other warily.</p><p>\u201cAll right, partners, I want you to show me your biceps. Tighten them as hard as you can. Good. Good,\u201d she said, surveying the room, watching as several of the men brought up their fists until the muscles of their upper arms bulged. \u201cMake it as tight and as painful as you can,\u201d she continued. Most of the men were gritting their teeth.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d she went on to say. \u201cNow, hold that until I tell you to relax.\u201d She walked to the other side of the room. \u201cAs far back as 1913, some doctors and midwives recognized that fear and tension could interfere with the birthing process. Even then they believed that deep breathing exercises and relaxation could aid labor.\u201d She paused to glance at her watch. \u201cThat\u2019s fifteen seconds.\u201d</p><p>The look of astonishment that crossed the men\u2019s faces was downright comical.</p><p>\u201cKeep those muscles tightly clenched,\u201d Carol instructed. She strolled around the room, chatting amiably as the men held their arms as tight as possible. Some were already showing the strain.</p><p>\u201cThirty seconds,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Her words were followed by a low groan. Carol couldn\u2019t help smiling. She hated to admit how much she enjoyed their discomfort, but this exercise was an excellent illustration of the realities of labor, especially for the men. The smile remained on her lips as the door in the back of the room opened to admit a latecomer. Carol opened her mouth to welcome the person, but the words didn\u2019t reach her lips.</p><p>There, framed inside the door, stood Alex Preston.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Carol stared at Alex. Alex stared at Carol.</p><p>The room went completely still; the air felt heavy, and the quiet seemed eerie, unnatural. It wasn\u2019t until Carol realized that several taut faces were gazing up at her anxiously that she pulled her attention away from Alex and back to her class.</p><p>\u201cNow, where were we?\u201d she asked, flustered and nervous.</p><p>\u201cNinety seconds,\u201d one of the men shouted.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d She glanced at her watch and nodded. \u201cNinety seconds.\u201d</p><p>The relief could be felt all the way across the room.</p><p>A few minutes later Carol dismissed everyone for a fifteen-minute break. Janice strolled over to Carol and eyed the back of the room, where Alex was patiently waiting. He was leaning against the back wall, his ankles crossed and his thumbs hooked in the belt loop of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt too distracted and tongue-tied to respond, although her thoughts had been traveling along those same lines. Alex was the sexiest man Carol had ever known. Unabashedly wonderful, too.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...been out of town,\u201d she said, her eyes magnetically drawn to Alex\u2019s.</p><p>Janice draped her arm across Carol\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSince your portion of tonight\u2019s class is finished, why don\u2019t you go ahead and leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Carol tore her eyes from Alex long enough to study her co-teacher. They were a team, and although they\u2019d divided the class into two distinct sections, they stayed and lent each other emotional support.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. I insist. Only...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d Carol pressed.</p><p>\u201cOnly promise me that if another gorgeous guy walks in off the street and looks at me like he\u2019s looking at you, you\u2019ll return the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Carol answered automatically.</p><p>Janice\u2019s voice fell to a whisper. \u201cGood. Then we\u2019ll consider this our little secret.\u201d</p><p>Carol frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014what do you mean, our little secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if my husband found out about this agreement, there could be problems.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughed. Janice was happily married and had been for fifteen years.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you I wouldn\u2019t be hanging around here talking,\u201d Janice murmured, giving Carol a small shove. \u201cDon\u2019t keep him waiting any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...thanks.\u201d Feeling unaccountably shy, Carol retrieved her purse and her briefcase and walked toward Alex. With each step that drew her nearer, her heart felt lighter. By the time she made her way to the back of the room, she felt nearly airborne.</p><p>He straightened, his eyes warm and caressing. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter told me you were teaching tonight and where. I hope you don\u2019t mind that I dropped in unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Mind? Her heart was soaring with gladness. She could\u2019ve flown without an airplane. No, she didn\u2019t mind that he\u2019d dropped in\u2014not in the least.</p><p>For the longest moment all they did was gaze at each other like starry-eyed lovers.</p><p>A noise at the front of the room distracted Carol. She glanced over her shoulder and saw several couples watching them with undisguised curiosity.</p><p>\u201cJanice said she\u2019d finish up here, and I could...should leave now.\u201d</p><p>Alex grinned, and with that, Carol could feel whole sections of the sturdy wall around her heart start to crumble. This man\u2019s smile was nothing short of lethal.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to thank her later,\u201d Alex said. He removed the briefcase from her unresisting fingers and opened the door, letting her precede him outside.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t taken two steps out the door when Alex paused. Carol felt his hesitation and stopped, turning to face him. That was when she knew Alex was going to kiss her. It didn\u2019t matter that they were standing in front of a public building. It didn\u2019t matter that it was still light enough for any number of passersby to see them. It didn\u2019t matter that they were both respected professionals.</p><p>Alex scooped her into his arms and with a lavish sigh lowered his head and covered her lips in the sweetest, wildest kiss of her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe hours felt like years, the days like decades.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt tears in the corners of her eyes. She hadn\u2019t thought about how empty her life had felt without him, how bleak and alone she was with him away. Now it poured out of her in a litany of sighs and kisses. \u201cI...I missed you, too\u2014so much.\u201d</p><p>For years she\u2019d been content in her own secure world, the one she\u2019d created for herself and her son. The borders had been narrow, confining, but she\u2019d made peace with herself and found serenity. Then she\u2019d met Alex, and he\u2019d forced her to notice how cramped and limited her existence was. Not only that, he\u2019d pointed toward the horizon, to a new land of shared dreams.</p><p>When Alex spoke again, his voice was heavy with need. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and followed him to his car, ready to abandon her own with little more than a second thought.</p><p>He unlocked the passenger door, then turned to face her. His eyes were dancing with excitement. \u201cLet\u2019s dispense with formalities and elope. Now. Tonight. This minute.\u201d</p><p>The words hit her hard. She blinked at the unexpectedness of his suggestion, prepared to laugh it off as a joke.</p><p>But Alex was serious. He looked as shocked as Carol felt, but she noted that the idea had begun to gain momentum. The mischievous spark in his eyes was gone, replaced by a solemn look.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Carol. I love you so much that my buddy in Texas practically threw me on the plane and told me to get home before I died of it. He said he\u2019d never seen anyone more lovesick and made me promise we\u2019d name one of our children after him.\u201d</p><p>The mention of a child was like a right cross to the jaw after his punch to her solar plexus, and she flinched involuntarily.</p><p>Alex set his hands on her shoulders, and a smile touched his eyes and then his mouth. He smiled so endearingly that all of Carol\u2019s arguments fled like dust in a whirlwind.</p><p>\u201cSay something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...my car\u2019s parked over there.\u201d She pointed in the general vicinity of her Ford. Her throat was so tight she could hardly speak.</p><p>He laughed and hugged her. \u201cI know this is sudden for you. I\u2019m a fool not to have done it properly. I swear I\u2019ll do it again over champagne and give you a diamond so large you\u2019ll sink in a swimming pool, but I can\u2019t keep the way I feel inside anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex...\u201d</p><p>He silenced her with a swift kiss. \u201cBelieve me, blurting out a proposal like this is as much of a surprise to me as it is to you. I had no idea I was going to ask you tonight. The entire flight home I was trying to figure out how I could make it as romantic as possible. The last thing I expected to do was impulsively shout it out in a parking lot. But something happened tonight.\u201d He reached for her limp hands and brought them to his lips, then kissed her knuckles with reverence. \u201cWhen I walked into your class and saw you with all those pregnant women, I was hit with the most powerful shock of my life.\u201d His voice grew quiet. \u201cAll of a sudden, my mind conjured up the image of you pregnant with our child, and I swear it was all I could do not to break down and weep.\u201d He paused long enough to run his fingers through his hair. \u201cChildren, Carol...our children.\u201d He closed his eyes and sighed deeply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol felt frozen. The chill worked its way from her heart, the icy circles growing larger and more encompassing until the cold extended down her arms and legs and into her fingers and toes.</p><p>\u201cI know this is abrupt, and I\u2019m probably ruining the moment, but say something,\u201d Alex urged. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s mind refused to function properly. Panic was closing in, panic and a hundred misgivings. \u201cI...don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Alex threw back his head and laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. All right,\u201d he said, his eyes flashing, \u201crepeat after me. I, Carol Sommars.\u201d He glanced expectantly at her.</p> <p>\u201cI...Carol Sommars...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm crazy in love with Alex Preston.\u201d He waited for her to echo his words.</p><p>\u201cAm crazy in love with Alex Preston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he whispered and leaned forward just enough to brush his mouth over hers. His arms slipped around her, locking at the small of her back and dragging her unresistingly toward him. \u201cYou know, the best part about those babies is going to be making them.\u201d</p><p>A blush rose up her neck, coloring her cheeks with what she felt sure was a highly uncomplimentary shade of pink. Her eyes darted away from his.</p> <p>\u201cNow all you need to do is say yes,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I...don\u2019t know.\u201d To her horror, she started to sob, not with the restrained tears of a confused woman, but the harsh mournful cries of one in anguish.</p><p>Alex had apparently expected anything but tears. \u201cCarol? What\u2019s wrong? What did I say?\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and brought her head to his shoulder.</p><p>Carol wanted to resist his touch, but she so desperately needed it that she buried her face in the curve of his neck and wept. Alex\u2019s arms were warm and safe, his hands gentle. She did love him. Somewhere between his rescue the night her car broke down and the camping trip, her well-guarded heart had succumbed to his appeal. But falling in love was one thing; marriage and children were something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Alex finally said. He opened the car door for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, sniffling.</p> <p>\u201cMy house. James won\u2019t be home yet, and we can talk without being disturbed.\u201d</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t sure what more he could say, but she agreed with a nod of her head and climbed inside. He closed the door for her, then paused and ran a hand over his eyes, slumping wearily.</p><p>Neither of them said much during the ten-minute drive. He helped her out of his car, then unlocked the front door to his house. His suitcases had been haphazardly dumped on the living room carpet. When he saw Carol looking at them, he said simply, \u201cI was in a hurry to find you.\u201d He led the way into the kitchen and started making a pot of coffee.</p><p>Carol pulled out a stool at the counter and seated herself. His kitchen\u2014in fact, his home\u2014wasn\u2019t at all what she expected. A woman\u2019s touch could be seen and felt in every room. The kitchen was yellow and cheery. What remained of the evening light shone through the window above the sink, sending warm shadows across the polished tile floor. Matching ceramic canisters lined the counter, along with a row of well-used cookbooks.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Carol, tell me what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d Alex urged, facing her from behind the tile counter. Even then Carol wasn\u2019t safe from his magnetism.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d she said, swallowing hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s on my mind. I\u2019m so confused....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize my proposal came out of the blue, but once you think about it, you\u2019ll understand how perfect we are for each other. Surely you\u2019ve thought about it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, and for emphasis, shook her head. \u201cI hadn\u2019t...not once. Marriage hadn\u2019t occurred to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d He raised his right hand to rub his eyes again.</p><p>Carol knew he must be exhausted and was immediately overcome with remorse. She did love Alex, although admitting it\u2014to herself as much as to him\u2014had sapped her strength.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she whispered, staring down at her hands, which were tightly clenched in her lap.</p><p>\u201cWould some time help?\u201d</p><p>She nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year. Several months. At the very least, three or four weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about two weeks?\u201d Alex suggested.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks,\u201d she echoed feebly. That wasn\u2019t nearly enough. She couldn\u2019t possibly reach such an important decision in so little time, especially when there were other factors to consider. Before she could voice a single excuse, Alex pressed his finger to her lips.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t decide in that length of time, then I doubt you ever will.\u201d</p><p>A protest came and went in a single breath. There were so many concerns he hadn\u2019t mentioned\u2014like their sons!</p><p>She was about to bring this up when Alex said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should draw the boys into this until we know our own minds. The last thing we need is pressure from them.\u201d</p><p>Carol agreed completely.</p><p>The coffee had finished perking, and Alex poured them each a cup. \u201cHow about dinner Friday night? Just the two of us.\u201d At her hesitation, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the rest of this week to sort through your thoughts, and if you still have any questions or doubts by Friday, we can discuss them then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not a final decision?\u201d Carol murmured, uneasy with the time limitation. He\u2019d said two weeks, and she was going to need every minute to make up her mind.</p><p>Carol woke around three with her stomach in painful knots. She lay on her side and at a breath-stopping cramp, she tucked her knees under her chin. A wave of nausea hit her hard, and she couldn\u2019t stifle a groan. Despite her flu shot last fall, maybe she\u2019d caught one of the new strains that emerged every year.</p><p>She lay perfectly still in the fervent hope that this would ward off her growing need to vomit. It didn\u2019t work, and a moment later she was racing for the bathroom.</p><p>Afterward, sitting on the floor, her elbows on the edge of the toilet, she breathed deeply.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Peter asked from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI will be. I just need a couple more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Peter asked. He handed her a warm washcloth, following that with a cup of water.</p><p>\u201cThe flu, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He helped her to her feet and walked her back to her bedroom. \u201cI appreciate the help, Peter, but it would be better if you went back to bed. I\u2019ll be fine by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call work for you and tell them you\u2019re too sick to come in.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo...I\u2019ll need to talk to them myself.\u201d Her son dutifully arranged the blankets around her, giving her a worried look before he slipped out of her bedroom.</p><p>Peter must have turned off her alarm because the next thing Carol knew it was eight-thirty. The house was eerily silent.</p><p>Sitting up, she waited for an attack of nausea. It didn\u2019t come. She\u2019d slept without waking even once. She was astonished that she hadn\u2019t heard Peter roaming about. He was usually as noisy as a herd of rampaging buffalo. Perhaps he\u2019d overslept as well.</p><p>In case he had, she threw the sheets back, sat on the edge of the bed and shoved her feet into slippers before wandering into the kitchen. The minute she stepped inside, it was obvious that her son had been up and about. A box of cold cereal stood in the middle of the kitchen table, along with a bowl half-filled with milk and crusts from several pieces of toast.</p><p>Posted on the refrigerator door was a note from Peter, informing her that he\u2019d phoned the hospital and talked to her supervisor, who\u2019d said Carol didn\u2019t need to worry about coming in. He proudly added that he\u2019d made his own lunch and that he\u2019d find a ride home from track practice, so she should stay in bed and drink lots of fluids. In a brief postscript he casually mentioned that he\u2019d also called Grandma Pasquale.</p><p>Carol\u2019s groan had little to do with the way she was feeling. All she needed was her mother, bless her heart, hovering over her and driving her slowly but surely crazy. No sooner had the thought formed in her mind than the doorbell chimed, followed by a key turning in the lock and the front door flying open. Her mother burst into the house as though Carol lay on her deathbed.</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d she cried, walking through the living room. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look terrible. Get back in bed before the undertaker gets wind of how you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, please, I\u2019m just a little under the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my uncle Giuseppe said when he had the flu, God rest his soul. His wife never even got the chicken stewed, he went that fast.\u201d She pressed her hands together, raised her eyes to the ceiling and murmured a silent prayer.</p><p>\u201cPeter shouldn\u2019t have phoned you,\u201d Carol grumbled. She certainly didn\u2019t need her mother fussing at her bedside, spooning chicken soup down her throat every time she opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cPeter did the right thing. He\u2019s a good boy.\u201d</p><p>At the moment Carol considered that point debatable.</p><p>\u201cNow back to bed before you get a dizzy spell.\u201d Her mother made a shooing motion with her hands.</p><p>Mumbling under her breath, Carol did as Angelina insisted. Not because she felt especially ill, but because arguing required too much energy. Carol might as well try to talk her mother into using canned spaghetti sauce as convince her she wasn\u2019t on her deathbed.</p><p>Once Carol was lying down, Angelina dragged the rocking chair into her bedroom and sat down. Before another minute had passed, she was busy with her knitting. Several balls of yarn were lying at her feet in case she wanted to start a second or third project in the next few hours.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Peter you were sick in the middle of the night,\u201d Angelina said. Eyes narrowed, she studied Carol, as if staring would reveal the exact nature of her daughter\u2019s illness. She shook her head, then paused to count the neat row of stitches before glancing back at Carol, clearly expecting an answer.</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been something I ate for dinner,\u201d she suggested lamely.</p><p>\u201cPeter said you were looking at parts of a toilet no one should see that close up.\u201d</p><p>Her teenage son certainly had a way with words. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cYour face is paler than bleached sheets. Uncle Giuseppe has more color than you, and he\u2019s been in his grave for thirty years.\u201d</p><p>Carol leaned back against the pillows and closed her eyes. She might be able to fool just about anyone else, but her mother knew her too well.</p><p>Several tense minutes passed. Angelina said not a word, patient to a fault. Yes, her mother knew; Carol was sure of it. She kept her eyes closed, afraid that another searching look would reveal everything. Oh, what the heck, Angelina would find out sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cAlex asked me to marry him last night.\u201d Carol tried to keep her voice even, but it shook noticeably.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d her mother said, nodding. \u201cThat explains everything. From the time you were a little girl, you got an upset stomach whenever something troubled you, although why you should be troubled when this man tells you he loves you is a whole other question.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol didn\u2019t need to hear stories from her childhood to recognize the truth.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis man brings color to your cheeks and a smile to your eyes and you said nothing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...need time to think,\u201d Carol cried. \u201cThis is an important decision.... I\u2019ve got more than myself and my own life to consider. Alex has a son and I have a son.... It isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shook her head. Her rocker was going ninety miles an hour, and Carol was positive the older woman\u2019s thoughts were churning at equal speed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, Mama,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so frightened.\u201d</p><p>Angelina stopped abruptly and set her knitting aside. She reached for Carol\u2019s hands, holding them gently. A soft smile lit her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll make the right decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure? I\u2019ve been wrong about so many things\u2014I\u2019ve made so many mistakes in my life. I don\u2019t trust my own judgment anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFollow your heart,\u201d Angelina urged. \u201cIt won\u2019t lead you wrong.\u201d</p><p>But it would. She\u2019d followed her heart when she married Bruce, convinced their love would see them through every difficulty. The marriage had been a disaster from the honeymoon on, growing more painful and more difficult with each passing day. The horror of those years with Bruce had shredded her heart and drained away all her self-confidence. She\u2019d offered her husband everything she had to give, relinquished her pride and self-respect\u2014and to what end? Bruce hadn\u2019t appreciated her sacrifices. He hadn\u2019t cherished her love, but turned it into something cheap and expendable.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you decide will be right,\u201d her mother said once again. \u201cI know it will be.\u201d</p><p>Carol closed her eyes to mull over her mother\u2019s confidence in her, which she was sure was completely unfounded. Angelina seemed to trust Carol\u2019s judgment more than Carol did herself.</p><p>A few minutes later, her mother started to sing softly, and her sweet, melodious voice harmonized with the clicking of the needles.</p><p>The next thing Carol knew, it was early afternoon and she could smell chicken soup simmering in the kitchen.</p> <p>Angelina had left a brief note for her that was filled with warmth and encouragement. Feeling much better, Carol helped herself to a bowl of the broth and noodles and leisurely enjoyed her first nourishment of the day.</p><p>By the time Peter slammed into the house several hours later, she was almost back to normal.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d he said rushing into the room. His face was flushed and his eyes bright. It looked as though he\u2019d run all the way home. His chest was heaving as he dropped his books on the table, then tried to catch his breath, arms waving excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Carol asked, amused by the sight her son made.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d he demanded, kissing both her cheeks the way her mother did whenever she was exceptionally pleased. \u201cThis is great, Mom, really great! Now we can go fishing and camping and hiking all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay anything about what?\u201d she asked in bewilderment. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this about fishing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarrying Mr. Preston.\u201d</p><p>Carol was half out of her seat before she even realized she\u2019d moved. \u201cWho told you...who so much as mentioned it was a possibility?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA possibility?\u201d Peter repeated. \u201cI thought it was a done deal. At least that\u2019s what James said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames told you?\u201d</p><p>Peter gave her a perplexed look. \u201cWho else? He told me about it first thing when I got to school this morning.\u201d He studied her, his expression cautious. \u201cHey, Mom, don\u2019t look so upset\u2014I\u2019m sorry if you were keeping it a secret. Don\u2019t worry, James and I think it\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ve always wanted a brother, and having one who\u2019s my best friend is even better.\u201d</p><p>Carol was so outraged she could barely talk. \u201cH-he had no business saying a word!\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cWho? James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot James. Alex.\u201d If he thought he\u2019d use the boys to influence her decision, he had another think coming.</p><p>Carol marched into her bedroom, throwing on a pair of jeans and an old sweatshirt. Then she hurried into the living room without bothering to run a brush through her tousled hair.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Peter demanded. He\u2019d ladeled himself a bowl of soup and was following her around the house like a puppy while she searched for her purse and car keys.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Carol stormed.</p><p>\u201cLooking like that?\u201d He sounded aghast.</p><p>Carol whirled around, hands on her hips, and glared at him.</p><p>Peter raised one hand. \u201cSorry. Only please don\u2019t let Mr. Preston see you, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Peter raised his shoulder in a shrug. \u201cIf he gets a look at you, he might withdraw his proposal. Honestly, Mom, this is the best thing that\u2019s happened to us in years. Don\u2019t go ruining it.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>James answered the door, and a smile automatically came to his lips when he saw it was Carol. Then his eyes narrowed as though he wasn\u2019t sure it was her, after all. Carol realized he was probably taken aback by her appearance. Normally she was well-dressed and well-groomed, but what Alex had done\u2014had tried to do\u2014demanded swift and decisive action. She didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to wear makeup for this confrontation.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Carol asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cWho? Dad?\u201d James frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s watching the news.\u201d The teenager pointed toward the family room, which was adjacent to the kitchen.</p><p>Without waiting for James to escort her inside, Carol burst past him, intent on giving Alex a piece of her mind. She was furious. More than furious. If he\u2019d honestly believed that involving the boys would affect her decision, then he knew absolutely nothing about her. In fact, he knew so little, they had no business even considering marriage.</p><p>She refused to be pressured, tricked, cajoled or anything else, and before this day was over Alex would recognize that very clearly indeed.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Alex met her halfway into the kitchen. His eyes softened perceptibly as he reached for her.</p><p>Carol stopped just short of his embrace. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cHow dare I?\u201d Alex repeated. His eyes widened with surprise, but he remained infuriatingly calm. \u201cWould you elaborate, please, because I\u2019m afraid I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d James ventured into the kitchen, giving Carol a wide berth. \u201cSomething must really be wrong,\u201d the boy said, and then his voice dropped to a whisper as he pointed to Carol\u2019s feet. \u201cMrs. Sommars is wearing two different shoes.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s gaze shot downward, and she mentally groaned. But if either of the Preston men thought they\u2019d throw her off her guard by pointing out that she\u2019d worn a blue tennis shoe on her right foot and a hot-pink slipper on her left, then she had news for them both.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling Mrs. Sommars was in a hurry to talk to me,\u201d Alex explained. The smile that quivered at the corners of his mouth did little to quell her brewing temper.</p><p>James nodded. \u201cDo you want me to get lost for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be a good plan,\u201d Alex replied.</p><p>James exchanged a knowing look with his father before discreetly vacating the room. As soon as Carol heard James\u2019s bedroom door close, she put her hands on her hips, determined to confront Alex.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you bring the boys into this,\u201d she flared.</p><p>\u201cInto what?\u201d Alex walked over to the coffeepot and got two mugs. He held one up to her, but she refused the offer with a shake of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carol, but I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Jabbing her index finger at him, she took several steps toward him. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that, Alex Preston. You know very well what I mean. We agreed to wait, and you saw an advantage and without any compunction, you took it! Did you really think dragging Peter and James into this would help? How could you be so foolish?\u201d Her voice shook, but her eyes were as steady as she could make them.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mention the possibility of our getting married to James, and I certainly didn\u2019t say anything to Peter.\u201d He leaned against the kitchen counter and returned her disbelieving glare with maddening composure.</p><p>Angrily Carol threw back her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened but he didn\u2019t argue with her. \u201cAsk James then. If he heard that I\u2019d proposed to you, the information didn\u2019t come from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to believe that, do you?\u201d she cried, not nearly as confident as she\u2019d been earlier. The aggression had gone out of her voice, and she lowered her hands to her sides, less certain with each minute. The ground that supported her outrage started to shift and crumble.</p><p>\u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t bring the boys into this,\u201d he reminded her smoothly. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t.\u201d He looked over his shoulder and shouted for James, who opened his bedroom door immediately. Carol didn\u2019t doubt for an instant that he\u2019d had his ear pressed to it the entire time they\u2019d been talking.</p><p>With his hands in his jean pockets, James strolled casually into the room. \u201cYes, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d James wore a look of complete innocence.</p><p>\u201cApparently you said something to Peter about the relationship between Mrs. Sommars and me. I want to know what it was and where you found out about it.\u201d Alex hadn\u2019t so much as raised his voice, but Carol recognized that he expected the truth and wouldn\u2019t let up until he got it.</p><p>\u201cOh...that,\u201d James muttered. \u201cI sort of overheard you saying something to Uncle Barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Barn?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cA good friend of mine. He\u2019s the one I was telling you about who kept Jim while I was out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me James,\u201d his son reminded him.</p><p>Alex lifted both hands. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d James went on to say, \u201cyou were on the phone last night talking to him about the basketball game tonight, and I heard you say that you\u2019d asked Carol\u2014Mrs. Sommars. I\u2019m not stupid, Dad. I knew you were talking about the two of you getting married, and I thought that Peter and I had a right to know. You should\u2019ve said something to us first, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor starters, this whole marriage business is up in the air\u2014when and if anything\u2019s decided, you two boys will be the first to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, the wedding\u2019s up in the air?\u201d This piece of information obviously took James by surprise. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s the holdup? Peter and I think it\u2019s a great idea. We\u2019d like it if you two got married. It\u2019d be nice to have a woman around the house. For one thing, your cooking could use some help. But if you married Mrs. Sommars\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJames,\u201d Alex broke in, \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to go back to your room before Carol decides she wants nothing more to do with the likes of us.\u201d</p><p>James looked affronted, but without further questions, he pivoted and marched back into his bedroom.</p><p>Alex waited until his son was out of sight. He sighed loudly and rammed his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carol. I had no idea James overheard my conversation with Barney. I thought he was asleep, but I should\u2019ve been more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...understand,\u201d Carol whispered, mollified.</p> <p>\u201cContrary to what James just said,\u201d Alex continued, the line of his mouth tight and unyielding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry you for your cooking skills. I couldn\u2019t care less if you never cooked again. I love you, and I\u2019m hoping we can make a good life together.\u201d</p><p>James tossed open his bedroom door and stuck out his head. \u201cPeter says she\u2019s as good a cook as his grandmother. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alex sent his son a look hot enough to melt tar.</p><p>James quickly withdrew his head and just as quickly closed his door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Peter and explain the mix-up, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Alex offered.</p> <p>\u201cNo...I\u2019ll say something to him.\u201d Suddenly self-conscious, Carol swung her arms at her sides and retreated a couple of steps. \u201cI suppose I should get home....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sick last night?\u201d Alex asked, his expression concerned. \u201cJames told me when I picked him up after school. I would gladly have given Peter a ride, but he\u2019d apparently found another way because he was gone before James could find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter decided to run home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you had been ill?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI...must\u2019ve caught a twenty-four-hour bug.\u201d Her eyes darted around the room. She felt so foolish, standing there with her hair a tangled mess, wearing the oldest clothes she owned, not to mention mismatched shoes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling better today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot better. Thank you.\u201d She was slowly but surely edging toward the front door. The sooner she escaped, the better it would be for everyone involved. If Alex was merciful, he\u2019d never mention this visit again.</p><p>She was all the way across the living room and had just reached the front door, when Alex appeared behind her. As she whirled around, he flattened his hands on either side of her head.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to a decision?\u201d he asked softly. His gaze dropped to her mouth. \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve managed to come up with is the flu,\u201d she murmured in a feeble attempt at humor. Alex wasn\u2019t amused, however, and she rushed to add, \u201cObviously you want to know which way I\u2019m leaning, but I haven\u2019t had time to give your proposal much thought. I will, I promise I will...soon.\u201d She realized she was chattering, but couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cWe\u2019re still on for Friday night, aren\u2019t we? We can discuss it then and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed, frightening Carol out of her wits. She gasped and automatically catapulted herself into Alex\u2019s arms. He apparently didn\u2019t need an excuse to hold her close. When he released her several awkward seconds later, he smiled at her, then kissed the tip of her upturned nose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Barney now. It\u2019s time the two of you met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Carol Sommars?\u201d Barney asked for the third time. He scratched his jaw and continued to frown. \u201cNo wonder Bambi mistook her for a bag lady. I\u2019m sorry, man, you\u2019re my best friend and we\u2019ve been buddies for a lot of years, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, you can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Alex dismissed his friend\u2019s statement and walked into the family room. If he lived to be a hundred, he\u2019d never forget Carol\u2019s mortified look as she bolted from the house.</p> <p>Barney certainly hadn\u2019t helped the situation any. Doing his best to keep a straight face, Alex had introduced the two. Barney\u2019s eyes had widened and his mouth had slowly dropped open in disbelief. It took a moment before he had the presence of mind to step forward and accept Carol\u2019s outstretched hand. Barney had mumbled that it was a pleasure to finally meet her, but his eyes had said something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Alex felt obliged to explain, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t always look like that.\u201d</p><p>Barney stalked over to the refrigerator and opened it. He stared inside for a long time before he reached for a cold beer. \u201cWhat time do the Trail Blazers play?\u201d</p><p>Alex checked his watch. Both he and Barney were keen fans of Portland\u2019s professional basketball team. The team had been doing well this year and were in the first round of the play-offs. \u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Barney said, making himself comfortable in the overstuffed chair. He crossed his legs and took a long swig of beer. \u201cWhat happened to her foot?\u201d he asked casually. \u201cDid she sprain it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s,\u201d Barney said, casting Alex a questioning glance. \u201cShe was wearing a slipper\u2014you mean you didn\u2019t notice? Did she twist her ankle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d James answered for Alex, wandering into the family room holding a bag of pretzels. He plopped himself down on the sofa, resting his legs on the coffee table. \u201cPeter says she does weird stuff like that all the time. Once she wore his swimming goggles in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Barney raised his eyebrows. \u201cShould I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made sense\u2014sort of\u2014when Peter explained it. His mother had gone to one of those cosmetics stores and they put some fancy makeup on her eyes, and she didn\u2019t want to ruin it when she took a shower, so she wore Peter\u2019s rubber goggles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she just take a bath?\u201d Barney asked. He threw Alex a look that suggested his friend have his head examined.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t take a bath because the faucet was broken,\u201d James said, \u201cand her brother hadn\u2019t gotten around to fixing it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Alex said in Carol\u2019s defense.</p><p>Barney rolled his eyes and tipped the beer bottle to his lips.</p><p>To his credit, Barney didn\u2019t say anything else about Carol until James was out of the room. \u201cYou\u2019re really serious about this woman?\u201d His question implied that Alex had introduced Barney to the wrong one, and that the whole meeting was a setup to some kind of joke that was to follow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally serious. I told you I asked her to marry me\u2014I can\u2019t get any more serious than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s thinking about it?\u201d Barney asked mockingly. Being the true friend he was, Barn clearly couldn\u2019t understand why Carol hadn\u2019t instantly leaped at Alex\u2019s offer.</p><p>To be honest, Alex wondered the same thing himself. True, he\u2019d blurted out his proposal in a parking lot. He still had trouble believing he\u2019d done anything so crazy. As a contractor, he\u2019d sold himself and his company hundreds of times. He\u2019d prepared bids and presented them with polish and professionalism. He always had solid arguments that made his proposals sound attractive and intelligent. Carol deserved nothing less.</p><p>But something had happened to him when he\u2019d visited her birthing class. Something enigmatic and profound. Even now he had to struggle not to get choked up when he thought about it.</p><p>After nearly two weeks in Texas, Alex had been starved for the sight of her, and he\u2019d barely noticed the others in the class. In retrospect, he was sure his reaction could be attributed to seeing all those soon-to-be mothers.</p><p>In fifteen years Alex hadn\u2019t given babies more than a passing thought. He had a son and was grateful for that. He might have suffered a twinge of regret when he learned there\u2019d be no more children, but he\u2019d been more concerned about his wife\u2019s well-being than the fact that they wouldn\u2019t be adding to their family.</p><p>Then he\u2019d watched Carol with those pregnant couples, and the desire for another child, a daughter, had suddenly overwhelmed him. He\u2019d decided while he was in Texas that he loved Carol and wanted to marry her, but the idea of starting a family of their own hadn\u2019t so much as crossed his mind. But why not? They were both young enough and healthy enough to raise a houseful of children.</p><p>He\u2019d been standing at the back of her class, waiting for her, when it happened. Out of nowhere, yet as clear as anything he\u2019d ever seen or felt, Alex saw Carol pregnant with a child. His child. He\u2019d realized at the time that this\u2014he used the word vision for lack of a better one\u2014was probably due to physical and emotional exhaustion. Wanting to hold on to the image as long as he could, he\u2019d closed his eyes. He\u2019d pictured her.... Her breasts were full, and when she smiled at him, her eyes had a radiance that couldn\u2019t be described. She\u2019d taken his hand and settled it on her protruding stomach. In his fantasy he\u2019d felt their child move.</p><p>This fantasy was what had prompted the abrupt marriage proposal. He wanted to kick himself now. If he\u2019d taken her in his arms, kissed her and said all the things she deserved to hear, things might have gone differently. He hadn\u2019t meant to rush her, hadn\u2019t meant to be so pushy, but once he\u2019d realized how resistant she was to the idea, he\u2019d panicked. The two-week ultimatum was unfair. He\u2019d tell her that on Friday night when they went out for dinner.</p><p>Then again, maybe he wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019d wait to hear what she was thinking, which way she was leaning, before he put his foot any farther down his throat.</p><p>Then he began to smile. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t too late for a proper proposal, after all.</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d</p><p>His name seemed to be coming from some distance away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, pulling himself out of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThe game\u2019s started,\u201d Barney said. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see it?\u201d He peered closely at Alex. \u201cIs something wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Yes, something was wrong, and there was only one cure. Carol Sommars.</p><p>Carol dressed carefully for her dinner date with Alex Friday evening. After going through her closet and laying half of everything she owned across the bed, she chose a demure, high-necked dress of soft pink that buttoned down the front. That seemed safe enough, especially with a shawl.</p><p>She\u2019d hardly ever felt this awkward. Trying to make her decision, she\u2019d swayed back and forth all week. One day she\u2019d decide she would be a fool not to marry him, and the next, she\u2019d been equally convinced she\u2019d be crazy to trust a man a second time.</p><p>Marrying Alex meant relinquishing her independence. It meant placing herself and her son at the mercy of another human being. Memories of her marriage to Bruce swiped at her viciously, and whenever she contemplated sharing her well-ordered life with another man, she broke into a cold sweat.</p><p>Years ago, someone had told her it took a hell of a man to replace no man. It wasn\u2019t until Carol graduated from college with her nursing degree and was completely on her own that she fully understood that statement. Her life was good, too good to tamper with, and yet...</p><p>Her thoughts were more confused than ever when the doorbell chimed. She paused, took a calming breath and headed across the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Alex,\u201d she said, smiling stiffly.</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p>He looked gorgeous in a three-piece suit. Her eyes took him in, and she felt some of the tension leave her muscles. It was when she met his eyes that she realized he was chuckling.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to dinner,\u201d he said, nodding at her dress, \u201cnot a baptism.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked, not sure she understood.</p><p>\u201cIf that collar went any higher up your neck, it\u2019d reach your nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I was removing temptation,\u201d she said, embarrassed by the blush that heated her face.</p><p>\u201cHoney, at this rate, the only thing we\u2019ll be removing is that dress.\u201d</p><p>Carol decided the best thing to do was ignore his remark. \u201cDid you say where we\u2019re going for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered cryptically, and his warm eyes caressed her with maddening purposefulness. \u201cI didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d After all the time they\u2019d been together, after all the moments she\u2019d spent in his arms, after all the dreams she\u2019d had about Alex, she shouldn\u2019t feel this uncomfortable. But her heart was galloping, her hands felt damp, her breath was coming in soft gasps\u2014and they hadn\u2019t even left her house yet.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>It was a question he shouldn\u2019t have asked. No, her mind screamed. Yes, her heart insisted. \u201cI guess so,\u201d her lips answered.</p><p>Alex led her outside and held open his car door.</p><p>\u201cIt was thoughtful of you to drop the boys at the theater. Personally I don\u2019t think they were that keen on seeing a Disney movie,\u201d she said, slipping inside his car.</p> <p>\u201cToo bad. I gave them a choice of things to do this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttending a kids\u2019 movie on the other side of town or being set adrift in the Columbia River without paddles probably isn\u2019t their idea of a choice.\u201d</p><p>Alex chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone disturbing us tonight.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Alex\u2019s were hot and hazy and so suggestive, Carol\u2019s heart skipped a beat. For sanity\u2019s sake, she looked away.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe champagne\u2019s cooling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve ordered in advance,\u201d she murmured, having difficulty finding something to do with her hands. Her fingers itched to touch him...needed to touch him. A need that only confused her more.</p> <p>\u201cI...hope you explained to Barney\u2014your friend\u2014that I...that I don\u2019t normally look the way I did the evening we met. When I got home and saw myself in the mirror...well, I could just imagine what he must\u2019ve thought.\u201d Carol cursed the madness that had sent her rushing out of her house that evening to confront Alex.</p><p>\u201cBarney understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Alex turned into his own driveway. Carol looked at him, somewhat surprised. \u201cDid you forget something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>A moment later, he let her into the house. She paused in the doorway, and her heart gave a sudden, sharp lurch. They weren\u2019t going to any restaurant. Alex had always planned to bring her back to his house.</p><p>The drapes were drawn, and the lights had been lowered. Carol saw that the dining room table was set with crystal and china. Two tapered candles stood in the middle of the table, waiting to be lit.</p><p>Alex went over to the stereo and pushed a single button. Immediately the room was drenched with the plaintive sound of violins.</p><p>Carol was still trying to assimilate what was happening when he walked over to the table and lit the candles. Tiny flames sent a golden glow shimmering across the pristine white cloth.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Alex said, holding out his hands.</p><p>Carol was too numb to reply. He took the lacy shawl from her shoulders and draped it over the back of the sofa. Then he pulled her purse from her unresisting fingers and set it next to the shawl. When he\u2019d finished, he turned and eased her into his arms.</p><p>Their bodies came gently together, and a shudder went through her. She wasn\u2019t a complete fool\u2014she knew what Alex was planning. She lowered her eyelids. Despite her doubts and fears, she wanted this, too.</p><p>For a moment, she battled the feeling, then with a deep sigh, she surrendered.</p><p>Alex wrapped his arms around her. \u201cOh, baby,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>She emptied her lungs of air as his hands slid down her back, to her waist.</p><p>There was music, such beautiful music, and then Carol realized they were supposed to be dancing. She rested her fingertips on his shoulders as his mouth moved toward hers. Carol sighed. Alex\u2019s breath was moist and warm, his hands gentle as they pressed her closer and closer.</p><p>When he kissed her, the moment of anticipation ended, and Carol felt a tremendous surge of relief. He groaned. She groaned. He leaned back and began to unfasten the buttons at her throat.</p><p>That all too brief pause helped Carol collect her scattered senses. \u201cAlex,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndressing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked breathlessly, knowing what a stupid question it was.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated with amusement. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to make love.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse went wild.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou love me. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her again, so passionately she could hardly resist\u2014and yet she had to. She broke away from him with what little strength she still possessed.</p><p>\u201cAlex...please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s a new beginning for us. I\u2019m crazy in love with you. I need you so much I can\u2019t think straight anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me here to make love to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it wasn\u2019t obvious?\u201d he asked as he nibbled kisses along the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy now? Why not that night on the Washington coast...? Why tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, do we need to go through this evaluation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know,\u201d she cried, pushing herself away from him. Her hands trembled, and it was with some difficulty that she rebuttoned her dress. \u201cThe truth, Alex. I want the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI thought...I believed that if we made love, it would help you decide you wanted to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt as though he\u2019d tossed a bucket of ice water in her face. She raised her hand to her pounding heart. \u201cOh, no...\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce did this to me, too...pressured me into giving in to him...then he hated me...punished me....\u201d Blindly she reached for her purse and shawl, then headed for the front door.</p><p>Alex caught up with her before she made it outside. His hand clasped her shoulder as he turned her to face him. By then she was sobbing, her whole body trembling with terror. Stark terror\u2014stark memories.</p><p>Alex took one look at her and hauled her into his arms. \u201cCarol.\u201d He threaded his fingers through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right. I would never have forced you.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>All Carol could do was cry, and the pile of used tissues was mounting. Alex tried to comfort her, to help her, but everything he did seemed to make matters worse. One thing he\u2019d immediately recognized\u2014she didn\u2019t want him to touch her.</p><p>She\u2019d curled herself up on his sofa and covered her face as she wept. She wouldn\u2019t talk to him. She wouldn\u2019t look at him. The only comprehensible statement she\u2019d made in the last fifteen minutes had been a demand that he take her home.</p><p>Fear knotted his stomach. He had the inexplicable feeling that if he did as she asked, he\u2019d never see her again. He had tonight and only tonight to repair the trust he\u2019d unwittingly destroyed.</p><p>\u201cCarol, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He must have told her that twenty times. It was true enough. Everything he tried to do with this woman was wrong. Tonight was the perfect example. For days he\u2019d been searching for a way to prove to Carol how much he loved her and how right they were for each other.</p><p>This evening had seemed the perfect place and time. He\u2019d planned it all\u2014the music, champagne, the carefully worded proposal, the diamond ring.</p><p>He\u2019d thought that if everything went well, they\u2019d make love, and afterward, they could discuss the details of their wedding and their lives. He wanted her in his bed, and although it was more than a little arrogant of him, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have any problem getting her there.</p><p>He\u2019d also come to the conclusion that once they made love, she\u2019d be convinced that they belonged together, and their marriage would naturally follow.</p><p>At first, his plan had worked flawlessly. Carol had walked into the house, seen that the table was set and the candles ready to light. She\u2019d looked at him with those huge eyes of hers and given him a seductive smile. Then, with barely a pause, she\u2019d waltzed into his arms.</p><p>From there everything had gone downhill.</p><p>One minute he was kissing her, marveling at the power she had over his body, and the next, she was cold and trembling, demanding answers that should\u2019ve been obvious.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d he asked her gently for the second\u2014or was it the third?\u2014time. Although his arms ached with the need to hold her, he resisted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. I need to go home.\u201d She rubbed her face and plucked a clean tissue from the nearby box. Apparently she\u2019d regained her resolve because she stood, wrapped her shawl around her, and stumbled to the door. \u201cIf you won\u2019t drive me, then I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>Alex heard the desperation in her voice and was helpless to do anything other than what she asked. As he stood, the regret swept through him. If there was anything he could do to ease her pain, he would\u2019ve done it. If there were any words he could have uttered to comfort her, he would\u2019ve said them gladly. But all she wanted him to do was take her back to her own home. Back to her own bed. Her own life.</p><p>Who did he think he was? Some Don Juan who could sweep this beautiful, sensitive woman into his bed and make love to her? He felt sick to his stomach at the way he\u2019d plotted, the way he\u2019d planned to use her body against her, to exploit the attraction between them to serve his own ends.</p><p>Now he was losing her, and there wasn\u2019t anyone he could blame but himself. He\u2019d known his chances weren\u2019t good the night he\u2019d asked her to marry him. He\u2019d hoped to see joy in her eyes when he suggested it. He\u2019d longed to see happiness on her face. He\u2019d wanted Carol to hurl herself into his arms, excited and overcome with emotion.</p><p>He should\u2019ve known he\u2019d been watching too many old movies.</p><p>He\u2019d asked Carol to marry him, and none of the things he\u2019d hoped for had happened. Instead, her eyes had reflected fear. And tonight...tonight he\u2019d witnessed stark terror.</p><p>Alex was astute enough to realize the problem lay in Carol\u2019s brief marriage. Whatever had gone on had left deep emotional scars. Even when he\u2019d felt the closest to her, Alex had learned very little about her relationship with her late husband. She\u2019d let tidbits of information drop now and then, but every time she did, Alex had the feeling she\u2019d regretted it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On her way out the door, Carol grabbed a handful of fresh tissues, and with nothing more to say, Alex led the way to his car.</p><p>He opened the passenger door, noticing how she avoided any possibility of their accidentally touching as she climbed inside.</p><p>The tension inside the car made the air almost too thick to breathe. He could hardly stand it and he wondered how she could.</p><p>When he braked at a stop sign, he decided to make one last effort.</p> <p>\u201cCarol, please, how many times do I have to tell you how sorry I am? I made a mistake. I behaved like a jerk. Tell me what you want me to do, because I\u2019ll do it. Anything you say. I love you! You\u2019ve got to believe I\u2019d never intentionally do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His pleas were met with more of the same strained, intolerable silence.</p><p>In frustration he pressed his foot to the gas, and they shot ahead. The seat belts were all that kept them from slamming forward with the car.</p><p>The fiercest argument of their courtship now ensued, and the crazy part was, neither of them uttered a word. Every once in a while, Alex could hear Carol drag a breath through her lungs, and he knew she was doing everything in her power not to cry. Each tear she shed, each sob she inhaled, felt like a knife wound.</p><p>He was losing her, and there wasn\u2019t a thing he could do about it. It wouldn\u2019t be so tragic if he didn\u2019t care for her so much. After Gloria\u2019s death, Alex had never truly believed he\u2019d fall in love again. Even when he\u2019d made the decision to remarry, he hadn\u2019t expected to find the depth of emotion he\u2019d experienced with Carol.</p> <p>And now it might be too late.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, did you and Mr. Preston have a fight or something?\u201d Peter asked the following morning.</p><p>\u201cW-why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Peter popped two frozen waffles in the toaster, then stood guard over them as though he expected Carol to snatch them out of his hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Mr. Preston was acting strange last night when he picked us up from the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSad. Mr. Preston\u2019s usually loads of fun. I like him, I mean, he\u2019s about the neatest adult I know. He doesn\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m a kid, and he likes the same things I like and\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014I just think he\u2019s an all-around great guy. Fact is, Mom, men don\u2019t come much better than James\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is...nice, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she agreed. She tightened her fingers around the handle of her coffee mug and looked anywhere but at her son.</p><p>Peter leaned toward her and squinted. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she said lightly, trying to make a joke out of it.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are all puffy and red like you have an allergy or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPollen sometimes affects me that way.\u201d Which was the truth. It just didn\u2019t happen to be affecting her eyes at that particular moment.</p><p>The waffles popped up, and Peter grabbed them, muttering under his breath when he burned his fingers. He spread a thin layer of butter on them and followed that with a puddle of syrup. Once that task was complete, he added two more waffles to the toaster, then sat across the table from Carol.</p><p>\u201cI kind of thought you and Mr. Preston might\u2019ve had a fight,\u201d Peter said, obviously feeling it was safe to probe some more. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been too bad because on the way to the movie he was telling us that he wanted to make this dinner the most romantic night of your life. Was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe...tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the Baked Alaska taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Baked Alaska?\u201d Carol made a nondescript gesture. \u201cOh...it was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Preston made everything himself. Right down to the salad dressing. James told me he\u2019d been shopping for days. It would\u2019ve been terrible if you\u2019d had a fight and ruined it.... You love Mr. Preston, don\u2019t you?\u201d Peter asked earnestly.</p><p>Carol closed her eyes to the emotion assaulting her from all sides. She would be lying if she didn\u2019t admit it. And her heart refused to let her lie. But no one seemed to understand that love wasn\u2019t a cure-all. She\u2019d loved Bruce, too\u2014or thought she did\u2014and look where that had gotten her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d averted her gaze, but she could hear Peter\u2019s sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI knew you did,\u201d he said cheerfully, slicing into his waffle. \u201cI told James you were wild about his dad and that whatever happened at dinner would be okay in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d Carol murmured.</p><p>An hour later, Carol was working in the garden space Alex had tilled for her several weeks earlier. She was cultivating the soil, preparing it to plant several different herbs that afternoon. She\u2019d done her homework and discovered a wide variety that grew well in the moist climate of the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Her back was to the kitchen, and she hadn\u2019t heard the doorbell. Nor was there the usual commotion that occurred whenever Peter let someone in.</p><p>Yet without a doubt, she knew Alex was standing in the doorway watching her. She felt his presence in the same way she experienced his absence.</p><p>Running her forearm across her damp brow, she leaned back and removed her gloves. \u201cI know what you want to say,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think it would be best if we just dropped the whole issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s a luxury neither of us can afford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were going to say that,\u201d she sighed, awkwardly struggling to an upright position. The knees of her jeans were caked with mud and the sweat was pouring down her flushed face.</p><p>There\u2019d probably been only two other times in her life when she\u2019d looked worse, and Alex had seen her on both occasions.</p><p>With the cultivator gripped tightly in her fist, she walked over to the patio and sank down on a deck chair. \u201cAll right, say what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Alex grinned. \u201cSuch resignation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be working in my garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He flexed his hands a couple of times. \u201cI suppose I should start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alex, this isn\u2019t necessary, it really isn\u2019t. I overreacted last night. So, you made a mistake\u2014you\u2019re only human and I forgive you. Your intentions weren\u2019t exactly honorable, but given the circumstances they were understandable. You wanted to take me into your bed and afterward make an honest woman of me.\u201d She made quotation marks with her fingers around the words honest woman. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he mumbled. Although of course the issue was much more complicated than that....</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ve been made an honest woman once and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I\u2019m not planning to repeat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your husband\u2019s name?\u201d Alex asked without preamble.</p><p>\u201cBruce...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize you\u2019ve never told me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged; she never talked about Bruce if possible.</p><p>\u201cTell me about him, Carol,\u201d Alex pleaded, \u201ctell me everything. Start with the minute you noticed each other and then lead me through your relationship to the day you buried him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see how that would solve anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She jumped to her feet, her heart in a panic. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you close up tight anytime someone mentions him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d She paced the patio. Stopping abruptly, she whirled around and glared at him, angry all over again. \u201cAll right, you want to know? I\u2019ll tell you. We were teenagers\u2014young, stupid, naive. We made out in the back seat of a car...and when I got pregnant with Peter we got married. Bruce died three years later in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>An eternity passed before Alex spoke again. \u201cThat\u2019s just a summary. Tell me what really happened in those three years you were married.\u201d His voice was soft and insistent.</p><p>Her chest constricted painfully. Would nothing satisfy him short of blood? How could she ever hope to describe three years of living in hell? She couldn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t even want to try.</p><p>Alex wouldn\u2019t understand, and nothing she could ever say would help him. What purpose would it serve to dredge up all that misery? None that she could see.</p><p>Slowly she lowered herself onto the deck chair again, trying to still her churning thoughts, to nullify the agonizing memories. The pain was so distinct, so acute, that she opted for the only sane solution. She backed away.</p><p>Alex reached for her hand, holding it loosely. \u201cI know this is difficult.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how difficult.</p><p>\u201cBruce and I were married a long time ago. Suffice it to say that the marriage wasn\u2019t a good one. We were much too young...and Bruce had...problems.\u201d She bit her lip, not willing to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drag up the past. I don\u2019t see how it would do any good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cI\u2019m not about to dissect a marriage that ended thirteen years ago simply because you\u2019re curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about it,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I get a little panicky when you start pressuring me into bed? Trust me, any woman who\u2019s gone through what I did would react the same way. You know the old saying\u2014once burned, twice shy.\u201d She tried to make light of it and failed. Miserably.</p><p>For the longest time Alex said nothing. He did nothing. He stared into the distance, and Carol couldn\u2019t tell where his thoughts were taking him.</p><p>\u201cI never expected to fall in love again,\u201d he said.</p><p>Carol frowned at the self-derision in his words.</p><p>\u201cGloria knew I would, but then she always did know me better than I knew myself.\u201d He paused for a moment, and he gave a sad, bitter smile. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the last time we were able to talk. The next day she slipped into a coma, and soon afterward, she died. She knew she was dying and had accepted it. The hospital staff knew it was only a matter of time. But I couldn\u2019t let go of her. I had such faith that God would save her from this illness. Such unquestionable trust. He did, of course, but not the way I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex...\u201d Tears were beginning to blur her vision. She didn\u2019t want to hear about Gloria and the wonderful marriage he\u2019d had with her. The contrast was too painful. Too bleak.</p><p>\u201cGloria took my hand and raised her eyes to mine and thanked me for staying at her side to the very end. She apologized because she\u2019d been ill. Can you imagine anyone doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carol\u2019s voice was the faintest of whispers.</p><p>\u201cThen she told me God would send another woman into my life, someone healthy and whole who\u2019d love me the way I deserved to be loved. Someone who\u2019d share my success and who\u2019d love our son as much as she did.\u201d He paused and smiled again, but it was the same sad smile. \u201cTrust me, this was the last thing I wanted to hear from my wife. First of all, I was in denial, and I refused to believe she was dying, and second, nothing could have convinced me I\u2019d ever love another woman as much as I loved Gloria.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol shut her eyes tightly and took deep breaths to keep from weeping openly.</p><p>\u201cShe told me that when I met this other woman and decided to marry her, I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for having fallen in love again. She must\u2019ve known that would be something powerful I\u2019d be dealing with later. She squeezed my fingers\u2014she was so weak, and yet, so strong. And wise, so very wise. Within a few hours she was gone from me forever.\u201d He rubbed his eyes and hesitated before continuing. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe her. I didn\u2019t think it would be possible to love anyone as much as I loved her.</p><p>\u201cThen I met you, and before I knew it, I was falling in love all over again.\u201d Once more he brought a weary hand to his face. His expression was blank, his eyes unrevealing. \u201cAnd again I\u2019m relinquishing the woman I love.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the two weeks to make your decision, Carol. In fact, I\u2019ll make it easy for you. I won\u2019t call or contact you until the seventh\u2014that\u2019s exactly two weeks from the day we talked about it. You can tell me your decision then. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed, feeling numb.</p> <p>Slowly he nodded, then stood and walked out of her house.</p><p>\u201cThe way I see it,\u201d Peter said, holding a red Delicious apple in one hand and staring at his mother, \u201cJames\u2019s dad can adopt me.\u201d</p><p>Carol felt the fleeting pain that tore through her every time Peter not-so-casually mentioned Alex\u2019s name. He seemed to plan these times with precision. Just when she least expected it. Just when she was sure she knew her own mind. Just when she was feeling overly confident. Then pow, right between the eyes, Peter would toss some remark carefully chosen for its effect. It was generally preceded by some bit of information about Alex or a comment about how wonderful life would be when they were one big, happy family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to marry Alex first, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said reproachfully. One challenging look defied him to contradict her.</p><p>\u201cWell, it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? If you marry him, naturally.\u201d Peter took a huge bite of the apple. Juice dribbled down his chin, and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Dad\u2019s family in years, and they wouldn\u2019t even care if someone adopted me. That way we could all have the same last name. Peter Preston has a cool sound to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she groaned, frustrated and angered by the way he turned a deaf ear to everything she said. \u201cIf this is another tactic to manipulate me into marrying Alex so you can go fishing, then I want you to know right now that I don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>She was under enough pressure\u2014mainly from herself\u2014and she didn\u2019t need her son applying any more.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom, think about how good our lives would be if you married Mr. Preston. He\u2019s rich\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all of this conversation that I want to. Now sit down and eat your dinner.\u201d She dished up the crispy fried pork chop and a serving of rice and broccoli, and set the plate on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating?\u201d Peter asked, looking mildly disappointed. \u201cThis is the third night you\u2019ve skipped dinner this week.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s appetite had been nil for the entire two weeks. \u201cNo time. I\u2019ve got to get ready for class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen will these sessions be over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo more weeks,\u201d she said, walking into her bedroom. Two weeks seemed to be the magical time period of late. Alex had given her two weeks to decide if she\u2019d accept his proposal. Two weeks that were up today. He\u2019d granted her the breathing space she needed to come to a sensible decision. Only \u201csensible\u201d was the last thing Carol felt. It shouldn\u2019t be this difficult. She wondered why she had so many doubts if she loved Alex\u2014which she did. But Carol knew the answer to that.</p><p>Alex\u2019s marriage had been wonderful.</p><p>Hers had been a disaster.</p><p>He was hoping to repeat what he\u2019d shared with Gloria.</p><p>She wanted to avoid the pain Bruce had brought into her life.</p><p>\u201cMom...phone.\u201d</p><p>Carol froze. She\u2019d been on tenterhooks waiting for Alex to contact her. All day she\u2019d felt a growing sense of dread. She\u2019d expected Alex to come strolling out from behind every closed door, to suddenly appear when she least expected him.</p> <p>The last thing she\u2019d figured he\u2019d do was phone.</p><p>With one shoe on, she hobbled over to her nightstand and picked up the phone, wondering what she was going to say.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, it\u2019s your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Ma, what can I do for you?\u201d Relief must have been evident in her voice.</p><p>Angelina Pasquale said, \u201cI was in church this morning, lighting a candle to St. Rita, when something happened to my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see your doctor?\u201d Carol\u2019s own heart abruptly switched gears. Her greatest fear was losing her mother to heart disease the way she\u2019d lost her father.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I see a doctor?\u201d her mother protested. \u201cI was talking to God\u2014in my heart\u2014and God was telling me I should have a talk with my daughter Carol, who\u2019s deciding if she\u2019s going to marry this rich non-Italian or walk away from the best thing since the invention of padded insoles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019ve got a class\u2014I don\u2019t have time to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to tell him?\u201d</p><p>Her mother was being as difficult as Peter. Everyone wanted to make up her mind for her. Everyone knew what she should do. Everyone except Carol.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s not Catholic, don\u2019t you?\u201d she told her mother, who had once considered that an all-important factor in choosing a husband. Religion and an equally vital question\u2014whether her potential husband was allergic to tomatoes.</p><p>Her mother snickered. \u201cI know he\u2019s not Catholic! But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got that all worked out with God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m sorry, but I have to leave now or I\u2019ll be late for my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be late for once in your life. Who\u2019s it gonna hurt? All day I waited, all day I said to myself, my bambina\u2019s going to call and tell me she\u2019s going to marry again. I want to do the cooking myself, you tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the wedding. No caterers, understand? I got the menu all planned. We\u2019ll serve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, please.\u201d</p><p>It took Carol another five minutes to extricate herself from the conversation. Glancing at her watch, she groaned. Rushing from room to room, she grabbed her purse, her other shoe and her briefcase. She paused on her way out the door to kiss Peter on the cheek and remind him to do his homework. Then she jumped in the car, still wearing only one shoe.</p><p>Her breathing was labored by the time she raced through traffic and pulled into the parking lot at the community center where the birthing classes were held.</p><p>She\u2019d piled everything she needed in her arms, including her umbrella, when she realized she\u2019d left her lecture notes at the house.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she muttered. She took two steps before she remembered she was carrying her shoe.</p><p>\u201cIt might help if you put that on instead of holding it in your arms.\u201d</p><p>Carol froze. She whirled around, angry and upset, directing all her emotion at Alex. \u201cThis is your fault,\u201d she said, dropping her shoe to the ground and positioning it with her toe until she could slip her foot inside. \u201cFirst, Peter\u2019s on my case, and now my mother\u2019s claiming she received a message directly from God and that He\u2019s worked out a deal with her, since you\u2019re not Catholic, and frankly, Alex\u2014don\u2019t you dare laugh.\u201d She finished with a huge breath. \u201cI swear, if you laugh I wouldn\u2019t marry you if you were the last living male in the state of Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, holding up both hands.</p><p>\u201cI should hope so. You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through this past week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour two weeks are up, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me that. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve decided?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shut, and she nodded slowly. \u201cI have,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cBefore you tell me what you\u2019ve decided,\u201d Alex said, moving toward Carol, his eyes a smoky gray, \u201clet me hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold me?\u201d she echoed meekly. Alex looked one-hundred-percent male, and the lazy smile he wore was potent enough to tear through her defenses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do much more than simply hold you, my love,\u201d he whispered, inching his way toward her.</p><p>\u201cHere? In a parking lot?\u201d</p><p>Alex chuckled and slipped his arms around her waist, tugging her closer. Carol had no resistance left in her. She\u2019d been so lonely, so lost, without him. So confused.</p><p>His mouth brushed hers. Much too briefly. Much too lightly.</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t want him to be gentle. Not when she was this hungry for his touch. Her lips parted in a firm and wanting kiss. Alex sighed his pleasure and she clung to him, needing him.</p><p>When they drew apart, she rested her forehead against his. \u201cOkay,\u201d Alex said, his breath warm and heavy. \u201cTell me. I\u2019m ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alex,\u201d she murmured, and her throat constricted with ready tears. \u201cI can\u2019t decide. I\u2019ve tried and tried and tried, and the only thing I really know is I need more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime,\u201d he repeated. Briefly he closed his eyes. His shoulders sagged with defeat. \u201cYou need more time. How much? A week? A month? Six months? Would a year fit into your schedule?\u201d He broke away from her and rubbed his hand along the back of his neck. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t made up your mind by now, my guess is you never will. I love you, Carol, but you\u2019re driving me insane with this waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see things from my point of view?\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for this time we\u2019ve had, because it\u2019s taught me something I hadn\u2019t been willing to recognize before. I\u2019m lonely. I want someone in my life\u2014someone permanent. I want you as my wife. I need you as my wife. But if you don\u2019t want what I\u2019m offering, then I should cut my losses and look elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>A strangled cry erupted from her lips. He was being so unfair, pressuring her like this. Everything had to be decided in his time frame, without any allowance for doubts or questions. Something broke in Carol. Control. It was all about control. She couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014allow another man to control her the way Bruce had.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right, Alex,\u201d she finally said. \u201cFind yourself someone else.\u201d</p><p>The shock of her words hit him like a blow to the head. He actually flinched, but all the while his piercing eyes continued to hold hers. Carol saw the regret and the pain flash through his burning gaze. Then he buried his hands in his pockets, turned and marched away.</p><p>It was all Carol could do not to run after him, but she knew that if she did she\u2019d be giving up her self-respect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Janice Mandle stuck her head out the door and scanned the parking lot. She looked relieved when she saw Carol, and waved.</p><p>Carol waved back. Although she wanted nothing more than to be alone, she didn\u2019t have any choice but to teach her class.</p><p>Janice called, mentioning the time.</p><p>Still Carol couldn\u2019t seem to tear her gaze from Alex, holding on to him for as long as she could. He made her feel things she\u2019d never known she was capable of experiencing. When he kissed her, she felt hot and quivery, as though she\u2019d just awakened from a long, deep sleep. Spending time with him was fun and exciting. There\u2019d been adventures waiting to happen with this man. Whole new worlds in the making. Yet something was holding her back. Something powerful. She wanted everything Alex was offering, and at the same time her freedom was too precious, too important.</p> <p>Carol didn\u2019t see Alex again until the end of the week, when the boys were participating in the district track meet. James was running in the four-hundred-and eight-hundred-meter races, and Peter was scheduled for the 1500-meter. On their own, the two friends had decided to choose events in which they weren\u2019t competing together. Carol had been impressed with their insight into each other\u2019s competitive personalities.</p><p>Carol\u2019s mother had decided to attend the meet with her. Angelina was as excited as a kid at the circus. They\u2019d just settled themselves in the bleachers when out of the corner of her eye, Carol saw Alex. Since they both had sons involved in track, she knew avoiding him would be nearly impossible, but she hadn\u2019t expected to see him quite so soon. Although, in retrospect, she should\u2019ve realized he\u2019d be attending this important meet.</p><p>Preparing herself, she sat stiffly on the bleachers as Alex strolled past. Instantly her heart started to thunder. His friend was with him, the one she\u2019d met briefly\u2014Barney or Bernie...Barney, she decided. Her hands were tightly clenched in her lap, and she was prepared to exchange polite greetings.</p><p>To her consternation, Alex didn\u2019t so much as look in her direction. Carol knew it would\u2019ve been nearly impossible for him to have missed seeing her. If he\u2019d wanted to hurt her, he\u2019d done so\u2014easily.</p><p>\u201cSo when does the man running with the torch come out?\u201d Angelina asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s in the Olympics, Mama,\u201d Carol answered, her voice weak.</p><p>Her mother turned to look in Carol\u2019s direction, and her frown deepened. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou look as white as bleached flour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Angelina asked stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cAlex...just walked past us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the Alex?\u201d</p> <p>Carol nodded. Before she could stop her mother, Angelina rose to her feet and reached for Carol\u2019s binoculars. \u201cWhere is he? I want to get a good look at this man who broke my daughter\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, please, let\u2019s not get into that again.\u201d The way her mother had defended her had touched Carol\u2019s heart, although Angelina hadn\u2019t wasted any time berating her daughter\u2019s foolishness, either. She\u2019d spent most of Sunday muttering at Carol in Italian. Carol wasn\u2019t fluent enough to understand everything, but she got the gist of it. Angelina thought Carol was a first-class fool to let a man like Alex slip through her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI want one look at this Alex,\u201d Angelina insisted. She raised the binoculars to her face and twisted the dials until she had them focused correctly. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give this man the eye. Now tell me where he\u2019s sitting.\u201d</p><p>Carol knew it would be easier to bend a tire iron than persuade her mother to remove the binoculars and sit down before she made a scene.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on your left, about halfway up the bleachers. He\u2019s wearing a pale blue sweater,\u201d she muttered. If he glanced in her direction, she\u2019d be mortified. Heaven only knew what interpretation he\u2019d put on her mother glaring at him through a set of field glasses, giving him what she so quaintly called \u201cthe eye.\u201d</p><p>Her mother had apparently found him, because she started speaking in Italian. Only this time her comments were perfectly understandable. She was using succulent, suggestive phrases about Alex\u2019s sexual talents and how he\u2019d bring Carol pleasure in bed.</p><p>\u201cMa, please,\u201d Carol wailed. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d</p><p>Angelina sat down and put the glasses on her lap. She began muttering in Italian again, leaning her head close to Carol.</p> <p>\u201cMa!\u201d she cried, distressed by the vivid language her mother was using. \u201cYou should have your mouth washed out with soap.\u201d</p><p>Angelina folded her hands and stared at the sky. \u201cSuch beautiful bambinos you\u2019d have with this man.\u201d</p><p>Carol closed her eyes at the image of more children\u2014hers and Alex\u2019s. Emotion rocked through her.</p><p>Her mother took the opportunity to make a few more succinct remarks, but Carol did her best to ignore them. It seemed as if the track meet wasn\u2019t ever going to begin. Carol was convinced she\u2019d have to spend the afternoon listening to her mother whispering in her ear. Just when she couldn\u2019t endure it any longer, the kids involved in the hurdle events walked over to the starting line. They shook their arms at their sides and did a couple of stretching exercises. Carol was so grateful to have her mother\u2019s attention on the field that it was all she could do not to rush out and kiss the coach.</p><p>The four-hundred-meter race followed several hurdle events. Carol watched James through the binoculars as he approached the starting line. He looked confident and eager. As they were taking their positions, he glanced into the stands and cocked his head just slightly, acknowledging his father\u2019s presence. When his gaze slid to Carol, his eyes sobered before he smiled.</p><p>At the gun, the eight boys leapt forward. Carol immediately vaulted to her feet and began shouting at the top of her lungs.</p><p>James crossed the finish line and placed second. Carol\u2019s heart felt as though it would burst with pride. Without conscious thought her gaze flew to Alex, and she saw that he looked equally pleased by his son\u2019s performance. He must have sensed her watching him because he turned his head slightly and their eyes met. He held on to hers for just a moment, and then with obvious reluctance looked away.</p><p>Carol sagged onto her seat.</p><p>\u201cSo who is this boy you scream for like a son?\u201d her mother demanded.</p><p>\u201cJames Preston\u2014the boy who finished second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that was Alex\u2019s son?\u201d Angelina asked slowly, as she took the binoculars and lifted them to her eyes once more. She was apparently satisfied with what she saw, because she grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine-looking boy, but he\u2019s a little on the thin side. He needs my spaghetti to put some meat on those bones.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t comment. She did love James like a son. That realization forced a lump into her throat. And her heart\u2014her poor, unsuspecting heart\u2014was fluttering hard enough to take flight and leave her body behind.</p><p>Feeling someone\u2019s eyes on her, she glanced over her shoulder. Instantly Alex turned away. Carol\u2019s hands began to tremble, and all he\u2019d done was look in her direction....</p><p>James raced again shortly afterward, placing third in the eight-hundred-meter. For a high school sophomore, he was showing a lot of potential, Carol mused, feeling very proud of him.</p><p>When her own son approached the starting line for his race, Carol felt as nervous as she ever had in her life....</p><p>Since the 1500-meter meant almost four long turns around the track, it didn\u2019t have the immediacy of the previous races. By the time Peter was entering the final lap, Carol and her mother were on their feet, shouting their encouragement. Carol in English. Angelina in Italian. From a distance, Carol heard a loud male voice joining theirs. Alex.</p><p>When Peter crossed the finish line in a solid third position, Carol heaved a sigh of pride and relief. Tears dampened her lashes, and she raised her hands to her mouth. Both the first-and second-place winners were seniors. As a sophomore, Peter had done exceptionally well.</p><p>Again, without any conscious decision on her part, Carol found herself turning to look at Alex. This time he was waiting for her, and they exchanged the faintest of smiles. Sad smiles. Lonely smiles. Proud smiles.</p><p>Carol\u2019s shoulders drooped with defeat. It was as if the worlds of two fools were about to collide.</p><p>He was pushy. She was stubborn.</p><p>He wanted a wife. She wanted time.</p><p>He refused to wait. She refused to give in.</p><p>Still their eyes held, each unwilling to pull away. So many concerns weighed on Carol\u2019s heart. But memories, too\u2014good memories. She remembered how they\u2019d strolled through the lush green foliage of the Washington rain forest. Alex had linked his fingers with hers, and nothing had ever felt more right. That same night they\u2019d sat by the campfire and sung with the boys, and fed each other roasted marshmallows.</p><p>The memories glided straight to Carol\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d</p><p>Dragging her gaze away from Alex, Carol turned to her mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to leave,\u201d Angelina said, glancing into the stands toward Alex and his friend. \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice? The stadium\u2019s almost empty, and weren\u2019t we supposed to meet Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d Carol murmured, \u201cwe were...we are.\u201d</p><p>Peter and James strolled out of the locker room and onto the field together, each carrying a sports bag and a stack of school books. Judging by their damp hair, they\u2019d just gotten out of the shower.</p><p>Carol and her mother were waiting where Peter had suggested. It seemed important to keep them as far away from the school building as possible for fear any of his friends would realize he had a family.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere nearby, and for that Carol was grateful. And even if it made no sense, she was also regretful. She wanted to be as close to him as she could. And yet she\u2019d happily move to the Arctic Circle to escape him. Her thoughts and desires were in direct contrast and growing more muddled every second.</p><p>Peter and James parted company about halfway across the field. Before they went their separate ways, they exchanged a brief nod, apparently having agreed or decided upon something. Whatever it was, Peter didn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>He seemed unusually quiet on the ride home. Carol didn\u2019t question her son until they\u2019d dropped her mother off. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d But he kept his gaze focused straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>His left shoulder rose and fell in an indecisive shrug.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Preston was at the meet today. Did you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Carol hedged. There was no reason to lie. \u201cYeah. He was sitting with his friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Powers and Mr. Preston are good friends. They met in college.\u201d</p><p>Carol wasn\u2019t sure what significance, if any, that bit of information held.</p><p>\u201cAccording to James, Mr. Powers\u2019s been single for the past couple years, and he dates beautiful women all the time. He\u2019s the one who arranged all those hot dates for James\u2019s dad...and he\u2019s doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of our business.\u201d Her heart reacted to that, but what else could she expect? She was in love with the man. However, it wasn\u2019t as if Alex hadn\u2019t warned her; he\u2019d said that if she wasn\u2019t willing to accept what he was offering, it was time to cut his losses and look elsewhere. She just hadn\u2019t expected him to start so soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJames was telling me his dad\u2019s been going out every night this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI think it would be best if we made it a rule not to discuss Alex or his dating practices. You know, and, I hope, have accepted, the fact that the relationship between James\u2019s dad and me is over...by mutual agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom, you really love this guy!\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrows at that.</p> <p>\u201cYou try to fool me, but I can see how miserable you\u2019ve been all week. And Mr. Preston\u2019s been just as unhappy, James says, and we both think he\u2019s going to do something stupid on the rebound, like marry this Babette girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I thought I just said I don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he muttered, crossing his arms and beginning to sulk. Five minutes passed before he sighed heavily. \u201cBabette\u2019s a singer. In a band. She\u2019s not like the run-of-the-mill bimbos Barney usually meets. Mom, you\u2019ve got to do something. Fast. This woman is real competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cAll right. All right.\u201d He raised both hands in surrender. \u201cI won\u2019t say another word.\u201d</p> <p>That proved to be a slight exaggeration. Peter had ways of letting Carol know what was going on between Alex and his newfound friend without ever having to mention either name.</p><p>Saturday, after playing basketball with James in the local park, Peter returned home, hot and sweaty. He walked straight to the refrigerator and took out a cold can of soda, taking the first swallows while standing in front of the open refrigerator.</p><p>Carol had her sewing machine set up on the kitchen table. Pins pressed between her lips, she waved her hand, instructing her son to close the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Peter muttered. He did as she asked, then wiped his face. \u201cEver hear of a thirty-six-year-old man falling head over heels in love with a twenty-three-year-old woman?\u201d Peter asked disdainfully.</p><p>Stepping on a nail couldn\u2019t have been more painful\u2014or more direct\u2014than her son\u2019s question. \u201cNo. Can\u2019t say that I have,\u201d she said, so flustered she sewed a seam that was so crooked she\u2019d have to immediately take it out. With disgust, she tossed the blouse aside, and when her son had left the room, she trembled and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>On Sunday morning, Peter had stayed in church a few extra minutes after Mass, walking up to the altar. When he joined Carol in the vestibule, she placed her hand on his shoulder and studied him carefully. She\u2019d never seen her son quite so serious.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, honey?\u201d</p><p>He gave her another of his one-shoulder rolls. \u201cI thought if Grandma could talk to God, then I\u2019d try it, too. While I was up there, I lit a candle to St. Rita.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>After that, she and her son drove over to her mother\u2019s house. The tears started when she was in the kitchen helping Angelina with dinner. It surprised Carol, because she had nothing to cry about\u2014not really. But that didn\u2019t seem to matter. Soon the tears were flowing from her eyes so hard and fast that they were dripping from her chin and running down her neck.</p><p>Standing at the sink washing vegetables helped hide the fact that she was weeping, but that wouldn\u2019t last long. Soon someone would see she was crying and want to know why. She tried desperately to stop, but to no avail. If anything, her efforts only made her cry more.</p><p>She must\u2019ve made more noise than she realized, because when she turned to reach for a hand towel to wipe her face, she found her mother and her sister-in-law both staring at her.</p><p>Her mother was murmuring something to Paula in Italian, which was interesting since the other woman didn\u2019t understand a word of the language. But Carol understood each and every one. Her mother was telling Paula that Carol looked like a woman who was in danger of losing the man she loved.</p><p>With her arm around Carol\u2019s shoulders, Angelina led her into her bedroom. Whenever Carol was ill as a little girl, her mother had always brought her to her own bed and taken care of her there.</p> <p>Without resistance, Carol let her mother lead her through the house. By now the tears had become soft sobs. Everyone in the living room stopped whatever they were doing and stared at her. Angelina fended off questions and directed Carol to her bed, pulling back the blankets. Sniffling, Carol lay down. The sheets felt cool against her cheeks, and she closed her eyes. Soon she was asleep.</p><p>She woke an hour later and sat bolt upright. Suddenly she knew what she had to do. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she held her hands to her face and breathed in deep, steadying breaths. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>Her family was still busy in the living room. The conversation came to an abrupt halt when Carol moved into the room. She picked up her purse, avoiding their curious eyes. \u201cI...have to go out for a while. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Angelina and Peter walked to the front door with her, both looking anxious.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d her son asked.</p><p>She smiled softly, kissed his cheek and said, \u201cSt. Rita must have heard your prayers.\u201d</p><p>Her mother folded her hands and raised her eyes to heaven, her expression ecstatic. Peter, on the other hand, blinked, his gaze uncertain. Then understanding apparently dawned, and with a shout, he threw his arms around Carol\u2019s neck.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Alex was in the kitchen fixing himself a sandwich when the doorbell chimed. From experience, he knew better than to answer it before James did. Leaning against the counter, Alex waited until his son had vaulted from the family room couch, passed him and raced toward the front door.</p><p>Alex supposed he should show some interest in his unannounced guest, but frankly he didn\u2019t care\u2014unless it was one stubborn Italian woman, and the chances of that were more remote than his likelihood of winning the lottery.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d James yelled. \u201cCome quick!\u201d</p><p>Muttering under his breath, Alex dropped his turkey sandwich on the plate and headed toward the living room. He was halfway through the door when he jerked his head up in surprise. It was Carol. Through a fog of disbelief, he saw her, dressed in a navy skirt and white silk blouse under a rose-colored sweater.</p><p>At least the woman resembled Carol. His eyes must be playing tricks on him, because he was sure this woman standing inside his home was the very one who\u2019d been occupying his thoughts every minute of every hour for days on end.</p><p>\u201cHello, Alex,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>It sounded like her. Or could it be that he needed her so badly that his troubled mind had conjured up her image?</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d James demanded. \u201cThis is Carol, Dad, Carol! Are you just going to stand there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he finally said, having some trouble getting his mouth and tongue to work simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cHello? That\u2019s it? You aren\u2019t saying anything more than that?\u201d James asked, clearly distressed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Carol asked him, and he noticed that her voice was husky and filled with emotion.</p><p>Someday he\u2019d tell her how the best foreman he ever hoped to find had threatened to walk off the job if Alex\u2019s foul mood didn\u2019t improve. Someday he\u2019d let her know he hadn\u2019t eaten a decent meal or slept through an entire night since they\u2019d parted. Someday he\u2019d tell her he would gladly have given a king\u2019s ransom to make her his wife. In time, he would tell her all that, but for now, all he wanted to do was enjoy the luxury of looking at her.</p><p>\u201cCarol just asked you a question. You should answer her,\u201d James pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d He managed to dredge up the polite inquiry.</p><p>\u201cNot so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good?\u201d he echoed.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders, and her eyes held his as she seemed to be preparing herself to speak. \u201cDo you...are you in love with her, because if you are, I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll understand and get out of your life right now, but I have to know that much before I say anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love with her?\u201d Alex felt like an echo. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabette...the singer you\u2019ve been dating.\u201d</p><p>James cleared his throat, and, looking anxious, glanced at his father. \u201cI...you two obviously need time alone. I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, what is Carol talking about?\u201d</p><p>His son wore an injured look, as if to suggest Alex was doing him a terrible injustice by suspecting he had anything to do with Carol\u2019s belief that he was seeing Babette.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d He made his son\u2019s name sound like a threat.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the boy admitted with some reluctance, \u201cMrs. Sommars might\u2019ve gotten the impression that you were dating someone else, from...from something I said to Peter. But I\u2019m sure whatever I said was very nebulous.\u201d When Alex glared at him, James continued. \u201cAll right, all right, Peter and I got to talking things over, and the two of us agreed you guys were wasting a whole lot of time arguing over nothing.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sommars is way, way better than any of the other women you\u2019ve dated. Sometimes she dresses a little funny, but I don\u2019t mind. I know Peter would really like a dad, and he says you\u2019re better than anyone his mom\u2019s ever dated. So when Uncle Barn started pressuring you to date that Babette, we...Peter and I, came up with the idea of...you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Alex said sternly, lacing his words with steel. \u201cExactly what did you say to Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d James was quick to inform him. \u201cPeter did all the talking, and he just casually let it drop that you were dating again and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd had fallen head over heels in love with someone else,\u201d Carol supplied.</p><p>\u201cIn the space of less than a week?\u201d Alex demanded. Did she really think his love was so fickle he could forget her in a few short days? He\u2019d only retreated to fortify himself with ideas before he approached her again.</p><p>\u201cYou said it was time to cut your losses and look elsewhere,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...I thought you must\u2019ve done it, especially when Peter started telling me about you and...the singer. What else was I supposed to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go to my room now,\u201d James inserted smoothly. \u201cYou two go ahead and talk without having to worry about a kid hanging around.\u201d He quickly disappeared, leaving only the two of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with anyone else, Carol,\u201d Alex said, his eyes holding hers. \u201cIf you came because you were afraid I was seeing another woman, then rest assured it isn\u2019t true. I\u2019ll talk to James later and make sure this sort of thing doesn\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t?\u201d he asked, frowning. They stood across the room from each other, neither of them making any effort to bridge the distance. The way Alex felt, they might as well have been standing on opposite ends of a football field...playing for opposing teams. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes drifted shut, and she seemed to be gathering her courage. When she spoke, her voice was low and trembling. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with James...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no right to involve himself in our business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked, Alex. It...worked. When I believed I was losing you, when I thought of you with another woman in your arms, I...I wanted to die. I think maybe I did, just a little, because I realized how much I love you and what a fool I\u2019ve been to think I could go on without you. I needed time, I demanded time, and you wouldn\u2019t give it to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong\u2014I understood that later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she countered, \u201cyou were right. I would never have made up my mind because...because of what happened in my marriage. With Bruce.\u201d</p><p>The whole world seemed to go still as comprehension flooded Alex\u2019s soul. \u201cAre you saying...does this mean you\u2019re willing to marry me?\u201d he asked, barely able to believe what she was saying. Barely able to trust himself to stay where he was a second longer.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t know who moved first, not that it mattered. All that did matter was Carol in his arms, kissing him with a hunger that seemed to consume them both.</p><p>\u201cYes...yes, I\u2019ll marry you,\u201d she cried between kisses. \u201cWhen? Oh, Alex, I\u2019m so anxious to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>Alex stifled the sudden urge to laugh, and the equally powerful urge to weep. He buried his face in the soft curve of her neck and swallowed hard before dragging several deep breaths through his lungs. He slid his hands into her hair as he brought his mouth to hers, exploring her lips in all the ways he\u2019d dreamed of doing for so many sleepless nights.</p> <p>Her purse fell to the floor, and she wound her arms around him, moved against him, whispering over and over how much she loved him.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d he told her as he lifted her from the carpet and carried her across the room. He was so famished for her love that he doubted he\u2019d ever be satisfied.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d never kiss you again,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear the thought of not having you in my life.\u201d</p><p>Alex made his way to the sofa, throwing himself on the cushions, keeping her in his lap. He stroked her hair as he gazed into her beautiful dark eyes. Unable to resist, he kissed her again.</p><p>When they drew apart, Alex rested his forehead against hers and closed his eyes, luxuriating in the warm sensations inside him. He didn\u2019t want to talk, didn\u2019t want to do anything but hold her and love her.</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou asked me about Bruce, and I didn\u2019t tell you. I was wrong to hold back, wrong not to explain before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, my...\u201d</p><p>She gently stroked his face. \u201cFor both our sakes, I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look sure, but she nodded, and when she started speaking, her voice trembled with pain. \u201cI was incredibly young and naive when I met Bruce. He was the most fun-loving, daring boy I\u2019d ever dated. The crazy things he did excited me, but deep in my heart I know I\u2019d never have married him if I hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant with Peter.\u201d</p><p>Alex kissed her brow and continued to stroke her hair.</p><p>\u201cAlthough Bruce seemed willing enough to marry me,\u201d she began, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much pressure my father applied.\u201d Her voice was gaining strength as she spoke. \u201cIt was a bad situation that grew worse after Peter was born. That was when Bruce started drinking heavily and drifted from one job to another. Each month he seemed to be more depressed and more angry. He claimed I\u2019d trapped him and he was going to make sure I paid for what I did.\u201d She closed her eyes and he heard her sigh. \u201cI did pay, and so did Peter. My life became a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Alex had suspected things were bad for her, but he\u2019d no idea how ugly. \u201cDid he beat you, Carol?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained closed, and she nodded. \u201cWhen Bruce drank, the demon inside him would give rise to fits of jealousy, fear, depression and hatred. The more he drank, the more the anger came out in violent episodes. There were times I thought that if I didn\u2019t escape, he\u2019d kill me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your family know? Surely they guessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly ever got to see them. Bruce didn\u2019t approve of me visiting my family. In retrospect, I realize he was afraid of my father. Had Dad or Tony known what was happening, they would\u2019ve taken matters into their own hands. I must have realized it, too, because I never told them, never said a word for fear of involving them. It was more than that.... I was too humiliated. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know about the terrible problems we were having, so I didn\u2019t say anything\u2014not even to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely there was someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce...once Bruce punched me so hard he dislocated my jaw, and I had to see a doctor. She refused to believe all my bruises were due to a fall. She tried to help me, tried to get me to press charges against him, but I didn\u2019t dare. I was terrified of what Bruce would do to Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carol.\u201d The anger Alex was experiencing was so profound that he clenched his fists. The idea of someone beating this warm, vibrant woman filled him with impotent rage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d lost any respect I ever had for Bruce shortly after we were married. Over the next three years I lost respect for myself. What kind of woman allows a man to abuse her mentally and physically, day after day, week after week, year after year? There must\u2019ve been something terribly wrong with me. In ways I can\u2019t even begin to understand, all the hurtful, hateful things Bruce accused me of began to seem valid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carol...\u201d Alex\u2019s chest heaved with the weight of her pain.</p><p>\u201cThen Bruce didn\u2019t come home one night. It wasn\u2019t unusual. I knew he\u2019d come back when he was ready, probably in a foul mood. That was what I\u2019d braced myself for when the police officer came to tell me Bruce had been killed in an accident. I remember I stared up at the man and didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>\u201cI was hanging clothes on the line, and I thanked him for letting me know and returned to the backyard. I didn\u2019t phone anyone, I didn\u2019t even cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, but later when I was able to cry and grieve, mingled with all the pain was an overwhelming sense of relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could blame you for that, my love,\u201d Alex said, wanting with everything in him to wipe away the memories of those years with her husband.</p><p>\u201cNow...now do you understand why I couldn\u2019t tell you about Bruce?\u201d she asked. \u201cYour marriage to Gloria was so wonderful\u2014it\u2019s what a marriage was meant to be. When she died, your love and James\u2019s love surrounded her. When Bruce died\u2014\u201d she hesitated, and her lips were trembling \u201c\u2014he was with another woman. It was the final rejection, the final humiliation.\u201d She drew in a ragged breath and turned, her eyes burning into his. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of wife I\u2019ll be to you, Alex. Over the years I\u2019ve thought about those three nightmarish years and I\u2019ve wondered what would\u2019ve happened had I done things differently. Maybe the fault was my own...maybe Bruce was right all along, and if I\u2019d only been a better woman, he wouldn\u2019t have needed to drink. If I\u2019d done things differently, he might\u2019ve been happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, you don\u2019t truly believe that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, love, my sweet, sweet love. You\u2019ve got to realize that any problems Bruce had were of his own making. The reasons for his misery lay within himself. Nothing you could ever have done would\u2019ve been enough.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t make myself fully believe that, and yet I know it\u2019s true. But Alex...this time I want everything to be right.\u201d Her eyes were clouded and uncertain, as if she suspected he\u2019d be angry with her.</p><p>\u201cIt will be,\u201d he promised her, and there wasn\u2019t a single doubt in his heart.</p><p>Carol awoke when dawn silently slipped through the lush drapes of the honeymoon suite. She closed her eyes and sighed, replete, sated, unbelievably happy. Deliriously happy.</p><p>From the moment Carol had agreed to become Alex\u2019s wife to this very morning, exactly one month had passed. One month. It hardly seemed possible.</p><p>In one month, they\u2019d planned, arranged and staged a large wedding, complete with reception, dinner and dance.</p><p>True to her word, Carol\u2019s mother had prepared a reception dinner that couldn\u2019t have been surpassed. Angelina had started dragging out her biggest pots and pans the Sunday afternoon she brought Alex back to the house to introduce him to the family.</p><p>Last week, Carol\u2019s sisters and their families had all arrived. The wedding became a celebration of love, a family reunion, a blending of families, all at once.</p><p>At the reception, Alex had surprised her with the honeymoon trip to Hawaii. The boys were mildly put out that they hadn\u2019t been included. Hawaii would have been the perfect place to \u201ccheck out chicks,\u201d as Peter put it. To appease them, Alex promised a family vacation over the Thanksgiving holiday. Peter and James had promptly started talking about a Mexican cruise.</p><p>Carol smiled as she savored memories of her wedding day. Peter and James had circulated proudly among the guests, accepting full credit for getting their parents together.</p><p>Alex stirred and rolled onto his side, slipping his hand around her waist and tucking his body against hers as naturally as if they\u2019d been married three years instead of three marvelous days.</p><p>Carol had been crazy in love with Alex before she married him, but the depth of emotion that filled her after the wedding ceremony made what she\u2019d experienced earlier seem weak by comparison.</p><p>Never had she been more in love. Never had she felt so desirable. Just as she\u2019d known it would be, Alex\u2019s lovemaking was gentle and unselfish while at the same time fierce and demanding. Thinking of how often and well he\u2019d loved her in the last few days was enough to increase the tempo of her heart.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she whispered, as Alex turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and spoke in silent messages.</p><p>He was telling her he loved her. She was saying she loved him back. He was saying he needed her. She echoed that need.</p><p>Alex kissed her again, lightly, his lips as weightless as the creeping sunlight.</p><p>\u201cOh, love,\u201d he whispered reverently, spreading moist kisses over her face. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of making love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope not.\u201d She smiled at him, brushing a stray curl from his brow. She fought back the ready tears that his love brought so easily to the surface. But it would\u2019ve been impossible to restrain them. Alex didn\u2019t understand her tears, and Carol could find no way to explain.</p><p>He tenderly wiped the moisture from her face and kissed her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to see you cry. Please tell me if there\u2019s anything I can do....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d After all the times they\u2019d made love, learned and explored each other\u2019s bodies in the past three days, he still couldn\u2019t completely accept her tears, fearing he was the cause. Once again, Carol tried to make him understand. \u201cI...I didn\u2019t realize making love could be so wonderful...so good.\u201d</p><p>Alex momentarily closed his eyes, his look full of chagrin and something else she couldn\u2019t name. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take any precautions last night.\u201d</p><p>His words triggered a slow easy smile. \u201cI know, and I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought we decided to wait a few months before we even considered starting a family.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think your chances of getting pregnant are?\u201d he asked after several minutes of kissing and touching.</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cAbout a hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>The room went quiet. When Alex spoke, his voice was strangled. \u201cHow would you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievably happy. I want your child, Alex.\u201d</p><p>His mouth found hers again for a kiss that grew wilder and wilder. Nestling her head against his strong shoulder, Carol sighed. She felt happier than she\u2019d ever imagined possible. Happy with her husband, her family, herself.</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>After all the years Carol had worked as an obstetrical nurse, after all the birthing classes she\u2019d taught, she should be able to recognize a contraction. Still, she wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure and had delayed contacting Alex until she was several hours into labor.</p><p>Resting her hands on her distended abdomen, she rubbed it gently, taking in several relaxing breaths. Twins! She and Alex were having twins. He felt as excited, as ecstatic, as she did. Maybe even more so...Everything was ready for their babies. The nursery was furnished with two cradles, each with a different mobile hanging above it, and Alex had painted a mural, a forest scene, on the wall for his daughters. All their little sweaters and sleepers were stacked in twin dressers he\u2019d lovingly refinished.</p><p>Carol took another deep breath as the next pain struck. Then, knowing she shouldn\u2019t delay much longer, she reached for the phone and called Alex at the office.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he cried impatiently. This last week he\u2019d been as nervous as...a father-to-be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Carol.\u201d</p> <p>She heard his soft intake of breath. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be calling me at the office if you were fine,\u201d he countered sharply. \u201cIs something going on that I should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. At least not yet, but I think it might be a good idea if you took the rest of the afternoon off and came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of a project, I can wait,\u201d she assured him, but she hoped he\u2019d be home soon, otherwise she was going to end up driving herself to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about me,\u201d he said. \u201cAre the babies coming now? Oh, Carol, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m prepared for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I am.\u201d</p> <p>Alex expelled his breath forcefully. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d she cried. \u201cDon\u2019t speed.\u201d</p><p>She used the time before his arrival to make some phone calls, then collected her purse and her small suitcase\u2014packed several weeks ago. Finally, she sank into her favorite chair, counting the minutes between contractions.</p><p>From a block away, Carol could hear the roar of his truck as he sped toward the house. The squealing of brakes was followed by the truck door slamming. Seconds afterward, Alex vaulted into the house, breathless and pale.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get up from her chair; instead, Carol held out both hands to him. \u201cSettle down, big daddy.\u201d</p><p>He flew to her side and knelt in front of her, clasping her hands in his. It took him a moment to compose himself.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re in labor?\u201d he asked when he\u2019d found his voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in labor,\u201d Carol told him and stroked his hair.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so calm about this?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and bent forward to brush her lips over his. \u201cOne of us has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I know...you need me to be strong for you now, but look at me,\u201d he said, holding out his hands for her inspection. \u201cI\u2019m shaking.\u201d Gently he laid those same shaking hands on Carol\u2019s abdomen, and when he glanced up at her, his eyes were bright with unshed tears. \u201cI love these babies\u2014our daughters\u2014so much. I can\u2019t believe how lucky I am. And now that they\u2019re about to be born, I feel so humble, so unworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alex...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019d better go. Is there anything we need to do first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve phoned my mother and the doctor, and my suitcase is by the door.\u201d She made an effort to disguise the intensity of her next contraction by closing her eyes and breathing slowly and deeply until it passed. When she opened her eyes, she discovered Alex watching her intently. If possible, he looked paler than he had before.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I love our babies, but I love you more than anything. I can\u2019t stand to see you in pain. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words were interrupted by the sound of another car pulling into the driveway and two doors slamming. James burst into the house first, followed by Peter, both looking as excited as if it were Christmas morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing home from school?\u201d Carol demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe heard you were in labor. You don\u2019t think we\u2019d miss this, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Carol echoed. \u201cHow? From whom?\u201d</p><p>The two boys eyed each other. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our sources,\u201d James said.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the time or place to question them. \u201cAll right, we won\u2019t discuss it now. James, take care of your father. Peter, load up the car. I think it might be best if you drove me yourself. James, bring your father\u2014he\u2019s in no condition to drive.\u201d</p><p>Their sons leaped into action. \u201cCome on, Dad, we\u2019re going to have a couple of babies,\u201d James said, urging his father toward the late-model sedan the two boys shared.</p><p>By the time they got to Ford Memorial, Carol\u2019s pains had increased dramatically. She was wheeled to the labor room while James and Peter were left to fend for themselves in the waiting room.</p><p>Alex was more composed by now, more in control. He smiled shyly and took her hand, clutching it between both of his. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, I\u2019m going to be fine and so are our daughters.\u201d</p><p>Janice Mandle came bustling in, looking pleased. \u201cOkay, we all ready for this special delivery?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Carol said, nodding firmly.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Alex echoed.</p><p>With Janice\u2019s help and Alex\u2019s love, Carol made it through her next contractions. As she was being taken into the delivery room, Alex walked beside her. The pains were coming faster, but she managed to smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered back. He reached for her hand again and they met, palm to palm, heart to heart.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, can I have seconds on the zabaglione?\u201d James called from the large family kitchen.</p><p>Angelina Pasquale\u2019s smile widened and her eyes met those of her daughter. \u201cI told you my cooking would put some meat on his bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you did, Mama,\u201d Carol said, exchanging a private smile with her husband. She and the babies had been home for a week. Royalty couldn\u2019t have been treated better. James and Peter were crazy about their sisters, and so far the only tasks allotted Carol had been diaper-changing and breastfeeding. She was well aware that the novelty would wear off, but she didn\u2019t expect it to be too soon. Angie and Alison had stolen two teenage hearts without even trying.</p><p>\u201cI brought you some tea,\u201d Alex said, sliding onto the sofa beside her. His eyes were filled with love. From the moment Carol was brought to the delivery room, the light in Alex\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t changed. It was filled with an indescribable tenderness. As she gave birth, his hand had gripped hers and when their two perfect identical daughters were born, there\u2019d been tears in both parents\u2019 eyes. Tears of joy. Tears of gratitude. They\u2019d each been granted so much more than they\u2019d ever dreamed. New life. New love. A new appreciation for all the good things in store for them and their combined families.</p><p>The soft lilting words of an Italian lullaby drifted toward Carol and Alex. Eyes closed, Carol\u2019s mother rocked in her chair, a sleeping infant cradled in each arm. The words were familiar to Carol; she\u2019d heard her mother sing them to her as a child.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, Angelina Pasquale murmured a soft, emotional prayer.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Alex asked, leaning close to Carol.</p><p>A smile tugged at the edges of Carol\u2019s mouth. Her fingers were twined with Alex\u2019s and she raised his knuckles to her lips and kissed them gently. \u201cShe was thanking St. Rita for a job well done.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
