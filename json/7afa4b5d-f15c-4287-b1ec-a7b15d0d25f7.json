A thick black curtain, dusty with age and neglect, covered the narrow opening from the ceiling of the box to the scarred hardwood floor, blocking out both the daylight and the air.</p><p>It was like being inside a coffin someone had absentmindedly left propped up against the wall, and Father Thomas Madden thanked God he wasn\u2019t claustrophobic. He was rapidly becoming miserable though. The air was heavy and ripe with mildew, making his breathing as labored as when he was back at Penn State running that last yard to the goalposts with the football tucked neatly in his arm. He hadn\u2019t minded the pain in his lungs then, and he certainly didn\u2019t mind it now. It was all simply part of the job.</p><p>The old priests would tell him to offer his discomfort up to God for the poor souls in purgatory. Tom didn\u2019t see any harm in doing that, even though he wondered how his own misery was going to relieve anyone else\u2019s.</p> <p>He shifted position on the hard oak chair, fidgeting like a choirboy at Sunday practice. He could feel the sweat dripping down the sides of his face and neck into his cassock. The long black robe was soaked through with perspiration, and he sincerely doubted he smelled at all like the hint of Irish Spring soap he\u2019d used in the shower this morning.</p><p>The temperature outside hovered between ninety-four and ninety-five in the shade of the rectory porch where the thermostat was nailed to the whitewashed stone wall. The humidity made the heat so oppressive, those unfortunate souls who were forced to leave their air-conditioned homes and venture outside did so with a slow shuffle and a quick temper.</p><p>It was a lousy day for the compressor to bite the dust. There were windows in the church, of course, but the ones that could have been opened had been sealed shut long ago in a futile attempt to keep vandals out. The two others were high up in the gold, domed ceiling. They were stained glass depictions of the archangels Gabriel and Michael holding gleaming swords in their fists. Gabriel was looking up toward heaven, a beatified expression on his face, while Michael scowled at the snakes he held pinned down at his bare feet. The colored windows were considered priceless, prayer-inspiring works of art by the congregation, but they were useless in combating the heat. They had been added for decoration, not ventilation.</p><p>Tom was a big, strapping man with a seventeen-and-a-half-inch neck left over from his glory days, but he was cursed with baby sensitive skin. The heat was giving him a prickly rash. He hiked the cassock up to his thighs, revealing the yellow and black happy-face boxer shorts his sister, Laurant, had given him, kicked off his paint-splattered Wal-Mart rubber thongs, and popped a piece of Dubble Bubble into his mouth.</p><p>An act of kindness had landed him in the sweatbox. While waiting for the test results that would determine if he needed another round of chemotherapy at Kansas University Medical Center, he was a guest of Monsignor McKindry, pastor of Our Lady of Mercy Church. The parish was located in the forgotten sector of Kansas City, several hundred miles south of Holy Oaks, Iowa, where Tom was stationed. The neighborhood had been officially designated by a former mayor\u2019s task force as the gang zone. Monsignor always took Saturday afternoon confession, but because of the blistering heat, his advanced age, the broken air conditioner, and a conflict in his schedule\u2014the pastor was busy preparing for his reunion with two friends from his seminary days at Assumption Abbey\u2014Tom had volunteered for the duty. He had assumed he\u2019d sit face-to-face with his penitent in a room with a couple of windows open for fresh air. McKindry, however, bowed to the preferences of his faithful parishioners, who stubbornly clung to the old-fashioned way of hearing confessions, a fact Tom learned only after he\u2019d offered his services, and Lewis, the parish handyman, had directed him to the oven he would sit in for the next ninety minutes.</p> <p>In appreciation Monsignor had loaned him a thoroughly inadequate, battery-operated fan that one of his flock had put in the collection basket. The thing was no bigger than the size of a man\u2019s hand. Tom adjusted the angle of the fan so that the air would blow directly on his face, leaned back against the wall, and began to read the Holy Oaks Gazette he\u2019d brought along to Kansas City with him.</p><p>He turned to the society page on the back first, because he got such a kick out of it. He glanced over the usual club news and the smattering of announcements\u2014two births, three engagements, and a wedding\u2014and then he found his favorite column, called \u201cAbout Town.\u201d The headline was always the same: the bingo game. The number of people who attended the community center bingo night was reported along with the names of the winners of the twenty-five-dollar jackpots. Interviews with the lucky recipients followed, telling what each of them planned to do with his or her windfall. And there was always a comment from Rabbi David Spears, who organized the weekly event, about what a good time everyone had. Tom was suspicious that the society editor, Lorna Hamburg, secretly had a crush on Rabbi Dave, a widower, and that was why the bingo game was so prominently featured in the paper. The rabbi said the same thing every week, and Tom invariably ribbed him about that when they played golf together on Wednesday afternoons. Since Dave usually beat the socks off him, he didn\u2019t mind the teasing, but he did accuse Tom of trying to divert attention from his appalling game.</p><p>The rest of the column was dedicated to letting everyone in town know who was entertaining company and what they were feeding them. If the news that week was hard to come by, Lorna filled in the space with popular recipes.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any secrets in Holy Oaks. The front page was full of news about the proposed town square development and the upcoming one-hundred-year celebration at Assumption Abbey. And there was a nice mention about his sister helping out at the abbey. The reporter called her a tireless and cheerful volunteer and went into some detail describing all the projects she had taken on. Not only was she going to organize all the clutter in the attic for a garage sale, but she was also going to transfer all the information from the old dusty files onto the newly donated computer, and when she had a few minutes to spare, she would be translating the French journals of Father Henri VanKirk, a priest who had died recently. Tom chuckled to himself as he finished reading the glowing testimonial to his sister. Laurant hadn\u2019t actually volunteered for any of the jobs. She just happened to be walking past the abbot at the moment he came up with the ideas, and gracious to a fault, she hadn\u2019t refused.</p><p>By the time Tom finished reading the rest of the Gazette, his soaked collar was sticking to his neck. He put the paper on the seat next to him, mopped his brow again, and contemplated closing shop fifteen minutes early.</p><p>He gave up the idea almost as soon as it entered his mind. He knew that if he left the confessional early, he\u2019d catch hell from Monsignor, and after the hard day of manual labor he\u2019d put in, he simply wasn\u2019t up to a lecture. On the first Wednesday of every third month\u2014Ash Wednesday he silently called it\u2014Tom moved in with Monsignor McKindry, an old, broken-nosed, crackled-skinned Irishman who never missed an opportunity to get as much physical labor as he could possibly squeeze out of his houseguest in seven days. McKindry was crusty and gruff, but he had a heart of gold and a compassionate nature that wasn\u2019t compromised by sentimentality. He firmly believed that idle hands were the devil\u2019s workshop, especially when the rectory was in dire need of a fresh coat of paint. Hard work, he pontificated, would cure anything, even cancer.</p> <p>Some days Tom had a hard time remembering why he liked the monsignor so much or felt a kinship with him. Maybe it was because they both had a bit of Irish in them. Or maybe it was because the old man\u2019s philosophy, that only a fool cried over spilled milk, had sustained him through more hardships than Job. Tom\u2019s battle was child\u2019s play compared to McKindry\u2019s life.</p><p>He would do whatever he could to help lighten McKindry\u2019s burdens. Monsignor was looking forward to visiting with his old friends again. One of them was Abbot James Rockhill, Tom\u2019s superior at Assumption Abbey, and the other, Vincent Moreno, was a priest Tom had never met. Neither Rockhill nor Moreno would be staying at Mercy house with McKindry and Tom, for they much preferred the luxuries provided by the staff at Holy Trinity parish, luxuries like hot water that lasted longer than five minutes and central air-conditioning. Trinity was located in the heart of a bedroom community on the other side of the state line separating Missouri from Kansas. McKindry jokingly referred to it as \u201cOur Lady of the Lexus,\u201d and from the number of designer cars parked in the church\u2019s lot on Sunday mornings, the label was right on the mark. Most of the parishioners at Mercy didn\u2019t own cars. They walked to church.</p><p>Tom\u2019s stomach began to rumble. He was hot and sticky and thirsty. He needed another shower, and he wanted a cold Bud Light. There hadn\u2019t been a single taker in all the while he\u2019d been sitting there roasting like a turkey. He didn\u2019t think anyone else was even inside the church now, except maybe Lewis, who liked to hide in the cloakroom behind the vestibule and sneak sips of rot whiskey from the bottle in his toolbox. Tom checked his watch, saw he only had a couple of minutes left, and decided he\u2019d had enough. He switched off the light above the confessional and was reaching for the curtain when he heard the swoosh of air the leather kneeler expelled when weight was placed upon it. The sound was followed by a discreet cough from the confessor\u2019s cell next to him.</p><p>Tom immediately straightened in his chair, took the gum out of his mouth and put it back in the wrapper, then bowed his head in prayer and slid the wooden panel up.</p><p>\u201cIn the name of the Father and of the Son . . . ,\u201d he began in a low voice as he made the sign of the cross.</p><p>Several seconds passed in silence. The penitent was either gathering his thoughts or his courage before he confessed his transgressions. Tom adjusted the stole around his neck and patiently continued to wait.</p><p>The scent of Calvin Klein\u2019s Obsession came floating through the grille that separated them. It was a distinct, heavy, sweet fragrance Tom recognized because his housekeeper in Rome had given him a bottle of the cologne on his last birthday. A little of the stuff went a long way, and the penitent had gone overboard. The confessional reeked. The scent, combined with the smell of mildew and sweat, made Tom feel as though he were trying to breathe through a plastic bag. His stomach lurched and he forced himself not to gag.</p><p>\u201cAre you there, Father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Tom whispered. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to confess your sins, you may begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is . . . difficult for me. My last confession was a year ago. I wasn\u2019t given absolution then. Will you absolve me now?\u201d</p><p>There was an odd, singsong quality to the voice and a mocking tone that put Tom on his guard. Was the stranger simply nervous because it had been such a long time since his last confession, or was he being deliberately irreverent?</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t given absolution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, Father. I angered the priest. I\u2019ll make you angry too. What I have to confess will . . . shock you. Then you\u2019ll become angry like the other priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you say will shock or anger me,\u201d Tom assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard it all before? Is that it, Father?\u201d</p><p>Before Tom could answer, the penitent whispered, \u201cHate the sin, not the sinner.\u201d</p><p>The mocking had intensified. Tom stiffened. \u201cWould you like to begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the stranger replied. \u201cBless me, Father, for I will sin.\u201d</p><p>Confused by what he\u2019d heard, Tom leaned closer to the grille and asked the man to start over.</p><p>\u201cBless me, Father, for I will sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to confess a sin you\u2019re going to commit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of a game or a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not a game,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019m deadly serious. Are you getting angry yet?\u201d</p><p>A burst of laughter, as jarring as the sound of gunfire in the middle of the night, shot through the grille.</p><p>Tom was careful to keep his voice neutral when he answered. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not angry, but I am confused. Surely you realize you can\u2019t be given absolution for sins you\u2019re contemplating. Forgiveness is for those who have realized their mistakes and are truly contrite. They\u2019re willing to make restitution for their sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but Father, you don\u2019t know what the sins are yet. How can you deny me absolution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaming the sins doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it does. A year ago I told another priest exactly what I was going to do, but he didn\u2019t believe me until it was too late. Don\u2019t make the same mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know the priest didn\u2019t believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t try to stop me. That\u2019s how I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a Catholic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know that a priest cannot acknowledge the sin or the sinner outside of the confessional. The seal of silence is sacred. Exactly how could this other priest have stopped you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have found a way. I was . . . practicing then, and I was cautious. It would have been very easy for him to stop me, so it\u2019s his fault, not mine. It won\u2019t be easy now.\u201d</p><p>Tom was desperately trying to make sense out of what the man was saying. Practice? Practice what? And what was the sin the priest could have prevented?</p><p>\u201cI thought I could control it,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cControl what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe craving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the sin you confessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Millicent. A nice, old-fashioned name, don\u2019t you think? Her friends called her Millie, but I didn\u2019t. I much preferred Millicent. Of course, I wasn\u2019t what you would call a friend.\u201d</p><p>Another burst of laughter pierced the dead air. Tom\u2019s forehead was beaded with perspiration, but he suddenly felt cold. This wasn\u2019t a prankster. He dreaded what he was going to hear, yet he was compelled to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Millicent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened to her?\u201d the man demanded, his impatience clear now. \u201cI killed her. It was messy; there was blood everywhere, all over me. I was terribly inexperienced back then. I hadn\u2019t perfected my technique. When I went to confession, I hadn\u2019t killed her yet. I was still in the planning stage and the priest could have stopped me, but he didn\u2019t. I told him what I was going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, how could he have stopped you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrayer,\u201d he answered, a shrug in his voice. \u201cI told him to pray for me, but he didn\u2019t pray hard enough, now did he? I still killed her. It\u2019s a pity, really. She was such a pretty little thing . . . much prettier than the others.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dear God, there were other women? How many others?</p><p>\u201cHow many crimes have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The stranger interrupted him. \u201cSins, Father,\u201d he said. \u201cI committed sins, but I might have been able to resist if the priest had helped me. He wouldn\u2019t give me what I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you need?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolution and acceptance. I was denied both.\u201d</p><p>The stranger suddenly slammed his fist into the grille. Rage that must have been simmering just below the surface erupted full force as he spewed out in grotesque detail exactly what he had done to the poor innocent Millicent.</p><p>Tom was overwhelmed and sickened by the horror of it all. Dear God, what should he do? He had boasted he wouldn\u2019t be shocked or angered, but nothing could have prepared him for the atrocities the stranger took such delight in describing.</p><p>Hate the sin, not the sinner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a real taste for it,\u201d the madman whispered.</p> <p>\u201cHow many other women have you killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillicent was the first. There were other infatuations, and when they disappointed me, I had to hurt them, but I didn\u2019t kill any of them. After I met Millicent, everything changed. I watched her for a long time and everything about her was . . . perfect.\u201d His voice turned into a snarl as he continued. \u201cBut she betrayed me, just like the others. She thought she could play her little games with other men and I wouldn\u2019t notice. I couldn\u2019t let her torment me that way. I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI had to punish her.\u201d</p><p>He let out a loud, exaggerated sigh and then chuckled. \u201cI killed the little bitch twelve months ago and I buried her deep, real deep. No one\u2019s ever going to find her. There\u2019s no going back now. No, sirree. I had no idea how thrilling the kill was going to be. I made Millicent beg me for mercy, and she did. By God, she did.\u201d He laughed. \u201cShe screamed like a pig, and oh, how I loved the sound. I got so excited, more excited than I could ever have imagined was possible, and so I had to make her scream more, didn\u2019t I? When I was finished with her, I was bursting with joy. Well, Father, aren\u2019t you going to ask me if I\u2019m sorry for my sins?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t contrite.\u201d</p><p>A suffocating silence filled the confessional. And then, in a serpent\u2019s hiss, the voice returned.</p><p>\u201cThe craving\u2019s come back.\u201d</p> <p>Goose bumps covered Tom\u2019s arms. \u201cThere are people who can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should be locked away? I only punish those who hurt me. So you see, I\u2019m not culpable. But you think I\u2019m sick, don\u2019t you? We\u2019re in confession, Father. You have to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think you\u2019re ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m just dedicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people who can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brilliant, you know. It won\u2019t be easy to stop me. I study my clients before I take them on. I know everything about their families and their friends. Everything. Yes, it\u2019s going to be much harder to stop me now, but this time I\u2019ve decided to make it more difficult for me. Do you see? I don\u2019t want to sin. I really don\u2019t.\u201d The singsong voice was back.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Tom pleaded. \u201cStep outside the confessional with me and we\u2019ll sit down together and talk this through. I want to help you, if you\u2019ll only let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I needed help before and I was denied, remember? Give me absolution.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will not.\u201d</p><p>The sigh was long and drawn out. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m changing the rules this time. You have my permission to tell anyone you want to tell. Do you see how accommodating I can be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you give me permission to tell or not, this conversation will remain confidential. The seal of silence must be maintained to protect the integrity of the confessional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what I confess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI demand that you tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemand all you want, but it won\u2019t make any difference. I cannot tell anyone what you have said to me. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence passed and then the stranger began to chuckle. \u201cA priest with scruples. How extraordinary. Hmmm. What a quandary. But don\u2019t you fret, Father. I\u2019m ten steps ahead of you. Yes, sirree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken on a new client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already chosen your next\u2014\u201d</p><p>The madman cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ve already notified the authorities. They\u2019ll get my letter soon. Of course that was before I knew you were going to be such a stickler for the rules. Still, it was considerate of me, wasn\u2019t it? I sent them a polite little note explaining my intentions. Pity I forgot to sign it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give them the name of the person you intend to harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarm? What a quaint word that is for murder. Yes, I named her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother woman, then?\u201d Tom\u2019s voice broke on the question.</p><p>\u201cI only take women on as clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you explain in the note your reason for wanting to kill this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you explain it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice makes perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one\u2019s even more special than Millicent. I wrap myself in her fragrance, and I love to watch her sleep. She\u2019s so beautiful. Ask me, and after I\u2019ve given you her name, you can forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not give you absolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the chemotherapy going? Are you feeling sick? Did you get a good report?\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded in a near shout.</p><p>The madman laughed. \u201cI told you I study my clients before I take them on. You could say I stalk them,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tommy, you\u2019ve been such a sport. Haven\u2019t you wondered why I followed you all this way just to confess my sins to you? Think about it on your way back to the abbey. I\u2019ve done my homework, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019m a heartbreaker. And I do so love a challenge. Make this one difficult for me. The police will come here soon to talk to you, and then you\u2019ll be able to tell anyone you want,\u201d he mocked. \u201cI know who you\u2019ll call first. Your hotshot friend with the FBI. You\u2019ll call Nick, won\u2019t you? I sure hope you will. And he\u2019ll come running to help. You\u2019d better tell him to take her away and hide her from me. I might not follow, and I\u2019ll start looking for someone else. At least I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk you what?</p><p>\u201cHer name,\u201d the madman whispered. \u201cAsk me who my client is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI urge you to get help,\u201d Tom began again. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me. Ask me. Ask me.\u201d</p><p>Tom closed his eyes. \u201cYes. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d he answered. \u201cSuch beautiful full br**sts and long, dark hair. There isn\u2019t a mark on her perfect body, and her face is like an angel\u2019s, so exquisite in every way. She\u2019s . . . breathtaking . . . but I plan to take her breath away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me her name,\u201d Tom demanded, praying to God there was time to get to the poor woman to protect her.</p><p>\u201cLaurant,\u201d the serpent whispered. \u201cHer name is Laurant.\u201d</p><p>Panic hit Tom like a fist. \u201cMy Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now you\u2019re getting it, Father. I\u2019m going to kill your sister.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Agent Nicholas Benjamin Buchanan was about to begin a long overdue vacation. He hadn\u2019t taken any time off in the past three years, and it was beginning to show in his attitude\u2014or so he\u2019d been told by his superior, Doctor Peter Morganstern, when he\u2019d ordered him to take a month\u2019s leave. He\u2019d also told Nick that he was becoming a little too detached and cynical, and deep down Nick worried that he might be right.</p><p>Morganstern always told it like it was. Nick admired and respected him almost as much as he did his own father, and so he rarely argued with him. His boss was as steady as a rock. He never would have lasted more than two weeks in the Bureau if he had let his emotions control his behavior. If he had any flaw at all, it was his maddening ability to remain calm to the point of being catatonic. Nothing ever fazed the man.</p><p>The twelve handpicked agents under his direct supervision calledhim Prozac Pete\u2014behind his back of course\u2014but he knew about the nickname and wasn\u2019t offended by it. Rumor had it he actually laughed the first time he heard it, and that was yet another reason he got along so well with his agents. He had been able to hold on to his sense of humor\u2014no small feat, considering the section he ran. His idea of losing his temper was having to repeat himself, though in all honesty, his raspy, years-of-smoking-cigars voice never, ever rose a decibel. Hell, maybe the other agents were right. Maybe Morganstern really did have Prozac running through his veins.</p><p>One thing was certain. His superiors knew gold when they spotted it, and in the fourteen years that Morganstern had worked for the Bureau, he\u2019d been promoted six times. Yet he never rested on his laurels. When he was named head of the \u201clost-and-found\u201d division, he dedicated himself to building an extremely efficient task force for tracking and recovering missing persons. And once that was accomplished, he turned his efforts to a more specific objective. He wanted to create a specialized unit devoted to the most difficult cases involving lost and abducted children. He justified this new unit on paper and then spent a considerable amount of time lobbying for it. At every opportunity, he waved his 233-page thesis under the director\u2019s nose.</p><p>His dogged determination finally paid off, and he now headed this elite unit. He was allowed to recruit his own men, a motley crew at best, who came to him from all walks of life. Each man was required to go through the academy\u2019s training program at Quantico first, and then he was sent to Morganstern for special testing and training. Very few made it through the grueling program, but those who did were exceptional. Morganstern was overheard telling the director he firmly believed he had the cream of the crop working for him, and within one year he proved to all the doubting Thomases that he was right. He then handed over the reins of the \u201clost and found\u201d to his assistant, Frank O\u2019Leary, and made the lateral move within the department to devote his time and effort to this very specialized group.</p><p>His team was unique. Each man possessed unusual skills in tracking he missing children. The twelve men were hunters who constantly raced against the clock with but one sacred goal, to find and protect before it was too late. They were every child\u2019s greatest champion and the last line of defense against the bogeymen who lurked in the dark.</p><p>The stress of the job would have sent average men into cardiac arrest, but there wasn\u2019t anything average about these men. None of them fit the profile of the typical FBI agent, but then Morganstern wasn\u2019t your typical leader. He had quickly proven that he was more than capable of running such an eclectic group. The other departments called his agents the Apostles, no doubt because there were twelve of them, but Morganstern didn\u2019t like the nickname because, as their leader, it implied all sorts of things about him that he couldn\u2019t possibly live up to. His humility was yet another reason he was so respected. His agents also appreciated the fact that he wasn\u2019t a by-the-manual boss. He encouraged them to get the job done, pretty much gave them a free hand, and always backed them up whenever it was needed. In many ways he was their greatest champion.</p><p>Certainly no one with the Bureau was more dedicated or qualified, for Morganstern was a board certified psychiatrist, which was probably why he liked to have his little heart-to-heart talks with each of his agents every now and then. Sitting them down and getting into their heads validated all the time and expense of his Harvard education. It was the one quirk all of them had to put up with and all of them hated.</p><p>He was in the mood to talk about the Stark case now. He had flown from D.C. to Cincinnati and had asked Nick to stop over on his way back from a seminar in San Francisco. Nick didn\u2019t want to discuss the Stark case\u2014it had happened over a month ago and he didn\u2019t even want to think about it, but that didn\u2019t matter. He knew he was going to have to discuss it whether he wanted to or not.</p><p>He waited at the regional office for his superior to join him, then sat down across from him at the polished oak conference table and listened for twenty minutes while Morganstern reviewed some of the particulars of the bizarre case. Nick stayed calm until Morganstern told him he was going to get a commendation for his heroic actions. He almost lost it then and there, but he was adept at concealing his true feelings. Even his boss, with his keen eye constantly on the lookout for any telltale signs of burnout or stress overload, was fooled into thinking that once again he was taking it all in stride\u2014or so Nick thought.</p><p>When the conference wound down, Morganstern stared into the steely blue eyes of his agent for a long, silent minute and then asked, \u201cWhen you shot her, what did you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this necessary, sir? It happened over a month ago. Do we really need to rehash this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a formal meeting, Nick. It\u2019s just you and me. You don\u2019t have to call me sir, and yes, I think it is necessary. Now answer me, please. What did you feel?\u201d</p><p>And still he hedged, squirming in the hard-backed chair like a little boy being forced to admit he\u2019d done something wrong. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean, what did I feel?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the burst of anger, his superior calmly repeated the question a third time. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m asking you. At that precise second, what did you feel? Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>He was giving him a way out. Nick knew he could lie and tell him no, he didn\u2019t remember, that he\u2019d been too busy at the time to think about what he was feeling, but he and Morganstern had always had an honest rapport with each other and he didn\u2019t want to screw that up now. Besides, he was pretty sure his boss would know he was lying. Realizing how futile it was to continue the evasion, he gave it up and decided to be blunt. \u201cYeah, I remember. It felt good,\u201d he whispered. \u201cReal good. Hell, Pete, I was euphoric. If I hadn\u2019t turned around and gone back inside that house, if I had hesitated even thirty seconds more, and if I hadn\u2019t had my gun drawn, it would have been all over and that little boy would be dead. I cut it too damned close this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you did get to the child in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have figured it out sooner.\u201d</p><p>Morganstern sighed. Of all of his agents, Nick had always been the most critical of his own performance. \u201cYou were the only one who did figure it out,\u201d he reminded him. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you read the newspapers? The reporters said she was crazy, but they didn\u2019t see the look in her eyes. I did, and I\u2019m telling you, she wasn\u2019t crazy at all. She was pure evil.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve read the papers and you\u2019re right, they did call her crazy. I expected they would,\u201d he added. \u201cI understand why and I think you do too. It\u2019s the only way the public can make sense out of such a heinous crime. They want to believe that only a demented man or woman could do such obscene things to another human being, and only a crazy person could derive pleasure in the killing of innocents. A good number of them are crazy, but some aren\u2019t. Evil does exist. We\u2019ve both seen it. Somewhere along the way, the Stark woman made a conscious choice to cross the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are afraid of what they don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Morganstern agreed. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a large percentage of academics who don\u2019t want to believe that evil exists. If they can\u2019t reason it or explain it in their narrow minds, then it simply can\u2019t be. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons our culture is such fertile ground for depravity. Some of my colleagues believe they can fix anything with a long-winded diagnosis and a few mind-altering drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that one of your colleagues believes that Stark\u2019s husband controlled her and that she was so terrified of him, her mind snapped. In other words, we should feel sorry for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard that too. Nonsense. The Stark woman was as depraved as her husband. Her fingerprints were on those pornographic tapes along with his. She was a willing participant, but I do believe she was breaking down. They\u2019d never gone after children before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonest to God, Pete, she was smiling at me. The boy was cradled in her arms, and she held a butcher knife over him. He was unconscious, but I could see he was still breathing. She was waiting for me. She knew I had figured it all out and I think she wanted me to watch her kill him.\u201d He paused to nod. \u201cYeah, it felt good to blow her away. I\u2019m just sorry her husband wasn\u2019t there. I would have liked to have gotten him too. Any leads yet? I still think you ought to put our friend Noah on his trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been considering doing just that, but they want to take Donald Stark alive so they can question him, and they know if Stark gives him any trouble at all, Noah won\u2019t hesitate to shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kill a cockroach, Pete. You don\u2019t domesticate him. Noah\u2019s got the right idea.\u201d He rolled his shoulders to stretch his cramped muscles, rubbed the back of his neck with his hand, and then remarked, \u201cI think I need to go on another retreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might be burning out. Am I?\u201d</p><p>Morganstern shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re just a little fatigued, that\u2019s all. None of this conversation is going in my report. I meant it when I said it was between you and me. You\u2019re way past due for some time off, but that\u2019s my fault, not yours. I want you to take a month off now and get your mind centered again.\u201d</p> <p>A hint of a smile softened Nick\u2019s bleak expression. \u201cCenter my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out,\u201d he explained. \u201cOr try to anyway. When was the last time you went up to Nathan\u2019s Bay to see that big family of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d Nick admitted. \u201cI keep in touch with all of them by E-mail. Everyone\u2019s as busy as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for you. Your folks will be glad to see you again. How\u2019s the judge doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s fine,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your friend Father Madden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talk to Tommy every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy E-mail?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you ought to go see him and have those talks face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I need a little spiritual guidance?\u201d Nick asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI think you need a little laughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I probably do,\u201d he agreed. He grew serious once again and said, \u201cPete, about my instincts. Do you think I\u2019m losing my edge?\u201d</p><p>Morganstern scoffed at the notion. \u201cYour instincts couldn\u2019t be better. The Stark woman fooled everyone but you. Everyone,\u201d he repeated more forcefully. \u201cHer relatives, her friends and neighbors, her church group. She didn\u2019t fool you, though. Oh, I\u2019m sure the locals would have eventually figured it out, but by then that little boy would be dead and buried, and she would have snatched another one. You know as well as I do that once they start, they don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Pete tapped the thick manila folder with his knuckles. \u201cIn the interviews, I read all about how she sat next to the poor mother\u2019s side day in and day out, comforting her. She was on the church\u2019s grieving committee,\u201d he added with a shake of his head. He looked as though even he, who had seen and heard it all before, was shocked by the Stark woman\u2019s gall.</p><p>\u201cThe police talked to everyone in that church group, and they couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t real thorough,\u201d he added. \u201cBut then it was a tiny little town and the sheriff didn\u2019t know what to look for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was smart enough not to wait. He called us in right away,\u201d Morganstern said. \u201cHe and the other locals were convinced that a transient had taken the boy, weren\u2019t they? And that\u2019s where all of their efforts were focused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nick agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to believe that one of your own could do such a thing. They had a couple of witnesses who had seen a vagrant hanging around the schoolyard, but their descriptions didn\u2019t match. The team from Cincinnati were on their way,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they would have figured her game out real quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly was it that tipped you off ? How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle things out of sync,\u201d he replied. \u201cI can\u2019t explain what it was that bothered me about her or why I decided to follow her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can explain it. Instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI knew I was going to do a real thorough check on her. Something wasn\u2019t right, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what it was. I got this weird, gut feeling about her, and it got stronger as soon as I walked into her house . . . you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it. What was the house like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmaculate. I couldn\u2019t see a speck of dust or dirt anywhere. The living room was small\u2014a couple of easy chairs, sofa, TV\u2014but, you know what was odd, Pete? There weren\u2019t any pictures on the walls or family photos. Yeah, I remember I thought that was real odd. She had plastic covers on her furniture. I guess a lot of people do that. I don\u2019t know. Anyway, like I said, it was spotless, but it smelled peculiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of smell was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVinegar . . . and ammonia. The smell was so strong it made my eyes burn. I figured she was just a compulsive housecleaner . . . and then I followed her into the kitchen. It was clean as a whistle. Not a thing sitting on the counters, not a towel draped on the sink, nothing. She told me to have a seat while she fixed us a cup of coffee, and then I noticed the stuff she had on the table. There were salt and pepper shakers, but in between was a huge clear plastic container of pink antacid tablets, and next to it was a ketchup-size bottle of hot sauce. I thought that was damned peculiar . . . and then I saw the dog. The animal tipped the scales. It was a black cocker spaniel sitting in the corner by the back door. He never took his eyes off her. She put a plate of chocolate chip cookies on the table and when she turned her back to get the coffee, I took one of the cookies and put it down by my side, to see if the dog would come and get it, but he never even looked at me. Hell, he was too afraid to blink, and he was watching her every move. If the sheriff had seen the dog with her, he would have known something was real wrong, but when he interviewed her, the cocker was outside in the pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went inside her house and didn\u2019t notice anything unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lucky, and she was arrogant and reckless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you go back inside after you left her house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to get some backup and wait and see where she went, but as soon as I got outside, I knew I had to go back in, and fast. I had this feeling she knew I was on to her. And I knew that the boy was somewhere in that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour instincts couldn\u2019t be better tuned,\u201d Morganstern said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I went after you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The infamous football game.\u201d</p><p>Morganstern smiled. \u201cI just saw it again on CNN Sports a couple of weeks ago. They must run that clip at least twice a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish they\u2019d give it a rest. It\u2019s old news.\u201d</p><p>The two men stood. Nick towered over his boss. Morganstern, in his tasseled black leather loafers, was five feet eight inches tall, and Nick was over six feet. His boss was slightly built, with thinning blond hair that was quickly going gray, and his thick bifocals were constantly slipping down the bridge of his narrow nose. He always wore a conservative black or navy suit with a long-sleeved, white, starched shirt and muted striped tie. To the casual observer, Morganstern looked like a nerdy university professor, but to the agents under his supervision, he was, in every respect, a giant of a man who handled the hellacious job and the horrific pressures with unruffled ease.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a month, Nick, but not a day before. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>His superior started out the door, then paused. \u201cAre you still getting sick every time you get on a plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? When was the last time I got laid?\u201d</p><p>Morganstern pretended to be shocked by the question. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long while, Agent. Apparently you\u2019re going through a dry spell.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of these days you\u2019ll meet the right woman, heaven help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for the right woman.\u201d</p><p>Morganstern smiled a fatherly smile. \u201cAnd that, you see, is exactly when you\u2019ll find her. You won\u2019t be looking, and she\u2019ll blindside you, just like my Katie blindsided me. I never had a chance, and I predict you won\u2019t either. She\u2019s out there somewhere, just waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s going to have a hell of a long wait,\u201d he replied. \u201cIn our line of work, marriage isn\u2019t in the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie and I have managed for over twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2019s a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Nick. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet sick every time I get on a plane? Hell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Morganstern chuckled. \u201cGood luck getting home then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Pete, most psychiatrists would try to get to the bottom of my phobia, but you get a kick out of it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cSee you in a month,\u201d he repeated as he strolled out of the office.</p><p>Nick gathered up his files, made a couple of necessary calls to his Boston office and to Frank O\u2019Leary at Quantico, and then hitched a ride to the airport with one of the local agents. Since there was no getting out of his forced vacation, he made some tentative plans. He really was going to try to kick back and relax, maybe go sailing with his oldest brother, Theo, if he could pry him away from his job for a couple of days, and then he was going to drive halfway across the country to Holy Oaks, Iowa, to see his best friend, Tommy, and get some serious fishing done. Morganstern hadn\u2019t mentioned the promotion O\u2019Leary had dropped on the table two weeks ago. While he was on vacation Nick planned to weigh the pros and cons of the new job. He was counting on Tommy for help with the decision. He was closer to him than he was to his own five brothers, and he trusted him implicitly. His friend would play his usual role of devil\u2019s advocate, and hopefully by the time Nick returned to his job, he would know what he was going to do.</p><p>He knew Tommy was worried about him. He\u2019d been nagging him by E-mail for the past six months to come and see him. Like Morganstern, Tommy understood the stresses and the nightmares of Nick\u2019s work, and he also believed that Nick needed time away.</p><p>Tommy had his own battle to fight, and every three months when he checked into the Kansas Medical Center for tests, it was Nick who got the queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach that stayed there until Tommy E-mailed him with good news. So far, his friend had been lucky; the cancer had been contained. But it was always there, hovering, waiting to strike. Tommy had learned to deal with his illness. Nick hadn\u2019t. If he could take the pain and suffering away from his friend, he would willingly give his right arm, but that wasn\u2019t how it worked. As Tommy had said, this was a war he had to wage alone, and all Nick could do was be there for him when he needed him.</p><p>Nick was suddenly anxious to see his friend again. He might even be able to talk him into taking off his priest collar for one night and getting roaring drunk with him the way they used to when they roomed together at Penn State.</p><p>And he would finally get to meet Tommy\u2019s only family, his baby sister, Laurant. She was eight years younger than her brother and had grown up with the nuns in a boarding school for wealthy young girls in the mountains near Geneva. Tommy had tried several times to bring her to America, but the conditions of the trust and the lawyers guarding the money convinced the judges to keep her sequestered until she was of age to make decisions for herself. Tommy had told Nick that it wasn\u2019t as grim as it sounded and that by following the letter of the trust, the lawyers were, in fact, protecting the estate.</p><p>Laurant had been of age for some time now and had moved to Holy Oaks a year ago to be close to her brother. Nick had never met her, but he remembered the photos of her that Tommy had stuck up on the mirror. She\u2019d looked like a street urchin, a scruffy-looking kid wearing a pleated black skirt and a uniform white blouse that was partially hanging out of her waistband. One of her knee-high socks had fallen down around her ankle. She had scabby knees and curly long brown hair that drooped down over one of her eyes. Both he and Tommy had laughed when they saw the photo. Laurant couldn\u2019t have been more than seven or eight years old when the picture was taken, but what stuck in Nick\u2019s mind was the joy in her smile and the sparkle in her eyes, suggesting the nuns\u2019 chronic complaints about her were true. She did look like she had a bit of the devil in her and a zest for life that was going to get her into sure trouble one day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, a vacation was just what he needed, he decided. The key to all of his plans was getting back to his home base, Boston, and that meant he was going to have to get on the damned plane first. No one hated flying as much as Nick did. It scared the hell out of him, as a matter of fact. As soon as he entered the Cincinnati airport, he broke out in a cold sweat, and he knew his complexion was going to be green by the time he boarded the plane. The 777 was bound for London with a brief stop in Boston, where Nick would be getting off, thank God, and going home to his Beacon Hill town house. He\u2019d purchased the building from his uncle three years ago, but he still hadn\u2019t unpacked most of the cardboard boxes the movers had dropped into the center of his living room, or hooked up the high-tech audio system his youngest brother, Zachary, had insisted on picking out for him.</p><p>He could feel his stomach tightening as he headed for check-in. He knew the drill. He presented himself, his credentials, and his clearance to the security officer. The prissy, middle-aged man named Johnson nervously chewed on his pencil-thin upper lip until his computer gave him Nick\u2019s name and code verification. He then escorted Nick around the metal detector the other passengers would have to pass through, handed him his boarding pass, and waved him down the ramp.</p><p>Captain James T. Sorensky was waiting for him in the galley. Nick had flown with the captain at least six times in the past three years and knew the man was an excellent pilot and meticulous in his job\u2014Nick had run a background check on the captain just to make certain there wasn\u2019t anything suspicious in his past to suggest the possibility of a nervous breakdown while he was flying. He even knew the kind of toothpaste the man preferred, but none of those facts made his nervousness subside. Sorensky had graduated from the Air Force Academy at the top of his class and had worked for Delta for eighteen years. His record was unblemished, but that didn\u2019t matter either. Nick\u2019s stomach was still doing somersaults. He hated everything about flying. It all boiled down to a question of trust, he knew, and even though Sorensky wasn\u2019t a complete stranger\u2014they were on a first-name basis these days\u2014Nick still didn\u2019t like being forced to trust him to keep almost 159 tons of steel in the air.</p><p>Sorensky could have been a model for an airline poster with his silver-tipped, immaculately trimmed hair, his perfectly pressed navy blue uniform with razor-edge creases in the trousers, and his tall, lean physique. Nick wasn\u2019t overweight by any means, but he still felt like a bull moose next to him. The captain radiated confidence. He was also rigid about his own rules, which Nick appreciated. Though Nick had the government clearance and FAA approval to carry his loaded Sig Sauer on the plane, he knew it made Sorensky nervous\u2014and that was the last thing Nick wanted or needed. In preparation, Nick had already unloaded his gun. As the captain greeted him, he dropped the gun\u2019s magazine into his hand.</p> <p>\u201cGood to see you again, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling today, Jim?\u201d</p><p>Sorensky smiled. \u201cStill worried I\u2019ll have a heart attack while we\u2019re in the air?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged to cover his embarrassment. \u201cThe thought has crossed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it could, but I\u2019m not the only man on board who can fly this plane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make you feel any better, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you have to fly, you\u2019d think you\u2019d get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think I would, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your boss know you get sick every time you get on a plane?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure he does,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cHe\u2019s sadistic.\u201d</p><p>Sorensky laughed. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a real smooth ride today,\u201d he promised. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going on with us to London, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFly over an ocean? That\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d The thought made his stomach lurch. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to Europe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. When I can drive there, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>The captain glanced at the magazine he held in the palm of his hand. \u201cThanks for letting me hold on to this. I know I don\u2019t have the legal right to ask you to give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it makes you nervous to have a loaded weapon on board, and I don\u2019t want a nervous pilot flying this plane.\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to get past Sorensky so he could get settled in his seat, but the captain was in the mood to chat.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, about a month ago I read a real nice article in the newspaper about you saving that poor boy\u2019s life. It was interesting to read about your background and how you\u2019re best friends with that priest . . . how the two of you ended up taking different paths. Now you wear a badge and he wears a cross. And saving that child . . . it made me proud to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just doing my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe article also mentioned that unit you work with. What was it he called the twelve of you?\u201d Before Nick could answer, the captain remembered. \u201cOh, yes, the Apostles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t figured out how he managed to get that information. I didn\u2019t think anyone outside the department knew about the nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s fitting. You saved that little boy\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were lucky this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reporter said you refused to be interviewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a glory job, Jim. I did what I had to, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The agent\u2019s humility impressed the captain. With a nod, he said, \u201cYou did a fine thing. That little boy\u2019s back with his parents now, and that\u2019s all that counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, we were lucky this time.\u201d</p><p>Sorensky, sensing Nick\u2019s unease with his compliments, quickly changed the subject. \u201cThere\u2019s a U.S. Marshal Downing on board. He had to give me his weapon,\u201d he added with a grin. \u201cDo you happen to know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name\u2019s not familiar. He isn\u2019t transporting, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing on a commercial flight? They\u2019ve got their own carriers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an unusual situation according to Downing. He\u2019s taking a prisoner back to Boston to stand trial and he\u2019s in a hurry,\u201d he explained. \u201cDowning told me they got the boy cold for selling drugs and that it\u2019s an open-and-shut case. The prisoner isn\u2019t supposed to be violent. Downing thinks his lawyers will plea him out before the judge ever picks up his gavel. Like you, they preboarded. The marshal\u2019s from Texas. You can hear it in his voice, and he seems like a real nice fella. You ought to go introduce yourself to him.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cWhere are they seated?\u201d he asked with a quick glance into the main cabin of the mammoth plane.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see them from here. They\u2019re on the left side, back row. Downing has the boy shackled and handcuffed. I\u2019m telling you, Nick, his prisoner can\u2019t be much older than my son, Andy, and he\u2019s just fourteen. It\u2019s a crying shame, someone that young is going to spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCriminals are getting younger and dumber,\u201d Nick remarked. \u201cThanks for telling me. I will go say hello. Is the plane packed today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sorensky answered as he tucked the magazine into his pants pocket. \u201cWe\u2019re only half full until we land at Logan. Then we\u2019ll be packed.\u201d</p><p>After insisting that if Nick needed anything he was to let him know, Sorensky went back to the cockpit, where a man wearing the navy blue uniform and identification of the airline\u2019s ground crew was waiting with a clipboard full of curled papers. He followed the captain into the cockpit and closed the door behind him. Nick put his suit carrier in the overhead compartment, dropped his old, scarred, leather briefcase in his assigned seat, and then crossed over to the left side of the plane and started down the aisle toward the U.S. marshal. He was halfway there when he changed his mind. The other passengers were quickly filing on board now, and so he decided to wait until they were in the air and he\u2019d gotten his legs back before introducing himself to Downing. He did get a good look at him though, and the prisoner too, before he turned around. Downing had one leg stretched out into the aisle, and Nick could see the fancy scrollwork on his cowboy boot. Tall and wiry, the marshal was all cowboy with his weathered complexion, his thick brown mustache, and his black leather vest. Nick couldn\u2019t see his belt, but he would have bet a month\u2019s salary that Downing was sporting a big silver buckle.</p><p>Captain Sorensky had been on the mark in his evaluation of the prisoner. At first glance he did look like a kid. But there was a hardness Nick had seen countless times in the past. This one had been around the block more than once and had most likely killed his conscience a long time ago. Yeah, they were getting younger and dumber these days, Nick thought. The prisoner had been cursed with bad judgment and god-awful genes. His face was scarred with acne, and his marble cold eyes were so close together he looked cross-eyed. Someone had done a real hatchet job on his hair, no doubt on purpose. There were spikes sticking up all over his head, kind of like the Statue of Liberty, but then maybe he wanted to look that way. What did it matter what kind of punk haircut he had? Where he was going he would still have plenty of friends waiting in line for a chance to get to him.</p><p>Nick went back to the front of the plane and got settled in his seat. He was in first class today, and though the seat was wider, it still felt cramped. His legs were too long to properly stretch out. After shoving his briefcase under the seat in front of him, he leaned back, clipped his seat belt together, and partially closed his eyes. It would have been nice if he could have at least tried to get comfortable, but that was out of the question because he knew that if he took his suit jacket off, he\u2019d freak out the other passengers when they saw his holstered gun. They wouldn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t loaded, and Nick wasn\u2019t in the mood to calm anyone else down. Hell, he was hovering on the edge of a panic attack now, and he knew he\u2019d stay that way until the plane had taken off. He\u2019d be all right, sort of, anyway, until they began their descent into Logan Airport. Then the anxiety would start all over again. In his present, claustrophobic, neurotic state, he thought it was damned ironic that O\u2019Leary wanted him to join the crisis management team.</p><p>Mind over matter, he told himself, and in a panic or not, he was determined to catch up on his paperwork while he was in the air. He\u2019d already checked and knew that no one was going to be sitting in the window seat. Nick always took the aisle, even if it meant moving another passenger, so that he could see the face of every single person who came on board the plane. After takeoff he would be able to spread his folders out while he deciphered his notes and fed the information into his laptop.</p><p>Damn, he wished he weren\u2019t such a control freak. Morganstern had told him he\u2019d taught him relaxation techniques while he was on retreat with the other team members during their isolated training period, but Nick didn\u2019t have any memory of anything that had happened during those two weeks, and he knew the others didn\u2019t remember anything either. They had all agreed to Pete\u2019s terms. He had sat them down, explained what he wanted to do, but not how, and then asked them to trust him. Nick had the most difficult time making up his mind because it meant he would have to give up his control. In the end, he finally agreed. Pete had warned them they wouldn\u2019t remember, and he\u2019d been right about that. None of them did.</p><p>Sometimes a scent or a sound would trigger a thought about the retreat and he\u2019d tense in reaction, but just as suddenly as it came into his mind, it vanished. He knew he\u2019d been in a forest somewhere in the United States\u2014he had the scars to prove it. There was one the shape of a crescent moon on his left shoulder and a smaller scar directly above his right eye. He\u2019d left the retreat with cuts and abrasions on his hands and legs, and God only knows how many mosquito bites to prove he\u2019d been stomping through the wilderness. Did the other Apostles have scars? He didn\u2019t know, and he could never seem to hold on to the question in his mind long enough to ask.</p><p>Once during a private meeting Pete had brought up the topic of the retreat and Nick had asked him if he\u2019d been brainwashed. His boss had flinched at the word. \u201cGood Lord, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI simply tried to teach you how to maximize what God gave you.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Pete\u2019s mind games trained them to hone their naturally acute instincts, to focus or, like the army slogan said, to be all they could be.</p><p>The plane was moving. They taxied to the end of the runway and then stopped. Nick assumed they were waiting for their turn to get in line with the other planes for takeoff\u2014Cincinnati was a national hub and was always glutted with traffic\u2014but fifteen minutes passed, and they still weren\u2019t inching forward. When he leaned over the empty seat and looked out the window, he saw two planes taxiing at a hell of a fast clip in the opposite direction.</p><p>A young blond woman smiled at him from across the aisle and tried to engage him in conversation by asking him if he was a nervous flyer. His white-knuckle grip on the armrests had to have been a dead giveaway. He nodded in answer, then turned to look out the windowagain to discourage further chitchat. She wasn\u2019t bad-looking, and the spandex skirt and top she wore proved, without a doubt, that she had a fine body, but he didn\u2019t want to work at small talk, and he certainly wasn\u2019t in the mood to flirt. He must be more tired than he\u2019d thought. He was becoming more and more like Theo. These days his brother wasn\u2019t in the mood for anything but work.</p><p>Nick spotted the fire truck and two police cars racing toward the plane at the same time that Captain Sorensky\u2019s voice came over the intercom. It was strained with good cheer.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, there will be a slight delay while we wait our turn for takeoff. We should be in the air soon, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.\u201d</p><p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth than the door to the cockpit opened and Sorensky, oozing confidence with his smile, stepped out into the galley. He hesitated for the barest of seconds, his gaze fully directed on Nick, and then started down the aisle. Following on his heels was the young, pasty-faced airline crewman. The man was tailing the captain so closely he looked like he was holding on to the back of his jacket.</p><p>Nick slowly unfastened his seat belt.</p><p>\u201cCaptain, shouldn\u2019t you be flying this plane?\u201d the leggy blond asked, smiling.</p><p>Sorensky didn\u2019t look at the woman when he answered. \u201cI just want to check something in back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The captain\u2019s hands were fisted at his sides, but as he passed Nick\u2019s seat, his right hand unfolded and he dropped the gun\u2019s magazine into Nick\u2019s lap.</p><p>In one fluid motion, Nick sprang out of his seat, grabbed theyoung crewman\u2019s arm, and pinned it to the back of the headrest behind him. The element of surprise was on his side. The man didn\u2019t even have time to blink before his gun was snatched out of his hand and he was facedown on the floor with Nick\u2019s foot pressed against his neck. The magazine was back in the Sig Sauer and the gleaming barrel was pointed at the man before the captain had fully turned around.</p><p>It all happened so fast, the other passengers were too stunned to scream. Sorensky raised his hands and called out, \u201cEverything\u2019s okay, folks.\u201d Turning to Nick, he said, \u201cMan, do you move fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some practice,\u201d Nick replied as he reholstered his gun and then knelt down and began to go through the man\u2019s pockets.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019s the prisoner\u2019s cousin, and he was going to get him off this plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t put a whole lot of thought into the plan, did he?\u201d He flipped open the man\u2019s wallet and read the name on his Kentucky driver\u2019s license. \u201cWilliam Robert Hendricks.\u201d Nudging the man he asked, \u201cYour friends call you Billy Bob?\u201d</p><p>In response Billy Bob started squirming like a fish in a canoe and screaming at the top of his lungs for a lawyer. Nick ignored him and asked the captain to see if Marshal Downing happened to have an extra pair of cuffs he could borrow.</p><p>As the initial moment of shock wore off, the passengers began to react. A murmur went through the crowd, and like a snowball, gathered momentum as it rolled down the aisle. Captain Sorensky, sensing the panic that was spreading, took control. In a voice as smooth as good whiskey, he called out, \u201cSettle down, settle down. It\u2019s all over now. Everyone sit back down and relax. As soon as this law officer takes care of this little matter, we\u2019ll be on our way again. No one\u2019s been hurt.\u201d The captain then asked one of the attendants to please fetch Marshal Downing from the back row.</p><p>The marshal, with prisoner in tow, strode down the aisle and handed Nick a pair of handcuffs. After Nick had snapped the cuffs in place behind the prisoner\u2019s back, he hauled him to his feet. He noticed that Marshal Downing was shaking his head and frowning.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d Downing muttered in a slow Texas drawl.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Captain Sorensky asked.</p><p>\u201cMore damned paperwork.\u201d</p><p>After stopping by his Boston office to drop off a couple of folders, tie up some loose ends, and take a little ribbing about the possibility that he had only squelched the hijacking to delay having to fly\u2014everyone in the department seemed to think his fear of flying was hilarious\u2014Nick finally headed home. Traffic was a bitch, but then it always was. He was tempted to head his \u201984 Porsche toward the highway and open her up just to see how the reconditioned motor would manage but decided against it. He was too tired. Instead, he maneuvered her through the familiar side streets. She handled like a dream. What did he care if his sisters, Jordan and Sidney, had nicknamed her \u201cCompensation,\u201d implying that a man who drove such a sexy sports car was merely compensating for what was lacking in his love life.</p><p>He pulled into the basement garage of his brick town house, hit the remote control to close the door, and felt his entire body begin to relax. He was finally home. He climbed the steps to the main floor, dumped his Hartmann bag in the back hallway outside the laundry room door\u2014his housekeeper, Rosie, had trained him well\u2014and had his suit jacket and tie off before he reached the newly remodeled kitchen. He dropped his briefcase and his sunglasses on the shiny brown granite island, grabbed a beer from the Sub-Zero refrigerator that always made a weird sucking sound whenever he closed the door, and headed for his sanctuary, dodging the pyramid of unpacked boxes Rosie had stacked in the center of his living room with hostile notes Scotch taped to them.</p> <p>The library was his favorite room in the house and the only one he\u2019d bothered to furnish since he\u2019d lived there. It was located in the back on the first floor. When he opened the door, the scent of lemon furniture polish, leather, and musty old books wafted about him, the scent not unpleasant. The room was large and spacious, yet still felt warm and cozy on harsh winter nights when a blizzard was raging outside his windows and there was a fire blazing in the hearth. The walls were a dark walnut that stretched twelve feet up to the ornately carved eighteenth-century moldings bracketing the ceiling. Two of the four walls bore shelves slightly bowed from the weight of the heavy texts. A ladder rolled back and forth along a brass pole across the bookcase so the volumes on the top shelves could be easily reached. His mahogany desk, a gift from his uncle, faced the fireplace, the mantel a clutter of photos his mother and his sisters had placed there after he\u2019d moved in. Double French doors with a Palladian arch above them were straight ahead. When he pulled the draperies back and opened the doors to the walled garden with the old cherub fountain and paver-brick patio, that had been laid down God only knows how long ago, sunlight and scent filled the library. In the spring it was lilac first, then honeysuckle, but now the heavy smell of heliotrope was prominent.</p><p>He stood there surveying his peaceful haven for several minutes until the heat began to press in on him and he heard the central air conditioner kick on. He closed the doors, yawned loudly, and took a long swallow of his beer. Then he removed his gun, took the magazine out, and put it all inside his wall safe. He sat down at his desk in his soft leather swivel chair, rolled up his sleeves, and flipped on his computer. The tension in his shoulders was easing, but he let out a loud groan when he saw the number of E-mails waiting for him. There were also twenty-eight logged calls on his answering machine as well. With a sigh, he kicked off his shoes, leaned back in his chair, and began scrolling through his E-mail while he listened to his phone messages.</p><p>Five of the calls were from his brother Zachary, the youngest in the family, who desperately wanted to borrow the Porsche for the Fourth of July weekend and vehemently promised to take good care of the car. The seventh message was from his mother, who was just as vehement when she told him that Zachary was not to be given the Porsche under any circumstances. His brainy sister Jordan also called to tell him that their stock had just hit $150 per share, which meant that Nick could retire now and live the high life had he been so inclined. Thinking about it made him smile. His father, with his work ethic, would have heart failure if any of his children weren\u2019t productive. According to the judge, their purpose in life was to make the world a little better. Some days Nick was sure he was going to die trying.</p><p>The twenty-fourth message stopped him cold.</p><p>\u201cNick, it\u2019s me, Tommy. I\u2019m in real trouble, Cutter. It\u2019s five-thirty my time, Saturday. Call me as soon as you get this message. I\u2019m in Kansas City at Our Lady of Mercy rectory. You know where it is. I\u2019m going to call Morganstern too. Maybe he can get hold of you. The police are here now, but they don\u2019t know what to do, and no one can find Laurant. Look, I know I\u2019m rambling. Just call, no matter what time.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Someone killed Daddy, and Bessie Jean Vanderman meant to find out who the culprit was. Everyone said it was old age and not poison that had done him in, but Bessie Jean knew better. Daddy was as fine as could be until he just up and keeled over. It was poison all right, and she was going to prove it.</p><p>One way or another, she would get justice. She owed it to Daddy to ferret out the criminal and have him arrested. There had to be proof somewhere, maybe even in her own front yard, where she kept Daddy chained on sunny days so he could take in some fresh air. If there was any evidence around, by God, she\u2019d find it. The investigation was on her shoulders and hers alone. Sister had cut short her vacation in Des Moines and had made her cousin drive her home when she heard the news. She was trying to help, but she wasn\u2019t much use, not with her bad eyesight and her vanity making it impossible for her to put on the tortoiseshell bifocals Bessie Jean now regretted she\u2019d ever told her made her look plumb bug-eyed. Certainly no one else was going to help look for evidence of foul play because no one else cared a hoot, not even that no-good Sheriff Lloyd MacGovern. He hadn\u2019t liked Daddy much, not since he\u2019d gotten away from her and taken a bite out of Sheriff Lloyd\u2019s ample ass. But, even so, you\u2019d think he would have had the decency to stop by her house and offer his condolences on Daddy\u2019s passing when there she and Sister were, sitting just one short block away from the town square where his office was located. Shame on him, Bessie Jean told Sister. It didn\u2019t matter if he liked Daddy or not, he should still do his duty and find out who murdered him.</p> <p>Not everyone in Holy Oaks was being callous, Sister reminded her. Others living in the valley were being very thoughtful and sensitive. They knew how much Daddy meant to Bessie Jean. That uppity next door neighbor of theirs with her fancy French name, Laurant, had turned out to be the most thoughtful and sensitive of all. Why, what would they have done if she hadn\u2019t heard Bessie Jean wailing and come running lickety-split to help? Bessie Jean had been down on her knees, leaning over poor dead Daddy, and Laurant had helped her to her feet and put her and Sister in her car, then had run back, unchained Daddy and scooped him up in her arms, real gentlelike, and put him in the trunk. Daddy was already stiff and as cold as a stone, but Laurant still had sped all the way to Doctor Basham\u2019s offices and had run Daddy inside as quick as she could on the hope that maybe the doctor could perform a miracle.</p><p>Since there weren\u2019t any miracles being dispensed that dark day, the doctor had put Daddy in the freezer to await the autopsy Bessie Jean insisted on. Then Laurant had driven her and Sister over to Doctor Sweeney\u2019s office to get their blood pressure checked because Bessie Jean was still terribly distraught, and Sister was feeling light-headed.</p><p>Laurant turned out not to be so uppity after all. In all her eighty-two years, Bessie Jean wasn\u2019t one to ever change her mind after she\u2019d made it up, but in this instance she did just that. After she\u2019d gotten past her initial shock and hysterics over losing Daddy, she realized what a kind-hearted soul Laurant was. She was still a foreigner, of course. She came to Holy Oaks from that city of sin and debauchery, Chicago, but that was all right. The city hadn\u2019t rubbed off on her. She was still a good girl. The nuns who had raised her at that fancy boarding school in Switzerland had instilled strong values. Bessie Jean, as rigid and set in her ways as she liked to think she was, decided that she could stand to have one or two foreigners for friends. She surely could.</p><p>Sister suggested they stop mourning Daddy\u2019s passing long enough to bake a tart apple pie for Laurant\u2014it was the neighborly thing to do\u2014but Bessie Jean chided her for having such a poor memory and forgetting that the Winston twins were looking after Laurant\u2019s corner drugstore while she drove all the way down to Kansas City. She\u2019d said she wanted to surprise her brother, that good-looking priest with such nice thick hair that the young girls at Holy Oaks College were always drooling over. They would have to wait until Monday to bake because that was the day Laurant was expected home.</p><p>Once both sisters had decided that Laurant was no longer an outsider, they naturally felt it was their business to interfere in her life whenever possible and to worry about her, just like they would if they had married and had had daughters of their own. Bessie Jean hoped Laurant remembered to lock her car doors. She was young, and in their estimation, that meant she was also naive, whereas they were older and wiser and knew all about the sorry ways of the world. Granted, neither one of them had been any farther away from Holy Oaks than Des Moines to visit their cousins, Ida and James Perkins, but that didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t know all about the terrible things happening today. They weren\u2019t ignorant. They read the papers and knew there were serial killers out there waiting at all the rest stops to prey on beautiful young women who were foolish enough to stop, or who had unfortunate car troubles that put them in harm\u2019s way. As lovely as Laurant was, she would certainly catch any man\u2019s eye. Why, just look at all the high school boys hanging around that store that wasn\u2019t even open yet in hopes she\u2019d come outside to have a word with them. Still, Bessie Jean reminded Sister, Laurant was every bit as smart as she was pretty.</p><p>Having made the decision not to fret about Laurant any longer, Bessie Jean sat down at the dining room table and opened the wooden stationery box her mama had given her when she was a young girl. She took out a sheet of pink, rose-scented paper embossed with her very own initials, and reached for her pen. Since Sheriff Lloyd wasn\u2019t going to do anything about Daddy\u2019s murder, Bessie Jean was taking matters into her own hands. She\u2019d already written one letter to the FBI requesting that they send a man to Holy Oaks to investigate, but her first letter must have gotten lost in the mail because a full eight days had passed and she still hadn\u2019t heard a word from anyone. She was going to make certain this letter didn\u2019t get lost. This time she was going to address her request to the director himself, and as expensive as it was, she was going to spend the extra money to send it by certified mail.</p><p>Sister got busy cleaning house. After all, company was coming. Any day now, the FBI would be knocking on their door.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>The wait was making her nuts. When it came to her brother\u2019s health, Laurant found it impossible to be patient, and sitting by the phone waiting for him to call her with the results of the blood tests required more stamina than she possessed. Tommy always called her on Friday evening between seven and nine, but he didn\u2019t call this time, and the longer she waited, the more worried she became.</p><p>By Saturday afternoon she had convinced herself the news wasn\u2019t good, and when Tommy still hadn\u2019t called her by six that night, she got into her car and headed out. She knew her brother was going to be upset with her because she was following him to Kansas City, but while she was headed toward Des Moines, she came up with a good lie to tell him. Her background was art history, she would remind him, and the lure of the Degas exhibit on temporary loan to the Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City was simply too appealing to resist. There had been a mention of the exhibit in the Holy Oaks Gazette, and she knew Tommy had read it. Granted, she had already seen the exhibit in Chicago, several times as a matter of fact, when she had worked at the art gallery there, but maybe Tommy wouldn\u2019t remember that. Besides, there wasn\u2019t a rule that you could see Degas\u2019s wonderful ballerinas only once, was there? No, of course not.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell Tommy the truth, even though they both knew what that was, that she became consumed with panic every three months when he checked into the medical center for tests. She was terrified that the results weren\u2019t going to be satisfactory this time and that the cancer, like a hibernating bear, was waking up again. Damn it, Tommy always had the results of his preliminary blood tests by Friday evening. Why hadn\u2019t he called her? Not knowing was making her an emotional wreck. She was so scared inside she was sick. Before she had left Holy Oaks, she had called the rectory and had spoken to Monsignor McKindry, uncaring that she was acting like a neurotic mother hen. The monsignor had a kind, gentle voice, but his news wasn\u2019t good. Tommy, he\u2019d explained, was back at the hospital. And no, he\u2019d told her, the doctors hadn\u2019t been happy with the preliminary tests. Laurant was sure she knew what that meant. Her brother was undergoing another brutal round of chemotherapy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damned if she\u2019d let him go through that ordeal without family by his side this time. Family . . . he was the only family she had. After their parents\u2019 deaths, she and her brother, children at the time, had been forced to grow up on opposite sides of the ocean. So much had been lost over the years. But things were different now. They were adults. They could make their own choices, and that meant they could be there for each other when times got rough.</p><p>The alternator light went on just outside the town of Haverton. The filling station was closed, and she ended up spending the night at a no-frills motel there. Before leaving the next morning, she stopped by the motel office and picked up a map of Kansas City. The clerk gave her directions to the Fairmont which, he informed her, was close to the art museum.</p><p>She still got lost. She missed her exit off of I-435 and ended up too far south on the highway that circled the sprawling city. Clutching the soggy map she\u2019d accidentally spilled Diet Coke all over, she stopped at a gas station for more directions.</p><p>Once she got her bearings, getting to the hotel wasn\u2019t difficult at all. She followed the street marked State Line and headed back north.</p> <p>Tommy had told her that Kansas City was pretty and clean, but his descriptions didn\u2019t do the city justice. It was really quite lovely. The streets were lined with well-manicured lawns and old, two-story houses with flowers in bloom everywhere. Following the gas station attendant\u2019s instructions, she cut over to Ward Parkway, the street that he had promised would take her directly to the Fairmont\u2019s front door. The parkway was divided by wide grassy medians, and twice she passed groups of teenagers playing football and soccer there. The kids didn\u2019t seem to mind the oppressive heat or the stifling humidity.</p><p>The street curved down a gentle slope, and just as she began to worry she\u2019d gone too far, she saw a cluster of pretty Spanish-style shops up ahead. She guessed that this was the area the motel clerk had called the Country Club Plaza and she felt a sense of relief. A couple of blocks farther and there on the right was the Fairmont.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite noon yet, but the hotel clerk was gracious about her wilted condition and let her check into a room early. An hour later she was feeling human again. She\u2019d been driving since early that morning, but a long, cold shower revitalized her. Even though she knew Tommy wouldn\u2019t mind if she showed up at the rectory wearing jeans or shorts, she\u2019d brought along \u201cchurch\u201d clothes. It was Sunday, and noon mass would probably just be getting out when she arrived. She didn\u2019t want to offend Monsignor McKindry, who, Tommy had told her, was extremely conservative. He\u2019d joked that if the monsignor could get away with it, he\u2019d still be saying mass in Latin.</p><p>She put on a pale pink, ankle-length, linen, sleeveless dress with a high mandarin collar. The skirt had a slit up the left side, which she hoped Monsignor wouldn\u2019t think was too racy. Her long hair was still damp at the nape, but she didn\u2019t want to mess with it any longer, and after she fastened the dainty straps on her sandals, she grabbed her purse and sunglasses and went back downstairs.</p><p>The heat felt like a slap in the face as she stepped outside, and she couldn\u2019t quite catch her breath for several seconds. The poor doorman, an elderly man with salt-and-pepper hair, looked in jeopardy of melting, dressed as he was in his heavy gray uniform. As soon as the valet brought her car around the circle, the doorman stepped forward with a wide smile to open the door for her. But the smile vanished when she rechecked her directions to Our Lady of Mercy church.</p> <p>\u201cMiss, there are churches much closer to the hotel,\u201d he informed her. \u201cWhy, there\u2019s one just a couple of blocks away on Main Street called Visitation. If it weren\u2019t so hot, you could even walk there. It\u2019s a beautiful old church and it\u2019s in a safe neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go to Our Lady of Mercy,\u201d she explained.</p><p>She could tell he wanted to argue with her, but he held his tongue. As she was getting into her car, he leaned forward and suggested that she lock her doors and not stop for any reason until she had reached the church\u2019s parking lot.</p><p>The area she drove into half an hour later was run-down and depressing. Abandoned buildings with broken windowpanes and boarded-up doorways lined the streets. Black graffiti on the walls screamed angry words at passersby. Laurant drove past a fenced-in, empty lot that some of the locals were using as a trash bin, and even with her windows up and the air-conditioning blasting away, she could still smell the stench of rotting meat. At the corner of the block were four little girls, about six or seven years old, dressed in their Sunday best. They were playing jump rope as they chanted a silly rhyme, giggling and carrying on like little girls do, oblivious to the destruction around them. In such decay, their innocence and beauty were jarring. The girls brought to mind a painting she had once seen during her studies in Paris. It was of a dirty brown field, fenced with black barbed wire, ugly and menacing with its sharp points. An angry gray sky swirled above. The mood was dark and bitter, yet in the left corner of the painting, entwined in the gnarled metal, a straggly yellow vine wound halfway to the top of the wire. And there, reaching toward heaven, was one perfect red rose just about to bloom. The painting was called Hope, and as Laurant watched the children at play, she was reminded of the artist\u2019s message\u2014that life will go on, and even in such blight, hope can and will flourish. Laurant committed to memory the scene of the little girls playing, hoping one day, when she had her paints, to capture them on canvas.</p><p>One of the little girls stuck her tongue out at Laurant and then waved to her. Laurant retaliated in kind and smiled as the child dissolved into a fit of giggles.</p><p>Four blocks ahead, in the midst of the rubble, sat Our Lady of Mercy Church. Twin pillars, painted white, stood as sentinels guarding the neighborhood. Mercy looked worn out from her duty. She was in desperate need of repair. Cracked paint peeled at the top of the pillars and the side of the church, and warped, rotting boards curled along the foundation. Laurant wondered how old the church was and pictured her all spruced up again. From the ornate carvings along the roofline and the stonework in front, Laurant knew she had once been magnificent. She could be again, with a little care and money. But would Mercy ever be renovated to her former glory, or, as was the horrid fashion these days, would she be ignored until it was too late and then torn down?</p> <p>A black wrought iron fence at least eight feet high surrounded the property on all sides. Inside the barrier was a large recently tarred parking lot and a whitewashed, stone house adjacent to the church. Laurant assumed this was the rectory and drove through the open gates, parking her car next to a black sedan.</p><p>She had just gotten out and was locking the door when she noticed the police car. It was parked in the rectory\u2019s driveway but was practically obstructed from view by the leafy branches of an old sycamore. Why were the police there? Probably more vandalism, she guessed, as Tommy had told her that the problems in the neighborhood had escalated in the last month. He thought it was due to the fact that the kids were out of school and there weren\u2019t any jobs or organized activities to keep them occupied, but Monsignor McKindry believed that the increased violence and desecration was gang related.</p><p>Laurant headed for the church. The doors were open, and she could hear organ music and voices raised in song. She was halfway across the parking lot when the music stopped. Seconds later people came pouring out. Some of the women were using the church bulletin to fan themselves, and several men were mopping the sweat from their brows with their handkerchiefs. Then Monsignor McKindry, looking as cool as a cucumber despite being dressed in long flowing robes, joined the crowd. Laurant had never met the monsignor, but she recognized him all the same from Tommy\u2019s description. The priest had shocking white hair and deep creases in his face. He was tall, and so thin as to appear sick. But, according to her brother, Monsignor ate like a lineman and was in the best of health, considering his advanced age.</p><p>His congregation obviously loved him. He had a smile and a kind word for every man and woman who stopped to speak to him, and he called each of them by his or her first name\u2014impressive considering the number. The children adored him too. They surrounded him, tugging on his robes to get his undivided attention.</p><p>Laurant moved to the side of the steps in the shade of the building, waiting for Monsignor to finish his duties. Hopefully, after he had changed out of his vestments, he would walk over to the rectory with her while she questioned him in private about Tommy. Her brother tried to shield her from unpleasant news, so much so that she had learned not to trust him when he told her anything about his medical condition. From what Tommy had told her about Monsignor, she knew that, although the older priest was kind and compassionate, he was also honest to a fault. It was her hope that he wouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the truth if Tommy were no longer in remission.</p><p>Her brother worried about her worrying about him. It was ridiculous, the games they played. Because he was older and because there were just the two of them in the family now, Tommy tried to shoulder too much on his own. Admittedly, she had needed his guidance when she was a little girl, but she wasn\u2019t a little girl anymore, and Tommy needed to stop shielding her.</p><p>She happened to glance over at the rectory just as the front door opened and a policeman with a rather noticeable potbelly came out on the porch. He was followed by a taller, younger man. She watched as the two shook hands and the policeman headed for his car.</p><p>The stranger on the porch captured her full attention, and she blatantly stared at him. Impeccably dressed in a tailored white shirt, navy blue blazer, and khaki pants, he looked like he had just stepped off the cover of GQ. Yet he wasn\u2019t what she would call drop-dead gorgeous, or even handsome, at least not in the usual sense, and perhaps that was what appealed to her. She\u2019d done a little bit of modeling for an Italian designer during her summer break from boarding school, before Tommy had found out and put a stop to it, but in those two and a half months she had worked with a fair number of pretty males. The man on the porch could never be called pretty. He was too rugged and earthy for such a label. And very, very sexy.</p> <p>There was an aura of authority about him, as if he were used to getting his way. She stared at the sharp angle of his jaw, the hard line of his mouth. He could be dangerous, she thought, yet she couldn\u2019t define what it was about him that made her feel that way.</p><p>The stranger had an interesting face and a complexion that was unfashionably tanned. Interesting indeed.</p><p>One of Mother Superior\u2019s constant warnings rang like an alarm bell inside her head. Beware of wolves wearing sheep\u2019s clothing. They\u2019ll steal your virtue every time.</p><p>This man didn\u2019t look like he ever had to steal anything. She imagined women flocked to him and that he took only what was freely offered. He was something else all right. She let out a little sigh then, feeling guilty about having such thoughts just a few feet away from the holy church. Mother Mary Madelyne was probably right about her. She was going to go to hell in a handbag if she didn\u2019t learn to control her sinful imagination.</p><p>The stranger must have sensed her staring at him because he suddenly turned and looked directly at her. Embarrassed at being caught in the act of gawking at him, she was about to turn away when the front door opened, and Tommy came outside. Laurant was overjoyed to see him there, and not in a hospital bed as she had feared.</p><p>Dressed in his long black cassock and white Roman collar, he looked pale to her\u2014and worried. She started weaving her way through the crowd.</p><p>Tommy and the stranger he was talking to presented a striking picture. Both were tall and dark-haired, but Tommy bore the Irish complexion with his ruddy cheeks and generous sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of his nose. Unlike her, when he accidentally stayed out in the sun too long, he didn\u2019t tan; he burned. He had an adorable dimple\u2014at least she thought it was adorable\u2014in his right cheek, and his boyish good looks had earned him the amusing nickname \u201cFather What-a-Waste\u201d from all the college and high school girls.</p><p>There certainly wasn\u2019t anything boyish about the man standing next to her brother. He kept watching her make her way toward the porch as he listened to Tommy and occasionally nodded agreement.</p><p>He finally interrupted her brother when he tilted his head toward her. Tommy turned, spotted her, and shouted her name. Taking the stairs two at a time, his black robe flapping about his ankles, he raced to intercept her with a look of acute relief on his face.</p><p>Laurant noticed that his friend stayed on the porch, but he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to them now. He was thoroughly occupied watching the crowd disperse around them.</p><p>She was astonished by her brother\u2019s reaction to seeing her. She\u2019d thought he\u2019d be mad, or irritated at the very least, but he wasn\u2019t upset at all. In fact, he acted as though they\u2019d been separated for years, even though she had seen him only a few days ago when he\u2019d taken her on a tour of the abbey\u2019s attic.</p><p>Tommy engulfed her in a bear hug. \u201cThank God you\u2019re all right. I\u2019ve been worried sick about you, Laurant. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming? I\u2019m so happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook with emotion. Thoroughly confused by his behavior, she pulled away and said, \u201cYou\u2019re happy to see me? I thought you\u2019d be furious that I followed you. Tommy, why didn\u2019t you call me Friday evening? You promised you would.\u201d</p><p>He finally let go of her. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been worried, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She looked into his big brown eyes and decided to tell him the truth after all. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been worried. You were supposed to call when you had the results of the blood work, but you didn\u2019t call and I thought . . . maybe the results weren\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lab screwed up. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t call. They had to redo the tests. I should have called, but damn it, Laurant, you should have let me know you were coming. I\u2019ve got Sheriff Lloyd looking all over Holy Oaks for you. Come on inside. I\u2019ve got to call him and tell him you\u2019re here, safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called Sheriff Lloyd looking for me? Why?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed hold of her arm and pulled her along. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything as soon as I get you inside. It\u2019s safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafer? Tommy, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019ve never seen you so rattled. And who is that man standing on the porch?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised her brother. \u201cYou\u2019ve never met him, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked, her frustration mounting.</p><p>\u201cNick. That\u2019s Nick Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>She stopped dead in her tracks and turned to her brother. \u201cYou\u2019re sick again, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s why he\u2019s here . . . like the last time when you got so bad and you didn\u2019t tell me until\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not sick again.\u201d She didn\u2019t look like she believed him, and so he tried once again to convince her. \u201cI promised you I would tell you when and if I had to have chemo again. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her fear ebbing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call you Friday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was inconsiderate. I should have let you know the tests got screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have to have chemo again, why is Nick here?\u201d she asked with a glance toward the porch.</p> <p>\u201cI sent for him, but the reason had nothing to do with my health.\u201d He rushed on before she could interrupt him. \u201cCome on, Laurant. It\u2019s about time you met him.\u201d</p><p>With a smile she said, \u201cThe infamous Nick Buchanan. You didn\u2019t tell me he was so . . .\u201d She stopped herself in time. She had always felt she could tell her brother just about anything, but it didn\u2019t seem appropriate now for her to admit that she thought his best friend was incredibly sexy. It was double jeopardy, she supposed, having an older brother who also happened to be a priest. There was no way he would understand or appreciate his sister having such ideas.</p><p>Nick and Tommy were more like brothers than friends. They met during a fistfight on the playground of St. Matthew\u2019s Elementary School when they were in second grade. They bloodied each other\u2019s noses and from that day on became each other\u2019s shadow. By an odd set of circumstances, Tommy ended up living with the Buchanan family of eight children most of his grade school and high school years, and then he and Nick went to Penn State University together.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so what?\u201d Tommy asked as he pulled her along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNick\u2019s so what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall,\u201d she said, finally remembering what they were talking about.</p><p>\u201cI never sent you any photos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, casting her brother a frown for the oversight. Suddenly nervous, she took a deep breath, smoothed her skirt, and went up the stairs to meet him.</p><p>Lordy, lordy, he had blue eyes. Brilliant blue eyes that didn\u2019t miss a trick, she thought as Tommy made the hasty introductions. She put her hand out to shake his, but he wouldn\u2019t let her be formal. He pushed her hand away, pulled her into his arms, and hugged her. It was a brotherly embrace, and when she stepped back, he continued to hold on to her while he looked her over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy to finally meet you. I\u2019ve heard so much about you over the years,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t met before now,\u201d he replied. \u201cI saw all the pictures of you when you were a kid. Tommy had them up on the wall of our dorm room, but that was years ago, and damn, Laurant, you sure have changed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI hope I have. The sisters at the boarding school were thoughtful enough to send photos to my brother, but he, on the other hand, never sent me any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t own a camera,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>\u201cYou could have borrowed one. You were too lazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t think about things like that,\u201d he argued. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t. Nick, we should get her inside, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Tommy held the screen door open and rudely shoved Laurant inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat, in heaven\u2019s name, is the matter with you?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain in a minute,\u201d he promised.</p><p>The foyer was dark and musty. Her brother rushed ahead and led the way into the kitchen at the back of the two-story house. There was a breakfast nook with a bay window overlooking Monsignor\u2019s vegetable garden, which took up most of the fenced-in backyard. An old rectangular oak table, one leg propped up with a coaster so it wouldn\u2019t wobble, and four spindle chairs sat in front of the three windows. The room had been recently painted a bright, cheerful yellow, but the blinds were torn and brown along the edges. They needed to be replaced, but she knew money was a precious commodity at Mercy.</p><p>Laurant stood in the center of the kitchen, watching her brother. He was acting like a nervous twit, pulling all the blinds down to the windowsills. Sunlight filtered into the kitchen through the cracks and tears, filling the room with soft light.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d she whispered to Nick.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll explain in a minute,\u201d he promised, repeating Tommy\u2019s exact words to her.</p><p>In other words, be patient, she thought.</p><p>Nick pulled a chair out for her and took the seat adjacent to her. Tommy couldn\u2019t seem to get settled. He sat down, then immediately jumped back up to get a notebook and pen from the linoleum counter. He was as jittery as a june bug.</p><p>Then Nick drew her attention when he stood up. His demeanor was just as serious as her brother\u2019s. She watched him loosen his tie and unbutton the top button of his shirt. The man oozed sensuality, she thought to herself. Was there a woman back in Boston waiting for him to come home? She knew he wasn\u2019t married, but he could be involved with someone. Surely he was.</p><p>Then Nick removed his jacket, and Laurant\u2019s fantasies came to a screeching halt.</p><p>As Nick draped the coat over the back of the empty chair next to him he watched the abrupt change in Laurant. Her back was now pressed against the chair as though she were trying to put as much distance between them as possible. He also noticed she was staring at his gun. Just a few seconds ago, she had been open and friendly, bordering on flirtatious. Now she looked guarded and uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cThe gun bother you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him a direct answer. \u201cI thought you were an investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you wear a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes with the job,\u201d Tommy answered for his friend. He was shuffling through his papers, his head downcast while he tried to get organized.</p><p>Laurant\u2019s patience had run out. \u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough, Tommy. I want to know why you\u2019re acting so strange. I\u2019ve never seen you this nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of difficult to know where to start.\u201d Looking past her, he said the last to Nick, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think I know what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did get your lab results, didn\u2019t you? And you\u2019re afraid to tell me about them. Did you think I\u2019d make a scene, and that\u2019s why you waited? They weren\u2019t good, were they?\u201d</p><p>He let out a weary sigh. \u201cI got the results last night as a matter of fact. I was going to tell you later . . . after I explained what happened yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Cowan felt real bad that the lab had screwed up the first time and so he made them rush the second blood work. He called from a wedding reception to let me know he finally got the results and everything\u2019s fine. Now will you relax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s definitely no chemo this time?\u201d Her voice sounded like that of a child, and she had so wanted to be adult about this. If anything happened to her brother, she didn\u2019t know what she would do. It seemed to her that she had only just found him and now this horrible illness was trying to take him away from her. \u201cIf everything\u2019s going so well, then why are you so nervous? And you are nervous, Tommy. Don\u2019t tell me you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you ought to just let her listen to the tape,\u201d Nick suggested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to hear it yet. It\u2019ll be too much of a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let her read the transcript the police made.\u201d</p><p>Tommy shook his head. \u201cI think it would be better if I just told her what happened first.\u201d He took a deep breath, then plunged in. \u201cLaurant, this man came into the confessional just as I was about to close up.\u201d He paused for a few seconds while he collected his thoughts and then began again. \u201cAfter I talked to the police, I made some notes, and while I was writing down what he said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in disbelief, and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from interrupting him. \u201cYou wrote down a man\u2019s confession? You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s against the rules, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand to stop her. \u201cI know what the rules are. I\u2019m a priest, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to snap at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLook, I\u2019m just edgy and I\u2019ve got a hell of a headache, that\u2019s all. This guy . . . all the while he was talking to me, he was making a tape.\u201d</p><p>She was astonished. \u201cHe recorded the conversation? Why would anyone want to tape his own confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably wanted a keepsake,\u201d Nick suggested.</p><p>Tommy nodded. \u201cSo anyway, he must have gone right out and made a copy of the tape. We know it isn\u2019t the original because of the whirling sound in the background,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe dropped the copy off at the police station. Can you believe it, Laurant? He just sauntered inside and left it on a desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would anyone go to so much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to make sure I could talk about it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of a sick game he\u2019s playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on the tape?\u201d She waited for him to answer, and when he hesitated, she demanded, \u201cTommy, just spit it out for heaven\u2019s sake. It can\u2019t be as bad as you\u2019re making it sound. What did the man say that was so upsetting?\u201d</p><p>Her brother pulled his chair closer to hers before he sat down again. Taking both of her hands in his, he said, \u201cThis man told me he\u2019s planning . . . he wants . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Laurant didn\u2019t believe him, not at first anyway. Tommy recounted what the man had said to him in the confessional. She didn\u2019t interrupt, but with each new detail she could feel her body stiffen. For a second or two, she was actually relieved that she was the target and not her brother. Tommy had enough to deal with now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this awfully well.\u201d</p><p>Her brother had made the remark in an almost accusatory tone of voice. Both he and Nick were waiting for her to absorb the information, watching her intently as though she were a butterfly trapped under a glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to think,\u201d she responded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s true . . . what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to take the threat seriously,\u201d Nick cautioned.</p><p>\u201cThis other woman he talked about . . . Millie. He told you he killed her a year ago?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe bragged about it.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran through her. \u201cBut was her body ever found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he buried her deep, where no one will find her,\u201d Tommy answered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re running the name through VICAP,\u201d Nick interjected. \u201cTheir computer system stores information on unsolved homicides that have been reported. It looks for possible matches. Maybe we\u2019ll get a lucky break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe what he told me. I think he did kill that poor woman. He wasn\u2019t making it up, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI ended it when he told me you were his next victim. I jumped up and ran out.\u201d He paused to shake his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I thought I was going to do. I was pretty shook up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t see him? He had already gone? How could anyone move that fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hadn\u2019t left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cold-cocked him,\u201d Nick told her.</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d she asked, unfamiliar with the term.</p><p>\u201cHe knocked me out,\u201d Tommy explained. \u201cHe was waiting for me and he got me from behind. I don\u2019t know what he used, but I\u2019m lucky he didn\u2019t crush my skull. I went down hard,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the next thing I knew, Monsignor was leaning over me. He thought I\u2019d passed out from the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, you could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken worse hits playing football.\u201d</p><p>Laurant made Tommy show her where he\u2019d been struck. When she touched the lump at the base of his skull, he winced. \u201cIt still stings,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should let a doctor look at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right, but damn, I wish I had seen his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to listen to the tape. Did you recognize the voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mostly whispered.\u201d</p><p>Tommy was frightened. She could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice when he next spoke.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to you, Laurant. We\u2019re going to make sure you stay safe,\u201d he fervently promised with a nod toward Nick.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a long while but simply stared at the dripping faucet in the sink across the room. Her head was reeling.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be blas\u00e9 about this,\u201d Tommy warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so calm?\u201d</p><p>She put her elbows on the table, bowed her head, and pressed her fingertips against her temples. Calm? She knew she was an expert at hiding her emotions\u2014she\u2019d done it for years\u2014but she was surprised her brother couldn\u2019t see how shaken she was. She felt like a grenade had just gone off in her head. Her quiet, peaceful world had just been blown apart. She was anything but calm.</p><p>\u201cTommy, what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you can\u2019t do. You can\u2019t take any chances, Laurant, not until this is over and they\u2019ve caught him. You can\u2019t stay in Holy Oaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I leave? My best friend is getting married, and I\u2019m her maid of honor. I\u2019m not going to miss that. And you know my store is set to open in two weeks, and it still isn\u2019t ready. Then, there\u2019s the public hearing coming up about the town square. People are depending on me. I can\u2019t just pack up and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would only be temporary, until they catch him.\u201d</p><p>She shoved the chair back and stood. She couldn\u2019t sit there another second.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Tommy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a cup of hot tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea? It\u2019s ninety-eight degrees in the shade, and you want hot tea?\u201d She scowled at him and he backed down. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll show you where everything is.\u201d</p><p>They watched her fill the teakettle with water and put it on the burner. After she\u2019d gotten a tea bag out of the canister and put it in the cup, she leaned her hip against the counter and turned back to her brother. \u201cI have to think about this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to think about. You\u2019ve got to leave. You don\u2019t have a choice in this, Laurant. I won\u2019t have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nick quietly interrupted, \u201cTommy, you ought to call Sheriff Lloyd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d He\u2019d forgotten about the sheriff until Nick reminded him. \u201cAnd maybe while I\u2019m gone, you can talk some sense into her,\u201d he added with a frown at Laurant. \u201cShe can\u2019t be difficult about this. She has to understand this is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being difficult,\u201d she argued. \u201cJust give me a minute, all right?\u201d</p> <p>Reluctantly, he got up and went to make the call. Nick used his mobile phone to alert the police that Laurant was there. Then he called his superior. While he was talking to Morganstern, she made her tea and carried it to the table. Then she sat down again.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get one of these,\u201d he said as he put the phone back in his breast pocket. \u201cWe would have known where you were and could have gotten hold of you while you were on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Holy Oaks everyone knows where everyone else is. It\u2019s like living in a fishbowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff didn\u2019t know where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t bother to ask anyone. He\u2019s very lazy,\u201d she said. \u201cMy neighbors knew where I was going and so did the two men who were looking after the store while the workmen were there.\u201d</p> <p>She picked up the transcript of the conversation the police had made, began to read it, and then put it back down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to listen to the tape now.\u201d</p><p>Unlike her brother, Nick was anxious for her to do just that. He left the kitchen to get the cassette player, and when he returned he put it in the center of the table.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stopped stirring her tea. She put the spoon in the saucer, took a breath, then nodded.</p><p>He hit the play button and leaned back. Laurant stared at the whirling cassette as she listened to the conversation that had taken place in the confessional. Hearing the stranger\u2019s voice made the horror more real to her, and by the time the tape ended, she was nauseated.</p> <p>\u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize his voice?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt was such a low whisper, I didn\u2019t get all of what he said. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard him before. I\u2019ll listen to it again,\u201d she promised, \u201cbut not yet, all right? I don\u2019t think I can . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of what he said was deliberate . . . calculated. At least that\u2019s what I think. He wanted to spook Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he succeeded. I don\u2019t want my brother to worry, but I don\u2019t know how to stop him. It isn\u2019t good for him . . . the stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be realistic, Laurant. A man tells him he\u2019s going to kill his sister after he gets his kicks, and you don\u2019t think he should worry?\u201d</p><p>She threaded her fingers through her hair in agitation. \u201cYes, of course . . . it\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t healthy for him.\u201d</p><p>Nick had noticed her slight French accent when she first spoke to him, but now the accent was more pronounced. She might have looked calm and collected, but that facade, like a thin layer of ice, was cracking.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she asked, sounding genuinely bewildered. \u201cI live such a boring . . . ordinary life. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of weirdos don\u2019t make any sense. There was this case a couple of years back. This pervert did six women before they finally caught him. You know what he told them when they asked him how and where he chose his victims?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAt the grocery stores. He\u2019d stand out front and he\u2019d smile at the women as they rushed past him. The first one who smiled back . . . that\u2019s the one he wanted. Ordinary women, Laurant, leading ordinary lives. You can\u2019t look for reasons with these guys, or waste your time trying to figure out how their minds work. Leave that to the experts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the man in the confessional is a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed. \u201cAnd maybe not. He could just be getting started. The profilers will know more after they\u2019ve heard the tape. They\u2019ll have some insight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot of inconsistencies here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cFor one thing, he told Tommy he did the other woman a year ago, but I think he was lying about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he also said he\u2019s gotten a real taste for it,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cThe one statement conflicts with the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he got off on it\u2014torturing and killing the woman\u2014then he did her recently and not a year ago. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to wait that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, what about the letter he said he sent to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wrote it, and if he mailed it, then they\u2019ll get it tomorrow or the day after. They\u2019re ready,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll run it for prints, but I doubt he left any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they found any prints on the cassette, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, there was one, but it wasn\u2019t our man\u2019s. The kid who checked him out at Super Sid\u2019s Warehouse had a record, so his prints were on file. It was easy to track him to the warehouse,\u201d he explained. \u201cHis probation officer helped him get the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he remember who bought the tape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t,\u201d he answered. \u201cHave you ever been to one of those stores? The traffic going through there is unbelievable, and it was a cash-only counter, so there wasn\u2019t any credit card receipt or check to trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the confessional? Did they find any prints there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t think any of them are his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very smart, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re never as smart as they think they are. Besides . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be smarter.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Nick radiated confidence, and it suddenly dawned on Laurant that he probably had been trained to present a calm demeanor so that witnesses and victims wouldn\u2019t panic.</p><p>\u201cDoes anything ever rile you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure the man on the tape is serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant, no matter how many times you ask me the question, the answer\u2019s going to be the same. Yes, I think he\u2019s serious,\u201d he patiently repeated. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to a lot of trouble researching you and Tommy and me. Like I said before, his intent was to scare your brother, and he sure as hell succeeded. Tommy\u2019s convinced this guy\u2019s crazy, but I\u2019ve got this feeling that most of what he said was carefully rehearsed. Now we have to figure out his real agenda.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her control slipping and clinched her hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking. \u201cDid you hear what he did to that woman? How he tortured her? Did you . . .\u201d</p><p>He took hold of her hand and squeezed. \u201cLaurant, take a deep breath. All right?\u201d</p><p>She did as he suggested, but it didn\u2019t help. The impact of what she had heard was finally hitting her full force. Chilled to the bone, she pulled her hand away and began to rub her arms.</p><p>She was covered with goose bumps and was visibly shivering. Nick grabbed his jacket and draped it around her shoulders. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He had the sudden urge to put his arm around her and comfort her just like he would one of his own sisters if she were scared, but he didn\u2019t know how Laurant would react, and so he stayed where he was and waited for her to give him some sort of signal.</p><p>She pulled the jacket tight around her with a death grip on the lapels.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour.\u201d</p><p>Both of them fell silent, and for several minutes the only sounds were the ticking of the clock above the kitchen sink and Tommy\u2019s muffled voice from the living room. Nick noticed she hadn\u2019t touched her tea. Then Laurant looked up at him, and he saw the tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling overwhelmed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She brushed a tear away and answered, \u201cI was thinking about that woman . . . Millie . . . and what he did to her . . .\u201d</p><p>The tea was cold, and she decided to make another cup. Then she decided to fix a cup for Nick too. The chore kept her busy and gave her a moment to try to get a grip on her emotions.</p><p>Nick watched her work and thanked her when she put the unwanted tea in front of him. Waiting until she sat down again, he said, \u201cI was wondering how you\u2019re going to hold up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hoping I\u2019m tougher than I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what is it you do for the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for the lost-and-found department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, when you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over to hit the rewind button and then glanced back at her. \u201cKids. I find kids.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were the most intense shade of blue, and when he looked at her directly, she felt as though he were trying to see inside her mind. She wondered if he were analyzing her every move as though she were a chess piece. Was he trying to find her vulnerability?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s specialized work,\u201d he commented, hoping that would put an end to the discussion about his job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we had to meet this way . . . under these circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook how I\u2019m shaking,\u201d she said as she put her hand out for him to see. \u201cI\u2019m so angry I want to scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>The suggestion brought her up short. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScream,\u201d he said.</p><p>She actually smiled, so silly was the notion. \u201cMonsignor would have heart failure, and so would my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, just take a few minutes and try to chill out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you propose I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else, just for a little while . . . until Tommy comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think about anything else right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can,\u201d he advised. \u201cTry, Laurant. It might help calm you down.\u201d</p><p>She reluctantly agreed. \u201cWhat should we talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he decided.</p><p>She shook her head, but he ignored it and continued on, \u201cIt\u2019s odd, don\u2019t you think, that we\u2019ve never met before today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is odd,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been my brother\u2019s closest friend since you were little boys, and he lived with your family all those years, yet I don\u2019t know much about you at all. Tommy came home for summer vacation, and you were always invited to come too, but you never did. Something always came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents went over once,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, they did. Your mother brought family photos with her, and there is one of you . . . actually it\u2019s the entire family . . . and Tommy . . . standing in front of a fireplace at Christmas. Would you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it with you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any idea how telling it was that she carried the photo with her. He watched her dig her billfold out of her purse. She\u2019d put the picture in one of the plastic covers that came with all the billfolds, and when she handed it to him, he noticed her hand wasn\u2019t trembling anymore.</p><p>He looked at the photo of the eight Buchanan kids clustered around their proud parents. Tommy was there too, squeezed in between Nick\u2019s brothers Alec and Mike. His brother Dylan was sporting a black eye. Nick figured he\u2019d probably given it to him during one of their family football games.</p><p>\u201cYour mother helped me learn all the names,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a little blurry though, and Theo\u2019s elbow is blocking half your face. No wonder I didn\u2019t recognize you today.\u201d</p><p>He handed the billfold back to her, and as she was putting it away, he said, \u201cI know a lot about you. Tommy had pictures up on the wall, the ones the nuns sent of you when you were little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was very homely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were,\u201d he teased. \u201cAll legs. Tommy would read me some of your letters too. It used to tear him up that he couldn\u2019t bring you over to live with him. He felt so guilty. He had a family, and you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did all right. I spent my summer vacations with Grandfather, and the boarding school was really very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know any other way of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cBut weren\u2019t you lonely?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cA little,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAfter Grandfather died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable with me?\u201d</p><p>The question jarred her. \u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time together, and it\u2019s important that you feel you can relax around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time will we be spending together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery minute of every day and night until this is over. It\u2019s the only way, Laurant.\u201d Without pausing to give her time to absorb that bit of news, Nick commented, \u201cYour brother went crazy when he found out you were modeling.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cYes, he did get a little crazy. That episode merited a long-distance call to the Mother Superior. I couldn\u2019t believe my own brother would tell on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mother Superior . . . her name was Mother Madelyne, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His memory was impressive. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cAfter Tommy told on me, Mother called the people I was supposed to be visiting during the summer break. They were very wealthy, and I had met an Italian designer through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took one look at you and wanted you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to model his spring fashions,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd I was in several shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Mother Madelyne dragged you back to the convent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was mortifying,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI was put on probation, which meant pots and pans for six months. Overnight, I went from glitz to dishwater hands. Do we spend every minute together, Nick?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cWhen you brush your teeth, I\u2019ll squeeze the toothpaste.\u201d</p><p>Once again he switched back to the topic of her past. \u201cEleven months later you were on the cover of one of those fashion magazines, and when Tommy showed it to me, I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same scrawny little kid with skinned knees.\u201d</p><p>He was giving her a compliment, but she didn\u2019t know how to respond, and so she said nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are going to be inseparable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean that first thing in the morning you\u2019ll be standing on my doorstep before I\u2019ve even gotten dressed for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t what I mean. I\u2019ll be getting dressed with you. What side of the bed do you sleep on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d He repeated the question.</p><p>\u201cThe right side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m on the left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the bed? Yeah, I am. But I\u2019m going to do whatever is necessary to keep you safe. I\u2019m going to blatantly invade your privacy, and you\u2019re going to let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when I take a shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hand you the soap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant, I\u2019m going to be close enough to scrub your back. That\u2019s just the way it has to be. You need to understand that I\u2019m going to be the first thing you see in the morning and the last thing you look at before you close your eyes at night. You and I are in this together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re spending all your time with me, how are you going to catch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for a powerful organization, Laurant, remember? They\u2019re already investigating. Leave it to us to catch him. It\u2019s what we\u2019re trained to do.\u201d</p><p>She rested her chin in the palm of her hand. She didn\u2019t say a word for a long minute, and then she straightened up again and looked him right in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him scare me. I want to help. I promise I won\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not scared now. Just angry. Furious, in fact, but not scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be scared. Fear will keep you coiled, focused, on your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it can also paralyze, and I won\u2019t let it paralyze me,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThis man . . . this monster,\u201d she corrected, \u201ctells my brother how much fun he had torturing and killing a poor, innocent woman, and then he tells him the craving\u2019s come back and that he\u2019s chosen me for his next amusement. He\u2019s so clever, he knows Tommy wants to see his face, so he waits for him to come outside the confessional and then he hits him on the back of the head. He could have killed him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to kill him or he would have,\u201d Nick said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s using Tommy as his messenger now.\u201d He saw the look that crossed her face and immediately sought to reassure her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your brother. We\u2019re going to keep him safe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight and day,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem to you that this man is calling all the shots now? He tells Tommy to notify you and make you take me away and then maybe he won\u2019t follow. And my brother wants to do just that. Hide me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he wants to hide you. He loves you and he doesn\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her temples with her fingertips. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would probably react the very same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my brother, and right now he\u2019s in agony worrying about something else that man said to him in the confessional that neither you nor Tommy has mentioned in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Tommy he would try to find someone else to amuse himself with.\u201d Her voice shook as she continued. \u201cFor whatever reason, he decided to warn me so I could get away, but this other woman won\u2019t have any warning, will she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she probably won\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cRunning away isn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m not going to give anyone that kind of power over me. I won\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should discuss this later, after Pete\u2019s had time to go over the tape with the profiler.\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to get up from the table, but Laurant grabbed hold of his hand. She didn\u2019t want to wait. \u201cI know that you must have some theories. I want to hear them. I need information, Nick. I don\u2019t want to feel powerless, and right this minute that\u2019s exactly how I feel.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bored into hers for several seconds before he made up his mind. Then he nodded. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you what we know. To begin with, my superior, Dr. Peter Morganstern, already has listened to a copy of the tape. He\u2019s a psychiatrist who heads my department and he\u2019s the best there is. If anyone can get into this creep\u2019s mind, he can. Just remember, Pete hasn\u2019t had time to sit down and analyze every word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. First, let\u2019s talk facts. The most important fact is that this wasn\u2019t random. You were specifically chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know he chose you because he\u2019s . . . dedicated . . . to you,\u201d he said, searching for the right word.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019ve got a fan. It\u2019s what we call them . . . fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m not a movie star or a celebrity. I\u2019m just an average person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook in the mirror, Laurant. There isn\u2019t anything average about you. You\u2019re beautiful. He thinks you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He hurried on before she could interrupt. \u201cAnd most victims these guys select aren\u2019t high profile.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and then said, \u201cGo on. I need to know exactly what I\u2019m up against. You aren\u2019t scaring me,\u201d she added so he wouldn\u2019t continue to choose his words so carefully. \u201cI want to know everything so I can fight back, and by God, I am going to fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what he\u2019s telling us. He\u2019s been stalking you for a long time now. He knows everything about you. Everything. He knows what kind of perfume you wear, what your favorite foods are, what kind of detergent you use in your laundry, what books you read, what your sex life is like, what you do every minute of every day. He wants us to know that he\u2019s been inside your house at least a couple of times, but probably more. He sat in your chairs, he ate your food, and he went through your drawers. It\u2019s his way of getting to know you,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019s probably taken something from your underwear drawer to keep, something you wouldn\u2019t miss right away. Think about it, and you\u2019ll remember some old nightgown or T-shirt that you haven\u2019t been able to find lately. The garment has to be something you wear close to your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, shaken by Nick\u2019s description of the man he called a fan. She didn\u2019t want to believe that anyone had gone through her house uninvited and searched through her things, and the thought that she was being watched made her skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cIt has to have your scent on it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt makes him feel closer to you. Whatever it is, he\u2019s sleeping with it,\u201d he added, remembering the man\u2019s words about wrapping himself in her fragrance.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked, surprised at how normal she sounded.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s watched you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would have known,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He tapped the cassette player. \u201cIt\u2019s all there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I had opened my eyes . . . what if I woke up and saw him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he wants you to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not yet. He\u2019d be upset if you forced him to hurt you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be speeding up his agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on. I\u2019m not scared,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>\u201cWhat I just told you . . . that\u2019s what he wants us to know. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re theorizing at this point. He lives in Holy Oaks, and he\u2019s someone you come into contact with all the time, maybe even on a daily basis. You\u2019re friendly with him, but like I said before, he\u2019s reading all sorts of other messages. Pete says he\u2019s in the adoration stage. That means he thinks you\u2019re pretty damned perfect, and he wants to protect you. The guy\u2019s obsessing now, and he\u2019s clearly at war with himself. He wants us to believe he is anyway. He might genuinely like you, Laurant, and in that case he doesn\u2019t want to hurt you, but he knows he\u2019s going to because no matter what you do, you\u2019re going to disappoint him. In his mind, there\u2019s no way you can live up to his expectations\u2014he\u2019ll make sure of that\u2014and there\u2019s no way you can win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he\u2019s in the adoration stage but that\u2019s going to change. When do you think it will happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me how soon? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to wait long. You could already be . . . tarnishing . . . in his mind. Look, he\u2019s got to find something wrong with you so he can feel betrayed. Maybe it will be the way you smile. All of a sudden, he\u2019s going to think you\u2019re mocking him, or maybe he\u2019ll believe you\u2019re coming on to some other man. That would definitely enrage him. He\u2019d like us to think he\u2019s tormented. Remember, he promised Tommy that if you ran away from him, he might not follow you. But he also boasted that he is brilliant and that he wants more of a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll get tired of this . . . obsession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t going to go away.\u201d Nick\u2019s voice had a sharp edge now. \u201cThe fantasy\u2019s controlling him. He can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game to him, and you\u2019re the mouse. He likes the hunt. The more challenging it is, the more fun. The game won\u2019t be over until you have begged for mercy.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and studied her closely. \u201cWell, Laurant? Are you scared yet?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>What a delightful time he\u2019d had toying with the priest. Delightful indeed. He really hadn\u2019t expected that he would have so much fun, because he\u2019d learned from past experiences that sometimes the buildup\u2014the planning stage in his schedule, as he liked to call it\u2014turned out to be far more rewarding than the actual event\u2014like when he was a boy and he was building his fort in the backyard. The joy was in the anticipation for what he was going to do inside his isolated cocoon where no one could spy on him. Oh, he\u2019d spend hours and hours getting ready, a busy little beaver sharpening the kitchen knives and scissors he\u2019d stolen from his mother\u2019s drawer, and meticulously preparing the burial sites for the animals he\u2019d trapped and caged. The killings always turned out to be anticlimactic though. The animals never squealed enough to satisfy him. But in this instance, good old Tommy boy hadn\u2019t let him down. No, no, he hadn\u2019t been disappointed in the priest at all.</p><p>As he was driving down the highway, he replayed the conversation in his head over and over again until he was laughing out loud and tears were streaming down his face. There wasn\u2019t anyone around, and so he could be as loud and raucous as he wanted to be, but then, come to think of it, he could pretty much do whatever he wanted to do these days, anytime, anywhere, as long as he was careful. Just ask pretty little Millicent. Oh, nope, you couldn\u2019t do that. No, sirree.</p><p>Father Tom\u2019s tortured cry when he realized the next victim was none other than his precious sister kept echoing in his mind. \u201cMy Laurant?\u201d the priest had shouted.</p><p>\u201cMy Laurant?\u201d he mockingly imitated. Priceless. Really priceless.</p><p>It was a pity he had had to leave so abruptly. He would have enjoyed tormenting Tommy a bit longer, but there simply hadn\u2019t been time, what with all those wasted minutes spent on that nonsense about not being able to tell anyone what had been said inside the confessional, even after he\u2019d given him permission. By God, he\u2019d ordered him to tell. It hadn\u2019t made any difference to the priest though. No, sirree. It hadn\u2019t. Oh, he\u2019d known about the church\u2019s precious regulations guarding their sacraments\u2014he always did his homework\u2014but he\u2019d misjudged Tommy because he hadn\u2019t counted on him being such a stickler for the rules. Who would have thought the priest would be so stubborn, when spilling the beans would save his own sister\u2019s hide? Who would have thought? A priest who wasn\u2019t morally bankrupt. My, oh my, what a dilemma that turned out to be. Had he been an ordinary man, his plans would have been ruined, and he would have had to start over again. But he wasn\u2019t ordinary. No, no, of course not. He was brilliant, and he had, therefore, anticipated every possibility. He\u2019d almost blurted out, right there in the confessional, that he was taping the conversation, but he\u2019d decided to let Tommy be surprised. He had hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to share the tape though, not yet anyway. It would be added to his impressive and certainly eclectic collection. Millie\u2019s tape was getting plumb worn out. Some insomniacs listened to the soothing sounds of the ocean or gentle rainfall when they went to bed; he listened to Millie\u2019s sweet voice.</p><p>The priest had forced his hand with that stupid confession rule, and the only way to get around it had been to break the rule himself by letting the police have a copy of the tape. Always thinking ahead, that was the ticket. One quick trip to Super Sid\u2019s Warehouse to pick up a three-pack of blank cassettes, a couple of manila envelopes, and he had taken care of the problem.</p><p>He would not allow anyone or anything to interfere with his schedule, which was why he always had an alternative plan of action in mind. Anticipate and respond. That was the key.</p><p>He let out a loud yawn. There was so much to do in preparation, and because he was meticulous to a fault in everything he did, he needed every single minute of the next couple of weeks to get ready for his own special Fourth of July celebration.</p><p>It promised to be . . . explosive.</p><p>Now he was on his way to St. Louis, thanks to his helpful friend, the Internet. What a wondrous invention that was. The perfect accomplice. It never whined, complained, cried, or demanded. And he didn\u2019t have to waste precious time training it. It was like a well-paid whore, giving him what he wanted, when he wanted it. No questions asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who would have imagined it would be so easy to learn how to make your own bombs in simple one-two-three steps a child of average intelligence could follow, with colorful illustrations to help the slow-witted along? If you had the money\u2014which he did\u2014you could order more sophisticated triggering devices\u2014which he had\u2014and lovely \u201cenhancing\u201d kits that turned little ear-tingling pops into ear-bleeding booms guaranteed to take out a city block, or your money back. He didn\u2019t have any desire to find nuclear ingredients, but he had a feeling that if he searched the subterranean rooms long enough and got real friendly with those stupidly dedicated anarchists, he would find everything but the plutonium. Weapons weren\u2019t a problem either, as long as you knew where to click on. And he did, of course. Yes, he did.</p><p>Although he had ordered lots of interesting little gadgets through the Internet, he hadn\u2019t ordered the explosives because he knew the mules could be monitoring the sight. Still, he\u2019d gotten the connection he\u2019d needed from one of his buddies who had hooked him up with an illegal dealer operating out of the Midwest, which was why he was now breezing down I-70 with his shopping list in his pocket.</p><p>He spotted a roadside rest area ahead and thought about stopping so he could get his copy of the tape out of the back of the van. He wanted to listen to the priest\u2019s voice again, but then he saw the police car parked there and he immediately changed his mind.</p><p>The mules were probably replaying the tape now while they made copious notes. It wasn\u2019t going to do them any good though. They weren\u2019t smart like he was. They wouldn\u2019t get anything from his voice except maybe the region he came from, and who cared about that? They would never figure out his game until it was over and he had won.</p> <p>He knew what the mules were calling him. The unsub. He liked the sound of it and decided that Unknown Subject was about the best nickname he\u2019d ever acquired. The simplicity of it appealed to him, he supposed. By using the word unknown, the mules\u2014his nickname for the FBI agents\u2014were admitting how inept and incompetent they were, and there was something honest and pure about their stupidity and their ignorance. The mules actually knew they were mules. How delightful.</p><p>\u201cAre we having fun yet?\u201d he shouted as he sped down the highway. And then he laughed again. \u201cOh, yes, we are,\u201d he added with another chuckle. \u201cYes, sirree.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Two detectives from the Kansas City Police Department, Maria Rodrigues and Frances McCann, arrived at the rectory a little past two. As the interview got under way, Nick, silent and watchful, remained by Laurant\u2019s side. He let the detectives run the show and didn\u2019t interfere in the questioning or volunteer any opinions or suggestions. When he got up to leave the room, Laurant had to force herself not to grab hold of him to keep him there. She wanted him close by, even if only to offer moral support, but he\u2019d gotten a phone call from a man named George Walker, a profiler assigned to the case.</p><p>Tommy joined them, and the first couple of minutes with him were very predictable. Like most women who met her brother for the first time, the detectives seemed captivated and had trouble taking their eyes off him.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a full-fledged priest?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Detective McCann asked. \u201cI mean, have you been ordained and everything?\u201d</p><p>Tommy gave her one of his grins, completely unaware of the heart flutters they caused in most women, and responded, \u201cI\u2019m full-fledged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should stick to the investigation,\u201d Rodrigues suggested to her partner.</p><p>McCann flipped open her notepad and looked at Laurant. \u201cDid your brother tell you how we got hold of the tape?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer but continued. \u201cThe son of a bitch just strolled inside the police station sometime last night, dropped his little package, and then strolled right back out. I mean, it was the perfect time \u2019cause it was a zoo in there. Two big drug busts had just gone down and they were dragging their drugged-out asses in for over an hour. The watch said he didn\u2019t notice the package until things had calmed down. Anyway, we figure he must have been dressed in blues, like a street cop, or maybe he was pretending to be a lawyer, come to bail his client out. No one remembers seeing anyone with a manila envelope,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s what the tape was in, and to be honest, it was such a hectic time, I doubt anyone would have noticed the envelope if the son of a bitch hadn\u2019t called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called 911 from a pay phone in City Center Square,\u201d Rodrigues interjected. \u201cThat isn\u2019t too far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy\u2019s got steel balls, I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d McCann remarked. She colored then and blurted, \u201cSorry about the language, Father. I\u2019ve been hanging around Rodrigues too long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what can you tell us?\u201d Rodrigues asked Laurant.</p><p>Laurant raised her hands in a gesture of futility. She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to help them\u2014she couldn\u2019t even come up with a viable theory as to why she had been targeted.</p><p>The detectives didn\u2019t have any leads yet, though it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. They had already canvassed the neighborhood, searching for witnesses who might have noticed a stranger or a car in the vicinity late Saturday afternoon. No one had seen or heard anything out of the ordinary, which hadn\u2019t surprised the detectives.</p><p>\u201cPeople around here are suspicious of the police,\u201d Rodrigues explained. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that if anyone saw anything peculiar, he\u2019ll confide in Monsignor or maybe even Father Tom here. The parishioners trust their priests.\u201d</p><p>Neither Rodrigues nor McCann were optimistic about catching the unsub quickly. They would have to wait and see what developed. Maybe the letter the man had told Tommy he\u2019d mailed would shed some insight. Then again, maybe not.</p><p>\u201cAside from assaulting Father Tom here, no other crime has been committed,\u201d McCann said. \u201cAt least not yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to tell me that if I\u2019m murdered, then you\u2019ll look into it?\u201d Laurant asked a little more sharply than she intended.</p><p>McCann, the more blunt of the two, responded. \u201cDo you want me to sugarcoat it or be honest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty territorial, kinda like big cats, and it would depend on where he dumped the body. If it\u2019s our city, we take the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA crime has already been committed,\u201d Tommy reminded them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rodrigues agreed. \u201cYou were assaulted, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tommy interrupted. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. He confessed to killing another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he says he killed her,\u201d Rodrigues countered. \u201cHe could have been lying about that.\u201d</p><p>McCann volunteered her opinion that the incident in the confes-sional was just a sick prank by an irate man who maybe had a grudge against Father Tom and wanted to get back at him. That was why, she explained, they had spent so much time on their first call questioning him about possible enemies.</p><p>\u201cLook, we aren\u2019t going to sit on our hands,\u201d Rodrigues assured Laurant. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a lot to go on yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t our jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that, Detective McCann?\u201d</p><p>Nick asked the question. He was leaning against the door frame, watching the detectives.</p><p>Her tone was antagonistic when she answered. \u201cThe unsub reported the crime here in Kansas City, but he made it clear on the tape, clear to us anyway, that he lives in or around Holy Oaks, Iowa. We\u2019ll share what we\u2019ve got with the police there, and we\u2019ll keep the file open of course . . . in case he comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way we see it, the FBI\u2019s involved. Right? You guys are bound to come up with something,\u201d Rodrigues offered.</p><p>McCann nodded. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to interfere in an FBI investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHey, we\u2019re trying to get along here. I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t work on this together. You give us what you\u2019ve got, and if we come up with anything, we\u2019ll be happy to share it with you.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t getting anywhere. After the detectives gave Laurant their cards, they left the rectory. Laurant was thoroughly frustrated by the lack of action, even though she realized her expectations had been unrealistic. She wanted answers and results\u2014maybe even a miracle\u2014to make this nightmare go away, but by the time the detectives left, she felt . . . hopeless. Because her brother seemed so relieved that something was being done\u2014the cavalry had arrived after all\u2014she didn\u2019t tell him how she felt. In fact, she didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to him for the rest of the afternoon. His attention was diverted elsewhere.</p><p>Tommy was so rattled by what was happening, he forgot it was Sunday afternoon. But then he happened to look out the window and saw the kids waiting for him. There was a tradition at Mercy parish on warm Sunday afternoons when Tommy was in town, and he wasn\u2019t about to let anything get in the way of the ritual that meant so much to the children in the neighborhood. At precisely quarter of three, all other duties and concerns came to a standstill, when a large number of neighborhood kids gathered in the church parking lot and began to clamor for Father Tom to come outside. Tommy put on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, kicked his shoes and socks off, and grabbed a towel. He made Laurant stay inside\u2014it was safer he told her\u2014but she could watch the fun from one of the windows.</p><p>As was the custom and barring any unforeseen complications, a fire truck arrived at three o\u2019clock, and two good-hearted off-duty firemen closed the gates to the lot and opened the fire hydrant. The children, including toddlers through high schoolers, eagerly waited while the firemen adjusted the heavy nozzle between the iron gates and clamped it to the rails so that the hose wouldn\u2019t go skittering every which way. Then the water was turned on. The kids wore cut-off jeans or shorts. None of them owned swimming suits\u2014such apparel wasn\u2019t in their parents\u2019 budgets\u2014but that didn\u2019t diminish their excitement. After stacking their towels and shoes on the steps of the rectory, they played in the water until their clothes were soaked, splashing and shouting with as much enthusiasm as any children at a country club. There weren\u2019t any fancy kidney-shaped pools with diving boards and water slides at Mercy. They made do with what they had, and for an hour, while the firemen and any other adults who had tagged along with their little ones sat with Monsignor on the porch and sipped cold lemonade, chaos reigned.</p><p>When Tommy wasn\u2019t busy holding on to the smaller children so they wouldn\u2019t be swept into the bushes by the force of the spray, he manned the medical kit and dispensed Neosporin, glow-in-the-dark Band-Aids, and sympathy for skinned knees and elbows. After the firemen turned the water off and prepared to leave, Monsignor dispensed Popsicles. No matter how tight money was or how poor the collections were that week, there was always enough set aside for these treats.</p><p>After the pandemonium had died down and the waterlogged, worn-out children had all gone home, Monsignor McKindry insisted that Nick and Laurant join Tommy and him for a peaceful dinner. Tommy and Nick prepared the meal. Nick grilled chicken while Tommy fixed a salad and green beans fresh from the monsignor\u2019s garden. The table conversation revolved around the monsignor\u2019s reunion, and he entertained his guests with one story after another about the trouble he and his friends had caused during their seminary days. By unspoken agreement, no one discussed what the older priest called the \u201cdisturbing event\u201d during dinner, but later as Monsignor McKindry and Laurant worked side by side washing and drying the dishes, he brought up the topic again when he asked her how she was handling the worry. She told him she was frightened, of course, but also so angry she wanted to start throwing things. Monsignor took her at her word and immediately snatched the plate she was drying out of her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhen your brother found out he had cancer, I know he felt powerless and frustrated and angry, but then he decided to take charge of his medical care. He read as much as he possibly could about his specific type of cancer, and that was quite a challenge because his is such a rare type. He studied all the medical journals and he interviewed a good number of specialists in the field until he found the man who had set the protocol for treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Cowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Monsignor replied. \u201cTom felt that Dr. Cowan could help him. He didn\u2019t expect any miracles, of course, but Tom had faith in Dr. Cowan, and the physician seems to know what he\u2019s doing. Your brother\u2019s holding his own in this battle,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why, when the oncologist transferred to Kansas Medical Center, Tom followed him. What I\u2019m trying to advise you to do, Laurant, is take charge. Figure out a way you can do that and then you won\u2019t feel so helpless or afraid.\u201d</p><p>After they finished cleaning the kitchen, Monsignor brewed her one of his special toddies, guaranteed to soothe her frazzled nerves. Then he said his good nights and went upstairs to bed. The drink was bitter, but she dutifully drank it down because Monsignor had gone to so much trouble for her.</p><p>It had been a hell of a day. It was late now, almost ten o\u2019clock, and the stress had worn her out. She sat on the sofa next to her brother in the rectory living room, trying to pay attention as they formulated their plans. But concentration was difficult, and she couldn\u2019t keep her thoughts from wandering. She couldn\u2019t even seem to block out the background noise. An old air conditioner propped in the window adjacent to the fireplace droned on and on like a swarm of angry bees, yet barely cooled the room. Occasionally the unit would shudder violently before returning to the monotonous droning again. She kept expecting the thing to leap out of the window. Icy condensation dripped down into a spaghetti pot Tommy had placed under the window to protect the hardwood floor he was determined to refinish one of these days, and the constant pinging noise was driving her to distraction</p><p>Nick was full of energy. He was pacing around the living room, his head down as he listened to what Tommy was saying. Her brother, she noticed, was quieter\u2014he\u2019d taken his tennis shoes off and propped his feet up on the ottoman. There was a huge hole in one of his white socks, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice, or care, that his big toe was sticking out. He was yawning every other minute.</p><p>Laurant felt as limp and lifeless as a rag doll. She put the china cup on the table, sank back into the soft cushions of the sofa, took a couple of deep breaths, and closed her eyes. Maybe tomorrow, after a good night\u2019s sleep, she\u2019d be more clearheaded.</p><p>So lost was she in her own thoughts, she flinched when Tommy nudged her knee to get her attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you falling asleep on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you and Nick should stay here tonight. We\u2019ve got two extra bedrooms. They\u2019re Spartan but adequate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only got one extra bedroom,\u201d Nick said. \u201cNoah\u2019s going to be here anytime now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Noah?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cHe\u2019s coming in from D.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick thinks I need a baby-sitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBodyguard,\u201d he corrected. \u201cNoah\u2019s good at what he does. He\u2019s going to stick to you like gum on a shoe. No arguments. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and since you want me to stay with Laurant, I\u2019m putting Noah on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Tommy\u2019s in danger?\u201d Laurant asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Noah with the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t go into detail, but she was too curious to drop the subject. \u201cThen how do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to work together. Noah\u2019s . . . specialized . . . and Pete uses him every now and then. I had to call in a favor to get him. He\u2019s swamped with business these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a bodyguard?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me what his specialty is, are you?\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Tommy yawned loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s settled then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s settled?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been paying attention? We\u2019ve been discussing the matter for the past fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d she admitted, and because he was her brother she didn\u2019t feel the need to apologize. \u201cWhat did you settle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going away with Nick.\u201d He glanced up at his friend and added, \u201cThat\u2019s what I decided anyway. Nick\u2019s ambivalent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? Where would we be going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan\u2019s Bay,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou could stay with the family. They\u2019d love to see you, and I know they\u2019ve been begging you to come. It\u2019s a great place, Laurant, and it\u2019s isolated too. There\u2019s only one way in and out,\u201d he added. \u201cOver a bridge. I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ll love it there. The front yard is the size of a football field, and just beyond is the water. Maybe Theo will take you sailing. You\u2019ve met Nick\u2019s brother, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I remember him. He stayed with Grandfather and me for a week after he finished law school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd aren\u2019t you still corresponding with Jordan?\u201d he asked, referring to Nick\u2019s sister.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019d love to see her again, and Judge and Mrs. Buchanan too, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tommy cut off any protest she was going to make. \u201cAnd you\u2019d finally get to meet all the others,\u201d he pressed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll come home to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, but Tommy, now isn\u2019t the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time. You\u2019ll be safe, and that\u2019s all you should be thinking about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think this lunatic won\u2019t follow me? Have you considered Nick\u2019s family? I could be putting them in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d make it secure,\u201d Nick said. He sat down in the easy chair on the other side of the ottoman and leaned forward, bracing his arms on his knees. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re going to be staying here for another day, maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo wait for the letter the man told Tommy he mailed to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my sister out of here now,\u201d Tommy insisted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you want to hang around? It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cI doubt our man is still in Kansas City. He\u2019s done what he came here to do. He\u2019s probably gone back home. We\u2019re staying because Pete\u2019s coming here. He\u2019s personally overseeing the investigation, and he wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Laurant asked. \u201cWhat can Tommy tell him he doesn\u2019t already know?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cLots of things,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhen is he coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pretty shaken up when I talked to him,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cI was real desperate to find you because I figured you\u2019d know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still figure that?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me do my job. Laurant and I will wait to talk to Pete before I take her away. I\u2019m going to protect her, Tommy, and you\u2019re just going to have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>He slowly nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to get in the way. Is that good enough?\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang and the conversation came to an abrupt end. Nick told Tommy to stay where he was and went to open the door. Laurant noticed he unsnapped the flap over his gun on his way out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s Nick\u2019s friend, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he sleeps with it?\u201d she asked her brother in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cSleeps with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis gun.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOf course not. You don\u2019t like it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like Nick?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI liked him before I met him because he\u2019s been such a good friend to you, and he seems very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d he asked, and then he laughed again. \u201cNick would get a kick out of hearing that. When the chips are down, when things get bad, he isn\u2019t nice at all. That\u2019s what makes him good.\u201d</p><p>Before she could nag him into giving her specifics, Nick returned to the living room. His friend Noah followed him.</p><p>Tommy\u2019s bodyguard certainly made a strong first impression. Laurant suspected that if he were ever involved in a brawl, he\u2019d come out the winner and relish the good time he\u2019d had slamming heads together.</p><p>He was dressed in faded jeans and a light gray T-shirt, and his sandy blond hair was in desperate need of a trim. There didn\u2019t seem to be an extra ounce of fat anywhere, and the muscles in his upper arms strained the bands on his shirtsleeves. A scar below his eyebrow and a devilish grin gave him a rakish appearance, and she knew before he\u2019d spoken a word that he was a flirt and a ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019d already given her the once-over as he crossed the room to shake Tommy\u2019s hand, and his gaze, she\u2019d noticed, had lingered on her legs a bit longer than was necessary.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to come here,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t given a choice. Nick asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owes me,\u201d Nick explained.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Noah agreed, his gaze still on Laurant. \u201cAnd he never lets me forget it.\u201d</p><p>When Tommy introduced him to his sister, he took hold of her hand and didn\u2019t let go. \u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a lot prettier than your brother,\u201d he drawled. Glancing at Nick, he added, \u201cSay, I\u2019ve got a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Nick replied.</p><p>Acting as though he hadn\u2019t heard him, he suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I take her and you can have her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s off limits, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d he asked, his eyes locked on Laurant\u2019s. \u201cYou married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, smiling over his outrageous behavior.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t see the problem. I want her, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>Noah\u2019s smile widened. He had obviously gotten just the reaction he wanted because he winked at Laurant, as though she were a partner in his game to irritate Nick. He finally let go of her hand and turned to Tommy again. \u201cSo what do I call you? \u2018Tom\u2019 or \u2018Tommy\u2019 or just plain \u2018priest\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call him \u2018Father,\u2019 \u201d Nick interjected.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not Catholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom or Tommy will be fine,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>\u201cPete told me you have a copy of the tape,\u201d Noah said then. His smile was gone now. \u201cI think I\u2019d better listen to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the kitchen,\u201d Tommy told him.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Have you got anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to fix you something?\u201d Laurant offered.</p><p>When Noah looked at her again, the smile was firmly back in place. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that a lot.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t like it at all. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cYou can fix yourself something to eat. Now that you\u2019re here, Laurant and I are going to take off. She\u2019s wiped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the schedule tomorrow?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go back to the hospital for a couple of tests,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cJust routine stuff,\u201d he added for Laurant\u2019s benefit.</p><p>\u201cHell, I hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ought to be sending you thank-you notes,\u201d Tommy remarked dryly. \u201cFrom what Nick\u2019s told me about you, you send them a lot of customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I cut out the middleman. I send them right to the morgue. Saves time and money.\u201d Noah glanced at his friend. \u201cWhat\u2019d you tell your priest about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you shoot to kill.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s about right, but then, so do you. My aim\u2019s better, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Nick countered.</p><p>Laurant was fascinated by the conversation, but she couldn\u2019t tell if Noah was joking or telling the truth. \u201cHave you killed a lot of people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow Laurant, you know better than to ask me that. I can\u2019t kill and tell. Besides, it\u2019s a sin to brag, isn\u2019t it, Tom?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cBragging is the least of your sins, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m a good man. I like to think of myself as an environmentalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my part to make the world a better place.\u201d Turning back to Tommy he asked, \u201cAre we going to be at the hospital all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got an early appointment in radiology. We should be back here by eight or nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it time for another MRI?\u201d Nick asked with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \u201cIf so, I really want to be there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about an MRI?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Nick shook his head and Tommy actually blushed as he answered. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I am having another MRI, but Nick can\u2019t go with me. He\u2019s been banned from radiology.\u201d</p><p>Noah wanted details, and it didn\u2019t take Laurant long to realize she was the reason Nick and Tommy weren\u2019t giving him any. They squirmed around their explanation like naughty schoolboys hauled in front of the principal.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll just go and get my purse.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even reached the kitchen before she heard the laughter. Tommy was telling the story, but because he was speaking in such a low voice, she could only catch a word or two. Whatever had happened with Nick in the radiology department was hilarious to the three men. She found her purse on the floor next to the chair, looped the strap over her shoulder, and then leaned back against the table and waited for the laughter to die down.</p><p>Nick came looking for her. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>With a nod she followed him to the front door. Tommy stooped down so she could kiss him on the cheek, and Noah immediately imitated the action.</p><p>Laughing, she pushed him back. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re one hell of a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the compliment, she said, \u201cWatch over my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ve been bred to do just that. I come from a long line of law enforcement officers, so I\u2019m a natural protector. It\u2019s in the genes,\u201d he added. \u201cSleep well, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Nick opened the door, but she paused on the threshold. \u201cNoah? What\u2019s your last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClayborne,\u201d he answered. \u201cNoah Clayborne.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Laurant\u2019s car was a piece of junk. The carburetor was clogged; the spark plugs needed to be replaced, and the transmission was slipping. Nick was surprised they made it across town to the hotel.</p><p>He had made reservations from the rectory. They were registered under the names of Mr. and Mrs. John Hudson. They stopped by the reception desk to pick up their keys and then went upstairs. In the elevator he told her he\u2019d had her clothes transferred.</p><p>\u201cVery efficient of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an efficient kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of the elevator first, made sure the hallway was empty, then walked by her side down the long, red carpeted corridor. It was as quiet as a tomb. Their suite was at the very end of the hall. Nick inserted the plastic card in the lock and pushed the door wide.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention we\u2019ve got the bridal suite? It\u2019s all they had available. Now Laurant, don\u2019t go all awkward on me,\u201d he hastily added when he saw her expression. \u201cYou look like you want to run.\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile. It was awkward, but she was determined to get past it. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to run anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to carry you over the threshold?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He finally gave her a little nudge to get her moving. She hesitantly stepped into the one-bedroom suite. She heard the door click behind her, and she felt a sudden pang of nervousness. This wasn\u2019t the time to be embarrassed or shy, she reminded herself. Nick was standing right behind her. She could feel the heat from his body. She quickly walked away from him and looked around the living room. It was beautifully decorated in soft, soothing taupe colors. There were two chocolate chenille sofas facing each other with a black marble coffee table in between. In the center of the table was a large crystal vase filled with fresh spring flowers, and on the sideboard in front of the triple windows overlooking the plaza lights, was a silver tray laden with fruit, cheese and crackers, and a bottle of champagne submerged in a black onyx bucket of ice.</p><p>Nick was doing something funny with the door. He had a thin wire in his hand and was threading a loop around the door latch. On the end of the wire was a tiny square box about the size of a nine-volt battery, and after he twisted the wire around the doorknob, he turned the box, and a red light suddenly began to blink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own personal security system,\u201d he told her. \u201cJordan designed it for me. If anyone tries to get in while I\u2019m in the shower or asleep, I\u2019ll know about it.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, rolled his shoulders, and then suggested she get ready for bed. \u201cI\u2019ll use this bathroom, and you can have the one off the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she walked to the door separating the living room from the bedroom and then paused. There was a king-size bed, and the white comforter and sheets had already been turned down for the night. A long-stemmed red rose was in the center of the bed, and Godiva chocolate squares, wrapped in gleaming gold paper, were on two of the pillows.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked when she continued to stand at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rose on the bed.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the room to see for himself. \u201cNice touch,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>He was just a foot away, leaning against the door frame. She couldn\u2019t quite look at him when she said, \u201cIt is the bridal suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, it is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou feeling awkward again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cYou can have the bed, and I\u2019ll take the sofa out here.\u201d</p><p>She heard a loud crunch. Nick had just taken a huge bite out of an apple. Juice dripped down his chin, and he casually wiped it away with the back of his hand and offered the apple to her. She leaned over and took a much smaller bite.</p><p>The tension left, and he was suddenly her big brother\u2019s best friend again. She headed for the bathroom, and while she was sorting through her overnight bag, looking for her nightshirt, out of the corner of her eye she saw Nick dive on the bed and grab the TV remote.</p><p>She stayed in the shower a long time, letting the hot water beat down on her shoulders until all the tension of the day eased away. She was drained by the time she finished blowing her long hair dry. She put on an extra-large Penn State nightshirt, slapped on some moisturizer, and then grabbed her tube of Chanel body lotion and went back into the bedroom.</p><p>Nick had made himself at home. He was leaning back against the pillows he\u2019d propped against the headboard, his long muscular legs sprawled out in front of him with one ankle crossed over the other. He had changed into a pair of old frayed shorts and a white shirt. His hair was still wet from his shower, and he was barefoot. A small notebook and a ballpoint pen were on his lap and the television remote control was in his hand. He looked completely at ease.</p> <p>There were complimentary robes hanging in the closet, but she\u2019d forgotten to take one of them into the bathroom with her, and since he\u2019d just given her little more than a cursory glance and turned back to the television, she stopped worrying about being prim and proper. She wasn\u2019t scantily clad in a negligee after all. The nightshirt covered her from her neck to the top of her knees.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t take his gaze off the television. Outwardly, he was immobile, concentrating on the TV screen, but inside his thoughts were turning somersaults. When Laurant had stepped out of the bathroom, he\u2019d taken it all in, those incredible long legs, the soft swell of her br**sts under the thin fabric, her beautiful neck, her flushed cheeks, and that perfect mouth of hers. He didn\u2019t think he could have been more aroused if she\u2019d been wearing one of those lacy little teddies from the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog.</p><p>Oh, yeah, he\u2019d noticed it all and in just under three seconds max. It had taken every ounce of discipline he possessed to look away, and honest to God, if she\u2019d asked him what he was watching on television right now, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell her.</p><p>He was a little shocked\u2014and a lot disgusted\u2014by his reaction to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just like my brother,\u201d she remarked as she stretched her legs out, tugged the nightshirt down, and then propped two fat pillows behind her back. Imitating him, she crossed one ankle over the other and began to twist the lid open on her lotion.</p><p>There was a lot of room between them on the king-size bed, but it was still a bed. Get over it, he told himself. She\u2019s Tommy\u2019s kid sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was rubbing the pink lotion on her arms when she answered him. \u201cI said that you\u2019re just like my brother. Tommy always has the remote clutched in his hand.\u201d</p> <p>Nick grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s because he knows the secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe who controls the remote, controls the world.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and that only encouraged him. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever noticed how the President is always patting his vest pocket? He\u2019s making sure the remote\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd all this time I thought it was just a nervous habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you know the truth.\u201d</p><p>She put the lotion on the table next to the bed and slipped under the covers. She blankly stared at the television for a minute, but her thoughts were racing.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s good at what he does, isn\u2019t he? I know you told me that he is, but after I met him, I felt like I didn\u2019t have to worry about Tommy any longer. Noah made me feel confident that he\u2019ll watch out for my brother. Oh, I know he was teasing about all that kill-and- not-tell stuff . . . he was teasing, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cYes, he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that Pete uses him every once in a while, but that Noah doesn\u2019t work for the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does and he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s kind of like being a little bit pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he replied. \u201cNoah likes to think of himself as a free agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Pete runs him.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by that remark. \u201cAnd because Pete works for the FBI and Noah works for him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works for the FBI too. We just don\u2019t tell him so.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell when you\u2019re serious. I feel numb everywhere. Hopefully, in the morning I\u2019ll be clearheaded again.\u201d</p><p>Tomorrow, when her thoughts weren\u2019t playing Twister inside her head, she\u2019d decide how to handle things. But for now, she was just too exhausted to think.</p><p>She fell asleep watching him watch the hockey game.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>When Laurant woke up, she could hear Nick moving around in the living room. Grabbing her bag, she hurried into the bathroom to get dressed. Her choice of clothing was limited. She\u2019d left Holy Oaks in such a hurry, there simply hadn\u2019t been time to give her wardrobe consideration. When she\u2019d packed, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d only be in Kansas City overnight, but she had thrown in a short black linen skirt and a white top just in case Tommy had been admitted to the hospital. The linen skirt was going to look like she\u2019d slept in the thing once she sat down, but it was going to have to do.</p><p>She had just put on one shoe and was reaching for the other when Nick knocked on the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is here,\u201d he called. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>She came out holding a shoe in her hand. \u201cWhat kind of work?\u201d</p><p>He motioned to a notebook on the table. \u201cI thought we\u2019d make a list. It\u2019ll give me a head start, but I\u2019ll warn you now, we\u2019ll be going over all this several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t mind. What exactly are we going to go over?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the chair out at the table and waited for her to sit down. \u201cA couple of things. First, we\u2019re going to make a list of people who might have a grudge against you. You know . . . enemies. Folks who would be happy if you just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are people who dislike me, but I honestly don\u2019t think any of them would wish me harm. Do I sound naive?\u201d She bent down to put her shoe on. When she straightened up again, Nick was putting a croissant on her plate.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do,\u201d he answered. \u201cDo you want some coffee?\u201d he asked as he reached for the carafe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink it, but thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink it either. Odd, huh? We must be the only two people in the world who don\u2019t support Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>He straddled the chair across from her and pulled the cap off his pen.</p><p>\u201cYou said first we\u2019re going to make a list of enemies. What else?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to know about any friends who are maybe a little too attentive. But, first things first. How long have you lived in Holy Oaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved there to be close to your brother, and you\u2019re opening a store soon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I purchased an old, run-down building in the town square and it\u2019s being renovated now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a store is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s calling it the corner drugstore, because that\u2019s what it used to be years ago, but I won\u2019t be selling any drugs, not even aspirin. It\u2019s going to be a place where the college kids can hang out, but also, hopefully, where town families can bring their children for ice cream. There\u2019s going to be a soda fountain with a lovely marble top and a jukebox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifties or sixties stuff, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of work for the sororities and fraternities designing logos and artwork for their T-shirts and banners, and I hope to get more. There\u2019s a loft above the soda fountain with wonderful windows and lots of light. That\u2019s where I plan to work. The store isn\u2019t big, but there\u2019s a veranda out front and I\u2019m thinking about putting tables and chairs there during the warm months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make much money selling ice cream and T-shirts, but then, I guess with your trust you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree or disagree with his assumption. She merely added, \u201cI also do a lot of design work for the local businesses, and I\u2019m going to teach a course this fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you studied art in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cYou paint, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy told me you won\u2019t even let him see any of your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get better, I will,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone who doesn\u2019t want you to open your store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve Brenner would love to see me fail, but I don\u2019t think he would hurt me or my brother just to get me to leave town. He even asked me out on a date once. He\u2019s a bother really. He doesn\u2019t like to hear the word no\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you didn\u2019t go out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t like him at all. Money means everything to him. He heads the Holy Oaks Advancement Society. Honest, that\u2019s what they call themselves, even though there are only two of them.\u201d She thought to add, \u201cSteve Brenner is a realtor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other member of this society?\u201d Nick asked as he added Brenner\u2019s name to the list.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Lloyd MacGovern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do the two of them want to do to advance Holy Oaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to buy all the buildings around the square for some developers,\u201d she said. \u201cSteve\u2019s the brains in the scheme, the one trying to put it all together. Even if an owner sold directly to the developers, Steve and the sheriff would get a commission. It\u2019s the way Steve set it up, or so I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do the developers want the property for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to mow down all those beautiful old buildings and put up housing for the college expansion. Huge, ugly apartments for married students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t the developers build them somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they could, but they also plan to put in a superstore right outside of town,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf they get rid of all the shops around the square . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve cornered the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the developers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffen, Inc.,\u201d she answered. \u201cI haven\u2019t met any of them. They\u2019re based in Atlanta. Steve\u2019s their spokesman. They\u2019re offering the owners a lot of money . . . top dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone else besides you holding out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people in town who want to see the buildings restored and not torn down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but how many of them own businesses around the square?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAs of last Friday there were four still on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others caved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to draw a diagram for me and write in all the names of the owners. You can do it later,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling it the town square, but it\u2019s actually a three-sided square. A little park leads in on the fourth side. There\u2019s a lovely old fountain. It\u2019s at least sixty, maybe seventy years old, but it still works . . . and there\u2019s a bandstand. During the summer months, the local musicians get together every Saturday night and play there. It really is charming, Nick.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and began to recall the names of those who had signed on with Griffen, starting with the struggling hardware store owner.</p><p>\u201cMargaret Stamp owns a little bakery in the center block,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd Conrad Kellogg owns the town pharmacy. He\u2019s on the block directly across from me. It\u2019s critical that they hold firm, because if one of them sells, Griffen can tear down their block, and once one apartment building goes up, the square\u2019s lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when Tommy gets transferred and leaves Holy Oaks? Will you sell your store then and follow him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stay where I am. I like Holy Oaks. I\u2019m comfortable there. It has a rich history, and people care about one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine living in a little town. I\u2019d go nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt . . . safe . . . until this happened. I believed that in a small town you knew who your enemies were. I guess I was wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you moved there after Tommy got so sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe almost died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he recovered. You could have taken a leave of absence from the gallery in Chicago and gone back there after Tommy got better, but you quit instead. How come?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the plate and nervously straightened the silverware on the table. \u201cI wasn\u2019t running to my brother. I was running away from a very uncomfortable situation. It was a . . . personal matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLaurant, I warned you that I was going to invade your privacy, remember?

I won\u2019t tell your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. It was just so . . . stupid,\u201d she said, glancing up at Nick again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met this man in Chicago. In fact, I worked for him. We dated for a little while, and I thought I was falling in love with him. That\u2019s what was stupid. He turned out to be . . .\u201d</p> <p>She was having trouble coming up with the perfect word to describe the man who had betrayed her. Nick came to her aid. \u201cSlime? Scum? Bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlime,\u201d she decided. \u201cYes, he was definitely slime.\u201d</p><p>He turned a page in his notepad and asked her for the man\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cJoel Patterson,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe was head of the department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . ? What happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI found him in bed with another woman, a friend, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. At least it wasn\u2019t funny at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose it was,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSorry, I wasn\u2019t being very sensitive, was I? Who was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a woman who worked for the gallery. Their affair didn\u2019t last long. She\u2019s involved with someone else now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me her name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to check her out too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristine Winters.\u201d</p><p>He wrote her name on his pad, then looked at Laurant. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Patterson for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cJust still feeling stupid. Do you know that he had the gall to blame me?\u201d</p><p>Nick lifted his gaze from the writing pad and gave her a sideways glance. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p> <p>His astonished expression made her smile. \u201cIt\u2019s true. He told me it was all my fault that he went to bed with Christine. \u2018Men have needs,\u2019\u201d she quoted.</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t putting out, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a quaint way of stating it. No, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you loved him. Why didn\u2019t you go to bed with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you justifying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. The guy\u2019s a jerk. I was just curious, that\u2019s all. You said you loved him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said I thought I was falling in love with him,\u201d she corrected as she pulled the croissant apart and reached for the jam. \u201cI was being very practical,\u201d she explained. \u201cJoel and I shared the same interests, and I thought we had similar values. I was wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question. Why didn\u2019t you go to bed with him?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t skirt the issue any longer. \u201cI was waiting for . . . I wanted . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little magic. A spark anyway. There should be . . . shouldn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, there should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but I couldn\u2019t make myself feel . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant, it\u2019s either there or it isn\u2019t. You can\u2019t manufacture it.\u201d</p><p>She laid the jam knife on her plate, then dropped her hands in her lap and slumped against the back of the chair. \u201cI\u2019m not very good with relationships,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid Patterson tell you that?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cHe really messed with your head, didn\u2019t he? What else did good old Joel tell you when he was busy blaming you for driving him to another woman?\u201d</p><p>She could tell he was getting angry, and the fact that it was on her behalf made her feel good. \u201cHe said my heart was made of ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that nonsense, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she said. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been very reserved. Maybe I am a little cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>His denial was given with conviction, as though he knew something she didn\u2019t. She would have asked him to explain, but their conversation was interrupted when the phone rang and Nick got up to answer it.</p><p>\u201cThat was Noah,\u201d he said when he returned. \u201cPete\u2019s plane just landed. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Fifteen minutes after Noah\u2019s phone call, Nick was driving her back to the rectory.</p><p>\u201cYour transmission\u2019s slipping,\u201d he commented as they started the climb up Southwest Trafficway. \u201cI noticed it last night, but I was hoping I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to have it looked at again.\u201d</p><p>It was another hot, humid day. The air-conditioning wasn\u2019t cooling the car well at all, and so she rolled down her window.</p><p>\u201cI think your compressor\u2019s had it too,\u201d he told her. \u201cShe\u2019s got over ninety thousand miles on her, Laurant. It\u2019s time to trade her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade her in?\u201d she repeated, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a car, Nick, not a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like to bond with their machines,\u201d he explained. \u201cGood men coddle them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that another one of the secrets you boys share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot boys,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMen. Manly men.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDoes Dr. Morganstern realize he has a nut working for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he isn\u2019t nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d She turned serious when she added, \u201cI imagine he\u2019s heard and seen some terrible things, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well it goes with the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy worries about you.\u201d</p><p>They had just started up another steep incline and Nick was listening to the grinding sound as the transmission tried to shift gears. Wincing over the god-awful noise, he made up his mind to have a mechanic look her over before Laurant drove the car again. She was damned lucky she hadn\u2019t gotten stranded on the highway.</p><p>He glanced at her over the top of his sunglasses. \u201cTommy wants me to get married and settle down,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thinks a family will make my life more normal. It isn\u2019t going to happen though. With the work I do, marriage isn\u2019t in the equation, and having children of my own . . . that\u2019s definitely out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I know I\u2019d ruin them. If I had any of my own, I wouldn\u2019t let them out of my sight. Yeah, I\u2019d ruin them all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d be afraid that something might happen to them . . . because you\u2019ve seen\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cSomething like that. What about you? Do you want to get married and have a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do . . . someday. I don\u2019t want just one child though. I want a houseful of them and I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s fashionable or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many constitute a houseful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour or five or maybe even six. Does Dr. Morganstern have any children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he and Katie weren\u2019t able to have any, but they do have lots of nieces and nephews, and they always have someone camping out at their house.\u201d</p><p>She watched Nick for a moment. \u201cWhy do you keep looking in the rearview mirror?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cautious driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re checking to make sure no one\u2019s following us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your gun?\u201d</p><p>With his left hand he lifted the holster he\u2019d wedged between the seat and the door. \u201cNever leave home without it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to put it on when we reach the rectory. Rules,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Propping her arm on the window, she stared out at the old buildings along the avenue. She was thinking about Dr. Morganstern, wondering what he was going to be like, if he would be reasonable when she told him what she wanted to do. She had already decided to go around Tommy and Nick\u2014both were too emotionally involved to be practical about the situation\u2014but she hoped that the doctor would understand and help her, with or without her brother\u2019s cooperation.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, we\u2019ll finish making that list later,\u201d Nick said. \u201cWe probably should have started it last night, but you were pretty wiped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout last night . . . I was wondering . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked when she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep while you were watching a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a game, the game. The Stanley Cup play-offs,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cDid you watch all of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the bitter end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what did you do?\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was trying to find out, but the devil in him decided to make her ask. \u201cI slept,\u201d he answered.</p><p>A long minute passed. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice was self-assured. His aim, no doubt, was to make her blush, and she decided it was high time she turned the tables on him. She was always prim and proper, but not this time. \u201cSo was it good for you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSure was. I slept like a baby. Now I\u2019m worried though. What\u2019s your brother gonna say when I tell him I slept with his sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>They reached Mercy, and Nick parked the car in front of the church so that he wouldn\u2019t interrupt the basketball game in progress. They spotted Noah and Tommy right away. They were standing nose to nose in the center of a group of teenagers. Tommy was wearing a pair of khaki shorts and a white polo shirt. Noah had on torn jeans, a black T-shirt, and his brown leather shoulder holster and gun. The expression on his face was downright menacing. It didn\u2019t take Laurant long to figure out why. Tommy was holding a whistle to his lips, and Noah was in his face, arguing over a call he\u2019d made. Her stubborn brother had never been one to back down, and he was now giving as good as he was getting. His face was beet red, and he was being every bit as belligerent as Noah. The boys were clustered around her brother like a small legion of warriors ready to strike on command.</p><p>Laurant got out of the car before Nick had time to open the door for her. She saw him slip on his gun and tried not to let it bother her.</p><p>\u201cI thought Tommy had to go to the hospital for more tests today,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after ten now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably already been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you do something about that?\u201d she asked with a nod toward Noah, who had just poked Tommy in the chest. Her brother retaliated by blowing his whistle in Noah\u2019s face.</p><p>Nick burst out laughing. \u201cLook at the boys\u2019 faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t like Noah shouting at their priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just having some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the boys understand that. Noah\u2019s outnumbered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can hold his own,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going inside,\u201d she said, waving to her brother as she crossed the parking lot. She saw Monsignor waiting for her in the open doorway and hurried toward him.</p><p>Noah spotted her out of the corner of his eye. He stopped shouting in midinsult and turned his back on Tommy so he could get a better view.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d Tommy demanded, still panting from the shouting match.</p><p>\u201cLaurant,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cShe\u2019s got a great body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about his sister,\u201d Nick reminded him, giving his shoulder a shove from behind.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re related. She\u2019s so damned pretty and sweet, and he\u2019s such a jerk. By the way, your friend\u2019s as blind as a bat,\u201d he added. \u201cHe can\u2019t even tell a ball\u2019s out of bounds when the line\u2019s two feet away from him.\u201d</p><p>The shouting match started all over again.</p><p>Ten minutes later the three of them came lumbering inside. Tommy was mopping his brow with the edge of his shirt, but Nick and Noah hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat. They were all laughing as they headed for the kitchen to get something to drink.</p><p>Laurant stepped back into the living room to get out of their way, shifting the heavy laundry basket she was holding to her other hip.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you offered those kids beers,\u201d Tommy chided.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot out,\u201d Noah defended. \u201cI figured they\u2019d want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re underage,\u201d Tommy pointed out in exasperation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not even noon yet.\u201d</p><p>Nick winked at her as he passed her again, carrying a six-pack of Coke. Noah told Tommy to stay inside while he and Nick talked to the boys on the porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d she asked her brother.</p><p>\u201cOne of the boys told Monsignor he might have seen the car the guy was driving Saturday, so Nick is talking to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the boy tell the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, none of the kids talk to the police,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut they all heard what happened, and as Frankie\u2014he\u2019s the leader of the pack\u2014so eloquently put it, \u2018Nobody\u2019s gonna come in our \u2018f\u2019\u2019ing parish and mess with one of our \u2018f\u2019\u2019ing priests.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Laurant\u2019s eyes widened. Tommy nodded. \u201cFrankie\u2019s a good kid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he has to keep up appearances. Being tough is important to all of them. Anyway, they started talking to their friends. They all hang out on the street, day and night, and one did remember seeing a strange van parked on Thirteenth Street, next to that empty lot. Nick\u2019s hoping he can get a description of the guy driving. Keep your fingers crossed,\u201d he added. Then, switching the subject, he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing with the laundry basket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand waiting. I have to keep busy, so I asked Monsignor if I could help with anything.\u201d</p><p>Tommy opened the door to the basement, turned on the light, and watched her go down the wooden steps.</p><p>Dr. Morganstern arrived five minutes later. She could hear him talking when she came up the stairs. The men were standing together in the front hall. His agents were a full head taller, and so was Tommy, but they were all deferentially \u201csiring\u201d him to death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laurant was nervous and apprehensive about meeting the doctor, and she hoped it didn\u2019t show when Nick pulled her forward to introduce her.</p><p>He shook her hand, insisted she call him Pete, and then said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go sit down and figure out what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively she looked at Nick. He gave her a quick nod, and she followed Tommy into the living room. Morganstern stayed behind to speak to his agents. He spoke to Nick first, but in such a low voice, Laurant couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. Then he turned to Noah, and whatever he said to him so startled the agent he suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cGod will strike me dead, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd lose one of his trusted soldiers? I think not,\u201d Pete responded as he led the two men into the living room. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m fully convinced God has a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Pete placed his briefcase on the table and flipped open the latches. Nick dropped down on the sofa next to Laurant, and Noah stood behind his superior, acting like a sentry, with his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering, sir, if you\u2019d found out anything significant from that profiler you assigned to the case,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWhat was his name, Nick?\u201d</p><p>The doctor answered the question. \u201cHis name is George Walker, and yes, he does have a few ideas that can help us. Nothing concrete unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t profilers figure things out from crime scenes?\u201d Tommy asked. \u201cI read somewhere that that\u2019s how they get their information.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d Pete agreed. \u201cHowever, there are other ways too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the tape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy, will you please stop pacing around and sit down,\u201d Laurant said.</p><p>Her brother motioned for her to move closer to Nick and then sat down on her other side. He didn\u2019t know quite how to phrase the question he wanted to ask, and so he decided to be blunt.</p><p>\u201cExactly why are you here, Pete?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very happy that you\u2019re here,\u201d Laurant interjected so that the doctor wouldn\u2019t think her brother was as rude as he sounded. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Tommy?\u201d she added as she nudged him in the side.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he agreed. \u201cPete knows I appreciate his help. We go way back, don\u2019t we?\u201d he asked the psychiatrist.</p><p>Pete nodded. Tommy turned to Laurant to explain. \u201cI called Pete a couple of years ago about a troubled kid I was trying to help. It was out of my league, and Pete helped get him into a treatment center. That was the first time I used my connection through Nick, but since then, Pete\u2019s come through for me with three other difficult cases. You never say no to me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to,\u201d Pete answered. \u201cI came here today to sit down with you, Tom. I wanted to review what happened in the confessional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard the tape,\u201d Tommy reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have, and it\u2019s been very helpful with the investigation. However, it doesn\u2019t tell me what you were thinking while our unsub was talking. I\u2019d like to take you through it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told Nick everything I remember. I\u2019ve gone over it at least ten times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Pete will be asking different questions,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. If you think it will help, I\u2019ll go through it again.\u201d</p><p>Pete smiled. \u201cNoah, why don\u2019t you and Laurant wait in the other room. Nick, I\u2019d like you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Laurant followed Noah to the door then turned back just as Pete was opening his briefcase. \u201cPete? When you\u2019re finished, may I have a word in private with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled the French doors closed behind them. Monsignor was coming down the steps from the second floor with a basket of dirty linens. Without a word Laurant took the basket from him and headed down to the basement again. She could hear her brother\u2019s laughter and assumed the questioning hadn\u2019t begun yet.</p><p>Pete acted as though he had all the time in the world. He started by asking Tommy if he missed playing football. Tommy was sitting on the edge of his seat, obviously tense and worried. Pete eased him into the discussion about the confession, and by the time their talk had ended, they had two more little bits of information that might prove helpful. The unsub had been wearing Calvin Klein\u2019s Obsession. Tommy had forgotten about that. And, until now, he\u2019d also forgotten about a click he had heard. He had assumed the man was snapping his fingers to get his attention. Pete suggested that the click was actually the recorder being turned on.</p><p>Pete ended the conference when he stood. \u201cWhen you return to Holy Oaks, I would rather you didn\u2019t hear confession for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we\u2019ve devised a trap to snare him.\u201d</p><p>Tommy glanced at Nick and then back to Pete again. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to come back to confession, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly think he\u2019ll try,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>Tommy shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening. It\u2019s too risky for him.\u201d</p><p>Nick, who had been unusually silent until now, spoke up. \u201cHe\u2019ll see it as a challenge. He thinks he\u2019s vastly superior to all the rest of us, remember? He\u2019s going to want to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, like it or not, he\u2019s established a relationship with you, and I believe he\u2019s going to want to keep you apprised of what he\u2019s been up to,\u201d Pete said. \u201cOne thing I know for certain now,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis unsub is going to go to any lengths necessary to talk to you again. He wants your admiration, but he also wants your loathing and fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many ways, you\u2019re the perfect partner in his plan,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants someone to appreciate how smart he is.\u201d</p><p>Tommy said, \u201cI know you think I\u2019m being stubborn about this, but I gotta tell you I still think you\u2019re wrong about this guy. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me that he would try to contact me again. I\u2019ve listened to your arguments and I know you\u2019re experts . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Nick prodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve forgotten why he came to me in the first place. He wanted absolution and he didn\u2019t get it. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Pete gave him a sympathetic look. \u201cNo, he came to you because you\u2019re Laurant\u2019s brother,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he never wanted forgiveness,\u201d he added softly. \u201cHe was mocking the church, the sacrament, and he was mocking you, Tom, especially you.\u201d</p><p>Tommy looked miserable. \u201cYou do realize he almost got Monsignor McKindry in that confessional. I volunteered for the duty at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to McKindry,\u201d Pete said. \u201cHe knew you were inside the confessional before he even walked into the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably watched you cross the parking lot and go inside,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnd if Monsignor had taken the duty, then he would have patiently waited for another opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s right,\u201d Pete said. \u201cThis man is organized and very patient. He\u2019s put a lot of time and effort into stalking you and your sister.\u201d</p><p>Something Pete had said earlier began to nag Tommy and he asked, \u201cWhat did you mean when you said he was giving us mixed messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant that he\u2019s deliberately trying to make us run in five different directions,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn the tape he\u2019s telling us he\u2019s a stalker, maybe a serial killer. He\u2019s telling us he\u2019s just getting started, but then he implies that he\u2019s been at it a long time. He says he\u2019s killed one woman, but he\u2019s hinted at the possibility that there have been others. He laughed, if you\u2019ll recall, when he told you that he\u2019d only hurt the women before Millicent. Now it\u2019s our job to figure out what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, it could all be lies or it could all be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy, try to understand that with these creeps, it\u2019s always about fantasies. Always,\u201d Nick repeated emphatically. \u201cThe fantasy is what is driving this unsub. It could all still be in his head, but we have to assume that Millicent did exist and that he tortured and killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he wants to act out his fantasy with Laurant?\u201d</p><p>Pete nodded. \u201cThe situation is urgent. He needs a reason to talk to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Pete\u2019s eyes, he noticed, were edged with sadness now. \u201cIf what he told us is true, then I\u2019m certain he\u2019s out there looking for another woman right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d try to find a substitute to replace Laurant . . . temporarily,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Tommy bowed his head. \u201cDear God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd then he\u2019ll want to confess his sins, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019ll want to brag.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Tiffany Tara Tyler was a slut and proud of it. She\u2019d learned a long time ago that she was going to have to relax her moral code of behavior if she was ever going to get anyplace in this cold, hard world. Besides, not being a prude had carried her a long way from the trailer park in Sugar Creek\u2014she was wearing the proof. And nothing, not even a blown-out tire on her rusted 1982 Chevy Caprice, was going to get her down. She was riding high and feeling good, and all because she was as sure as shit that her life was about to undergo a radical change. Oh, she knew she was always going to be a Jezebel in her mother\u2019s estimation\u2014she\u2019d decided her daughter was damned to the eternal fires of hell after she\u2019d caught her in the bathroom with Kenny Martin\u2014but Tiffany had made up her mind not to care a hoot what her crazy, old, worn-out mother thought of her anymore. She knew where her real talent lay, and she believed with all her heart that if she worked hard enough, she would succeed. Who knew? Maybe by the time she was thirty, twelve long years from now, she might even be a millionaire like that Heidi Fleiss madam she so admired because she got to meet all those famous movie stars. Tiffany bet they treated Heidi just like a star too, and maybe, after she finished ha**ng s*x with them, they even took her out to dinner at one of those fancy, expensive restaurants.</p><p>Tiffany remembered the exact moment her life experienced an epiphany\u2014she\u2019d looked that word up in the dictionary after reading the article in Mademoiselle magazine. She\u2019d been at Suzie\u2019s Hair Salon, getting a perm that fried her already fried, unnaturally blond, frizzy, long hair. To take her mind off her painful burning scalp, she\u2019d picked up the magazine and begun to read the article that was all but screaming at her, \u201cKnow Your Assets.\u201d The message couldn\u2019t have been any more clear to her. Do what you\u2019re good at. Change what you don\u2019t like about yourself. And use your assets to get what you want. But, most of all, go for it.</p><p>She took every word to heart, and to this day she carried the stolen magazine with her wherever she went. It was always tucked inside her Vuitton rip-off bag next to the brand-new mobile phone she\u2019d spent two whole hundred dollars on so she could get three months\u2019 free phone service, as long as it was in the U.S. of A.</p><p>Tiffany liked to think she was gifted with ESP, and after reading that article, she could plainly see she was destined for great things. It was all going to begin happening for her in just two days\u2019 time when she checked herself into the Holidome. The motel\u2019s rates were a little steep, but it was worth it. The Holidome sat across the highway from the doctor\u2019s office, and she wouldn\u2019t have so far to walk after the surgery was done.</p><p>Because she\u2019d bought herself the phone\u2014she\u2019d seen a picture of Heidi Fleiss with a mobile phone in her hand and figured it was an important asset every girl ought to have if she was going to go places\u2014she was still shy two hundred dollars of the twenty-four hundred she needed to get her boob job. She was carrying all of the twenty-two hundred with her. She didn\u2019t dare take the chance of hiding any of her money in the trailer, where her stepfather could sniff it out like a trained hound dog with his beet-red, twice-broken, alkie nose. He\u2019d just go on another one of his drunken sprees, which always ended up in jail. If he didn\u2019t find it, her mother certainly would. She was always snooping through Tiffany\u2019s things looking for more damning evidence to prove her daughter was still a whore. Then she\u2019d feel it was her duty to donate all the cash to that screaming redemption preacher she watched on television all the time. No, Tiffany didn\u2019t take any chances with the hard-earned money that guaranteed to change her future. She had it all with her and all in cash. She\u2019d divided the money in half and stuffed eleven hundred dollars into each one of her size 32AA Wonderbra cups, which weren\u2019t doing anything remotely wonderful for her figure, as flat-chested as she was. New boobs were going to change all that, of course. She was sure of it.</p><p>Going for it and changing what you could change\u2014that\u2019s what success was all about. Like most eighteen-year-old girls, she had big dreams. She had always been very goal oriented, and big boobs were an integral part of her future plans. She\u2019d never told anyone, not even her best friend, Louann, that her biggest dream of all was to be the centerfold in Playboy magazine. Penthouse was a step down, and so was Hustler, but she\u2019d settle for either one of those centerfolds too. All the men in Sugar Creek read those magazines\u2014well, they didn\u2019t really read them. They took them into the bathroom with them so they could get off while they gawked at na*ed women, and she just knew their eyes were going to bug right out of their heads when they saw her in all her na*ed beauty smiling coyly out at them with her new size 36D boobs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any idea what kind of money could be made in centerfold work, but it had to be a lot more than she was making now lap dancing. She was never the customer\u2019s first choice, and she knew it had to be because she was so flat-chested. Vera, one of the other girls, always made three times what she did in tips, but then Vera was full-figured, and the men liked to burrow their faces in between her enormous boobs. Tiffany had had to supplement her income by giving blow jobs out back, behind the Dumpster. She was real talented with her mouth\u2014just ask any of the boys back in Sugar Creek, or for that matter the doctor who was going to give her new boobs. He\u2019d been so impressed with her skill, he\u2019d reduced the price of the implants. Tiffany guessed she\u2019d have to impress the doctor again to get a further discount of the two hundred dollars she was lacking, and if he balked about it, she\u2019d just have to threaten to have a chat with his prim little wife, who had been sitting a couple of feet away at the front desk answering the doctor\u2019s phone while Tiffany was inside the cubicle lathering up the good doctor\u2019s privates. One way or another, she was going to get her new size 36D boobs in just two days\u2019 time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flat tire was a temporary setback, and as she stood on the side of the highway furiously working the wad of gum in her mouth, she spotted a van coming toward her. She wasn\u2019t going to have to use her new phone to call a tow service after all. Tugging her hot pink, spandex skirt down, she propped her hand on the tilt of her hip, balanced herself regally on the hot pink stiletto heels that killed her feet but made her legs look good, and pretended to be a helpless woman in need of assistance.</p><p>She hoped a man was driving the van because she could always get any man to do anything she wanted once he understood how talented she was. Squinting into the sun, she let out a loud sigh of relief when the van pulled to a stop behind her car and she saw the handsome man smiling at her.</p><p>Tiffany Tara Tyler straightened up, put on her best come-hither expression, and sashayed over to the van.</p><p>Just as she had predicted, her life was about to radically change.</p> <p>Forever.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>This was about as close as Laurant was ever going to get to a therapy session with a psychiatrist. There weren\u2019t any of those in Holy Oaks. There were, however, several people she knew who could have benefited from a couple of long talks with a \u201chead\u201d doctor. Emma May Brie\u2014as in the cheese\u2014immediately came to mind. She was a perfect candidate for analysis. The sweet, but strange, woman wore a blue shower cap decorated with white daisies as a hat everywhere she went, rain or shine. She took if off for only one hour on Tuesday mornings when she got her hair done at Madge\u2019s Magic, the local beauty shop that guaranteed to give every customer \u201cvolume.\u201d Emma May wasn\u2019t the exception to their promise. When she stepped outside the shop, her thinning gray hair was indeed twice the size, that is, until she put her daisy cap on and squished it all down.</p><p>There were other residents who could also use a good psychiatrist, but the fact was, if the renowned Dr. Morganstern decided to go into private practice and hang his shingle out on Main Street, no one would ever go see him. It just wasn\u2019t done. Problems were never discussed with outsiders, and anyone who was thought to be peculiar was simply given a wide path when he was having one of his \u201cspells.\u201d</p><p>What was taking Pete so long? He\u2019d asked her to wait for him in the dining room, but that had been at least ten minutes ago, and she was now so fidgety she couldn\u2019t sit still. Just as she made up her mind to go back downstairs and finish sorting the laundry, the swinging door from the kitchen opened.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you wait,\u201d Pete said as he entered, \u201cbut Monsignor and I got to talking and I didn\u2019t want to interrupt a story he was telling me about one of his parishioners.\u201d</p><p>He closed the double doors leading to the hallway to insure privacy.</p><p>Although she had requested the meeting, she was suddenly dreading it because she knew what she wanted to ask him, and part of her was worried sick that he would agree.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d he remarked as he sat down.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to sit still and was tapping her foot against the hardwood floor so vigorously her knee was making the table wobble. When she realized what a telltale sign that was about her mental state, she forced herself to stop. It was impossible to relax, so she sat ramrod straight, as stiff as a corpse, in the uncomfortable chair that made a squeaky sound of protest every time she moved.</p><p>Shards of sunlight filtered into the room through the old-fashioned, Victorian lace curtains, and the air smelled faintly of overly ripe apples. There was a large oriental bowl filled with fruit in the center of the table.</p> <p>Pete didn\u2019t show any signs of rushing. He opened the conversation by asking her how she was holding up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing all right.\u201d Could he tell she was lying?</p><p>Silence followed her response. He continued to patiently wait for her to gather her thoughts and tell him what was on her mind. She felt like a fool because she was having so much trouble getting the words out. What had seemed like a perfectly sound plan a half hour ago now seemed deranged.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever skied?\u201d</p><p>If Pete was surprised by the question, he didn\u2019t let it show. \u201cNo, as a matter of fact, I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve always wanted to try it though. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I used to ski all the time. The school I attended was surrounded by mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou attended boarding school in Switzerland, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd I\u2019d go up into the mountains every chance I could. I love skiing, and I actually got pretty good at it. Since I\u2019ve been in America, I\u2019ve gone to the slopes in Colorado a few times. I\u2019ll always remember how it felt that very first time I took the lift up to the top of a black . . . they rate the slopes by degree of difficulty, you see. Green is for beginners, blue is for the intermediate skier, and the blacks are reserved for the experienced who want more of a challenge. There are other ratings too, like diamonds and double diamonds,\u201d she rambled on. \u201cAnyway, the first time I stood on the edge of what appeared to be a sheer drop-off, I took the longest time gathering my courage to push off. I felt like I was standing on the cliffs of Dover. It looked that steep to me. I was terrified . . . but determined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd talking to me is like standing on that precipice again?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, it is . . . because I know that, like that mountaintop, once I push off, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>There was an uncomfortable pause before Laurant started again. \u201cI guess I should start by being completely honest, shouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019d be wasting your time otherwise. I told you I was doing all right, but that wasn\u2019t true. I\u2019m a mess inside, and I feel like I\u2019m tied in a thousand knots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAll I can think about is . . . him. My concentration\u2019s shot,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I was doing the laundry for Monsignor, I was thinking about what I wanted to ask you, and I accidentally poured an entire bottle of bleach in with the sheets before I realized what I was doing. A very large bottle of bleach,\u201d she emphasized.</p><p>Pete smiled. \u201cThink of the positive. They\u2019ll be nice and white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were green and blue stripe when I put them in the washer.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to buy him a new pair,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as you can see, I\u2019m having a little trouble . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying focused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My mind\u2019s racing, and I feel so . . . guilty.\u201d</p><p>Monsignor knocked on the door and poked his head inside.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, I\u2019m heading over to the hospital to make my rounds. I shouldn\u2019t be gone long, and Mrs. Krowski will be here soon. Would you mind catching the phone calls until she arrives? Father Tom can handle any emergencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Monsignor.\u201d</p><p>Pete stood. \u201cJust a minute, Monsignor.\u201d</p><p>Excusing himself, he went into the hall and called for Noah. Laurant heard footsteps on the stairs and then Pete spoke again. \u201cAsk Agent Seaton to drive Monsignor and stay with him.\u201d</p><p>The old priest balked at the idea of having an escort, arguing that he could drive his own car, but Pete gently cut him off and firmly insisted that the agent accompany him. Monsignor realized it was pointless to argue and reluctantly agreed.</p><p>Apologizing, Pete returned to Laurant. Nick followed him into the dining room, closed the door behind him, and then leaned against it. Folding his arms across his chest, he winked at her, and his body language told her in no uncertain terms that he wasn\u2019t planning on leaving anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cDid you wish to speak to Pete?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNick asked to join us,\u201d Pete said. \u201cI told him it was up to you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a moment. \u201cOkay. But, Nick,\u201d she demanded, looking him right in the eye, \u201cI would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t interrupt or argue when you hear what I have to say. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>Pete seized control of the conversation then. \u201cYou said you were feeling guilty. Why?\u201d</p><p>Deciding to ignore Nick, she stared at the delicate rose pattern on the oriental bowl when she answered. \u201cI want to run away and hide until you catch him, and I\u2019m ashamed because I feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to feel ashamed about, and your desire to run away is quite natural,\u201d Pete said. \u201cI\u2019m certain I\u2019d feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t buying that. \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. My reaction is cowardly and selfish.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly feeling restless, she got up and walked over to the front window. Lifting the lace curtain, she looked outside just as Monsignor was getting into the passenger seat of a black sedan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself,\u201d Pete said. \u201cFear isn\u2019t a flaw, Laurant. It\u2019s a safety mechanism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out there now . . . looking for another woman, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Neither Pete nor Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cGet away from the window,\u201d Nick ordered.</p><p>She immediately stepped back and let go of her tight grip on the curtain.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried he\u2019s watching the rectory now?\u201d She took a step toward Nick. \u201cYou told me you thought he\u2019d accomplished what he came here to do and that he was on his way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick corrected. \u201cI told you he was probably gone. We aren\u2019t taking any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why Monsignor has an escort today? Yes, of course it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you and Tom are here, Monsignor will have an agent watching out for him,\u201d Pete added.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re putting him at risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a precaution,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cThis man . . . he\u2019s going to kill another woman soon, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Pete chose his words carefully. \u201cUntil we can prove otherwise, we must assume he was telling Tom the truth. Therefore, the answer is yes, he\u2019s going to take another woman soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll torture her and kill her.\u201d The room seemed to be closing in on her, and she took a deep breath in an attempt to collect herself. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t stop with just one more, will he? He\u2019s going to keep on killing and killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and sit down, Laurant,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>She did as he requested, sitting sideways in the chair to face him. Her hands were clasped on her knees. \u201cI have a plan.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re ready to push off that mountaintop, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI still want to run away,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Out of the corner of her eye she saw Nick straighten. \u201cI want to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will get him,\u201d Pete assured her.</p><p>\u201cBut I can help you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have to help. For a lot of reasons,\u201d she added. \u201cFirst and foremost are those women out there who don\u2019t have an inkling that this monster is looking for his next victim. They\u2019re the overriding reason I\u2019m not going to hide.\u201d</p><p>Pete was frowning in anticipation. When he began to shake his head, she knew he had guessed what she wanted to do, and so she hurried to explain before he put an end to the discussion.</p><p>\u201cI can be very stubborn and determined, and once I make a decision, I stick to it. All my life other people have tried to control what I do. After my mother died, the lawyers handling the trust made all the decisions for me. That made sense when I was young, but as I got older, I began to resent their totalitarian tactics. They certainly weren\u2019t interested in how I felt, and I wanted to at least have some input in the decision making, but that wasn\u2019t allowed. They decided what schools I would attend, where I would live, and how much or how little I could spend.\u201d</p><p>She paused to take a quick breath and then continued. \u201cIt took me a long time to get out from under their control, but I finally managed it, and I\u2019ve found a place where I feel that I belong . . . really belong. Now this monster is trying to take that away from me. I can\u2019t let him do that. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse me,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cSet a trap and use me to get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d Nick exploded.</p><p>She heard the anger in Nick\u2019s voice but tried to ignore him. She kept her gaze fixed on Pete. \u201cHelp me convince my brother that I should go back to Holy Oaks. That\u2019s the first step,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no idea how scared I am, but the way I see it . . . I don\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you don\u2019t,\u201d Nick argued.</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cThe only way I can get my life back is to take control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question,\u201d Nick insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t out of the question,\u201d she said, surprised at how calm she sounded. \u201cPete, if I go back home after he\u2019s told my brother to hide me away, won\u2019t he see it as a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure he will,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThis is a game to him. Otherwise, why would he have mentioned Nick? He knows Nick is with the FBI, and he wants to prove that he is much more intelligent than any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen if I go back to Holy Oaks, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m playing into his hand, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re going back until this bastard is either dead or behind bars,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWill you please let me finish and then you can argue?\u201d</p><p>She kept a wary eye on him. He looked like he wanted to pluck her out of her chair, drag her into the hall, and shake some sense into her. It was just the resistance she had expected.</p><p>\u201cYou can get into his mind, Pete. You can figure out what buttons to push and make him come after me, and if I make him angry enough . . . then he\u2019ll leave those other women alone. At least that\u2019s my hope. You and Nick could set a trap. You do this sort of thing all the time, don\u2019t you? And Holy Oaks is a small town. There\u2019s only one major highway leading in and out. I don\u2019t think it would be too difficult to close the town, if you needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant, do you realize\u2014\u201d Pete began.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know what could happen, and I assure you I won\u2019t take any chances. I\u2019ll do whatever you tell me to do. I promise. Just let me help you catch him before he kills again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing you as bait,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered quietly. \u201cYes,\u201d she repeated resolutely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your ever loving mind. You do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe plan makes sense,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, calm down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPete, we\u2019re talking about putting my best friend\u2019s little sister into a situation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stop thinking of me as Tommy\u2019s sister,\u201d she suggested. \u201cAnd start thinking like an agent. This is a golden opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing you as bait.\u201d He was repeating Pete\u2019s statement, but unlike his superior, his voice wasn\u2019t calm. Nick\u2019s bordered on a roar.</p><p>\u201cWill you please lower your voice? I don\u2019t want Tommy to hear about this until we\u2019ve made a decision.\u201d</p><p>Nick glared at her and began to pace around the room. Laurant was depending on Pete now to become her ally because, as bad as Nick was taking her plan, she knew her brother\u2019s reaction was going to be ten times worse.</p> <p>She knew she had to convince Pete. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend the rest of my life hiding. We both know you wouldn\u2019t even be here if it weren\u2019t for Nick and Tommy. With all the work you have to do, you couldn\u2019t possibly drop everything and go running every time you heard about a threat. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there aren\u2019t enough of us to handle the load these days,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYour time\u2019s valuable, and so I thought that maybe we could speed up this man\u2019s agenda.\u201d</p><p>She could have sworn she saw a speculative gleam appear in the doctor\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you proposing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make him crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Nick had paused in his pacing and was staring at her with an incredulous look on his face. \u201cHe\u2019s already crazy,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd so are you if you think Tommy and I are going to let you put yourself in the middle of his playground. Hell no, Laurant. It isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to Pete. \u201cWhat would do it? What would push him over the edge? How could we make him so angry he\u2019ll get careless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving listened to the tape, I can tell you that this unsub has quite an ego, and it\u2019s important to him that the world believe he\u2019s intelligent. It would infuriate him if he heard any criticism at all. If you were to discuss him openly in town, if you were to tell everyone about this fool of a man, then I believe he would speed things up. He\u2019d want to get to you quickly just to shut you up. Mock him, and you\u2019ll incite him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else could I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake him jealous,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he thought you were romantically and intimately involved with another man, then he would view that as a betrayal.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI could make him jealous. I know I could. Remember what he said on the tape? How Millicent betrayed him by flirting with other men, and he had to punish her? I could flirt with every man in town.\u201d</p><p>Pete shook his head. \u201cI believe it would be more effective if there was just one man, and the unsub believed you loved him.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to continue. Pete began to drum his fingers on the table while he considered the possibilities.</p> <p>\u201cHe mentioned Nick by name. He dared Tommy to get the FBI involved, so it\u2019s apparent he wants to play his game with us.\u201d Pete rubbed his jaw. \u201cLet\u2019s play into his hand until we see where it leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him think he\u2019s calling the shots,\u201d Pete explained. \u201cI wonder how he would feel if he thought his confession brought you and Nick together romantically. His carefully thought-out game would backfire, and he\u2019d certainly feel like a fool. It\u2019s an interesting idea.\u201d He nodded and added, \u201cYou and Nick should behave like a couple in love. That should push the unsub right over the edge.\u201d Pete qualified his suggestion when he said, \u201cIf he is what he says he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick . . . ,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to buy it,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe brings us together and we fall in love overnight? I\u2019m telling you, Pete, it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t care if he believes it or not,\u201d Pete patiently explained. \u201cThe goal is to taunt him and his little game. If you and Laurant act like lovers, he\u2019ll believe you\u2019re mocking him. He won\u2019t like it one little bit. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s too risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being reasonable,\u201d Laurant protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being reasonable? You don\u2019t have a clue what these creeps are capable of . . . not a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know what they can do,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd you could make it safe for me.\u201d</p><p>Bracing his hands on the tabletop, he leaned forward and shook his head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t making an informed decision because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up against. There\u2019s no such thing as a fail-safe plan. Isn\u2019t that right, Pete? Remember the Haynes case? Why don\u2019t you tell her about that fail-safe plan.\u201d</p><p>Pete paused to consider how much he was going to tell Laurant before beginning.</p><p>\u201cBefore I started working for the FBI, men like Haynes were called psychopaths, and he certainly was that all right. Nowadays Haynes would be called an organized killer\u2014as opposed to disorganized. He was meticulous in his preparation and planning, and he was highly intelligent. He always targeted a stranger, stalked her for months until he was very familiar with her habits. He would never have contacted her though or warn her the way this unsub has warned you,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cAnd when he was finally ready, he lured the woman he\u2019d chosen to a secluded area where no one would hear her scream. Like a lot of organized killers, Haynes enjoyed prolonging her agony as long as possible\u2014it heightened his own pleasure, you see, and after he killed her, he always hid the body. That\u2019s an important difference between an organized and disorganized killer,\u201d he explained. \u201cMost disorganized killers leave the body in plain sight, and often they\u2019ll leave the weapon they used as well.</p><p>\u201cHaynes did keep souvenirs, however . . . most of them do, so that he could relive the fantasy, but also so that he would have a reminder that he had fooled everyone, especially the authorities. If it weren\u2019t for his wife contacting us, I believe Clay Haynes could have gone on killing for years and years before he disintegrated. He was that clever.</p><p>\u201cThey set a trap to snare him. His wife had found the souvenirs in an old trunk, and she wanted to help us. She was terrified of her husband and for good reason, but she was determined to put him behind bars. Clay traveled during the week. He was a pharmaceutical rep, but he always returned home on Friday afternoon. They thought they had time, so they let Mrs. Haynes pack before they moved her to a safe house. An agent was with her and a couple of others were staked out front.</p><p>\u201cClay surprised everyone by coming home early. During interrogation he told us he went in through the basement, and he knew at first glance that someone else had touched his trophies. He came up behind the agent in the living room and killed him and then turned his wrath on his wife. When the agent in the house didn\u2019t answer the phone, the others rushed inside, but it was too late by then. Clay had done quite a job on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe butchered her,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnd she sure as hell didn\u2019t die quick.\u201d</p><p>Laurant closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to hear any more details.</p><p>\u201cWere you on that case?\u201d</p><p>Pete answered. \u201cNick was a brand-new recruit. He had completed his training to work in my section, but at that time he was also working with the serial crime unit under a very capable man named Wolcott. Wolcott took Nick along to the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Laurant saw the bleakness in Nick\u2019s eyes and felt a crushing tightness in her chest.</p><p>\u201cI saw what that psychopath did to his wife and the agent,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnd all the while he was killing the man inside and carving on her, there were agents outside waiting for him. Don\u2019t you wonder what must have been going through her mind knowing that help was that close? I still think about it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt proved too much for Wolcott to handle. He resigned the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaynes got away, but he was apprehended the following week,\u201d Pete interjected.</p><p>\u201cA week and a day too late for anyone to help his wife,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThings can go wrong and best-laid plans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand the risks,\u201d she said. \u201cThis man who\u2019s stalking me, he\u2019s organized, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s so clever and so organized, couldn\u2019t he go on killing for years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how can either one of you believe we have any other choice? The woman he\u2019s hunting now . . . she\u2019s someone\u2019s daughter, or mother, or sister. We have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Nick muttered. \u201cHave you thought about Tommy\u2019s reaction? What\u2019s he going to say when you tell him about this half-cocked plan of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I thought you might want to tell him about it. You could explain it much better than I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Pete was watching Nick closely. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he remarked quietly.</p><p>Nick misinterpreted the comment. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly think her idea has merit. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think your reaction is interesting. I\u2019ve already told you how I feel about your involvement in this, Nick. You\u2019re too close to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m on vacation. I can do what I want.\u201d</p><p>Pete rolled his eyes and then tried to force his agent to be logical. \u201cLaurant\u2019s right about one thing. You need to start thinking like an agent. This is a golden opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She knew then she had her ally. \u201cWill you talk to my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get Nick\u2019s cooperation first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d Nick assured her.</p><p>The phone rang, jarring her. Relieved by the interruption, she hurried to answer it.</p><p>\u201cThree rings, Laurant. Let it ring three times before you pick up,\u201d Pete cautioned.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why Pete wanted her to wait, but she nodded agreement as she continued on into the hallway. There was a small alcove, an indentation really, on the opposite side of the steps. A Queen Anne table just fit inside the recess. A black desk phone was resting on top of a pair of phone books, and there were a pad and a pen beside it.</p><p>Nick stepped out into the hall as Laurant picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cOur Lady of Mercy,\u201d she said as she reached for the pen. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p><p>She heard the giggling, and then a little boy\u2019s voice asked, \u201cIs your refrigerator running?\u201d</p><p>She knew the joke and decided to go along. \u201cWhy, yes it is.\u201d</p><p>Another spurt of laughter followed, and then another voice shouted, \u201cThen you better go catch it.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rang through the phone as Laurant hung up. Nick was watching from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cKids playing phone games,\u201d she explained.</p><p>The phone rang again. As she waited for the third ring to end, she said to Nick, \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t have encouraged him. I\u2019ll be firmer this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Lady of Mercy. May I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant.\u201d Her name was said on a low sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The voice on the other end of the line began to sing a bastardized version of \u201cBuffalo Gal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen-eyed girl won\u2019t you come out and play, come out and play, come out and play. Green-eyed girl won\u2019t you come out and play . . . Like my singing, Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d As she asked the question, she whirled around and looked at Nick.</p><p>\u201cA heartbreaker,\u201d the voice taunted. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to break your pretty little heart. Are you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she lied.</p><p>She cringed when she heard his laughter. It stopped as suddenly as it had begun and then he whispered, \u201cDo you want to hear another song?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Nick was rushing toward her; she could hear sounds coming from upstairs, and out of the corner of her eye she saw Pete watching her from the dining room, yet she was frozen by the voice on the phone. She was gripping the receiver so tightly in her hand that Nick had to use considerable force to pull it away and listen with her.</p><p>It dawned on her then that someone was taping or tracing the call, and that was why Pete had told her to let it ring three times. She should keep him talking as long as possible she thought, but oh God, the sound of his voice made her want to throw up.</p><p>\u201cIs the song as stupid as the one you just sang?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, this one\u2019s sure to please. It\u2019s so pure and . . . original. Listen close now.\u201d</p><p>She heard a click, and then a woman\u2019s bloodcurdling screams. It was the most horrific sound she had ever heard. If Nick hadn\u2019t been holding her up, she would have dropped to the floor as the tortured screams pierced her ear. They were almost inhuman and seemed to go on forever. Then, Laurant heard another click, and the screaming stopped.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me to leave her alone? I have, you know. I\u2019ve left her in a grave, even put a little stone on top so I\u2019d remember where she is if I ever want to dig her up again. I do that sometimes, you know. I like to see what they\u2019ve become. This one was a poor substitute for you, Laurant. Are you ready to play yet?\u201d</p><p>Bile was rising to her throat. She could taste it.</p><p>\u201cPlay what?\u201d she asked, trying her best to sound bored with him and with the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHide-and-seek. You hide and I seek. That\u2019s how the game is played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing any games with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she countered, her voice hard. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>He shrieked, but she couldn\u2019t tell if she\u2019d just angered him or made him happy. Jerking the phone away from Nick\u2019s hand, she straightened up and shouted, \u201cCome and get me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Some things in life were simply too good to pass up. Like an icy cold glass of lemonade on a blistering hot and humid day. Or a lady in distress standing on the side of the highway, just begging for a little attention. Only this one hadn\u2019t been a lady, and he\u2019d ended up feeling a bit sorry he\u2019d wasted so much of his valuable time on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, he had put the tape to good use hadn\u2019t he? Perhaps his valuable time hadn\u2019t been completely wasted after all. By God, they\u2019d gotten his message loud and clear. Heartbreaker was a man of his word.</p><p>He wondered how long it would take them to find her. Hell, he\u2019d done everything but post directions. Poor, poor Tiffany. He burst out laughing then; he couldn\u2019t contain it. The bitch had never gotten to use the new phone she\u2019d shoved in front of his face while she bragged about it. He\u2019d used the phone though, to call his sweetheart, and he\u2019d stayed on the line long enough for the mules to figure out whose name the phone was listed under.</p><p>He\u2019d given her what he considered a fitting burial. He left her on a shallow grave near the highway. The scrub surrounding the gully obstructed the view. Eventually the mules would find her, and they\u2019d know with one look what kind of woman she had been.</p><p>He broke her heart, and then he stole it. The spontaneous action worried him for a couple of minutes, but then he realized how careful he\u2019d been not to get any of the blood in his van. Those amazing Ziploc bags really did do a good job, just like the commercials boasted. He\u2019d have to remember to send the company a note praising their clever little product.</p> <p>Filth. That\u2019s what she\u2019d been. Pure filth. And that was why he hadn\u2019t kept the memento. He didn\u2019t want to remember her, so he\u2019d thrown it away.</p><p>Usually, whenever he encountered a worthy prospect, he entertained the notion of keeping her and training her, but at first glance he could plainly see that this one had been used, and he immediately ruled her out. The replacement had to be pure and innocent, clean, and adoring. Oh, yes, she\u2019d be adoring all right, or a lasting relationship would never, ever work. No sirree.</p><p>He had done it before and he could do it again.</p><p>A burst of raw anger caught him unaware, shocking him. He realized then that he was gripping the steering wheel and forced himself to relax. All his time and effort had been wasted. Wasted! He had created the perfect mate, and when she died, he grieved.</p><p>He didn\u2019t relish the chore of finding and training a replacement, but he couldn\u2019t put it off much longer. No, he\u2019d have to get started soon, which meant hour upon hour of careful, meticulous planning. He would have to see to every detail, every tiny wrinkle. And research. There would be so much research involved. He would have to know everything about her. Everything! Who her friends and relatives were, who would miss her, and who wouldn\u2019t give a damn. Then he\u2019d have to isolate her, alienate her, and once he finally took her, the real work would begin. He\u2019d keep her locked away. The slow, agonizing training process would begin, day in and day out, endless training. He would be cruel and relentless until she became exactly what he wanted. There would be pain, lots of pain, but she would come to understand and forgive him once he had broken her and then molded her into the perfect mate. Why? Because she would adore him.</p> <p>The anger wouldn\u2019t let him alone. Rage was steadily building, gnawing at his gut like hungry maggots. He couldn\u2019t let it get out of control, not now. He took a deep breath and ordered himself to think about something pleasant.</p><p>Little Tiffy had been as easy as she\u2019d advertised. No challenge at all. He didn\u2019t even have to sweet-talk her into getting into his van. No, she\u2019d just strutted over to the door and scrambled right on up inside, with her tight little skirt hiked up above her crotch. She\u2019d wanted him to see she wasn\u2019t wearing panties. No modesty, that one. God only knew what diseases she\u2019d been carrying. He\u2019d had to wash three times just to get rid of the stench of her.</p><p>He made a mental note to remember to tell his buddies on the Internet that killing whores wasn\u2019t what it was cracked up to be.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t dirty talk her way out of what was happening to her. No, sir. Killing her had been a kick, but it hadn\u2019t given him the rush he craved these days. He knew why of course. She hadn\u2019t been clean.</p><p>\u201cGreen-eyed girl, won\u2019t you come out to play . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, how he hated to start all over again. Such time! Such work!</p> <p>\u201cCalm down, calm down,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it before, you can do it again.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a project he was ready to undertake just yet. If he\u2019d learned anything over the years, it was that you finished one job before you took on another.</p><p>The exit off I-35 leading to Holy Oaks loomed up ahead. An exemplary driver, he turned on the blinker and slowed the van.</p><p>\u201cGreen-eyed girl, I\u2019m coming for you, coming for you, coming for you . . .\u201d</p><p>He had a secret name for Holy Oaks. He called it \u201cunfinished business.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>The game was on.</p><p>A team of FBI agents swarmed into Holy Oaks to prepare the trap. Jules Wesson, their section leader, set up his command post in a spacious, well-appointed cabin owned by the abbey and located just eight blocks south of the town on the tip of Shadow Lake. Wesson, a Princeton graduate with a masters in abnormal psychology, was rumored to become Morganstern\u2019s replacement if and when Wesson completed his doctorate, and if and when Morganstern retired\u2014rumors most of the other agents believed had been started by Wesson himself. He was a by-the-book, hard-nosed, pain-in-the-ass boss, surprisingly arrogant given the fact that the agents under his direction had far more experience in the field than he did.</p> <p>Joe Farley and Matt Feinberg, one a field agent from Omaha, Nebraska, the other an electronic surveillance specialist from Quantico, were sent into town ahead of the others to scout Laurant\u2019s neighborhood and secure the premises. Both had been ordered to treat the property as a crime scene.</p><p>They knew they were going to have trouble blending in. In a town the size of Holy Oaks, everyone knew everyone else, and everyone else\u2019s business, and the two agents didn\u2019t want to stand out like a pair of red shoes in a funeral procession. They had been told that there were other strangers in town working at the abbey on the restoration, and so both of the agents dressed in work clothes. Farley wore a baseball cap and carried a black duffel bag. Feinberg carried a toolbox.</p><p>No one paid them the slightest attention. No one, that was, but Bessie Jean Vanderman.</p><p>While Agent Feinberg slowly circled the perimeter of Laurant\u2019s two-story clapboard house, checking for possible hiding places, Agent Farley carried his bag up the front steps. He crossed the porch and paused at the door to put on a pair of gloves. An expert at getting in and out without leaving a trace, he used a very simple tool, his American Express card\u2014he never left home without it\u2014to open the door. It took him less than five seconds.</p><p>Sheriff Lloyd McGovern showed up five minutes later and burst in on Farley. Bessie Jean, Laurant\u2019s neighbor and unofficial watch-dog now that Daddy had passed on, had called the sheriff when she spotted a squat-necked, square-framed man going inside Laurant\u2019s house.</p><p>Farley was more concerned about the sheriff messing up his crime scene than the gun the man was waving about.</p><p>Lloyd, scratching his balding head and still brandishing his gun\u2014which, the agent could plainly see, had the safety on\u2014shouted, \u201cYou put your hands up, boy. I\u2019m the law here in Holy Oaks and you\u2019d best do what I say.\u201d</p><p>Feinberg came inside the front door without making a sound. He walked up behind the sheriff and poked him in the back to get his attention. The sheriff mistakenly thought he had a gun. He dropped his weapon and put his hands up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not resisting,\u201d he stammered, the bluster and hostility gone from his voice now. \u201cYou boys take whatever you want, but leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes in exasperation, Feinberg moved to the side and waved his palms in front of the sheriff. Lloyd realized he was unarmed and scrambled to get his gun off the floor.</p><p>\u201cAll right now,\u201d he began, pleased he was once again in charge. \u201cWhat are you boys doing here? You\u2019re just plain stupid if you think you\u2019re going to steal anything of value. Look around you, and you can see Lauren don\u2019t have much at all worth taking. I know for a fact that she doesn\u2019t have a VCR, and her television set is at least ten years old. It can\u2019t be worth more than forty dollars, and that sure ain\u2019t worth going to jail for. As far as I can tell, she\u2019s as poor as a church mouse. She ain\u2019t got much in the bank, and she had to take out a loan to pay for her store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know how old her television set is?\u201d Farley asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cHarry told me. That\u2019s Harry Evans,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019s my cousin twice removed. He tried to sell Lauren a brand-spanking-new television a while back. You know the kind with the picture inside the picture? She didn\u2019t want it, and she asked him to fix up an old television she bought at a garage sale instead. She was throwing good money away if you ask me. And that\u2019s how come I know how old her television is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a relative working at the bank too?\u201d Feinberg asked. \u201cIs that how you know about the loan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Lloyd answered. \u201cI might remind you boys I\u2019m the one with the gun here, and you\u2019re gonna start answering my questions. Are you robbing Lauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Feinberg answered.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing in her house? Are you foreigner relatives of hers from France?\u201d</p><p>Farley had been born and raised in the Bronx and hadn\u2019t been able to rid himself of his thick street accent. He sounded like a thug in a bad gangster movie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he managed to say with a straight face. \u201cWe\u2019re from France.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff liked to be right. His chest puffed up like a peacock. Nodding as he put his gun away, he said, \u201cI thought as much. You talk funny, so I figured you boys had to be foreigners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Sheriff, we\u2019re both from the East, and that\u2019s why we have accents. My friend here was just joking when he said we\u2019re French. We\u2019re friends of Laurant\u2019s brother,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re doing some work up at the abbey, and Father Tom asked us to stop by and fix her sink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clogged,\u201d Farley added to the lie.</p><p>The sheriff noticed the black bag near the front door. \u201cAre you boys planning on spending the night here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Farley answered. \u201cDepends on how much work the plumbing needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t own the house. She\u2019s just renting. Where is Lauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think you boys are going to sleep here in the same house with her, and you\u2019re not related?\u201d</p><p>Feinberg\u2019s patience was wearing thin. \u201cQuit calling me boy. I\u2019m thirty-two years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two, huh? Then answer me this. What\u2019s a grown man doing wearing braces? I never heard of such a thing.\u201d</p><p>The braces were the last step in the reconstruction of a shattered jaw Feinberg had suffered four years ago during a raid that had gone sour, but the agent wasn\u2019t about to impart that information to a man he had already surmised to be a complete moron. Besides, no one was supposed to know the truth, that they were FBI agents.</p><p>\u201cWe do things different in the east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon you do,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut you still shouldn\u2019t be staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you worried about Laurant\u2019s reputation?\u201d Feinberg asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, everyone knows Lauren\u2019s a good girl,\u201d the sheriff replied as he settled his broad rear end on the arm of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Farley asked. \u201cWhy does it bother you if we sleep here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it won\u2019t bother me none at all, but it\u2019s going to bother someone else you boys don\u2019t want to be messing with. I\u2019m warning you. You\u2019d best find some other accommodations because he isn\u2019t going to like hearing that Lauren\u2019s got two men living with her, even if it\u2019s just for a couple of days. No, he won\u2019t like hearing it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, who won\u2019t like it?\u201d Farley asked as he shut the door. The sheriff wasn\u2019t going to leave until they had an answer to that question.</p><p>\u201cNever you mind who. I\u2019m going to have to tell him though. Why don\u2019t you boys go on up to the abbey? They\u2019ve got rooms you can use for free if you tell them you\u2019re here for retreat. You know what that is, don\u2019t you? You spend your time praying and contemplating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know who\u2019s going to be upset about us staying with Laurant,\u201d Farley persisted. \u201cAnd I also want to know why you think you have to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause if he found out that I knew and I didn\u2019t tell him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Farley demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe can get real mean,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to make him angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake who angry, Sheriff ?\u201d</p><p>Lloyd pulled a stained handkerchief from his back pocket and mopped his brow. \u201cIt\u2019s close in here, isn\u2019t it? Lauren\u2019s got herself a window air conditioner, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind if you boys turned it on. The living room will be nice and cool by the time she gets home. She is coming here today, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Feinberg said.</p><p>Farley wouldn\u2019t give up. \u201cWe\u2019re still curious to hear that name, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you, and I can be right stubborn when I want to, and I\u2019m feeling stubborn now. I wouldn\u2019t get myself worked up about it if I was you, because you\u2019re going to be meeting my friend real soon. He\u2019ll come over here lickety-split as soon as he hears you\u2019re here. I guarantee it. He\u2019s a powerful man around these parts, so if you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll be real respectful to him. I wouldn\u2019t make him mad, that\u2019s for sure. The law can only do so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning we\u2019re on our own?\u201d Farley asked.</p><p>The sheriff lowered his gaze. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d Shrugging, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s just the way things are around here. Progress comes with a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that means . . .?\u201d Farley asked.</p><p>\u201cNever you mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell your friend he has nothing to fear from us,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cNeither one of us is romantically interested in Laurant.\u201d</p><p>Farley guessed where Feinberg was heading and immediately nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, that\u2019s good to hear because my friend is planning to marry Lauren real soon, and he always gets what he wants. Make no mistake about that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s talking marriage, huh?\u201d Feinberg remarked.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t just talk.

Nick . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Father Tom\u2019s best friend. Guess it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Nick lives in Kansas City? Long-distance relationships don\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t live in Kansas City. He lives on the East Coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t think Brenner has anything to worry about. Like I just said, long-distance relationships rarely work.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff had unknowingly just given them his friend\u2019s name, but neither Feinberg nor Farley let him know it.</p><p>\u201cNick must have figured that too,\u201d Feinberg said.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why he\u2019s moving here to Holy Oaks to be with Laurant,\u201d Farley added.</p><p>The sheriff \u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cHe\u2019s coming here . . . with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Farley said. \u201cGuess he doesn\u2019t want to take the chance of losing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was love at first sight,\u201d Feinberg reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s this fella going to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere with Laurant, until they get married. Then I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019ll live,\u201d Farley told him.</p><p>\u201cGet married, you say? Who\u2019d you hear this from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant told us,\u201d Feinberg answered.</p><p>\u201cPeople will talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got to get going now.\u201d The sheriff hastily shoved his handkerchief back into his pocket and headed for the door.</p><p>For all his considerable bulk, the lawman could move fast when he wanted to. Farley and Feinberg stood at the window and watched the sheriff run to the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat a piece of . . . ,\u201d Farley muttered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even ask us our names or ask to see our identification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got places to go, people to see . . . ,\u201d Feinberg began.</p><p>\u201cAnd a friend named Brenner to tell,\u201d Farley concluded as he pulled out his cell phone and dialed.</p><p>The phone was answered on the first ring. \u201cYou got him?\u201d Farley asked. He listened for another minute, then said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>Feinberg squatted down by the black case. \u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d he said as he handed the other agent a pair of gloves. \u201cThis could take us all night.\u201d</p><p>Farley was the eternal optimist. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, they did get lucky. They found the video camera tucked high in a corner of the linen closet outside of Laurant\u2019s bedroom. The camera lens was pressed against a hole in the wall and was pointed toward Laurant\u2019s bed. He\u2019d been watching her sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Nick wasn\u2019t talking to her. Laurant assumed he was still furious because she had insisted upon returning to Holy Oaks. After she\u2019d taunted the madman to come and get her, Nick had gone a little crazy. And that was putting it mildly. Tommy heard all the commotion and came running, with Noah hot on his tail. As soon as Nick told her brother what she\u2019d done, Tommy joined in the shouting match, but she held her own and stood up to them. Pete and Noah came to her assistance, flanking her sides like protective guardians. They defended her plan, and after what seemed like an hour of battling, Tommy finally caved. The phone call convinced him that the man wasn\u2019t going to forget Laurant, and if the FBI didn\u2019t set a trap and catch the animal, then she would be on the run or in hiding for the rest of her life.</p><p>And while the unsub was playing his hide-and-seek game with her, he would, no doubt, be preying on other women.</p><p>They had no other choice.</p><p>Unfortunately, Nick hadn\u2019t seen it that way, and thus far she\u2019d been unsuccessful in penetrating his anger. Pete had once again suggested that Nick step aside, repeating his earlier argument that he was simply too close to the situation and couldn\u2019t be objective. Nick refused to listen, but when Morganstern threatened to take the choice away from him and have him removed from the case, Nick saw Tommy\u2019s stricken expression, and then he too caved.</p><p>Pete made a call to Frank O\u2019Leary to get the ball rolling.</p><p>Now, she was finally on her way home, sitting side by side with Nick on a US Air Express plane that was taking them from Kansas City to Des Moines. They would drive the rest of the way. Pete told her a car would be waiting at the airport. Her automobile was going into the shop for repairs in Kansas City, and as soon as the work was finished, Tommy and Noah would drive it back to Holy Oaks.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about what was going to happen once she got there. She nervously flipped through the pages of Time magazine, even tried to read an article about inflation, but she couldn\u2019t concentrate, and after rereading the same paragraph three times, she gave up.</p><p>How long was Nick going to give her the silent treatment? He had stopped talking the minute they\u2019d entered the airport.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being childish.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. She turned to look at him and noticed how gray his complexion was.</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>A curt shake of his head was her only answer. Then she noticed his grip on the armrest. \u201cNick, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, after the plane lands . . . unless . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe crash and die in a fiery ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. Macho Man was afraid of flying. He looked like he was going to throw up. His fear was real, and no matter how funny she thought it was, she forced herself to be sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like flying much, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered curtly before turning to stare out the window again.</p><p>\u201cWant to hold my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t funny, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>She plied his hand away from the armrest and slipped her fingers through his. \u201cI wasn\u2019t teasing. Lots of people don\u2019t like to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>His grip was firm and she could feel the calluses on his hand. Working man\u2019s hands, but today he was dressed like an executive on Wall Street. Another contradiction, she thought, another layer of his personality she found puzzling and fascinating. Tommy and Nick seemed so different from each other. They certainly had chosen different paths. Her brother was dedicated to the church. He always looked for the good in others, and his primary goal was to save souls.</p><p>Nick seemed to have dedicated his life to fighting demons. His job was depressing and unending, and she wasn\u2019t sure if the rewards were worth the price he paid. He seemed so cynical to her. He expected people to be bad, and thus far, he hadn\u2019t been disappointed.</p><p>The urge to comfort him took her by surprise. She leaned close and whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t there until or unless we land.\u201d</p><p>He was proving to be difficult to comfort. \u201cLandings aren\u2019t dangerous\u2014\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAs long as the pilot knows what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he knows what he\u2019s doing. Pilots are trained to land planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only got a few more minutes to go. We\u2019re making our final descent.\u201d</p><p>His grip on her hand tightened. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain just told the attendants to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear the landing gear go down? I sure as hell didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath and told himself to calm down. \u201cYou do know that this is when most accidents happen, don\u2019t you? Pilots misjudge the runway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you read that somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just figured it out. Simple physics. Things go wrong . . . human error. Think about it. One man\u2019s trying to ease down over a hundred fifty tons of metal on a couple of little rubber rollers. It\u2019s a damned miracle every time a plane lands.\u201d</p><p>She maintained a somber expression. \u201cI see. Then you believe that if man were meant to fly, he would be born with wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Now he sounded surly.</p><p>\u201cIn your line of work . . . don\u2019t you have to dodge bullets . . . and don\u2019t you go into life-and-death situations sometimes? You\u2019re an FBI agent for heaven\u2019s sake. The cream of the crop. Yet you\u2019re afraid of a little plane ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the sarcasm in his voice. \u201cI think you should talk to someone about this. Pete could help. He\u2019s a psychiatrist, and he could surely help you get over this . . . worry.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel like telling her that Pete\u2019s amusement at his phobia matched hers. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>Because he was looking at her, he didn\u2019t notice the ground coming up to meet the plane. The landing was smooth and uneventful, and by the time they had taxied to the gate, Nick\u2019s complexion was looking healthy again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to get down on your knees and kiss the ground?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plain cruel to make fun of a man\u2019s phobias, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t making fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you were,\u201d he replied. He moved into the aisle, flipped open the overhead compartment, and pulled the bags down. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real mean streak inside you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back so she could stand in front of him. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cPretty cocky now that you\u2019ve got your feet on the ground, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always cocky,\u201d he boasted as he nudged her toward the exit.</p><p>The airport was surprisingly crowded. As they threaded their way toward the baggage claim area, Nick noticed the number of men admiring Laurant. One man didn\u2019t even try to be subtle. He did a double take, then turned completely around and followed them. Nick responded by throwing his arm around Laurant\u2019s shoulders and pulling her into his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking sure you stay close,\u201d he answered. He shot the gawker a hostile look, then grinned when the man turned and hurried the other way.</p><p>\u201cYou wear your skirts too short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then you wear your legs too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Keep moving.\u201d</p><p>He continued to scan faces as they walked through the crowd. He had to let go of her when they reached the escalator. She was frowning at him, but it was too late to take back the comment about her skirt.</p><p>An agent was waiting for them outside the baggage area. The car, a 1999 Explorer, was parked in a No Loading zone. The agent handed Nick a folder stuffed with papers and the keys to the car, and then loaded their luggage into the back. Two airport security guards were huddled together on the sidewalk, shaking their heads and muttering over the fact that they couldn\u2019t do anything about the illegally parked vehicle.</p><p>The agent drew her attention then when he opened a large black case that was tucked into the rear corner of the cargo area. When she saw the display of weapons, she took an involuntary step back.</p><p>Nick noticed. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>She straightened her shoulders. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>The agent opened the passenger door for her, wished her good hunting, and then disappeared inside the terminal.</p><p>Nick tossed his jacket into the backseat and unbuttoned the collar of his shirt as he got in behind the wheel, pushing the seat back as far as it would go to accommodate his long legs. There was a leather console between them. Inside was a map of Iowa.</p><p>Laurant knew the way home, of course, but Nick still checked the route that someone had outlined with yellow Hi-Liter.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what your friend said to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he wondered, glancing up from the paper he held in his hand.</p><p>\u201cGood hunting.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cYeah, we always say that,\u201d he explained. \u201cSuperstition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike \u2018break a leg\u2019 before you go onstage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She let him finish reading, and after he\u2019d placed the file folder in the back, she asked, \u201cWas there anything important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some update stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but those security policemen look like they want to cry because they can\u2019t give you a ticket.\u201d</p><p>Nick waved to the guards as he pulled out into traffic. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there anything in the folder about the letter that man told Tommy he\u2019d mailed to the Kansas City police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they still haven\u2019t gotten anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would he tell Tommy he\u2019d mailed it when he obviously hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he was toying with him. I\u2019ll let Pete figure that one out.\u201d</p><p>She was silent as Nick maneuvered through the heavy traffic. Once they were on the highway, he rolled up his sleeves and settled back in his seat. He had the next two hours to prepare her. He went through the list of all the things she wasn\u2019t going to do and ended with the same reminder he\u2019d given her at least ten times now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe anything anyone tells you, and you don\u2019t go anywhere without me. You got that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even the ladies\u2019 room in a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Not even the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, appeased for the moment. She wasn\u2019t fooled. She knew he\u2019d go through the list again in another hour or so. \u201cLet\u2019s go over your daily routine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have it memorized by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see if I do. We get up around seven o\u2019clock every morning, do our stretching exercises\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo limber up,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, and then we go running . . . God help me . . . three and a half miles, start to finish. We take the path around the lake, beginning at the western tip, and we always go in the same direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate running. It\u2019s bad for the knees, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it invigorating. Maybe you will too,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re in good shape. You can run three and a half miles, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure I can, but I\u2019m going to be bitching the entire time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so then we go back home and . . .\u201d</p><p>When he paused, she assumed she was supposed to continue. \u201cAnd we shower and change into work clothes, and then we walk two blocks to the town square. I\u2019ll spend most of the day getting my loft organized and unpacking boxes while the workmen finish up downstairs. With any luck at all, they should be done soon. I want to be open by the Fourth of July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give you much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably be back in Boston by the Fourth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being optimistic. I could be in Holy Oaks for a month, maybe longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you afford to take so much time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promised your brother. I\u2019m not leaving until we catch him . . . or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he goes to ground, and I have to leave for whatever reason, I\u2019m taking you with me. Don\u2019t even think about arguing about that,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, but you know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen fast. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have to wait long.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cI feel the same. The way he sounded on the phone . . . yeah, he\u2019s gonna be coming after you fast. Pete thinks so too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I want this to be over as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, God willing, it will be. You know, you\u2019re going to be sick of me by the time I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be sick of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. I\u2019ll warn you now. I\u2019m going to be taking a lot of liberties. Fact is, I\u2019m going to be all over you.\u201d He glanced at her before continuing. \u201cThe goal is to make the unsub crazed with jealousy. Right? And so angry, he\u2019ll make that one little mistake . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you can get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan. But I probably won\u2019t be the one nailing him. Neither will Noah for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s going to be busy baby-sitting Tommy, and I\u2019ll be busy . . . mauling you. I\u2019m kind of looking forward to that. So tell me something. What kind of kisser are you?\u201d</p><p>She attempted a southern accent when she answered in a slow drawl, \u201cI\u2019m very . . . very . . . good.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHow do you know you\u2019re good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndre Percelli,\u201d she said. \u201cHe kissed me, and he told me I was good. That\u2019s how I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned this Andre guy before. Who the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met in fourth grade. But alas, our love affair ended as quickly as it had begun. We were in the cafeteria line when he kissed me, and I ended it then and there.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a good kisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Andre told me before I punched him.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou were a tough little kid, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hold my own. I still can,\u201d she boasted.</p><p>\u201cSo, whatever happened to Andre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened to him. Last I heard, he was married with two babies.\u201d</p><p>Nick changed the subject back to her routine. \u201cWe never talked about the evenings. What do you do at night?\u201d</p><p>Laurant was digging through her purse, looking for her hair clip. \u201cYes we did talk about the evenings,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd I told you that there\u2019s something scheduled every night for the next two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the wedding you\u2019re going to be in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut also because I promised the abbot I\u2019d help clean out the attic. He\u2019s spring cleaning before the anniversary celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is also happening on the Fourth of July. Bad timing,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThe wedding\u2019s the Saturday before,\u201d she told him. She found the clip at the bottom of her purse.</p><p>\u201cThis anniversary thing . . . it\u2019s going to be a mess. I hope to God we get this tied up before then. Tommy told me the town\u2019s going to be loaded with strangers coming in from all over the United States.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hair back and clipped it in place. \u201cActually, they\u2019ll be coming in from Europe too,\u201d she said. \u201cAssumption Abbey opened its doors one hundred years ago. There might even be a cardinal attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a security nightmare. I\u2019m telling you, Laurant, if we don\u2019t catch this creep quick, I\u2019m getting you out of there until the celebration is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d she replied. \u201cPete said to take it a day at a time, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the first of July. Then we leave.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand up. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing with you, but it doesn\u2019t give us much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he makes his move fast. Listen, it\u2019s real important you don\u2019t . . . relax. You understand? Relaxing your guard can be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I won\u2019t relax. Could I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I weren\u2019t me . . . what I mean to say is . . . if I weren\u2019t your best friend\u2019s sister and we were complete strangers to each other before this happened, then would you have been as resistant to setting a trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean using you as bait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, you are my friend\u2019s sister. I can\u2019t separate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s immediate reaction was to tell her yes, he would have been just as resistant because he knew firsthand how plans could blow up in your face, but after mulling the theoretical question over in his mind for another minute, he admitted it was a golden opportunity and he probably wouldn\u2019t pass it up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fifty-fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d weigh the dangers against the possibility of catching this creep before he kills again. And then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d go for the trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. I\u2019ve seen what can happen. We don\u2019t always get the bad guys, Laurant, no matter what you\u2019ve seen on television. Sometimes, they stay on the loose for years. The son of a bitch on the top of the \u2018most wanted\u2019 list, Emmett Haskell, broke out of a high-security mental ward in Michigan over a year ago, and we still haven\u2019t caught up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed a lot of people. That\u2019s what he did. Seven dead so far, but those are only the ones we know about. There could be more. Haskell told the shrinks that killing brought him good luck. He liked to bet the horses and always went to the track the first Saturday of every month, so the first Friday of every month, he had to kill someone. Didn\u2019t matter who,\u201d he added. \u201cAnyone would do. Man, woman, child. He was real partial to women though. The prettier, the better . . . for luck, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy told me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hadn\u2019t told him in confidence or he never would have said anything, but I asked him why he was so worried about you and he mentioned . . .\u201d</p><p>He knew where she was leading\u2014the Stark case. He had told Tommy about that one, hoping that talking about it would help him forget. It hadn\u2019t helped him though, not one little bit.</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned I killed a woman, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend your actions to me, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere really wasn\u2019t any other choice. Maybe if I\u2019d been a little smarter about it, I could have gotten her cuffed . . . but I left the house, and that gave her time to get the kid and prepare.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran down her arms. \u201cPrepare for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. She knew I was coming back, and she wanted me to watch her kill the little boy.\u201d</p><p>Laurant saw the troubled look that crossed Nick\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow do you get rid of it?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you block out the memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t block anything out. I deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI keep busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping busy isn\u2019t dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell Noah I said this, but sometimes I wish I were more like him. He can shrug it all off when he has to.\u201d</p><p>She disagreed. \u201cHe\u2019s paying a price, just like you. He\u2019s just got tougher shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe. But as long as animals like Haskell and Stark are out there, I can\u2019t relax. I want to get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be another one, isn\u2019t there? Nick, you need a normal life outside of your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like Pete, and this is damned heavy chitchat.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the phone, punched in a number, and then spoke into the mouthpiece, \u201cWe\u2019re taking the next exit and finding something to eat. By the way, you\u2019re following too close.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d put the phone back, she turned around to look out the back window. \u201cThe blue car, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the gray Honda behind the blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have they been following us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we left the airport. This car has a tracking device with a fifty-mile radius, and once we\u2019re in Holy Oaks, Jules Wesson, the senior agent in charge of this operation, will always have us under surveillance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do us much good. It\u2019s a little town, and we\u2019ll walk as much as we drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be wearing a cute little tracking device too. I\u2019m not sure what it will be in, but probably a pin or a bracelet.\u201d</p><p>It was actually comforting to know that the FBI would be tracking her as she moved about town.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jules Wesson is efficient, but I still wish that Pete were in Holy Oaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be much good there. He\u2019s never been a field agent. Jules Wesson and Noah and I will feed him information as we get it, and hopefully Pete will be able to figure out the where and when and how. Think there\u2019s a decent place to eat in Sweetwater? That\u2019s the next exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a diner in the center of town. The food\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big, juicy hamburger with pickles. And fries. Lots of French fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to give him directions. Sweetwater boasted one main street, aptly named Main Street, and the diner was located right smack in the middle of it.</p><p>Laurant slid into a booth by the front window. Nick sat down beside her. There wasn\u2019t much room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to sit across from me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied as he reached for the sticky, plasticized menu standing on end behind the salt and pepper shakers. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna start practicing this lovey-dovey stuff.\u201d</p><p>Nick ordered two double hamburgers, a double order of fries, and two glasses of milk. She told him he ate like a farmhand, and that reminded him of a story about her brother involving the cafeteria line at college. By the time Nick finished recounting the incident, she was laughing so hard, there were tears in her eyes. She had no idea Tommy had been such a prankster.</p><p>\u201cHe started the food fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy wasn\u2019t always a priest,\u201d Nick reminded her.</p><p>He told her another story, and then another. A couple of times the other patrons of the diner turned at the sound of their laughter. They saw a young couple completely at ease with each other.</p><p>Laurant was thoroughly relaxed by the time they got back into the car and headed out again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should slow down. I don\u2019t see the gray car,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work. You aren\u2019t supposed to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they going to follow us all the way to Holy Oaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many agents are there waiting for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this costing a lot of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to get him, Laurant. Cost isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what happens if it takes longer than everyone expects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it takes longer.\u201d</p><p>Laurant removed the clip and let her hair fall around her shoulders, then she tilted the seat back. She had just closed her eyes when Nick said, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you get?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou . . . living in such a little town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re a big-city girl at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not at all. I grew up in a little village.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour grandfather happened to own the village,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou lived on an estate. You can call it a small town if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I went to school in a tiny little town. It was almost cloistered. I really like Holy Oaks, Nick. The people there are good and decent. And it\u2019s beautiful. And peaceful . . . at least it used to be peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well if you like it so much, how come you rent the house you live in? Why didn\u2019t you buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to concentrate on the business first,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd Mrs. Talbot didn\u2019t want to sell the house just yet. She raised her family there, and even though she\u2019s living in a nursing home now, she isn\u2019t ready to let it go. I\u2019m thinking about buying a cabin on the lake. It needs a lot of work though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you haven\u2019t already purchased it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSteve Brenner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Holy Oaks Advancement Society guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owns the cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the guy wants to own you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems that when Agents Farley and Feinberg went into your house, the neighbor lady called the sheriff and he came running.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cL.A. doesn\u2019t run anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s name is L.A.?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLard Ass,\u201d she explained. \u201cEveryone calls him that. He isn\u2019t highly thought of in Holy Oaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. What happened when the sheriff showed up? Did he know they were FBI? They must have told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t tell him anything, but the odd thing is, he never asked. He was busy telling them all about Steve Brenner\u2019s designs on you. Seems Brenner\u2019s telling everyone he\u2019s going to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it. One of the agents told the sheriff all about our hot and heavy relationship, and he couldn\u2019t wait to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo doubt to tell Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of man who has trouble understanding he can\u2019t get everything he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help him understand.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how he planned to do that, but the tone of his voice indicated he was looking forward to it.</p><p>It seemed that the time spent driving to Holy Oaks sped by faster than the actual miles. They were comfortable together. They discussed music\u2014they both liked classical and country. They argued politics\u2014she was a die-hard liberal, and he was a full-blown conservative. And he kept her fascinated with funny stories about growing up in a large family. Before she realized it, Nick was slowing down to take the exit to Holy Oaks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be home before dark,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Nick turned serious. \u201cLaurant, there are a couple of things I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarley and Feinberg . . . the agents I mentioned a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they searched your house, they found a video camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did they find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the linen closet upstairs. There was a perfectly drilled little hole about half the size of an aspirin. The camera\u2019s eye was facing your bed. You never would have noticed it. It\u2019s right in the center of a flower in your wallpaper.\u201d</p><p>She felt as though all the air had been knocked out of her lungs. She spun around in her seat and unconsciously clutched his forearm. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just now telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you could use a little respite from this nightmare. If I\u2019d told you when we first got in the car, you would have been worrying about it all the way home. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwhile,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere was dust on it, so it\u2019s been there for some time, at least a week or two, but I can\u2019t tell you exactly how many days and nights. The serial number was filed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever hold back information again. All right? When you hear something new, you tell me right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be living together. I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil death do us part?\u201d she asked sarcastically, but her sarcasm was tinged with fear.</p><p>\u201cNo, until we catch him.\u201d</p><p>She released her grip on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped at you. You did warn me. You told me he\u2019d been in my house and that he\u2019d watched me sleep. He\u2019s seen me . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t go on. She turned to look out the window so he wouldn\u2019t see how shaken she was. She pictured herself getting dressed and undressed. Some nights when the air conditioner wasn\u2019t cooling sufficiently, she\u2019d slept in the nude. And all of it was on tape.</p><p>She looked down at her lap and saw that she\u2019d broken the hair clip. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve done something I should be ashamed of. There were nights when I didn\u2019t feel like wearing a nightgown. It was hot,\u201d she defended.</p><p>\u201cWhat you do in the privacy of your own bedroom . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything. I slept. That\u2019s all. I certainly haven\u2019t been entertaining any men, but what if I had? God, this is so sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it isn\u2019t too late for me to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>He pulled over to the side of the road, put the car in park, and then nodded toward the sign to the right. It was the Holy Oaks city limit.</p><p>\u201cAre you giving me one last chance to change my mind?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you that you\u2019ve got to stop freaking out every time you hear something . . . unpleasant. There are going to be some surprises, and I\u2019m going to try my damnedest to anticipate, but you\u2019ve got to . . . handle it. You understand? I can\u2019t be worried about how you\u2019re reacting and try to put you back together every time you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his arm, gently this time. \u201cI promise. I won\u2019t freak out. At least I\u2019ll try not to.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the determination in her voice, see it in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got guts,\u201d he said as he changed gears and pulled out onto the highway.</p><p>She was suddenly cold. She turned the air conditioner down and rubbed her arms. \u201cDid they find the tape? Was it in the camera? Those tapes don\u2019t last very long, do they? Just a couple of hours. How did he change it? Has he been going back and forth into my house . . . my bedroom? If he has, he\u2019s been taking quite a risk of being seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe camera\u2019s operated with a transmitter, which means he\u2019s watching your bedroom on a monitor somewhere. I\u2019ll show it to you when we get there. It\u2019s a fairly simple motion sensitive device.\u201d He added, frowning, \u201cHigh school stuff really\u2014and that\u2019s what bothers me about it. Whoever set up the equipment wasn\u2019t a pro, but he got the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem very clever for our boy,\u201d he explained. \u201cLike I said, it isn\u2019t high-tech, and our unsub seems like the kind who would go to great lengths to make it slick . . . perfect. His goal is to impress us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she turned to look out the window again. \u201cWe\u2019re almost home.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned left onto Assumption Road, a two-lane highway. Someone had partially blackened the road sign with paint so that only the first three letters, A-s-s, were visible. Nick grinned when he saw it.</p><p>\u201cThe high school kids do that at least once a year,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey think it\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you probably watch the Simpsons on television, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she admitted. \u201cMessing with the sign makes the abbot furious. Disrespectful and all that. Are we going home first, or do you want to go to the lake to see Jules Wesson? Tommy told me he arranged for the agents to use the abbot\u2019s cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go check in with Wesson first. I turn on Oak Street, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019d make a left on Oak if you were going to my house and a right to get to the lake.\u201d</p><p>The twin steeples of Assumption Abbey rose up in the distance. The gothic structure had been built on top of a hill overlooking the pristine little town. It was magnificent. The drab grayness of the massive stone edifice was intermittently broken by brilliant stained glass windows, and a long, winding path led up to the doors.</p><p>Nick slowed the car as he drove past the wrought iron fence that surrounded the property. There were giant oaks everywhere. They clustered protectively against the north and south sides of the structure, like flying buttresses strengthening the outside walls.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a cathedral,\u201d he remarked softly, as though they were inside the church now.</p><p>\u201cThe renovation has been going on for a long time. It\u2019s become a town project to raise funds to restore it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost finished,\u201d she added, \u201c. . . the main church anyway. The chapel still needs work. We\u2019ll have to come up here and walk around. The gardens are beautiful this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich came first? The chicken or the egg?\u201d</p><p>She understood what he was asking. \u201cAssumption Abbey was founded by an order of priests from Belgium, and it was here long before the town developed. Our population is quite diverse. There was an influx of immigrants after World War II.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they come all the way to Holy Oaks, Iowa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Tommy tell you anything about the history of this town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe immigrants followed Father Henri VanKirk. He died last year. I wish I could have known him. He was an incredible man. During the war, he helped countless numbers of families escape the Germans, but he was eventually captured and tortured by the Nazis. When he was finally released, he came to America, and his superiors sent him here to heal. Quite a few of the families he had helped had lost everything, and they followed him. They rebuilt their lives and made Holy Oaks their home.</p><p>\u201cAfter Father VanKirk died, the abbot found his journals. He thought they would offer inspiration to people, and so he decided to have them all translated into English. Everyone\u2019s been so busy getting ready for the anniversary celebration, there hasn\u2019t been time, but as soon as it\u2019s over, I\u2019m supposed to begin the translation and save it all on the computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Father VanKirk buried here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. There\u2019s a cemetery on the other side of the abbey. Magnificent oak trees, bigger than the ones you see beside the church, circle the grounds . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why this place is called Holy Oaks, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRight. They protect the ground where the angels sleep.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cWhere the angels sleep. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the town? It\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>White clapboard houses lined the paved brick streets. The streetlights looked like old-fashioned gas lights. Nick knew they were electric. Still, they were a nice touch and made the town all the more quaint.</p><p>\u201cHoly Oaks reminds me of a New England town. It\u2019s got that kind of charm. Does your house have a white picket fence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my neighbor\u2019s does.\u201d</p><p>They reached the stop sign on Oak. Nick turned right and headed down another tree-lined street. The branches formed a canopy from one side to the other. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a time warp. I keep expecting to see Richie Cunningham driving down the street in a \u201957 Chevy convertible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives two blocks over,\u201d she teased.</p><p>As they neared the lake, the houses became more modest. Built in the last half of the century, they sported more modern features, like brick facades and split levels, but, like their older counterparts, they were meticulously kept up. It was apparent that the families living here took pride in their homes and their town.</p><p>They passed a deserted baseball field, continued west, past a Phillips 66 filling station, through a pair of rough timber posts and into the park.</p><p>\u201cThis place is crammed with kids from the college in the spring and in the fall. The local high school kids take it over in the summer.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled down his window. The earthy smell of the humus from the pine needles and the oak and birch leaves matted against the ground filled the air. They reached a fork in the road, and straight ahead was a clear lake. Shadows from the towering trees rippled on top of the glistening water with every faint breeze.</p><p>The cabin was tucked in between the trees. Nick pulled into the gravel driveway and turned off the motor.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like anyone\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Laurant had just made the comment when the front door opened. Through the screen she could see a man with thick, black-rimmed glasses peering out at them.</p><p>Nick made her stay in the car until he came around and opened her door. His eyes were never still. He was constantly searching the area around them, barely paying her any attention at all as he offered her his hand.</p><p>\u201cIs that man Jules Wesson?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Matt Feinberg. He\u2019s our electronic nerd. He\u2019s a nice guy too. You\u2019ll like him.\u201d</p><p>The agent under discussion waited until they\u2019d reached the porch, then opened the door and stepped back. He was average in appearance, medium height, brown hair and eyes, and he wore braces. He had a wonderful, sincere smile. He was holding a wad of wires in both hands, but he dropped them on the entry table so he could shake her hand.</p><p>After the preliminaries were exchanged, he asked, \u201cDid Nick tell you that Farley and I went through your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who found the camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. While we were inside, your neighbor called the sheriff, and he came running. He\u2019s something else,\u201d he said, and then he filled her in on what they had told the sheriff about doing some repair work on her house. Then he turned to Nick. \u201cAs soon as Seaton puts in another phone line, we\u2019ll be good to go. He\u2019s working on it now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow many agents are here?\u201d</p><p>Feinberg glanced up at the balcony before he answered. \u201cWesson isn\u2019t sharing that information. I honestly don\u2019t know how many are here, and if and when more are coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Wesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bedroom getting some papers. This is a nice place, isn\u2019t it? If the circumstances were different, I\u2019d want to camp out here. The lake reminds me of Walden Pond.\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded. \u201cThis is the cabin you ought to buy, Laurant,\u201d he said.</p><p>She agreed. The light was wonderful. Two-story picture windows brought the view of the lake inside. The living room and dining area had been combined into one large rectangle. The atmosphere was rustic, yet airy. It was cluttered now though. Computer boxes and other equipment were scattered about. The dining room table had been pushed against the far wall, and on top were two computers. It didn\u2019t look like either one had been plugged in yet.</p><p>She heard a door open and looked up to the balcony just as Jules Wesson stepped out. He was talking on his mobile phone and was carrying a stack of papers.</p><p>Wesson was tall, wiry, and partially bald. He had piercing eyes, but after giving her and Nick only a brief glance, he ignored them and continued with his phone conversation. She watched him go to the table and put the papers down. Then Feinberg drew her attention again.</p><p>He handed her a gold watch. It looked like an old-fashioned Timex with a stretch band. \u201cWe\u2019d like you to wear this, and we don\u2019t ever want you to take it off, not even in the shower. It\u2019s water repellent, of course. You could even go swimming with it. There\u2019s a tracking device inside, and I\u2019ll be monitoring your every move on that screen behind me. We want to know where you are at all times.\u201d</p> <p>Laurant removed her own watch and slipped on the new one. She\u2019d left her purse in the car and didn\u2019t have any pockets, so she handed it to Nick, and he tucked it in the pocket of his shirt.</p><p>Wesson hung up the phone. He nodded to Laurant as Nick introduced her, but he didn\u2019t waste any time on pleasantries. \u201cI\u2019m ready for him,\u201d he announced briskly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like surprises. You don\u2019t leave Holy Oaks without getting my permission first. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Wesson finally got around to acknowledging Nick. The commander was establishing a pecking order, letting Nick and Laurant know he was the man in charge. Even in a crisis, games were still played. What bullshit, Nick thought. He knew Wesson considered him competition, and no amount of talking would ever convince him that Nick wasn\u2019t interested in fast tracking his way to the top.</p><p>Personally, Nick didn\u2019t like Wesson one little bit, but he was stuck working with him, and he would make the best of the situation. Wesson had an ego the size of Iowa, but as long as he didn\u2019t let it get in the way of the operation, Nick thought they\u2019d get along just fine.</p><p>\u201cMorganstern wants you to call him,\u201d Wesson said.</p> <p>\u201cThey get anything on the phone call?\u201d</p><p>Feinberg answered. \u201cThey were able to lock in on the call the unsub made to the rectory. The phone was owned by a woman named Tiffany Tyler, and the call was made just outside of St. Louis.\u201d</p><p>Feinberg stepped forward. \u201cThe highway patrol found her car parked on the shoulder of I-70. The left back tire was flat, and there wasn\u2019t a spare in the trunk. We think that she willingly got into the unsub\u2019s vehicle, but that\u2019s just an assumption. We also think he never touched her car, but even so, our techs went over it from top to bottom, inside and out. It\u2019s an old Chevy Caprice, and it was loaded with prints. They\u2019re running them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe any of the prints belong to our unsub.\u201d Wesson directed his explanation at Laurant. \u201cHe\u2019s careful, real careful.\u201d</p><p>Feinberg nodded. \u201cAnd methodical,\u201d he added as he removed his glasses and began to clean them with his handkerchief. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single smudge or half print on that tape or that envelope he left with the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you to start irritating him,\u201d Wesson said. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll lose control and mess up, and we\u2019ll get a lucky break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiffany\u2019s the woman I heard screaming over the phone, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Wesson answered. \u201cHe used her phone to call you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you found her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The answer was clipped, his lips pinched. He acted as though she had just criticized him personally.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s still alive. Do you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Wesson impatiently cut her off. \u201cShe\u2019s dead, no doubt about it.\u201d</p><p>His cold attitude rattled her. \u201cBut why would he pick her up in the first place? If he\u2019s so careful and if he does study his clients before he takes them on like he bragged, then why would he do such a spontaneous thing?\u201d</p><p>Feinberg answered her. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty certain he killed her to get our attention. He wants us to know he\u2019s the real thing.\u201d</p><p>Nick took hold of her hand. \u201cAnd Tiffany was . . . convenient. She was helpless and his for the taking.\u201d</p><p>Feinberg put his glasses back on, adjusted the rims around his ears, and said, \u201cI forgot to mention that Farley and I went through your mail. It\u2019s piled up on the table by your front door.\u201d</p><p>Laurant took the invasion of privacy in stride. Although it hadn\u2019t occurred to her that the FBI would be opening her mail, the fact that they had didn\u2019t bother her. They were simply being thorough, and that was something she appreciated.</p><p>Wesson took a step closer to Nick and said, \u201cJust so you understand. You\u2019re here solely as Laurant\u2019s bodyguard. Your job is to protect her every minute.\u201d</p><p>Wesson\u2019s tone had been antagonistic. Nick\u2019s was mild in comparison. \u201cI know what my job is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the plan is to enrage the unsub, so both of you have got to put on a show everyone in town will believe.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. Wesson wasn\u2019t quite finished putting Nick in his place. \u201cMy team will do the real work and catch this creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real work?\u201d Nick repeated sarcastically. \u201cWe\u2019re working this together, like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for Morganstern,\u201d Wesson pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I am here, and you\u2019re going to have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>The mood had turned hostile. They were like bulls getting ready to butt heads. Laurant squeezed Nick\u2019s hand. \u201cWe should get going, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t say another word. The phone rang just as he was opening the door to leave with Laurant. He turned back when he heard Wesson exclaim, \u201cHot damn.\u201d</p><p>Nick waited until he\u2019d finished the conversation, then asked, \u201cHot damn what?\u201d</p><p>Wesson smiled smugly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Wesson was a prick. He was also crass, obnoxious, rude, and arrogant, and his people skills sucked. Worse, he lacked compassion. The agent\u2019s response to hearing that a farmer had stumbled upon the mutilated body of eighteen-year-old Tiffany Tara Tyler had been grossly inappropriate. Wesson had been downright jubilant. Shouting with glee, the man had all but broken out in song, and what made his unbridled enthusiasm all the more obscene was that Laurant, a civilian, was there watching him.</p><p>Nick wanted to get her out of the cabin before she saw or heard anything more, and deal with Wesson later, but when he took hold of Laurant\u2019s arm to lead her outside, she pulled away. What she did next not only surprised him, but raised his admiration a notch.</p><p>She made Wesson squirm. She got right in his face so he couldn\u2019t ignore her, and then she gave him hell. She reminded him that a young girl had been murdered, and if he couldn\u2019t feel any remorse or pity for poor Tiffany, then perhaps he should consider another line of work.</p><p>When Wesson began to argue, Nick took over, but his language was much cruder than hers.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going in my report,\u201d Wesson threatened.</p><p>\u201cSee that it does,\u201d Nick countered.</p><p>Wesson decided to end the conversation. He resented that an outsider would offer an opinion about his behavior, and he wasn\u2019t about to waste any of his valuable time trying to placate her. That fell under Nick\u2019s job description.</p><p>\u201cJust do what I tell you to do, and we\u2019ll catch him,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t back down. \u201cAnd keep my opinions to myself?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t see any need to answer. Turning back to the computer, he ignored her.</p><p>Laurant swung around. \u201cNick, may I use your phone?\u201d He handed it to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s Dr. Morganstern\u2019s private number?\u201d</p><p>Wesson did a one-eighty in the swivel office chair and sprang to his feet. \u201cIf you have any problems, you bring them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Wesson looked at Nick for help in dealing with the difficult woman. Nick simply stared back at him as he rattled off Morganstern\u2019s phone number. \u201cJust hit thirty-two. It will speed dial the number for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, ma\u2019am, I know I sounded . . .\u201d</p><p>She paused in dialing. \u201cCallous, Mr. Wesson. You sounded cold-hearted, cruel, and callous.\u201d</p><p>Wesson tightened his jaw and narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any of us any good to get personally involved. We\u2019re trying to catch this pervert so that there won\u2019t be any more dead bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Tiffany,\u201d Nick reminded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to say her name,\u201d Laurant told him.</p><p>Shaking his head resignedly, as though he\u2019d say or do anything just to get her off his back, he said, \u201cTiffany. Her name was Tiffany Tara Tyler.\u201d</p><p>She handed the phone back to Nick and marched out of the cabin. She was inside the car before Nick could open the door for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat an obnoxious man,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou made him sweat, and I didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Pete would put someone like him in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t. Pete is consulting on this case. O\u2019Leary\u2019s the one in charge, and Wesson works under him.\u201d</p><p>Nick headed the car back toward town. The sun was just beginning to disappear behind the trees, creating a luminous glow on the lake\u2019s surface.</p><p>Laurant\u2019s thoughts were on Tiffany. \u201cWesson actually cheered when he heard about that poor girl.\u201d</p><p>Nick felt compelled to set the record straight. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t cheer because a woman was murdered. He was excited because we now have a crime scene, and hopefully, that\u2019s going to change things. I\u2019m not excusing Wesson\u2019s behavior,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to explain it. He\u2019s supposed to be a good agent. I\u2019ve only worked with him once in the past, but that was a long time ago, and we were both new and inexperienced. Pete says he\u2019s good. But Wesson\u2019s going to have to prove it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that now that you have a crime scene, things will change. How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery killer leaves what the profilers call his personal signature at his crime scene. It\u2019s an expression of his sick and violent fantasies, and it will tell us a lot about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s careful, you said so yourself. What if there aren\u2019t any clues at the crime scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWhenever one person comes into contact with another, he leaves something behind, no matter how careful he is. A hair follicle, a scale of skin, a bit of a fingernail, tread marks from the bottom of his shoes, or maybe a thread from his pants or shirt . . . there\u2019s always something left behind. The trick won\u2019t be finding the evidence. It\u2019s the analyzing what they find that\u2019s more difficult. It will take time and care. And while the criminologists are doing their job, the photos of the scene will be sent to the profiler and he\u2019ll tell us what fantasies the unsub\u2019s acting out.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her before continuing. \u201cA killer\u2019s signature,\u201d he explained, \u201cis his psychological calling card. He can change the methods he uses and the where and the when and the how, but he never changes his signature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s always a pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cLike the marks on the body or the way the body is positioned. The profiler looks at that and figures out what the killer is really after. I can already tell you that, with this man, it\u2019s all about control.\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped the car at the corner of Oak and Main. A young woman pushing a baby stroller crossed the street in front of them. She paused to give Nick the once-over and to wave at Laurant before continuing on.</p><p>\u201cMy house is on the next block, second from the corner. But I don\u2019t want to go there. I wish we could just check into a motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to go home and act like nothing\u2019s wrong, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I still don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to go back into that house again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d</p><p>They drove down the street, which was lined with trees older than any of the residents. The light of dusk, filtered by low branches, dappled the yards, but heavy storm clouds were just beginning to loom up on the horizon. Laurant saw her house and remembered how charming she\u2019d thought it was the first time she\u2019d driven up to it. It was old and worn, and she loved it. After she had moved in, the first thing she did was purchase a porch swing at the garden shop. Every morning she\u2019d take her cup of tea and sit on the swing while she read the paper. In the evenings, she\u2019d chat with the neighbors tending their yards.</p><p>The tranquility she\u2019d felt, the sense of belonging, was gone now, and she didn\u2019t know if she would ever get it back.</p><p>\u201cIs the camera still there, or did they take it away?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We don\u2019t want him to know we found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he didn\u2019t see the agents when they went into my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they found it in the hall closet,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cThey kept out of the camera\u2019s eye.\u201d</p><p>He pulled into the driveway and turned the motor off. She was staring at the house when she asked, \u201cWhere would he get something like that? Do they sell transmitters in the stores?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he could answer her, she blurted, \u201cEvery time I go into the bedroom, he could be watching.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her knee. \u201cWe want him to be watching. This is a great opportunity to push him. You and I are going to be getting hot and heavy in front of the camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know what the plan is.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t getting cold feet, but she could feel her resolve slipping away. Her life had turned into one of those surreal movies where nothing was as it appeared, where everything that looked benign and innocent was only a mask hiding something sinister. Her charming little house looked inviting, but he had been inside, and there was a camera focused on her bed.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready to go in?\u201d</p><p>Her nod was brisk.</p><p>Nick could see her anxiety and decided to try to take her mind off the moment. As he opened his door, he said, \u201cHoly Oaks is a pretty town, but I\u2019d still go crazy living here. Where\u2019s the traffic? Where\u2019s the noise?\u201d</p><p>She knew what he was doing. He was helping her cope. He could tell when she was getting overloaded, she realized, and that was when he lightened the conversation.</p><p>She opened her door and got out. \u201cYou like traffic and noise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m used to,\u201d he replied. They were looking at each other over the top of the car. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a lot of road rage here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we do. When the sheriff\u2019s son, Lonnie, goes joyriding with his friends, a lot of people would love to ram his car into a gully. He\u2019s a menace, and his father isn\u2019t going to do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe local thug, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She reached back into the car to get her purse while Nick surveyed the neighborhood. There was a big oak in the front yard, almost identical in size to the oak in the neighbor\u2019s yard on the corner. On the other side of the white, two-story house was an empty lot. At the end of the long drive was an unattached garage, which meant that when she put her car away, she had to walk to the back door. The two houses were close together, and there were trees and overgrown shrubs all along the sides\u2014too many places for a man to hide. He also noticed there weren\u2019t any outside lights on the house or the garage.</p><p>\u201cA burglar\u2019s paradise,\u201d he remarked. \u201cToo many concealed areas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a porch light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people here who don\u2019t ever lock their doors, even when they go to bed at night. It\u2019s a small town and everyone feels safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re locking your doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoo-hoo, Laurant. You\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned as a white-haired old lady wearing a bright purple dress with a wide lace collar opened her screen door and stepped out onto her porch. She was clutching a white lace handkerchief in her hand. She appeared to be around eighty years old and was as thin as a lightning rod.</p><p>\u201cWe had some excitement while you were away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Laurant called back. She went to her neighbor\u2019s picket fence and waited to hear what happened.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me shout, dear,\u201d Bessie Jean gently chided. \u201cCome over here and bring that young man with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to know who you are,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nick grabbed Laurant\u2019s hand and whispered back, \u201cShow time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovey-dovey stuff ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right, babe.\u201d And with that, he leaned down and lightly kissed her.</p><p>Bessie Jean Vanderman stood on her porch, taking it all in. Her eyes were as wide as saucers as she watched the smiling couple.</p><p>The picket fence ran the perimeter of the front yard. Nick let go of Laurant\u2019s hand to open the gate. As he followed her down the cement walk and up the stairs to the porch, he noticed another elderly woman peeking out at him through the screen. It was dark inside the house and the woman\u2019s face was cast in shadows.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the excitement?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cA hooligan broke into your house.\u201d Bessie Jean lowered her voice, as if sharing a confidence, and leaned toward Laurant. \u201cI called the sheriff and demanded that he come right over and investigate. I don\u2019t believe there were any arrests made. The sheriff left the hooligan inside and went running to his car. That was certainly a sight to see. He didn\u2019t have the good manners to come and tell me what was happening. You\u2019d best see if anything\u2019s missing.\u201d She straightened up and backed away to get a full view of Nick. \u201cNow who is this handsome man standing so close to you? I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen him in Holy Oaks before.\u201d</p><p>Laurant quickly made the introductions, but Bessie Jean Vanderman took her time sizing him up. This one doesn\u2019t miss a thing, he thought, spotting the shrewdness in her clear green eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it you do, Mr. Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with the FBI, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean\u2019s hand flew to her throat. She appeared startled for about two seconds, then recovered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so in the first place? I\u2019d like to see your badge, young man.\u201d</p><p>Nick produced his identification and handed it to her. She gave the badge only a cursory glance before handing it back.</p><p>\u201cYou took your sweet time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>The criticism was there in her brisk tone when she responded, \u201cSister and I don\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what she was talking about, and he could tell from Laurant\u2019s puzzled expression that she didn\u2019t have a clue either.</p><p>Bessie Jean pulled the screen door open. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to waste any more time. Come on inside and you can get started investigating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is it that you want me to investigate?\u201d he asked as he followed Laurant.</p><p>Bessie Jean\u2019s sister was waiting for them. Laurant again made the introductions. Viola took off her glasses and tucked them in the pocket of her apron as she came forward to shake his hand. She was shorter, rounder, and a much softer version of her sister.</p><p>\u201cWe waited and waited,\u201d she said. She patted Nick\u2019s hand before she let go. \u201cI\u2019d almost given up on you, but Bessie Jean never lost faith. She was just certain her letter was misplaced, and that\u2019s why she wrote another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like the FBI to drag their feet,\u201d Bessie Jean said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I knew my letter must have been lost in the mail. I wrote a second letter then, and when I still didn\u2019t hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote to the director himself,\u201d Viola explained.</p><p>Bessie Jean led the way into the living room. It was cool and dark and smelled of cinnamon and vanilla. One of them had been doing some baking, and his stomach rumbled in response. He was hungrier than he\u2019d realized.</p><p>Dinner would have to wait. It took his eyes a second to adjust to the darkness, then Viola opened the front window curtains, and he was squinting again. The room was cluttered with antiques. Directly ahead of him was the fireplace. The mantel was lined with candles, and above was a huge oil painting of a gray-haired dog sitting on a burgundy cushion. The animal appeared to be cross-eyed.</p><p>Bessie Jean ushered Nick and Laurant to the Victorian sofa, then removed the needlepoint pillow from the wicker rocker and sat down, crossing one ankle over the other as she\u2019d been trained to do by her mother. Her posture was so stiff, she could have balanced a couple of encyclopedias on her head.</p><p>\u201cGet your pad out, dear,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Nick barely heard her. His attention had been arrested by all the photos cluttering the tables and the walls. The subject was the same in every one of the silver frames\u2014the dog\u2014a schnauzer he guessed, or maybe a mixed breed.</p><p>Laurant touched his arm to get his attention and said, \u201cBessie Jean and Viola wrote to the FBI for help in solving a mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a mystery, dear,\u201d Viola corrected. \u201cWe know exactly what happened.\u201d She was sitting in a big floral print easy chair and was busy repinning the doily on one of the arms.</p><p>\u201cYes, we know what happened,\u201d Bessie Jean agreed with a nod.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give him the particulars, Sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have his pad and pen out yet.\u201d</p><p>Viola got up and went into the dining room while Nick patted his pockets, looking for a pad he knew he didn\u2019t have. It was in the car with his folders.</p><p>The sister came back with a pink notebook about the size of a pocket calculator and a pink pen with a purple feather sticking out from the end.</p><p>\u201cYou may use this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now tell me what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe director was remiss in not telling you what your assignment was,\u201d Bessie Jean said. \u201cYou\u2019re here to investigate a murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean patiently repeated her announcement. Viola nodded. \u201cSomeone murdered Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy was a family pet,\u201d Laurant explained with a nod toward the oil painting looming over them.</p><p>\u201cDaddy was named after our daddy, the colonel,\u201d Viola added.</p><p>To his credit, Nick didn\u2019t smile. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe demand justice,\u201d Viola told him</p><p>Bessie Jean was frowning at Nick. \u201cYoung man, I don\u2019t mean to criticize . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just never heard of a law officer not having a pad and pen. That gun clipped to your belt is loaded, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, it is.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean was satisfied. Having a gun was important in her opinion because, once he caught the culprit, he might very well have to shoot him.</p><p>\u201cHave the local authorities looked into the matter?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a matter, dear. It was murder,\u201d Viola corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe called Sheriff L.A. right away, but he won\u2019t do anything to help us find the criminal,\u201d Bessie Jean explained.</p><p>Viola, wishing to be helpful, interjected, \u201cThat\u2019s Lard Ass, dear. Now write it down.\u201d</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t decide which was more jarring\u2014a pet named Daddy or a sweet old lady using the words lard ass.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean gave her sister a relieved glance and then began. \u201cWe believe Daddy was poisoned, but we can\u2019t be absolutely certain. We kept him chained to the big oak in the front yard off and on during the day and sometimes into the evening on bingo night so he could take in the fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a fence, but Daddy could jump it, so we had to use the chain,\u201d Viola explained. \u201cAre you writing that down, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy was in the best of health,\u201d Bessie Jean told him.</p><p>\u201cHe was only ten and in his prime,\u201d Viola supplied.</p><p>\u201cHis water bowl was completely turned over,\u201d Bessie Jean said as she rocked back and forth, fanning herself with her handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cAnd Daddy could never have managed to turn that bowl over, because it was weighted down so he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean nodded again. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Daddy was clever, but he couldn\u2019t get his nose under that bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to have turned the bowl over,\u201d Viola said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cWe think poison was added to his water, and then after poor Daddy took a big drink, the culprit got rid of the evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know how he got rid of it too,\u201d Viola announced. \u201cHe threw the poisoned water into my impatiens,\u201d Viola said. \u201cHe killed my beautiful flowers. They were in glorious bloom one day and shriveled up and brown the next. They looked like someone had poured acid on them.\u201d</p><p>A bell started ringing in the back of the house. Viola struggled to get out of the chair. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll go get my buns out of the oven. Could I get you anything while I\u2019m up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Laurant said.</p><p>Nick was busy writing on his pad. He looked up and said, \u201cI could use a glass of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe often take a gin and tonic in an evening,\u201d Viola said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite refreshing on such hot humid days. Would you like one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater will do,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on duty, Sister. He can\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t contradict her. He finished making a note to himself and then asked, \u201cDid the dog bark at strangers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, yes,\u201d Bessie Jean answered. \u201cHe was a wonderful watch-dog. He was quite persnickety about letting strangers get near the house. He barked at everyone. Why, he took exception to anyone who walked down the street.\u201d</p><p>The topic of the dog was obviously still distressing to Bessie Jean. As she talked about him, she gradually increased the pace of her rocking. Nick half expected her to fling herself out of the chair.</p><p>\u201cThere are some strangers in town now, working up at the abbey. Three men moved into the old Morrison house across the street and are renting it while they\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd two more moved in with the Nicholsons at the other end of the block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy wasn\u2019t partial to any of them,\u201d Viola interjected from the dining room. She carried a glass of ice water across the room to the coffee table and set it on a napkin she pulled from her pocket.</p><p>Nick was rapidly getting the idea that Daddy wasn\u2019t partial to anyone.</p><p>\u201cThose Catholics are always in such a rush,\u201d Bessie Jean remarked. She had obviously forgotten that Laurant was Catholic and that her brother was a priest. \u201cThey\u2019re an impatient lot if you ask me. They want to get the renovations completed on the abbey so it will be ready for the open house during the July Fourth celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the abbey\u2019s anniversary celebration as well,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>Bessie Jean realized they were getting away from the investigation. \u201cWe had the doctor put Daddy in the freezer so you could oversee the autopsy. Are you getting all this down on your pad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I am,\u201d Nick assured her. \u201cPlease go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust yesterday I received a bill from the doctor for cremation services. I was thunderstruck, and I called him up right away. I was certain there had been a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog was cremated?\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean dabbed at the corners of her eyes with her handkerchief and then began to fan herself again. \u201cYes, he was. The doctor told me that my nephew had called him and told him we\u2019d changed our minds and to go ahead and cremate poor Daddy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rocking chair was really moving now, the floor creaking beneath it.</p><p>\u201cAnd the vet followed those instructions without consulting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Viola said. \u201cIt just never occurred to him to check with us first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour nephew\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it,\u201d Bessie Jean cried out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any nephews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, the culprit wanted to get rid of the evidence,\u201d Viola said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019d like to look at those flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you can\u2019t do that, dear,\u201d Viola said. \u201cJustin helped me dig out the roots and plant new flowers. He saw me out there, down on my knees, struggling so, and even after the hard day he\u2019d put in doing carpentry work up at the abbey, he was kind enough to come over and help me. I simply can\u2019t keep up with the yard anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is Justin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJustin Brady,\u201d Bessie Jean answered, impatiently. \u201cI do believe I already mentioned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Viola said. \u201cYou told Nicholas that three workmen moved into the Morrison house and two others lived with the Nicholsons. You didn\u2019t say their names. I heard every word you said as clear as a bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I meant to,\u201d Bessie Jean replied. \u201cI\u2019ve only met the three across the street. There\u2019s Justin Brady. He\u2019s the only one we like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he helped me,\u201d Viola said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s Mark Hanover and Willie Lakeman. They were all sitting on the porch steps together drinking beer, and all of them saw me struggling, but Justin\u2019s the only one who crossed the street to help me. The other two kept on drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, young man, do you believe Daddy was murdered, or do you think we\u2019re just a couple of dotty old ladies making up stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBased on what you\u2019ve told me, and assuming that it\u2019s accurate, I agree that your dog was killed,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>Laurant\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Bessie Jean clasped her hands together. She was elated. \u201cI knew the FBI wouldn\u2019t fail me. Now tell me, Nicholas, what are you prepared to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look into this myself. Some samples of the soil where those flowers were planted would help. And the water bowl . . . you do still have it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Viola said. \u201cIt\u2019s packed away in the garage with all of Daddy\u2019s favorite toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you keep us apprised of developments?\u201d Bessie Jean asked.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly will. You didn\u2019t happen to wash that water bowl, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we did,\u201d Viola said. \u201cWe were so upset, we just put it away so we wouldn\u2019t be . . . reminded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cViola wanted to take the painting down and pack up the pictures, but I wouldn\u2019t let her do it. It\u2019s a comfort having Daddy smiling down at us.\u201d</p><p>In unison, everyone paused to look up at the oil painting. While Nick was wondering how the women could tell that the dog was smiling, Laurant was pondering how the sisters could feel such affection for the nasty-tempered animal that snapped at everyone who came into the yard. He\u2019d bitten so many people, the vet kept his shot record posted on the waiting room bulletin board.</p><p>\u201cWe do hope the culprit turns out to be someone from outside our peaceful valley. We don\u2019t like to think that one of our own could do such a terrible thing,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put such cruelty past the sheriff\u2019s boy. Lonnie\u2019s always been trouble. The boy\u2019s got a real mean streak inside him that runs deep. He gets it from his father, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sneaky one all right. His mother passed on several years ago. I don\u2019t mean to speak ill of the dead, but she was a mousy woman. She didn\u2019t have any backbone at all, not even when she was a young girl. She was a whiner too, wasn\u2019t she, Bessie Jean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy yes, she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there were a lot of strangers in town,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHave you noticed anyone hanging around your house or Laurant\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spend a good deal of my time sitting on my porch and I will occasionally look out the windows at night, just to make certain things are as right as they should be. Except for the man I saw going into Laurant\u2019s house yesterday, I haven\u2019t noticed anyone in the yard or lurking about. Like I said before, most of the strangers are workmen helping out at the abbey. Some of them come from as far away as Nebraska and Kansas.\u201d</p><p>She planted both feet on the floor and brought the rocker to an abrupt stop. Leaning toward Nick and Laurant expectantly, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll stay to supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s macaroni night,\u201d Viola announced as she pushed against the cushions with both hands to raise herself out of the low chair and then headed for the kitchen. \u201cMacaroni and brisket and homemade cinnamon rolls, and I\u2019ll make company salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put you to any trouble,\u201d Laurant protested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to join you,\u201d Nick said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, why don\u2019t you help Sister, and I\u2019ll keep Nicholas company,\u201d Bessie Jean suggested.</p><p>\u201cCome and set the table, dear,\u201d Viola said. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat in the kitchen, but we\u2019ll use the Spode.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean didn\u2019t waste any time. As soon as Laurant disappeared, she leaned even farther out of the rocker and demanded to know how Nick and Laurant had become so friendly.</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting for the opportunity. In the barest of details, he told her about his friendship with Tommy and how he had been called in to help when a man came into the confessional and threatened to harm Laurant.</p><p>\u201cThe unfortunate incident brought us together,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur experts are all in agreement that the man was just a blowhard out to get some kicks. You know the kind. He wants to scare people, to stir up things and cause trouble. He wants attention, that\u2019s all. They figure he\u2019s not real bright. He probably has a low IQ,\u201d he added, \u201cand is most likely impotent.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean blushed. \u201cImpotent, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. That\u2019s what they figure he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t come here to investigate Daddy\u2019s murder?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wondered how long it would take her to figure that out. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m going to look into it all the same,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She sat back in the rocker. \u201cTell me a bit about your background, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him skim over it. She drilled him with the expertise of a master interrogator. She wanted to know everything about his family too.</p><p>Laurant saved him by appearing in the doorway and calling them to dinner. Nick followed Bessie Jean into the kitchen. The delicate, flowered china rested on a white linen tablecloth that almost completely covered the chrome legs of the kitchen table. Nick charmed the ladies with his gentlemanly manners by rushing to pull out their chairs for them. They beamed with pleasure.</p><p>Company salad turned out to be a square of lime Jell-O nestled on a bed of iceberg lettuce with a dab of mayonnaise on top. He hated Jell-O, but he ate it anyway so he wouldn\u2019t hurt their feelings, and while he was gulping it down, Bessie Jean filled Viola in on the incident that occurred in Kansas City.</p><p>\u201cThe things people will do for attention these days. Terrible, just terrible. Father Tom must have been very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he was,\u201d Laurant said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so he called Nick for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething good came out of it,\u201d Nick said. He winked at Laurant across the table and added, \u201cI finally met Tommy\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were taken with her, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Bessie Jean nodded, as though stating a foregone conclusion.</p><p>\u201cOf course he was,\u201d Viola said. \u201cShe\u2019s the prettiest girl in Holy Oaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was love at first sight,\u201d he told them, casting an adoring look at Laurant. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in that stuff until it happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Laurant?\u201d Viola asked. \u201cWas it love at first sight for you as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d she answered breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Viola said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s romantic, Bessie Jean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s romantic,\u201d Bessie Jean said. \u201cBut sometimes fires that start fast burn out fast. I wouldn\u2019t want our Laurant to get her heart broken. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying, Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I do, but it isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me, what are your intentions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Viola and Bessie Jean looked at each other and then burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking what I\u2019m thinking, Sister?\u201d Bessie Jean chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sure I am.\u201d Viola gave her sister a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is thrilling news,\u201d Bessie Jean announced. \u201cI assume Father Tom has given his blessing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he has,\u201d Laurant replied. \u201cHe\u2019s very happy for us.\u201d</p><p>Laurant and Nick looked at each other, puzzled by the ladies\u2019 laughter.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, we weren\u2019t laughing over your wonderful news. It\u2019s just . . . ,\u201d Viola began.</p><p>\u201cSteve Brenner,\u201d Bessie Jean supplied. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a tantrum when he finds out about you two. Oh my, yes, and I do so hope Sister and I are there to see it happen. Mr. Brenner has grand plans for you, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even gone out with the man, and I don\u2019t believe I did anything to encourage his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s infatuated, dear,\u201d Viola explained.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s obsessed,\u201d Bessie Jean corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re the prettiest girl in Holy Oaks, so he\u2019s got to have you. He thinks that having the best of everything will make him the best man in town. That\u2019s why he bought the big old house over on Sycamore. If you ask me, Mr. Brenner\u2019s nothing but a big old rooster, strutting around town.\u201d She turned to Nick. \u201cHe thinks he can take anything he wants, including your Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s in for a surprise, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Bessie Jean smiled. \u201cMy, yes, he is,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou may have noticed that Sister and I don\u2019t have a high opinion of the man.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone else likes him just fine,\u201d Viola said. \u201cWe know why too. Mr. Brenner donates money to all the local charities, and that makes people appreciative. He isn\u2019t a bad-looking fellow either. He has a nice head of hair.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean scowled disdainfully. \u201cI\u2019m not so easily impressed. I don\u2019t care for showy people, and Mr. Brenner throws money around like it\u2019s grass seed. I\u2019m going to lose my appetite if we keep talking about him. Now, Laurant, is your engagement official, or do you want us to keep quiet about it? We can keep a secret when we have to,\u201d she assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou may tell anyone you want to tell. Nick and I are going to be looking for an engagement ring tomorrow or the day after.\u201d She was brimming with excitement as she put her hand out and wiggled her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything too big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to put the announcement in the paper. I could help you with that,\u201d Bessie Jean suggested.</p><p>From the eagerness in Bessie Jean\u2019s voice and the glint in her eyes, Laurant knew she was dying to give the news to her friend\u2019s daughter, Lorna Hamburg, who just happened to be the editor of the society page.</p><p>\u201cI could ring Lorna up right after supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be very helpful,\u201d Laurant agreed.</p><p>\u201cShould I mention the problem in Kansas City?\u201d</p><p>Laurant wasn\u2019t sure and looked at Nick who quickly answered. \u201cOf course you should mention it. The editor will probably want to know all the details of how we met. Right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>The endearment wasn\u2019t planned. It just slipped out, and he was more surprised than she appeared to be.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling. I think Bessie Jean should also tell Little Lorna that the FBI experts have concluded that they\u2019re dealing with a man who\u2019s obviously disturbed . . . and inferior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be sure to tell Little Lorna everything,\u201d Viola said. She passed the platter of brisket to Nick, insisting that he take a second helping. Nick pushed his chair back, patted his full stomach, and told her that he couldn\u2019t eat another bite.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many disturbed people in the world today,\u201d Bessie Jean remarked with a shake of her head. \u201cIt will be a comfort to know an FBI agent is close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly will you be staying?\u201d Viola asked.</p><p>\u201cWith Laurant,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman, and she can take care of herself, but I want to be there to help make sure she\u2019s safe from men like Steve Brenner and anyone else who thinks he\u2019s going to bother her.\u201d</p><p>The sisters both raised their eyebrows and shared a look that Nick couldn\u2019t interpret. He\u2019d said something they didn\u2019t like, but he didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p>Bessie Jean put her fork down, pushed her plate back, then folded her hands on the table and collected her thoughts for a moment before turning to look directly at Laurant.</p><p>\u201cDear, I\u2019m going to be blunt. I know a thing or two about raging hormones in young bodies. I may be old and set in my ways, but I keep up with the changing times by watching my stories on the television. Now, you don\u2019t have a mother or a father to guide you. Oh, I know you\u2019re an adult, but you still need someone who\u2019s older and wiser to counsel you every now and then. Every young woman does. Sister and I have grown quite fond of you, and with that fondness comes worry. Now, I\u2019m going to ask you straight out. While Nicholas is busy protecting you from other men, how do you propose to protect yourself from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s talking about your virtue, dear,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made a commitment to one another,\u201d Nick began. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything . . . dishonorable . . . and neither will Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople will talk, but they\u2019ll do it behind your backs,\u201d Viola told him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll talk anyway,\u201d Bessie Jean said. \u201cThe best intentions sometimes get pushed to the side of the road in the heat of the moment. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laurant opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. She shot Nick a pleading look.</p><p>\u201cGet to the point, Bessie Jean,\u201d Viola urged as she folded her napkin neatly on the table and stood.</p><p>\u201cAll right then, I will,\u201d she said, delicately dabbing at the corners of her mouth with her napkin. \u201cSafe sex, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Viola agreed. She circled the table, collecting the plates. \u201cWe want you to practice safe sex . . . shall we have dessert?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Steve Brenner was in a cold rage. The bitch had gone too far this time. No one, man or woman, was going to make a fool out of him. It was high time Laurant was taught a lesson, and he was just the man to inflict it. Who the hell did she think she was to humiliate him in front of his associates and his friends by bringing another man home?</p><p>How could anyone fall in love in the space of one weekend?</p><p>Infuriated over the news Sheriff Lloyd had just given him, he picked up a chair and hurled it across the room, knocking a desk lamp to the floor. He watched it shatter, and then, still enraged, he slammed his fist into the wall. Fresh paint splattered in every direction, spraying white mist on his freshly laundered, bloodred, Polo shirt. The drywall crumbled under his hand, and the skin on his callused knuckles ripped wide open when he struck the cement block behind the wall. Oblivious to the pain or the mess he\u2019d just made, he jerked his hand back, then shook himself like a wet dog ridding itself of excess water.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think when he was this angry, and he knew he needed to be clearheaded so that he could figure out his options. He was the master of the game, after all. The bitch didn\u2019t understand that yet, but she soon would. Yes, indeed.</p> <p>Sheriff Lloyd was sprawled in a chair behind an empty desk. He appeared to be relaxed, but inside he was as nervous and tense as a cornered possum because he knew firsthand what Steve was capable of when he was riled. God help him, he never wanted to see that side of his new associate again.</p><p>Lloyd\u2019s brand new, silver, mustang belt buckle was digging painfully into his gut, but he was afraid to move. He didn\u2019t want to do anything that would draw attention to himself until Steve had gotten his temper under control.</p><p>Fat red drops of blood were steadily dripping down on Steve\u2019s pressed khaki pants and turning into black streaks all the way down to his knee. Lloyd thought about telling Steve\u2014he knew how important his appearance was to him\u2014but he decided to keep quiet instead and pretend he didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Most of the women in town thought Steve was a handsome man, and the sheriff supposed he was, with his wavy brown hair and good bone structure. His face was a little long, but when he smiled, the women didn\u2019t see anything but charisma. He wasn\u2019t smiling now though, and if those same women could see the frost in his eyes, they wouldn\u2019t think he was handsome at all. They might even be as afraid of him as Lloyd was.</p><p>Steve clenched and unclenched his fists as he stood at the window, looking out at the square with his back to the sheriff. Three teenagers were riding their skateboards along the sidewalks, ignoring the posted signs prohibiting bicycles and skateboards as they sped along. The pharmacist, Conrad Kellogg, came running outside waving his hands when one of the freaks with dyed-orange, long, straggly hair accidentally rammed into his window.</p><p>Directly across the square, the door opened to Laurant\u2019s store, and the Winston twins, dressed in bib overalls, came outside. They were working late tonight. The streetlights were already on, which meant it was after seven. All the stores but the pharmacy closed at six. The twins were working overtime to get the store ready. Steve watched as they adjusted the seals around the window they\u2019d just installed in her storefront.</p> <p>\u201cA damn waste of money,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say, Steve?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Since the brooding man wasn\u2019t paying any attention to him now, Lloyd decided it was safe to get comfortable. He eased his belt down below his extended belly, unbuttoned his pants to give him a little more room, and then dug his pocketknife out of his pocket. Flipping the rusty blade open, he began to dig the dirt out from under his ragged nails.</p><p>\u201cI take off for a couple of days to get in a little fishing, and what happens? She falls in love with another man. Son of a bitch. If she had only given me a chance . . . if she had let herself get to know me, she would have fallen in love with me. No question about that. I can be fu**ing charming when I want to,\u201d Steve snapped.</p><p>Lloyd didn\u2019t know if he should try to placate him now or commiserate with him on this latest development. Saying the wrong thing could be worse than saying nothing at all, and so he settled on a loud grunt, leaving it to Steve to interpret.</p><p>\u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day,\u201d Steve railed. \u201cAll I wanted was a chance. I figured I\u2019d give her some time to get used to the idea, then maybe send her some more flowers and ask her out again. Did you see the way she ignored me at the fish fry last month? No matter what I did, she wouldn\u2019t let me get near her. She acted like I was a pesky fly. That\u2019s how much attention she gave me. People noticed too. I saw the way they were watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Steve, it ain\u2019t like that at all. Everyone in Holy Oaks knows you\u2019re going to marry Lauren. She\u2019s got to know it too. Maybe she\u2019s just sowing some wild oats before she settles down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen sow wild oats, not women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen maybe she\u2019s just playing hard to get.\u201d He winced when he poked tender skin under his thumbnail with the pocketknife. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the richest man in the valley and she knows it. Yeah, that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. Playing hard to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she was . . . better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThan what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s staying there with her, then she\u2019s letting him touch her.\u201d</p><p>Rage was back in his voice, and Lloyd tried to deflect it. \u201cI think she\u2019s just testing you. Women like men to chase them. Everybody knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were those men at the house?\u201d He whirled around and regarded the sheriff malevolently while he waited for an explanation. He got an excuse instead.</p><p>\u201cI was in a hurry to tell you about Lauren bringing home another man. I didn\u2019t think to ask their names. They told me they were friends and they were there to fix her sink. They had tools and I figured they were probably on their way to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t bother to get their names or see some identification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a hurry,\u201d Lloyd whined. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, you\u2019re the sheriff in this two-bit, shantytown. Don\u2019t you know how to do your job?\u201d</p><p>Lloyd dropped the knife and put his hands up in a conciliatory gesture. \u201cDon\u2019t take your anger out on me. I\u2019m just the messenger. If you want, I\u2019ll go right on back there and get all the information you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Steve muttered before turning his back on the sheriff again. \u201cMaybe that old, dried-up biddy next door was right. Maybe they were robbing Laurant\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Steve, you know she doesn\u2019t have nothing worth stealing. I\u2019m telling you they\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t get his anger under control. Laurant sharing her bed with another man. It was unforgivable. Maybe she was just trying to assert her independence . . . playing a little game with him. Oh, yes, she needed to be taught a lesson all right. He\u2019d let her rudeness go unpunished in the past, and so he could only blame himself for this latest insult. The first time she had given him the cold shoulder he should have put the fear of God into her then and there. Some women required a heavy hand until they learned where their place was. His first wife had been like that, but he\u2019d believed Laurant was different. She\u2019d seemed delicate and almost perfect, but he realized now he\u2019d used the wrong approach. He\u2019d been too damned polite and nice, but that was going to change.</p><p>\u201cNo one falls in love in a single weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to her friends, she\u2019s real taken with this Nick Buchanan,\u201d Lloyd remarked. His head was down, his concentration on getting the dirty paste out from under his pinky nail. \u201cThese friends . . . they told me Nick and Lauren were gonna get married.\u201d</p><p>After blurting out the last bit of information, Lloyd glanced up to see how Steve was reacting.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Steve muttered. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd nodded. \u201cBut you know . . . if they should get married, they\u2019d probably move away . . . what with his job and all . . . I didn\u2019t think to ask what it was this Nick fellow does for a living . . . but then don\u2019t you see? She\u2019d have to sell her store.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s gaze turned glacial as he watched Lloyd. The fat man reminded him of a monkey in the zoo, grooming himself in public without a care in the world. He was disgusting, but he was useful, and for that reason, Steve put up with him.</p><p>Lloyd put his penknife away, noticed all the dirt on the white desk pad, and brushed it to the floor. Glancing out the window he remarked, \u201cLooks like Lauren\u2019s store is going to open real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen either,\u201d Steve said. His face was contorted with anger, and he took a threatening step toward the sheriff. \u201cDo you have any notion in that pea brain of yours how much money we stand to lose if she gets her way and convinces the other shop owners not to sell? I\u2019m not letting anyone screw this deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about breaking the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew the law,\u201d he roared. \u201cYou\u2019re already in this up to your ass,\u201d he added in a snarl. \u201cSo what if you have to go in a little deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t broken the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Tell that to old lady Broadmore. You\u2019re the one who forged her name on that legal document.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd began to sweat. \u201cThat was all your idea, and what was the harm? The old lady was already dead and her relatives will get the money, so they sure don\u2019t care. Hell, they would have sold her store, but you said they\u2019d hold us up for a lot more money if they knew about our deal with the development company. I don\u2019t look at what we done as criminal.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s laugh sounded like a nail going down a chalkboard. \u201cIt might have been my idea, but you\u2019re the man who signed her name, and I noticed you couldn\u2019t wait to spend your bonus money buying yourself a new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only did what I was told to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, and you\u2019re going to keep on doing what you\u2019re told. You want to retire a rich man, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. I want to leave this town . . . get away from . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonnie?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff averted his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of your own son, aren\u2019t you, Lloyd? As mean and bad-tempered as you are, you\u2019re still afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, I\u2019m not,\u201d he blustered.</p><p>Steve hooted with laughter, and the sound was even more grating than ten fingernails scratching at a chalkboard. Lloyd had to force himself not to cringe.</p><p>\u201cYou chicken shit. You\u2019re scared of your boy.\u201d</p><p>At the moment, what scared Lloyd more than his son was knowing that Steve could see through his \u201cbig man\u201d veneer. \u201cLonnie\u2019s going on nineteen years now, and I\u2019m telling you, he ain\u2019t never been right in his head, not even when he was little. He\u2019s got a real mean attitude and a nasty temper to boot. I\u2019ll admit I do want to get away from him, but not because I\u2019m scared. I can still beat the crap out of him. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m sick and tired of the messes he\u2019s always getting himself into. I\u2019ve had to sneak him out of trouble more times than I can count. Lonnie\u2019s going to kill someone one of these days. He came damn close with the Edmond girl. She ended up in the hospital, and I had to do some pretty fancy talking to get that doctor to keep quiet. I convinced him that Mary Jo would kill herself if folks heard she\u2019d gotten herself raped. She\u2019d never be able to hold her head up in this town again.\u201d</p><p>Steve cocked his head. \u201cYou threatened him too, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019ll bet you told him you\u2019d sic Lonnie on him or his wife if he said a word. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do to keep my boy out of jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what everyone in town calls you? Sheriff Lard Ass. They\u2019re laughing at you behind your back. If you want things to change, keep your mouth shut and do what I tell you to do. Then you can leave Holy Oaks and Lonnie, and never look back.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd was slowly tearing strips from the paper on the blotter. He kept his gaze averted when he asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna tell Lonnie what I\u2019m planning to do, are you? The boy thinks he\u2019s gonna get a big cut of the money, and I want to be long gone before he figures out he ain\u2019t getting a dime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell him anything as long as you continue to cooperate. Do we understand each other? Now about this Buchanan\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lloyd\u2019s neck snapped back. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Brenner\u2019s hand clenched into a fist again with the intent of smashing it into Lloyd\u2019s fat face, but he felt the sting in his knuckles this time, and glancing down, saw the bloodstains on his pant leg. Shit. He was going to have to change clothes again. Appearances had to be maintained, and he couldn\u2019t stand to look the least bit imperfect.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he muttered as he strode to the bathroom in the back of the office to wash his hand.</p><p>Lloyd finally remembered who Buchanan was. \u201cI still wish you\u2019d let me go on back to Lauren\u2019s house and have a talk with those friends. They could still be there.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd\u2019s nasally whine was getting on Steve\u2019s nerves. He didn\u2019t have any patience for slow-witted people, and if the sheriff weren\u2019t a necessary ingredient in his grand scheme, he would have taken great delight in beating the hell out of him. Better yet, he\u2019d order Lonnie to do it for him while he watched. The boy would do whatever Steve told him to do because, like his father, he was motivated by greed and hate, and failure.</p><p>He finished washing, patted his hands dry with a paper towel, then folded it neatly into a perfect square before tossing it into the trash can. Reaching into his back pocket, he pulled out his comb and stood in front of the mirror, smoothing his hair back. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lonnie now?\u201d he called out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He never tells me where he\u2019s going. If he\u2019s gotten his lazy ass out of bed, then he\u2019s probably down at the lake, fishing. Why do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>It was time for the lesson. Laurant was going to learn he wouldn\u2019t put up with any competition.</p><p>\u201cNever you mind. Go find him and send him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go pick up my new car first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what I tell you first, then you can get your damned car. I said, go find Lonnie.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff shoved his chair back and stood. \u201cBut what should I tell him.\u201d</p><p>Steve came back into the office. He was smiling when he answered. \u201cTell him I\u2019ve got a job for him.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Laurant deliberately prolonged her visit with the Vandermans. She needed the time to psych herself up for the ordeal ahead of her.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, everything had changed. She used to think of her home as her safe haven, a sanctuary really, where she could find peace and tranquility after putting in a hard day\u2019s work. He had taken that away from her, the man the FBI nicknamed the unsub. The unknown subject who was tearing her mind into shreds.</p><p>How long had he been watching her? Would he be sitting in a comfortable chair watching her tonight? Laurant blanched at the thought. Soon now she would go into her bedroom and get ready for bed while the camera tracked her every movement.</p><p>She had a sudden urge to put on her tennis shoes and go running. She couldn\u2019t, of course, it was dark out, and it wasn\u2019t part of the approved-by-Wesson schedule. Laurant still wanted to do it though. She had started her running regimen after she heard about her brother\u2019s cancer. It was an outlet, a way of dealing with her fear. She loved the physical exercise, pushing herself to the limit, faster and faster, until her mind cleared and all she could concentrate on was the pounding of her heartbeat, the crunch of the scrub under her feet, and the rhythm of her breathing as she raced along the broken path around the lake. She became oblivious to her surroundings as she pushed and pushed, harder and harder, until the blessed endorphins kicked in, energizing her. For a brief time, the panic was gone, and she felt gloriously alive and completely free.</p><p>She longed for that feeling now, and oh God, how she wanted control over her life again. She hated being afraid, and alternating between fury and terror was making her crazy.</p><p>\u201cDear, be careful with that cup. You don\u2019t want to chip it.\u201d</p><p>Viola\u2019s caution pulled Laurant back to the present. Viola continued to tell her the latest gossip she\u2019d picked up at her ladies\u2019 bridge club. Laurant tried to pay attention as she finished hand drying the blue Spode. When the kitchen was cleaned, she followed the elderly woman out onto the porch and sat side by side with her in the glider while Bessie Jean, her hand tucked into the crook of Nick\u2019s arm, took him on a stroll around the property to show off her petunias and her vegetable garden. The streetlight barely lit the backyard.</p> <p>Nick was more interested in the dark, vacant, tree-lined lot behind Laurant\u2019s house than the garden. Cluttered with thick shrubs and bushes, it was a paradise for the unsub to hide and watch, or creep up on Laurant\u2019s house without being seen.</p><p>\u201cDo kids ever play in that lot?\u201d he asked Bessie Jean after complimenting her on her garden.</p><p>\u201cThey used to, but they don\u2019t go back there anymore, not since Billy Cleary got a fierce case of poison ivy. He was wearing shorts and he sat in it, you see, and from what his mother told me, it was a very painful experience. The child couldn\u2019t sit down for two weeks. Once he was feeling better, Billy and his friends turned to playing by the lake.\u201d</p><p>They had made a full circle of the house. Bessie Jean called out to Viola, \u201cI was just telling Nicholas about Billy Cleary and how he used to play in the lot behind Laurant\u2019s house until he got poison ivy.\u201d She climbed the steps and sat down in a wicker chair.</p><p>Viola leaned toward Laurant. \u201cHis privates were covered in it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI told Nicholas no one goes near that lot anymore,\u201d Bessie Jean explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Viola said. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Sister? Several weeks ago there were children playing back there. Daddy stood on his hind legs at the back screen, barking and barking. We had to shut the door to calm him down.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t believe those were children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was going on dark. It was probably just a raccoon or possum back there. Actually, now that I reflect upon it, I believe that a wild animal was making a home back there because Daddy put up a fuss several times that week.\u201d</p> <p>Viola nodded. \u201cYes, he did,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Nick leaned against the railing. \u201cHow long ago did this happen? Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure,\u201d Bessie Jean said.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Viola announced. \u201cI\u2019d just put in the Big Boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig Boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomatoes,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was when?\u201d Nick asked patiently.</p><p>\u201cAlmost a month ago.\u201d</p><p>Bessie Jean didn\u2019t agree. She thought Viola was mistaken and that it hadn\u2019t been quite that long. The sisters bickered about it for several minutes before Laurant stood, drawing their attention and putting an end to the budding argument.</p><p>\u201cNick and I should be heading home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, you\u2019ll want to get unpacked and settled, won\u2019t you?\u201d Viola remarked.</p><p>\u201cShe looks tuckered out, doesn\u2019t she, Sister,\u201d Bessie Jean commented.</p><p>Nick was in full agreement. Laurant did look worn-out. There were dark circles under her eyes. She looked completely different from the first time he\u2019d seen her at the rectory. When she had learned that Tommy was all right, she completely relaxed, and for a short while, she didn\u2019t appear to have a care in the world.</p><p>But that was before her brother had told her about the sick bastard who wanted to kill her. To her credit, she hadn\u2019t collapsed or gotten hysterical like some would. And Nick remembered the strength she\u2019d shown later when she\u2019d talked Pete into letting her set a trap. How much strength and endurance did she have stored inside her? He hoped to God she had enough to see this nightmare through.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for dinner. It was lovely,\u201d Laurant said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you my recipe for my macaroni dish,\u201d Viola promised.</p><p>Bessie Jean scoffed. \u201cWhat recipe? You followed the directions on the Kraft macaroni and cheese box. Just get her one at the store, Sister.\u201d</p><p>Nick added his thank-you, then casually draped his arm around Laurant\u2019s shoulders. Bessie Jean escorted the couple to the end of her walk and opened the gate for them.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes never settle, do they, Nicholas?\u201d So that the young man wouldn\u2019t take offense, she hastened to explain. \u201cI notice little things, you see, and from the moment you stepped out on my porch, you\u2019ve been surveying the neighborhood. It\u2019s not a criticism,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I noticed. You\u2019re always on your guard, aren\u2019t you? I imagine you were trained to do that at the FBI school.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cActually, I\u2019m just nosy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, her green eyes sparkling. Nick guessed she must have given the men in Holy Oaks a merry chase when she was a young girl.</p><p>Leaning around Nick, she whispered loudly, \u201cI like your young man. Don\u2019t chase this one off, dear.\u201d</p><p>Laurant laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to,\u201d she promised. \u201cI like this one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSister and I know all about a woman\u2019s biological clock,\u201d she said. \u201cA good number of women your age already have two or three children. It\u2019s time you got started on a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d she answered for lack of anything better to say. She knew it was pointless to argue with Bessie Jean or mention that plenty of women waited until they were in their thirties to start a family and that Laurant had several years to go before that momentous birthday. Bessie Jean was outspoken, opinionated, and as subtle as a sledgehammer, but Laurant still liked her. As flawed as she was, she was also honest and kind . . . on occasion anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy, look, there\u2019s Justin Brady and Willie Lakeman.\u201d</p><p>The neighbors across the street were carrying a long extension ladder around from the backyard. One of them propped it against the side of the house and began to climb up while the other held it in place.</p><p>Bessie Jean called out a greeting and smiled when the two men waved.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late to be painting,\u201d Nick remarked.</p><p>He\u2019d only just made the comment when the floodlights were turned on from inside the house.</p><p>\u201cJustin\u2019s the young man on the ladder,\u201d Viola said. \u201cI told you about him. When he saw me working in my flower bed, he came right over to lend a hand. I didn\u2019t much care for any of them starting out, but I\u2019ve since changed my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you like them starting out?\u201d Nick asked, eyeing the tall, muscular man who was leaning into the ladder and reaching for the putty knife in the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI thought they were all useless, but they\u2019re just ornery, not shiftless. They\u2019re keeping their promise,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cThe owner, Mr. Morrison, made an arrangement with the boys to paint his house in lieu of paying rent. He\u2019s off in Florida taking in the sun until after the celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen any of them working on the house,\u201d Bessie Jean said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I have seen though. Almost every single night for the past couple of weeks, they\u2019ve been walking down to the bar and grill on Second Street and drinking until closing time. They don\u2019t care about their neighbors trying to sleep. They sing and laugh and carry on, making a terrible racket when they\u2019re coming home. I\u2019ve watched them from my window, and just two weeks ago one of them passed out in the front yard. I believe it was Mark Hanover. He slept there all night. It\u2019s shameful the way they carry on, getting drunk as skunks.\u201d</p><p>The sisters obviously had different opinions on the renters.</p><p>\u201cBut now they\u2019re keeping their word,\u201d Viola reminded her. \u201cAnd Justin told me that, as soon as they finish working at the abbey, they\u2019re going to fix the house up, even if it means working from sunup to sundown. I believe they\u2019ll do it too.\u201d</p><p>Nick kept trying to get a better look at Willie Lakeman, but his back was turned to the street and he was wearing a baseball cap. Even if he turned around, Nick doubted he\u2019d see his face clearly. Willie appeared to be about the same height and weight as Justin.</p><p>He decided to walk over and say hello. Maybe he could get the third renter to come outside and he could size him up too. His plan changed when he heard Laurant yawn. She was falling asleep on her feet.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart. Let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>She followed him to the car and helped carry in the bags. The house was dark except for a small desk lamp by the phone, and all the draperies were closed. The phone rang just as she started up the stairs with her overnight bag. She dropped it on the floor, switched on a light, and hurried into the living room. Nick had warned her that there would always be at least one FBI agent inside her house at all times, so she wasn\u2019t taken by surprise when the swinging door to the kitchen opened and a man dressed in black pants and a long-sleeved white shirt rolled up to his elbows came hurrying toward her. There was a gun clipped to his belt and a sandwich in his hand.</p><p>He beat her to the phone, which was on the desk between her living room and dining room, checked the caller ID, and picked up a headset attached to the base of the phone, then motioned for her to answer.</p><p>From the number displayed, she knew it was Michelle Brockman calling. She was Laurant\u2019s best friend and would soon be a bride.</p><p>\u201cHi. How\u2019d you know I was back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Holy Oaks, remember?\u201d Michelle said. \u201cSo tell me, is it true? Did some man actually threaten you in Kansas City? I\u2019m never letting you leave this town again if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Laurant assured her friend. \u201cIt was just some guy thinking he was funny. The authorities looked into it and said he\u2019s not to be taken seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Michelle sighed. \u201cOkay then, tell me, who is the hunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Michelle\u2019s laughter erupted over the phone. The sound always made Laurant smile. It came from deep in her belly, and it was filled with such joy and mischief. They had met at the monthly fish fry. Laurant had only been in town a week and hadn\u2019t even unpacked her things before Tommy volunteered her services in the kitchen at the fund-raising event. Michelle had also been commandeered.</p><p>An instant friendship developed. They were complete opposites. Laurant was reserved, and Michelle was exuberant. She was also considerate. Lorna Hamburg had cornered Laurant and was trying to get as much personal information as she could for an article she wanted to write about the newcomer, or as she called her, the foreigner from Chicago. Michelle dragged Laurant away from the busy-body and wouldn\u2019t let Lorna harass her. They became best friends from that moment on.</p><p>\u201cI asked, who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Laurant replied, deliberately tormenting her friend.</p><p>\u201cStop playing games. I\u2019m dying of curiosity. I want to know. Who is the hunk you brought home with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Nicholas Buchanan. Do you remember I told you that my brother lived with the Buchanans when he was growing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s Tommy\u2019s best friend,\u201d she explained. \u201cI never met him until last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gone to bed with him yet?\u201d</p><p>Laurant could feel herself blushing. \u201cHold on a minute, will you?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over the mouthpiece of the old-fashioned phone and whispered to the agent, \u201cDo you need to listen in on this private conversation?\u201d</p><p>The agent was trying hard not to smile. He put the headset down and walked away. She pulled the chair out and sat down at the desk, facing the wall.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m back,\u201d she announced as she picked up a ballpoint pen and began to click it open and shut.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being evasive. Did you go to bed with him yet? I heard he\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Laurant laughed. \u201cMichelle, you shouldn\u2019t be asking questions like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m your dearest friend, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m worried about you. You need sex, Laurant. It\u2019s good for your complexion.\u201d</p><p>Laurant began to scribble on the notepad. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my complexion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing sex wouldn\u2019t help. It will bring color to your cheeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use blush.\u201d</p><p>Michelle let out a loud, exaggerated sigh. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he really just a friend of your brother\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>Laurant bowed her head. She felt horrible about lying to her best friend, but she knew that when this was over and she could finally tell Michelle the truth, she would understand.</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t just a friend.\u201d She turned in the chair to look at Nick. He was standing in the front hallway with the other agent and nodding at something the man was telling him. His expression was somber until he caught her staring at him. Then he smiled.</p><p>She turned back to the wall. \u201cThe oddest thing happened, Michelle,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell in love.\u201d</p><p>Michelle was immediately skeptical. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You actually allowed yourself to fall in love? I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest? It happened awfully fast, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied. She picked up the pen again and began to draw.</p><p>\u201cHe must be something else to get through all your defenses. I can\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, and I know you\u2019ll like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. He must have knocked you over to get your attention. You fell hard, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is mind-blowing,\u201d Michelle exclaimed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that shocking,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease.\u201d</p><p>Laurant laughed. Michelle always put her in a good mood. She was so dramatic and very open in her feelings and attitudes, whereas Laurant kept everything close to her heart. Michelle was the only friend since high school whom she had ever confided in.</p><p>\u201cI know what goes on in that warped head of yours. You\u2019re always trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with the guy, and you\u2019re always playing it safe. Just because you got burned once\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t count the college guy,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cEveryone gets her heart broken in college at least once. I\u2019m only counting the creep from Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a creep,\u201d Laurant agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd just because you misjudged him, you concluded all men were scum. Except my Christopher. You never thought he was scum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t. I love Christopher.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI do too. He\u2019s so sweet and wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess this one up, Laurant. Go with your feelings this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, don\u2019t mess this one up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your history . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go all irate on me. I\u2019m simply telling it like it is. You don\u2019t have a very good record with men around here. Want me to go through the list of men you\u2019ve rejected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t love any of those men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never let yourself get to know any of them long enough to find out if there was a future or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. Everyone in town was so certain that Steve Brenner would be able to get through that thick shell of yours. I heard he was telling people he wanted to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard. I don\u2019t even like the man, and I certainly never encouraged him. He gives me the creeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him, and so does Christopher. Steve is charming and funny and witty. Everyone likes him but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBessie Jean Vanderman and her sister don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. They don\u2019t like anyone.\u201d</p><p>Laurant laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. They dislike the Catholics because they\u2019re too pushy, and I just heard that Viola thinks Rabbi Spears is running a crooked bingo game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I make that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something. How did you find out so quickly that Nick was with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotline. While Bessie Jean was standing out front, her sister snuck back inside, called my mother, and she told me. We all know how Viola loves to embellish. She said you were getting engaged, but mother and I didn\u2019t believe her. Do you think you will marry Nicholas one day, or is it too soon to ask that question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just asked me if we slept together,\u201d she reminded her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I asked you if you had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Viola wasn\u2019t embellishing. I am going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Michelle shrieked again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me right away. You\u2019re serious? You\u2019re really . . . I can\u2019t believe this. It\u2019s happening too fast for my little brain to take in. Have you set a date yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut Nick wants to get married real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, this is so romantic. Wait until I tell Christopher. You\u2019re my maid of honor,\u201d she said then. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>The hint wasn\u2019t subtle. \u201cWill you be my maid of honor?\u201d</p><p>Michelle paused to shout the news to her parents. Both of them had to take a turn on the phone congratulating Laurant, and by the time Michelle was back, ten more minutes had passed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be your maid of honor. I\u2019m honored that you asked me. Oh, that reminds me. I called you to tell you your dress is ready. You can pick it up tomorrow. Try it on one more time, okay? I don\u2019t want any screwups on the day of my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe picnic,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect to meet Nick then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat picnic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what picnic? The abbot\u2019s throwing a big thank-you party at the lake for everyone who worked so hard on the renovations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this decided?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You were out of town. It was in the Sunday bulletin, but you were in Kansas City. Oh, my God, I forgot to ask. The news about Nick turned me into a blithering idiot I suppose. It was so . . . un-you . . . that it was all I could think about. I forgot to ask. Is your brother all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s fine. He got a clean bill of health this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no chemo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chemo.\u201d</p><p>Michelle sounded relieved. \u201cThank goodness. Is he back home yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he and a friend are going to drive my car back as soon as the repairs are done. The transmission was slipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to buy a new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, one of these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you can afford it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Laurant suddenly dropped the pen. She hadn\u2019t been paying attention as she scribbled on the pad, but now she saw what she had done. There were hearts all over the paper, broken hearts. She ripped the paper from the pad and began to tear it up.</p><p>\u201cFather Tom still doesn\u2019t know all the money\u2019s gone, does he?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder to see if Nick and the other man were still in the hallway, but they were gone.</p><p>Even though she was alone in the room, she still lowered her voice when she answered, \u201cNo, Tommy doesn\u2019t know the money\u2019s gone. You and Christopher are the only ones I\u2019ve told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven help you if Tommy finds out. Put yourself in his place. He assigned his interest in the trust to you when he entered the seminary, thinking that your grandfather\u2019s estate would be secure and that you would be set for life. How is he going to feel when he finds out those slimy lawyers were stealing every cent in the trust by charging exorbitant fees,\u201d Michelle railed. The more she talked about the injustice, the angrier her voice became. \u201cMillions of dollars in fees,\u201d she reminded Laurant. \u201cThey should rot in jail. What they did to you was criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Laurant corrected. \u201cTo my grandfather. They betrayed him, and that\u2019s why I went after them.\u201d</p><p>It had taken her a year to find an attorney who was willing to take on one of the largest and most powerful law firms in Paris, and even he had resisted at first, until he looked over her papers and saw what they had done. His position radically changed then. He wanted to put them out of business. The suit was filed the following morning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose hope. You have to keep fighting to get what\u2019s rightfully yours.\u201d She sighed over the phone. \u201cLawyers are scum buckets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame on you. You\u2019re marrying a lawyer, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a lawyer when I met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle, pray this is settled soon. I\u2019ve spent almost every dime I have on legal fees and renovating the store. I had to borrow money from the bank too. God only knows how I\u2019m going to pay it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lawyers you\u2019re fighting are hoping you\u2019ll give up and go away. Remember what Christopher said? That\u2019s why they keep filing all those motions or whatever to delay the final court hearing, but if you win again this time, they have to pay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd within ten days,\u201d Laurant said.</p><p>\u201cWell, hang in there. You\u2019re close to the finish line now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother\u2019s yelling at me. I have to hang up. The picnic\u2019s at five. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the abbot scheduled the party so soon. The renovations aren\u2019t finished yet, and I\u2019ll just bet the scaffolding is still in the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only time that would work with his busy schedule,\u201d Michelle explained. \u201cAnd the abbot promised me the scaffolding would be gone before the wedding. Do you realize, in less than a week I\u2019ll be an old married woman. Oh, hold on, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>She heard Michelle shout to her mother that she\u2019d be right down, and then she spoke into the phone again. \u201cMother\u2019s becoming a nervous wreck with the preparations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Laurant\u2019s mind was racing even as she talked to Michelle. Agent Wesson was using the abbot\u2019s cabin as his command center, and no one was supposed to know that he and his men were in Holy Oaks.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly is the picnic? At the abbot\u2019s cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michelle answered. \u201cHe has some relatives or friends staying there. It\u2019s across the lake. Just follow the traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here, remember? I\u2019m going to Des Moines to pick up my new brace, so I\u2019ll see you at the picnic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s driving you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d she answered. \u201cIf this one doesn\u2019t fit, he\u2019s going to raise holy hell. Because of their screwups, I have less than a week to learn how to walk without a limp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone can do it, you can. Want me to do anything for you while you\u2019re away?\u201d</p><p>Michelle laughed. \u201cYes. Go get some color in your cheeks.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Laurant heard Nick coming down the stairs, and when she finished saying good-bye to Michelle and hung up the phone, she saw him leaning against the door frame watching her. His hair was tousled on his forehead, and she was once again struck by how sexy he was. Maybe Michelle was right. Maybe she should think about putting some color back in her cheeks.</p><p>What would he be like in bed? My God, she couldn\u2019t believe she was letting her mind conjure up such thoughts. She quickly pushed the budding fantasies aside. She wasn\u2019t a teenager in the throes of a hormonal rebellion. She was an adult, and there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with being celibate until the right man came along, was there? Nick didn\u2019t fit her requirements. No, he wasn\u2019t the right man.</p><p>\u201cSorry I was on the phone so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Joe says you\u2019ve got a bunch of messages stored on your machine. Go ahead and listen to them.\u201d</p><p>Nick carried her bag upstairs while Laurant replayed the tape. There was only one disturbing message, from Margaret Stamp, the owner of the local bakery. She was calling to tell Laurant that Steve Brenner had upped his offer to buy Margaret\u2019s store by 20 percent, and that Steve had given her a week to consider. She ended the message with a question. Did Laurant know that Steve wasn\u2019t going to pay out any of the money to those who had sold until all the stores had signed?</p><p>A clap of thunder rumbled in the distance. Laurant slumped against the back of the chair, concentrating on the droning whir of the tape as it rewound. Her resolve had taken another beating, yet she knew she would have to summon the energy to deal with this latest crisis. Poor Margaret. Laurant knew she didn\u2019t want to sell, but business at the bakery was poor these days, and the money Steve was offering would be enough to ensure Margaret a comfortable retirement. How could Laurant, in good conscience, talk Margaret into holding firm when there was a good chance she would lose everything?</p><p>She jumped when Nick touched her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, I\u2019d like you to meet Joe Farley. He\u2019s going to be staying with us.\u201d</p><p>The agent came forward to shake her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Laurant\u2019s mind switched gears. The fight to save the town square would have to be put on the back burner for now.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd you can call me Joe.\u201d</p><p>Joe was a thickset man with a bushy mane of red hair and a round face that lit up when he smiled. One of his front teeth was slightly crooked, and that humanized him somehow. Even though he too was wearing a gun, he didn\u2019t seem as imposing or as rigid as Mr. Wesson.</p><p>\u201cDo you usually work with Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few times,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m usually stuck in an office, so this is quite a change for me. I hope you don\u2019t mind, but Feinberg and I have made a couple of changes in your alarm system. It isn\u2019t fancy, but it will get the job done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced at Nick. \u201cI don\u2019t have an alarm system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now.\u201d</p><p>Joe explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve wired all the windows and the doors so that when anyone comes inside, we\u2019ll know it. A red light will flash, but the alarm won\u2019t make any noise,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to spook the unsub. We want to draw him inside and nail him. Hopefully, he won\u2019t know he\u2019s triggered the setup. Of course, any stranger that comes near your house is going to get marked by the agents outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is being watched?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be staying here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUntil the first of July . . . if we haven\u2019t caught the unsub before then. I\u2019ll leave when you do.\u201d</p><p>Her head was spinning. It was becoming more and more difficult to push one crisis aside while she concentrated on another. She turned around and headed for the kitchen, the men trailing behind her. \u201cI need a cup of tea,\u201d she said wearily.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, you\u2019re not waffling about leaving, are you? We did talk about this,\u201d Nick reminded.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I know,\u201d she answered weakly.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Laurant. You\u2019re out of here\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cI said okay.\u201d Her irritation was loud and clear. \u201cMind telling me where I\u2019m going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop doing that?\u201d she demanded loudly.</p><p>The burst of temper surprised Nick. He raised an eyebrow as he leaned back against the kitchen table and folded his arms. \u201cStop doing what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGiving me dumb answers,\u201d she muttered. She grabbed the white teakettle from the counter and went to the sink to fill it with water.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take a trained eye to see that the pressure was getting to her, but the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse because Nick was also feeling like a cranky, caged animal. Now that they were in Holy Oaks, the waiting game began, and God, how he hated that part of his job. He\u2019d rather have a root canal than wait around for something to happen.</p><p>Working with Jules Wesson was already turning out to be a problem. Nick had spent ten minutes on his mobile phone trying to get Wesson to give him information, but every time he asked a question, Wesson hedged. Nick knew what he was doing, pushing him out of the loop.</p><p>Joe dragged a chair out from the table and sat down, but Nick followed Laurant to the sink. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean? Dumb answers?\u201d</p><p>She bumped into his chest when she turned. Water sloshed out of the mouth of the kettle, splashing his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou never give me a direct answer,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Like when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now was a good example. I asked you where I was going, and you answered\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He cut her off. \u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a direct answer, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Without a thought as to what she was doing, she grabbed a towel and began to blot the water off his shirt. He snatched it out of her hand and tossed it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where we\u2019ll be going,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhen I know, I\u2019ll tell you. All right? And by the way,\u201d he added, leaning down until they were nose to nose, \u201cthat\u2019s the only damned time I haven\u2019t given you a straight answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she countered. \u201cI asked you how many agents were here in Holy Oaks, and do you remember what your answer was? Enough. Now, what kind of a straight answer was that?\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw flexed, indicating the price he was paying for holding his temper. \u201cIf I knew the exact number, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t want you to see them or look for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She pushed him out of her way and went to the stove, put the kettle on the front burner, and turned it on.</p><p>\u201cBecause then you\u2019ll be staring at them or looking for them every time we go out, and if the unsub\u2019s watching you\u2014which, by the way, we\u2019re pretty damned sure he\u2019s going to be doing\u2014then he\u2019ll notice you noticing the agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two fight like an old married couple.\u201d</p><p>Laurant and Nick turned as one to frown at Joe.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t fighting,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cWe were simply having a difference of opinion,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Joe grinned. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not your kid you\u2019re trying to convince. I don\u2019t care if you fight or not. The fact is both of you probably need to let off a little steam, and you might as well clear the air right now.\u201d</p><p>Laurant noticed the stack of dirty dishes piled up in the sink. Joe had obviously made himself at home but hadn\u2019t bothered to clean up. She scowled at him, then got the Palmolive soap from the cabinet and filled the sink with water.</p><p>Joe noticed what she was doing. \u201cI\u2019ll wash those. I was going to put them in the dishwasher, but you don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old house.\u201d</p><p>Nick picked up the towel and started drying the plate she handed him, as Joe leaned back in his chair and got comfortable.</p><p>\u201cNick, about leaving on the first . . . ,\u201d Joe began.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesson wants her to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. She\u2019s leaving on the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna pull rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re so firm on that date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Tommy estimates a couple of thousand people are going to be flooding in here on the second and third. There\u2019s a big university reunion going on while the town celebrates the anniversary. I\u2019d like to get her out of here before, but she\u2019s got to be in this wedding, and she won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Wesson\u2019s determined to keep her here for as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you she\u2019s leaving. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting Laurant stay with a crowd that size coming here. How can I protect her?\u201d Shaking his head, he added, \u201cIt isn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>Joe raised his hands in a conciliatory gesture. \u201cI\u2019m easy with whatever you decide. I just thought I should warn you you\u2019re in for a fight, that\u2019s all. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re calling the shots.\u201d</p><p>Laurant handed Nick another dish to dry and asked, \u201cWhat about Tommy? Will he also be leaving on the first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how stubborn your brother can be. He thinks it\u2019s important that he help the abbot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll make him leave, won\u2019t you?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cHe won\u2019t listen to me, but he will listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make him leave when we do. If he doesn\u2019t go, then I don\u2019t go. Tell him that. Then maybe he\u2019ll stop arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he said when he saw the stricken look in her eyes. \u201cNoah promised me he\u2019d get him out of here one way or another. He may have to coldcock him and drag him out,\u201d he added. \u201cBut hitting a priest isn\u2019t gonna faze him. Noah gave me his word, so you can relax. Trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anyone hungry?\u201d Joe asked hopefully. As if on cue, his stomach growled.</p><p>\u201cI guess you are,\u201d Nick remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving. Feinberg was supposed to figure out a way to bring in some groceries, sneaking in through the back lot behind your house, but man oh man, those two old ladies next door are always looking out their windows. He hasn\u2019t been able to get past them. They should be working for the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know you\u2019re still here, or they would have said something to me or Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t left the house since I came in,\u201d Joe explained. \u201cThose old ladies went out that afternoon, and I\u2019m assuming they think I left while they were gone. I\u2019ve been real careful about the lights at night,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t Feinberg bring the groceries from the other side of the house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t get to a door that way, and it was too much of a risk to try to hand them through the window.\u201d</p><p>Laurant let the water out of the sink, dried her hands, and then began to look through the refrigerator for something for Joe to eat.</p><p>\u201cYou find anything in there? I sure couldn\u2019t. I just ate the last of your cold cuts, and all that\u2019s left is cereal,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cSo the cupboards are pretty bare, huh?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Laurant closed the refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the grocery store tomorrow,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d offer. I\u2019ve got a list made up . . . if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re really starving, we could go out and get you something,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>Laurant shook her head. \u201cEverything\u2019s closed this time of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even ten o\u2019clock. Nothing\u2019s open?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry. All the stores close at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honest to God don\u2019t know how she handles living here,\u201d he told Joe. He straddled the chair across the table from the agent and added, \u201cThere\u2019s not even a bagel shop within fifty miles. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I, Laurant?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d just finished searching through her pantry and closed the door, empty-handed. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right, but I get along just fine without fresh bagels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s a Krispy Kreme donut shop in town,\u201d Joe lamented.</p><p>\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>Laurant opened the freezer on the bottom of the refrigerator and began to search through the frozen vegetables.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something in there?\u201d Joe asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cSome frozen broccoli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>The kettle started whistling, and Nick reached for a cup and saucer. \u201cYou want any of this, Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have iced tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t here to serve you, buddy. If you want it, fix it.\u201d</p><p>Nick made Laurant sit down and served her a cup of the tea.</p><p>\u201cNeither one of you should criticize the town until you\u2019ve been here at least a week. You have to get into the swing of things first. The pace is different,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Nick drawled.</p><p>She ignored the sarcasm. \u201cOnce you learn how to slow down, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>She was getting angry. \u201cYou should keep an open mind. Besides, if I want a bagel, I buy a package at the store and defrost them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut those aren\u2019t fresh,\u201d he complained. \u201cEveryone eats bagels, Laurant. They\u2019re a national staple. What do all those college kids do? Bagels are healthy, damn it. Kids know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop whining. You\u2019re acting like one of those Americans who would come all the way to Paris and insist on eating at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t whining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever happened to the sweet sister I met in Kansas City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left her there,\u201d Laurant answered.</p><p>Joe got up from the table, grabbed the box of Rice Krispies from the cabinet, got the skim milk out of the refrigerator, and then reached for a tablespoon and the biggest bowl he could find. \u201cThis Brenner guy increased his offer by twenty percent to buy the woman\u2019s bakery, huh?\u201d</p><p>Laurant gave him a surprised look.</p><p>\u201cI listened to your messages,\u201d he stated. \u201cAnd it sounded to me like Margaret\u2019s close to folding. The deal could be too good to pass up, especially if she\u2019s as old as she sounded over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t that old, but you\u2019re right. The money would be her retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to save the town, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m only trying to save the town square. I don\u2019t understand why people think progress means tearing down beautiful old buildings to put up slick new ones. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. The town will be fine with or without the square, but the charm . . . the history . . . that will be lost.\u201d</p><p>Nick watched her stir the tea. She\u2019d been doing that for the last couple of minutes, but she hadn\u2019t taken a drink yet. She sat motionless, staring pensively at the swirling liquid in the cup. The sound of the spoon clinking against Joe\u2019s empty bowl eventually drew her attention.</p><p>Laurant noticed that he glanced at his wrist as he carried the dish to the sink.</p><p>\u201cJoe, why do you keep looking at your watch?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause I\u2019ve got it wired,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf the red light goes off on the panel I\u2019ve hooked up in the guest room, it will trigger the alarm on my watch.\u201d</p><p>Thunder cracked close by, and it began to rain. Joe was thrilled by the sound. \u201cMother Nature\u2019s going to help us out tonight. Let\u2019s just hope the storm\u2019s a bad one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a bad storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d he answered. \u201cBecause Nick wants to disable the camera after you two have put on your little performance for our unsub. I\u2019m gonna make the lights flicker a couple of times, and then I\u2019m gonna turn everything off. I\u2019ll hit the main switch,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen the lights come back on, the camera won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep with the camera watching you,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t. Thank you,\u201d she said, relieved.</p><p>\u201cThe camera\u2019s plugged into an outlet up in the attic,\u201d Joe told her. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping he\u2019ll come inside to turn it back on, thinking that the breaker just needs to be reset.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>She propped her elbow on the table, rested her chin in the palm of her hand, and stared at the back window with its blinds closed. Was he out there now, watching and waiting for his opportunity? How would he come at her? While she was sleeping? Or would he wait until she was outside and try to grab her then?</p><p>Rain began to pelt the windows.</p><p>\u201cYou guys ready to go upstairs?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cThe storm could slow down any time, and I want to take advantage of this opportunity while it lasts. I\u2019ll go down to the basement and mess with the circuits. You two wait here until after I\u2019ve turned the lights off and flipped them back on. Then you go upstairs and do your thing. I\u2019ll give you five minutes and then I\u2019ll turn everything off again. Nick, you dismantle the camera and when you\u2019ve done that, shout down to me, and I\u2019ll turn the lights back on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a flashlight on the hallway chest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be able to see what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Joe pushed the chair back and stood. \u201cOkay, just sit tight until the lights come back on. I\u2019m going to keep flickering them every couple of seconds. I\u2019ll yell when you can go up.\u201d</p><p>He hurried around the corner into the back hall and down the basement steps. Nick stood in the doorway, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t drink any of your tea. I figured out why you made it.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced up at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to figure out?\u201d</p><p>The lights flickered twice, then went completely out. It was suddenly pitch black in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get spooked.\u201d His voice was a soothing whisper in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>A flash of lightning lit the room for the briefest of seconds, and Laurant half expected to see a face looming in the gray light. She was getting spooked, sitting in that tiny room where he had made himself at home. God, how she wished she could jump in the car and run away. Why oh why had she come back?</p> <p>Nick\u2019s voice eased her budding panic. \u201cMaking tea is how you cope, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She turned in his direction and tried to see him in the darkness. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get stressed, you stop everything you\u2019re doing and make yourself a cup of hot tea. You did that a couple of times in Kansas City while we were at the rectory. You never drink it though, do you?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the lights came back on and Joe shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Nick took Laurant\u2019s hand and gently pulled her from the chair. He didn\u2019t let go of her as they went through the house and up the stairs. With each step she took toward the bedroom, her heartbeat escalated until it felt like it was slamming against her rib cage. The linen closet door was open, but she couldn\u2019t see the camera.</p><p>Nick paused with his hand on the doorknob. \u201cThis has to look real. You understand what I mean? We want to provoke him, remember? That means we\u2019ve got to get hot and heavy in there, and you\u2019ve got to act like you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to act like you\u2019re enjoying it too,\u201d she pointed out. Lord, she was suddenly so nervous her voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m not going to have any trouble at all. I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on you for a long time. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust try to keep up with me.\u201d</p><p>He wanted a seductress, and by God, that\u2019s what he was going to get. She was determined to give the performance of a lifetime. They had the same goal in mind, to make the madman so jealous he would forget caution and come after her. They hoped his fury would drive him to do something careless. It was too late for second thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cSmile.\u201d He grinned as he added, \u201cMaybe we ought to practice a little first. How long has it been since you\u2019ve been tossed in the hay and mauled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of days,\u201d she lied. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger than that. Any surprises inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. The usual stuff all young ladies keep at their disposal. Chains and whips on the walls. The standard equipment handed down from mother to daughter.\u201d</p><p>She kept a straight face. \u201cWhat kind of girls have you been hanging out with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girls,\u201d he assured her. \u201cReal good girls.\u201d</p><p>Laurant knew that Nick was trying to get her to laugh so she wouldn\u2019t have stage fright.</p><p>As she pushed past him, she said, \u201cSorry, no surprises inside. Every girl has mirrors on her ceiling, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He was laughing when she opened the door. She went in first, flipped on the lights, and headed for the bed.</p><p>It turned out to be easier than she\u2019d expected. She simply pretended she was modeling again. In her mind, the bed was the end of the runway, and it was her job to get there using every part of her body. She moved with easy grace, her h*ps swaying to the music she could hear in her mind, a pouty look on her face.</p><p>Nick watched from the doorway, stunned by the swift change in Laurant. She tossed her long thick curls provocatively over her shoulder as she glanced back at him with a sultry come-and-get-me look. When she reached the foot of the double bed, she turned and beckoned him forward with the crook of her finger. He had to remind himself that it was all an act. If eyes could smolder with passion, hers could burn down the house.</p><p>He walked toward his temptress, but she wasn\u2019t quite finished shocking the hell out of him. As he reached for her, she shook her head, took a step back away from him and then slowly began to unbutton her blouse. She never took her gaze off him, staring directly into his eyes, waiting, teasing, beckoning.</p><p>He let her unbutton the blouse, but when she started to take it off and he saw the hint of her lacy bra and the soft swell of her breasts, he roughly pulled her into his arms, acting impatient and eager now. His hand moved to the back of her neck. He wound her hair around his fist as his other hand pressed against her spine, bringing her up close against him. Tilting her head back, he leaned down and kissed her long and hard.</p><p>The touch was electric. Her mouth was so soft, pliable, willing\u2014damn, could she kiss. Her lips parted without prodding, and it was then that Nick gave in to his curiosity and desire. His tongue thrust inside to taste the sweet interior of her mouth. She stiffened in response, but only for a second or two, and then her arms found their way around his neck, and she was pressing against him, clinging to him as she matched his fervor.</p><p>The kiss went on forever. His mind knew it was all a performance for the camera, but his body didn\u2019t care about that distinction. He reacted like any other man would in the arms of a beautiful woman.</p><p>He dragged his mouth away from hers and began to nibble on her earlobe. \u201cSlow down,\u201d he whispered, panting.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered back. Then she tugged on his hair, pulling his head back so that she could kiss him on the mouth again. When her tongue touched his, he growled low in his throat.</p><p>She smiled with smug satisfaction against his lips and then kissed him passionately again, thoroughly getting into the role of aggressor now, but Nick wasn\u2019t going to let her outdo him. He unsnapped her jeans and his hands moved to her spine and slipped inside the fabric. Cupping her backside, he jerked her up against his hard arousal. Shocked, her eyes opened, and she tried to pull back. He wouldn\u2019t let her. His mouth took absolute possession, and within seconds her eyes were closed again, and she was pressing against his hard, warm chest. Pelvis to pelvis, the fit perfect, she rubbed against him. The way he stroked and caressed her with his hands and his tongue made her forget that she was supposed to be acting. She gripped his shoulders to keep from collapsing and kissed him back with honest longing.</p><p>From the darkened living room across town, the Peeping Tom watched. His roar of rage echoed through the house. Shaking, he picked up a lamp, ripped it from the socket, and hurled it at the stucco wall.</p><p>Retribution was at hand.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>She had trouble looking Nick in the eye the following morning. As soon as the lights had gone out the night before, Nick had abruptly pulled away from her and had gone into the hallway to dismantle the camera. She was thankful for the darkness then because she knew she looked dazed and disoriented. She had trouble getting her legs to work. She\u2019d wanted to hide in the bathroom until she regained her wits, but that had been out of the question. She fell back on the bed instead and stayed there until her heartbeat slowed down and she could draw a proper breath.</p><p>Nick and Joe came into her darkened room and told her to get some rest. They would take turns staying awake. She didn\u2019t know if Nick slept or if he got any rest at all. The only thing she remembered was the exhaustion that overtook her.</p><p>She woke up at daybreak and dressed in her jogging clothes, a snug-fitting, blue-and-white-striped spandex top that didn\u2019t quite cover her belly button, blue spandex shorts, socks, and her comfortable but worn-looking white Reeboks. After securing her hair into a ponytail, she went into the bedroom to begin her stretching exercises.</p><p>Nick came into the bedroom as she was coming out of the bathroom. He took one look at her outfit, and his heart skipped a beat. Every curve of her body was evident. \u201cJeez, Laurant, does your brother know you wear stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>She began her waist bends and didn\u2019t look at him when she answered, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my clothes. I\u2019m not going to church. I\u2019m going running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you ought to put a big T-shirt over . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour chest.\u201d</p><p>The shirt wasn\u2019t going to cover her amazing long legs. He was having trouble taking his eyes off them. \u201cAnd long pants,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThis is a small town. You\u2019re going to shock folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I won\u2019t,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThey\u2019re used to seeing me run.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it, not one little bit, but who was he to complain? If she wanted to dress like a . . . runner . . . ah, hell, what was the matter with him? He had no business telling her what to wear. Even if they were in a relationship\u2014which they weren\u2019t, he quickly qualified\u2014he still wouldn\u2019t have the right to tell her how to dress.</p><p>Nick had already put on his running clothes, a faded navy blue T-shirt, gym shorts, white socks, and his battered, used-to-be-white running shoes. While she stretched her legs, he slipped his gun into the holster at his hip and pulled the T-shirt down to cover it. Then he picked up a small earpiece and tucked it in his right ear. Moving in front of the mirror above her dresser, he pinned a circular disc to his neck band just above his clavicle.</p><p>She was retying one of her shoelaces when she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the pin for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a microphone,\u201d he answered. \u201cSo no dirty talking today. Wesson will hear whatever I say, and just for the record, Jules, I still think this is a badass idea.\u201d</p><p>The voice inside his ear spoke back. \u201cDuly noted, Agent Buchanan, and it\u2019s sir to you, not Jules.\u201d</p><p>Nick mouthed the word \u201cjackass\u201d to himself and then turned to Laurant, \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, and for the first time since he\u2019d come into the bedroom, she looked into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wondered how long that was going to take.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to pretend to misunderstand. \u201cYou noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re blushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d Shrugging to cover her embarrassment, her voice dropped to a whisper so that Wesson, hopefully, wouldn\u2019t hear her, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to talk about what happened . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t need to talk about it,\u201d he agreed. Then he grinned an adorable lopsided grin and added, \u201cBut I\u2019ll bet we\u2019re both gonna be thinking about it all day long.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her mouth, and so she stared at the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nodding, she brushed past him. On the way down the stairs, he said, \u201cI want you to stay directly in front of me, and don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll slow down to keep pace with you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll slow down? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been running almost every morning since I joined the FBI. We agents have to keep in top shape,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThen how come you told me you weren\u2019t a runner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that. I told you I hated to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was bad on the knees and that you were going to complain the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is bad on the knees, and I do plan to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many miles do you run every morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a hundred, give or take.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>Joe was standing in front of the living room window, looking outside through the crack in the drawn drapes.</p><p>\u201cNick, I think you better have a look at this. We\u2019ve got a situation here. You might want to reconsider running today.\u201d</p><p>Laurant beat him to the window. She peeked out and then said,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s just the boys waiting for me. We run together every morning.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked over her head and saw seven young men cluttering the sidewalk in front of her house. There were two more jogging in place in the middle of the street.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh school kids,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd they run with you every day? Why the hell didn\u2019t you mention them to me?\u201d</p><p>He sounded incredulous and angry. \u201cDon\u2019t get upset. It\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m sorry I forgot to mention them. The boys are on the track team at Holy Oaks High School . . . well, some of them are,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t really run with me, at least not around the lake. They all peter out by the time I hit the path. Then they wait for me to come back and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d he demanded. Before she had a chance to answer, he muttered, \u201cWesson, are you getting this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing you loud and clear,\u201d came the staticky reply.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d he asked Laurant again. \u201cThey wait for you to come back around the lake, and then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they jog home with me. That\u2019s all. They want to stay in shape during the summer so that when school starts, they\u2019ll be in top form.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced outside again and noticed another boy running down the street to join his friends.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, they\u2019re serious runners all right,\u201d he remarked sarcastically. \u201cEspecially the kid eating the donut. He\u2019s definitely headed for the Olympics.\u201d</p><p>Joe got a glimpse of himself in the hall mirror. His hair was sticking up every which way. He hadn\u2019t bothered to comb it since he\u2019d gotten out of bed, or rather, since he\u2019d gotten off the sofa, and he self-consciously tried to pat it down as he said, \u201cUh . . . I don\u2019t believe any of those boys dragged themselves out of bed and came over here to run, Laurant. No, I\u2019m pretty sure running isn\u2019t on their minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did get them out of their beds this early in the morning?\u201d she asked, exasperated.</p><p>Nick answered. \u201cHormones, Laurant. Raging hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake. At this time of day? Boys their age have a whole lot more on their minds besides sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Nick argued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at Joe who sheepishly nodded. \u201cThey really don\u2019t,\u201d he agreed with Nick.</p><p>Nick jerked his thumb toward the window. \u201cAt that age, I didn\u2019t think about anything else but sex.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cI\u2019d have to agree with Nick again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I ever thought about. Mostly I thought about how to get it, and when I finally did get it, then I thought about how to get it again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or be angry. The conversation was ludicrous. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that every second of every waking hour that\u2019s what you both were thinking about when you were teenagers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Nick said. \u201cSo we know where they\u2019re coming from and what they\u2019re after. Maybe I ought to go outside and have a little talk with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>Nick came up with a better idea. He\u2019d intimidate them. He pulled his T-shirt up over his gun and tucked the material behind it so that the weapon was clearly visible.</p><p>Joe watched him. \u201cThat ought to discourage them.\u201d</p><p>As Nick was opening the front door for Laurant, he smiled and said, \u201cMaybe I ought to shoot a couple of them.\u201d</p> <p>Laurant rolled her eyes as she went past him, ignoring his scowl. Waving to her entourage, she jogged across the street and introduced Nick to the boys. She told them that he was her fianc\u00e9. The kids all noticed Nick\u2019s gun, of course, but they gave it only a cursory glance before returning their full attention to Laurant\u2019s considerable assets. They didn\u2019t even look at him when Laurant explained that Nick worked for the FBI.</p><p>It all came down to spandex versus a loaded weapon, and spandex won.</p><p>Nick stayed right behind her as she ran. The boys fell into step around the two of them, taking turns trying to engage Laurant in conversation.</p><p>Donut boy was the first to fade. Three others quickly followed. Laurant gradually picked up the pace, her long legs eating up the pavement as she gracefully glided forward. She\u2019d been right about her fan club\u2019s endurance. By the time they reached the entrance to the park, the last two boys were doubled over and panting for breath. Nick heard one of them gag and got an inordinate amount of pleasure from the sound.</p><p>Laurant loved this time of day. It was so peaceful and quiet and lovely. For an hour she forced herself to forget about everything and concentrate only on the path. The rain last night had left the leaves damp, but she knew that by noon, they would all be dried out again. A drought had hit Iowa hard, and the weeds and scrub were brown. As she rounded the bend around the blue water lake, the entrance to the nature preserve was on her right. There were a good ten acres of tall brown prairie grass. Like wheat, it swayed in the gentle morning breeze.</p><p>She passed the abbot\u2019s cabin and had the feeling that Agent Wesson was watching her, but she couldn\u2019t see him because the blinds were drawn. The dock to the right of the cabin and behind was sitting up high out of the water, another sign of the lack of rain.</p> <p>Sweat trickled down the back of her neck and between her br**sts by the time she\u2019d made a complete circle around the lake. She slowed down, then stopped, doubled over and took long deep breaths. She could hear Nick panting behind her.</p><p>Standing there, they were easy targets. He did a quick survey of the dense forest and overgrown brush around them, and moved closer to her. His T-shirt was covered with sweat. With the back of his arm he wiped his forehead. She could catch her breath when they were back home. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. Do we walk or run home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe jog.\u201d</p><p>The boys were waiting at the park entrance. Grinning like idiots, they once again fell into step around Nick and Laurant.</p><p>\u201cWimps,\u201d Nick muttered as Laurant waved good-bye to the boys and sprinted up the front walk.</p><p>Once the door was shut behind them, Nick relaxed. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s humid out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think of our lake? Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it yesterday,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWhen we went to see Wesson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it lovely? It\u2019s a fisherman\u2019s paradise. You can actually see the fish in the clear, rock-bottomed water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>She had her hands on her h*ps and was still panting a bit. \u201cHow could you not notice? What were you looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the places the bastard could hide. He could have had you in his sights from the moment we entered the park until the moment we left, and I never would have spotted him. I can\u2019t let you do that run again. You hear me, Wesson? The unsub could have been hiding anywhere. There\u2019s too much territory to cover.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry when she tried to speak. \u201cYou think he\u2019ll use a gun to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an up close and personal kind of guy,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe might try to wing you to slow you down though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were other agents keeping both of you in their sights all the while you were in the park,\u201d Joe added as Laurant passed him on her way to get some bottled water. He followed her into the kitchen and continued. \u201cYou both were safe.\u201d</p><p>Laurant returned to the living room, tossed Nick a bottle of Evian, and opened her own. She took a big drink and headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Nick said as he went up the stairs ahead of her. He looked in the bathroom to make sure there weren\u2019t any surprises waiting.</p><p>He was being overly cautious, and she was thankful for it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could shower in the other bathroom down the hall,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Nick was sitting on the bed talking on the phone when she came out of the bathroom fifteen minutes later. Her hair was dripping down her back, and she was wearing a short cotton robe that had seen better days. He took one look at her and promptly lost his train of thought. He knew she was na*ed under that thin material, and he had to force himself to turn away so he could concentrate on his conversation.</p><p>\u201cLook, Theo, we\u2019ll talk about this when I get back to Boston. All right?\u201d He hung up the phone and slowly turned his head to get a glimpse of Laurant out of the corner of his eye. He watched her open the dresser drawer and take out two little wisps of lace. Immediately, his mind went to visions of her wearing them.</p><p>Get a grip, he told himself. She was off-limits, and he had no business fantasizing about her. What the hell kind of a friend was he to lust after Tommy\u2019s sister?</p><p>Berating himself didn\u2019t do any good. He wanted her. Simple as that. There, he finally admitted the obvious. Now what was he going to do about it? Nothing, he decided. Not a damned thing. Even if she weren\u2019t his friend\u2019s sister, he wouldn\u2019t get involved with her. A relationship between the two of them was impossible. It would never work out, and she\u2019d end up hating him. She wanted what she had never had, a family and kids, lots of kids, and he didn\u2019t want any of that. He\u2019d seen too much to ever let himself become that vulnerable. Even though he came from a family of eight, he was still a loner, and that\u2019s the way he liked it.</p><p>He never should have kissed her. Bad idea, he decided. He hadn\u2019t been prepared, hadn\u2019t realized how good it was going to be. God, he was arrogant. He actually thought he could remain distant and professional, but when she wrapped her arms around him and he felt her soft lips, thoughts of being professional went flying out the window, and he\u2019d turned into one of those perverted teenagers outside. All he could think about was getting her flat on her back.</p><p>Maybe Morganstern was right after all. Maybe Nick was too close and personal for this assignment. His boss had been referring to his friendship with Tommy though. What would Pete think if he knew that his agent was lusting after the friend\u2019s sister? Nick already knew the answer to that question. Pete would have his hide.</p><p>The phone rang again. Nick answered it, listened for a minute, and then said, \u201cYes, Monsignor. I\u2019ll be sure to tell him. Thanks for calling.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was standing in the closet doorway, shifting from bare foot to bare foot as she searched through the clothes crammed together on the single, bowed rod.</p><p>When Nick hung up, she asked, \u201cWas that Monsignor McKindry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah, it was. Tommy left his Daytimer in the kitchen, and Monsignor said he\u2019d mail it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention when Tommy and Noah left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cAt the crack of dawn. Laurant, for the love of God, put some clothes on.\u201d</p><p>She kept sorting through her clothes as she answered him. \u201cAs soon as you give me a little privacy, I\u2019ll be happy to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the embarrassment in her voice. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he said, feeling like an idiot. Heading for her shower, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t leave the bedroom until I\u2019m dressed, and keep the door locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I still want you to wait for me.\u201d His voice didn\u2019t leave room for argument.</p><p>She ran after him. He was peeling his T-shirt off as she reached behind him to grab her hair dryer and brush from the counter behind the sink. Her hand accidentally rubbed against the base of his spine, and he reacted as though she\u2019d just burned him with her curling iron. He flinched.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>He sighed as he tossed the T-shirt into the sink. \u201cI made you feel awkward again, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>They were standing toe to toe, facing each other. She clutched the robe to her chest with one hand and gripped the hair dryer and brush with the other hand.</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Wesson listening?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe pin\u2019s on the dresser with the earpiece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be awkward, but it\u2019s just that we kissed. I know we were supposed to, but I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she said, \u201cIt just made things awkward again. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both got . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHot.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been staring at his toes until he\u2019d said that word. Her eyes flew to his.</p><p>\u201cYes, we did. What do we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet past it,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI know one way.\u201d</p><p>The sparkle in his eyes should have been a warning. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTake a shower with me. That should get you past your shyness.\u201d</p><p>She was so shocked by the suggestion she laughed, which was exactly what he wanted her to do. The tension vanished. His grin was comical. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that leer down perfectly,\u201d she told him as she turned around and left the bathroom.</p><p>Because the mirror was still clouded with steam, and the bathroom was sweltering, Nick told her to leave the door open. She waited until she heard the shower running, then hurried to get dressed and dry her hair. Since they were going shopping for an engagement ring, she decided to dress up a little, and she put on her white pleated slacks and a peach silk blouse. Then she found her white canvas slip-ons in the back of the closet.</p><p>Nick made the bed while she brushed her hair. The coverlet was all lopsided when he was finished, but she didn\u2019t criticize his effort.</p><p>Nick wore jeans and a white polo shirt. He clipped the leather holster to his belt. Then he pinned the red disc back on, added the earpiece, and shoved his wallet in his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s the schedule?\u201d he asked after he gave her a quick once-over.</p><p>\u201cSome breakfast first because I\u2019m starving, then the grocery store for Joe. After that, I want to check on my store to see if they\u2019ve started on the floors yet. If they haven\u2019t, I\u2019ll work there all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the jewelry store,\u201d he suggested as he slipped on a pair of leather loafers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to pick up the bridesmaid dress too,\u201d she remembered. \u201cAnd I should spend an hour or two at the abbey. I\u2019ve got to get started on the attic.\u201d</p><p>They spent the morning doing errands. It was all so ordinary, tasks that couples did together all the time, but there wasn\u2019t anything ordinary about their situation. She was constantly looking over her shoulder, even when they were in the grocery store getting supplies for Joe. Laurant was stopped by a friend or neighbor on almost every aisle, and each time, she introduced Nick as her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>He put on quite a show. He was attentive and affectionate, and it was all so natural, she had to remind herself that it was just an act.</p><p>She relaxed only when they were inside the car. She felt safe then. Nick drove through McDonald\u2019s to get breakfast and headed home again. He turned on the radio, and they listened to Garth Brooks croon about a love lost and found again.</p><p>She was eager for Nick to see her store. She helped him carry the groceries inside, and left them in the hall for Joe to put away. Then they got back in the car again. Since they were going up to the abbey after they purchased an engagement ring, he decided to drive to the square.</p><p>He stopped at the fountain so that he could see all the buildings ahead of him. None of them were historical treasures by any means, but the old structures were charming. Most of the facades needed work, but nothing major.</p><p>\u201cDo you see what it could be?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhy would anybody want to tear this down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said enthusiastically. \u201cYears ago, this is where everyone did their shopping and their socializing. I want it to be like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSprucing up the stores won\u2019t be enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something inside to draw the people in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe president of the college is considering moving the bookstore into the corner building on your right. It\u2019s more than big enough, and they\u2019re running out of room on campus. The kids would have to come into the square to get their books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd they can walk. The campus is only a couple of blocks away. Let\u2019s go,\u201d she urged. \u201cI want you to see my store.\u201d</p><p>Her enthusiasm made him smile. He parked in the center block, near the jewelry store. He put his arm around her as they walked along the street.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t show off her store after all. The first coat of polyurethane had just been applied to the floor. Since the windows were coated, Nick couldn\u2019t even look through to see the lovely marble countertop. He would have to wait at least four days until the second and third coats had been applied and dried.</p><p>They backtracked to Russell\u2019s Jewelry Store. Nick impressed the socks off of Miriam Russell when he picked out a two-carat diamond ring\u2014the biggest in the store. Laurant didn\u2019t want that one though. She liked the one-and-a-half-carat, marquise diamond. Since it didn\u2019t need to be sized\u2014it fit her finger perfectly\u2014Nick said it was meant to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held out her hand, waving her fingers so the light would catch the sparkle in the diamond, ooh-ing and ah-ing like a woman in love. She worried she might be overdoing it a bit, but Miriam seemed to be buying the act. Her hands were clasped together, and she was beaming with satisfaction.</p><p>When Nick handed Miriam his American Express card to pay for the purchase, her expression sobered. She asked Laurant if she could have a word in private before she ran the charge. She led Laurant to the back of the store while Nick waited at the counter. He didn\u2019t know what they were discussing, but whatever the topic was, it embarrassed Laurant. Her face turned pink, and she kept shaking her head.</p><p>A few minutes later, after Nick signed the purchase slip, he picked up the ring, put it on Laurant\u2019s finger again, and then leaned down and kissed her. It was a gentle, undemanding kiss that left her thoroughly shaken. He had to nudge her away from the counter.</p><p>As they were leaving the store, Miriam called out, \u201cRemember what I said, Lauren. I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed for you.\u201d</p> <p>Clearly mortified, Laurant hurried away. Nick caught up with her. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna keep her fingers crossed for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Laurant. Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>She stopped trying to outrun him. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you. That little conference we had in the store was all about Russell\u2019s return policy. She thinks I\u2019m going to botch this one up. Those were her words, not mine. You do realize, don\u2019t you, that when this is over and you\u2019ve gone away, they\u2019re all going to think I screwed up again. This isn\u2019t funny, Nick, so you can stop grinning.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t at all sympathetic. Laughing, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real strange reputation here, don\u2019t you? Exactly what is it you do to the men who try to get close to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI don\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m just . . . discriminating. There\u2019s a small group of women in town who have nothing better to do than gossip, and if one of them happens to see me talking to an available man, she assumes all sorts of things that aren\u2019t true. Before I know what\u2019s happened, that nosy editor, Lorna Hamburg, is printing it in the local paper. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not seen socializing with the same man, everyone assumes I\u2019ve gone and botched it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe actually prints stuff like that in the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe runs the society page,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s all gossip and rubbish. There isn\u2019t a whole lot going on here, and so she . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbellishes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God, speaking of the devil,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. Move it, Nick. She\u2019s spotted us.\u201d</p><p>Lorna Hamburg caught sight of them a block away and came running. Long, curly, platinum hair dwarfed her already small features, and huge pendulum earrings dangled from her lobes and flapped madly to and fro with each step. She carried a leopard print canvas bag the size of a suitcase looped over her left shoulder, and as she ran, she tilted to that side, like a drunk who couldn\u2019t walk a straight line.</p><p>She was sprinting now to intercept them, her fuchsia-colored, four-inch heels clipping along the sidewalk. The sound was like teeth chattering.</p><p>\u201cMan, can she move,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>As she bore down on them, Nick couldn\u2019t help but notice her eyebrows, or rather the lack thereof. Lorna had plucked hers out and used a pencil to draw a straight line above her deep-set eyes.</p><p>Thanks to Nick\u2019s lack of cooperation in running for cover, Laurant was stuck.</p><p>\u201cI thought FBI agents were supposed to be fast,\u201d she muttered as she patiently waited to introduce him to the woman she secretly called Gazette Gorilla.</p><p>\u201cKeep the goal in mind. This is a golden opportunity. Now stop frowning and look like you love me.\u201d</p> <p>Nick was disgustingly charming, and that only encouraged Lorna to be pushier than ever. She demanded an on-the-spot interview. Whipping her eight-by-ten notebook out of her bag, she wanted to know all the details of how the two of them had met.</p><p>Within fifteen seconds, Nick knew two things about the woman. One, she detested Laurant, and two, she wanted him. It wasn\u2019t an arrogant assumption. Nor was it a shrewd observation. Hell, the way she was looking at him while she repeatedly moistened her lips with her tongue darting in and out made it real apparent. Disgustingly so.</p><p>The knot in Laurant\u2019s stomach twisted tighter and tighter as Lorna\u2019s questions became more and more personal, but she didn\u2019t reach her unraveling point until Lorna asked if she and Nick were already living as man and wife.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your damned business, Lorna.\u201d</p><p>Nick squeezed her shoulder and then said, \u201cHoney, show Lorna your engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was still fuming as she lifted her hand and waved it in front of Lorna\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat must have cost a fortune. Everyone in town knows you work for the FBI,\u201d she said then. \u201cWhy, I must have gotten six phone calls about you already. It\u2019s true,\u201d she added when he looked skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s the gun, you see. People wondered about it. They\u2019re much too polite to ask you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they whisper behind his back,\u201d Laurant interjected.</p><p>Lorna ignored her. \u201cFBI agents don\u2019t make much money, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me if I can afford the ring?\u201d Nick wondered.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be that forward.\u201d</p><p>Nick squeezed Laurant\u2019s hand. \u201cI live a comfortable life. Family trust,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Lorna. It\u2019s none of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nick placed his other hand on Laurant\u2019s shoulder and said sweetly, \u201cNow, darling, don\u2019t get all bent out of shape. Lorna\u2019s just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cCurious. Where are you from, Nick? You don\u2019t mind if I call you Nick, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I live in Boston. I was raised on Nathan\u2019s Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be taking Laurant to Boston after you\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re going to be living here. I\u2019ll be doing a lot of traveling, but I can be based anywhere, and Laurant loves this town. It\u2019s growing on me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Laurant won\u2019t have to work after you\u2019re married, will she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not selling the store, Lorna, so give it up,\u201d Laurant snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding up progress, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a great comeback, but it was the best she could do on the spur of the moment. \u201cAnd I happen to want to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Her tone was condescending.</p><p>\u201cIf Laurant wants to work, she will,\u201d Nick said. \u201cShe\u2019s a modern, independent woman, and I\u2019ll support whatever she does.\u201d</p><p>Lorna closed her notebook and stuffed it in her bag. Then she turned her full, patronizing attention on Laurant.</p><p>\u201cI want to believe this one\u2019s the real thing, but honestly, I have my doubts. I certainly don\u2019t want to be forced to print yet another retraction. I just hate doing that. People believe that what I print in my column is true, so you can understand my concern.\u201d</p><p>Nick draped his arm around Laurant\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into his side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had to print a retraction about Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice I\u2019ve had to do it,\u201d Lorna said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d Laurant blurted. \u201cWe really need to get going. I\u2019ve got a lot to get done this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed what a small town Holy Oaks is,\u201d Lorna began. \u201cBut I\u2019m actually quite important here. I\u2019m the society editor at the Gazette. People depend on me to keep them abreast of the latest happenings about town. They also expect me to be accurate, but your fianc\u00e9e has made that task extremely difficult. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I just hate writing anything about her. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Laurant suggested.</p><p>Turning back to Nick, Lorna continued, \u201cAs I was telling you before I was so rudely interrupted, Laura keeps changing her mind. I mentioned in one of my articles that Steve Brenner and Laura were a serious item and that marriage appeared to be on the horizon, but I was forced to print a retraction.\u201d</p><p>She paused to smirk at Laurant before continuing. \u201cShe made me do it. Can you imagine? My credibility was on the line, but she didn\u2019t care about that. She still insisted I print a retraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Laurant pointed out in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019ve never dated Steve Brenner and you know it, but you didn\u2019t care about being accurate, Lorna. Did you?\u201d</p><p>Laurant\u2019s French accent was getting thicker, a dead giveaway that she was upset.</p><p>\u201cMust you be insulting? I am accurate. I print what I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf memory serves, you wrote about my wedding plans.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was backing her into a corner, and Lorna didn\u2019t like that one bit. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the details now, but I\u2019m sure I must have gotten it straight from the horse\u2019s mouth or I wouldn\u2019t have printed it,\u201d she muttered, her lips puckered with distaste now.</p><p>\u201cThe horse being Steve Brenner?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I might have . . . exaggerated a bit, to make the article newsworthy,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I certainly didn\u2019t make it all up, no matter what Laura\u2019s told you. I have my reputation to protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Steve have to say about the article?\u201d</p><p>Lorna shrugged. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything about it. Have you met him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like him,\u201d Lorna predicted. \u201cEveryone likes him, everyone but Laura,\u201d she said, waving her hand at Laurant. \u201cSteve wants to improve the economy here, and he\u2019s done so much to help this town. I know he must have been as embarrassed as I was about the retraction, but he never said a word. He wouldn\u2019t, of course. He\u2019s such a gentleman. I wouldn\u2019t have printed that retraction at all if Lauren hadn\u2019t threatened to go over my head. She can be a very . . . difficult woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really need to get going,\u201d Laurant said again. She had had enough of Little Lorna.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t budge. \u201cJust for the record . . . since you want to be accurate and all . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lorna asked, her pen posed to strike.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Laurant. That\u2019s Laurant, not Laura, not Lauren. We\u2019re in love,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you aren\u2019t going to have to worry about printing another retraction. Isn\u2019t that right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer right away, he squeezed her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cNick loves me and I love him.\u201d</p><p>Lorna had that ugly smirk on her face again. It was apparent she didn\u2019t believe Laurant, and all of a sudden it became imperative to Laurant that the obnoxious woman be convinced.</p><p>\u201cIt happened just like that,\u201d she said, snapping her fingers in front of Lorna\u2019s nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in love at first sight, but then I met Nick. I thought it was just plain old lust, didn\u2019t I, darling? But then I realized it was real. I\u2019m madly in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Lorna\u2019s small eyes were darting back and forth between Nick\u2019s complacent grin and Laurant\u2019s earnest expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to quote you.\u201d She made it sound like a threat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Nick told her as he turned toward the car with Laurant still tucked against his side.</p><p>Fortunately the car wasn\u2019t parked far away. Nick opened the door for Laurant and then went around to the driver\u2019s side and got in. Lorna stood on the sidewalk, watching them with a malevolent glare.</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling Little Lorna doesn\u2019t like you much,\u201d Nick said, glancing back at the society editor in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cI can see why the FBI wanted you. You\u2019re very observant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy article\u2019s going to be in the Sunday paper,\u201d Lorna shouted. \u201cPlease try to stay in love until then.\u201d</p><p>Infuriated because the woman wouldn\u2019t believe her, Laurant hit the button to roll the window down and then leaned out. \u201cI\u2019m telling you for the last time, Lorna. This is true love. It\u2019s the lasting kind.\u201d</p><p>Lorna stepped off the curb. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Laurant repeated.</p><p>\u201cHave you set a wedding date?\u201d</p><p>It was a challenge, and it didn\u2019t go unanswered. \u201cAs a matter of fact we have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married on the second Saturday in October at seven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason the wedding\u2019s so soon?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want a long engagement. Besides, everything\u2019s planned. Honestly, Lorna, everyone knows about this. You really should keep up, shouldn\u2019t you? I mean, you are the society editor after all.\u201d</p><p>Lorna\u2019s response was a loud snort. \u201cStill . . . planning a wedding in so little time. You don\u2019t have to get married, do you? Is that the reason for the rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Laurant snapped as she reached for the door handle.</p><p>Nick grabbed her arm and hit the door lock. He was trying not to laugh, but he was dying to ask her what she would do if he let her get out of the car. Was she going to deck Little Lorna?</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Laurant that she was acting like a complete lunatic. She slumped down in her seat and rolled the window up.</p><p>\u201cWill you please start the car. I want to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of them said another word until they had driven away from the town square and were heading for the abbey. Then Laurant exploded in a tirade. \u201cLorna Hamburg is the most opinionated, gossipy, nasty-spirited woman in Holy Oaks. I can\u2019t abide her. She\u2019s mean and cruel, and she loves to stir up trouble. How dare she not believe me,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ve never, ever lied to her before. Never. But she didn\u2019t believe me, did she? You saw the look on her face. She thought I was lying.\u201d</p><p>A minute passed in silence and then Nick glanced at her. \u201cLaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, sounding downright surly.</p><p>He pointed out the obvious. \u201cYou were lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t know that, did she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cApparently she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive, Nick. Just drive.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He simply couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She ignored him and stared out the window while she struggled to get her temper under control.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t being very logical,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when this is over and I go back to Boston? Are you going to make Lorna print another retraction, or are you just going to admit that you lied to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to admit I lied. Never. I won\u2019t give that vile woman the satisfaction of knowing she was right. I\u2019ve got a horrible reputation with the men in this town because of her lies.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and stared down at her lap. She knew she wasn\u2019t being reasonable, but she was too angry with the Gorilla to care.</p><p>\u201cLorna doesn\u2019t have any ethics. None at all. I swear I\u2019ll go to any lengths to avoid admitting I lied. I\u2019d even marry you,\u201d she exaggerated. \u201cAnd you\u2019re totally unsuitable.\u201d</p><p>Nick slowed the car. \u201cWhat do you mean, I\u2019m unsuitable? What\u2019s the matter with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t safe. That\u2019s what\u2019s the matter with you. You wear a gun, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before, it goes with the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any guarantees in life, and there\u2019s no such thing as completely safe, at least not the way you mean it. Bus drivers can be killed while they\u2019re doing their job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? How many bus drivers do you think get involved in shoot-outs?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t know all that many FBI agents who get into shoot-outs, as you so quaintly put it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re being completely illogical. You do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Her spine stiffened. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to be logical. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. Even though you know it\u2019s illogical, you\u2019d still marry me just to spite Lorna?\u201d</p><p>Of course she wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. And of course she wasn\u2019t going to admit it to Mr. Always-logical-know-it-all. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d she asked</p><p>\u201cNothing. If you don\u2019t see anything wrong with it, then I don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and gave him a belligerent nod. \u201cGood. October fourteenth . . . seven P.M. . . . Pencil it in.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>One man\u2019s trash could become another man\u2019s treasure. That was Laurant\u2019s hope, anyway, as she sorted through a dozen mildew-infested boxes of old, moth-eaten linens and broken knickknacks someone had stored in the attic over fifty years ago. By the time she stopped for the day, she was covered in a layer of dust, her white slacks were gray, and she was sneezing every other second from the moldy cardboard. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t find a priceless van Gogh or Degas painting tucked in with the trash. In fact, she didn\u2019t find anything she didn\u2019t consider old junk, but she refused to lose heart. She\u2019d only just started the job, after all, and there were over sixty boxes still sealed for her to sort through.</p><p>Nick helped her haul the trash down four flights of steps on their way to the car.</p> <p>\u201cDo we have time to stop by the seamstress to pick up my bridesmaid dress?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, if we hurry. We\u2019re supposed to pick up Tommy and Noah in an hour. That\u2019s enough time to shower and change.\u201d</p><p>The minute they arrived home, she ran up the stairs, passing Joe on his way down.</p><p>\u201cJust made the rounds and everything\u2019s locked up tight,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Nick carefully draped the dress over the dining room table and headed for the kitchen to grab a cool drink.</p><p>Laurant rushed to get ready. She wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistake twice and come out of the bathroom wearing an ugly, old, ragged robe, and so she gathered up everything she would need, including her sling-back shoes.</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later she decided she was as good as she was going to get. She was pulling out all the stops tonight, and so she wore the dress. It was short, it was black, and it had just enough spandex in the material to make it cling in all the right places. The flattering square neckline showed only a hint of cleavage. She\u2019d worn the dress only once since moving to Holy Oaks, and that was when she had taken Michelle and Christopher out to dinner to celebrate their engagement. Michelle had nicknamed the outfit \u201cthe killer dress,\u201d said it was indecently decent, and insisted that it was the sexiest thing Laurant owned. Christopher had been emphatic in his agreement.</p><p>Laurant stood in front of the mirror primping. She even curled her hair, but because she was so out of practice, she burned her ear in the process. She stared at her reflection and let out a loud groan. Why was she going to so much trouble to look pretty? She wasn\u2019t a teenager in the throes of her first love, but she certainly was acting like one.</p><p>My God, was she falling in love with him? The possibility sent chills down her spine. When his job was over, he would leave.</p><p>\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d she whispered as she slammed the brush down on the counter. She had a stupid crush on her big brother\u2019s friend. That was all there was to it.</p><p>Her ego took a real beating when Nick entered the room. He barely noticed her. After giving her one quick once-over\u2014probably making sure her shoes were on the right feet\u2014he told her Pete was on the phone, and when Joe finished talking to him, Pete wanted to speak to her. Nick\u2019s voice sounded strained, and she wondered why he seemed so preoccupied.</p><p>He was looking over her head. \u201cNothing important,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just wants to hear how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Nick got a whiff of her perfume as he passed her on his way to the bathroom. He pretended not to notice, just as he\u2019d pretended not to notice how incredibly sexy she looked in that tight black dress. Until he closed the door. Then he leaned against it, bowed his head, and whispered, \u201cDamn, am I in trouble.\u201d</p><p>They were fifteen minutes late picking up Noah and Tommy. Nick drove the car up the back driveway behind the abbey and pulled up to the steps. He and Laurant were getting out when Tommy appeared in the doorway and came running down the steps. Noah was nowhere in sight.</p><p>He hugged Laurant. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the car.\u201d He let go of her, opened the door, and tried to shove her inside, his anxiety apparent. \u201cNick, this is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Noah?\u201d Nick asked. He waited until Tommy had gotten into the backseat, then slid in behind the wheel again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get carryout and go to Laurant\u2019s house and eat. I don\u2019t like the idea of her being out in public. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She turned in the seat so she could see his face. \u201cTommy, I can\u2019t stay locked in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan is to be seen, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the plan is,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIncite the madman to come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to come after her,\u201d Nick said quietly. \u201cBut we\u2019d like it to happen sooner rather than later. We\u2019ll be ready for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, this is a bad plan. Things can go wrong\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laurant interrupted him. \u201cDid you know there are agents watching us right now?\u201d She didn\u2019t know if that were true or not. She was trying to calm her brother.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d he asked, craning his neck to look out the back window.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to see them,\u201d she said, sounding like an authority.</p><p>Tommy seemed to relax a little then. \u201cYeah, okay. Ah, heck. I forgot my wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to say that until the check comes,\u201d Nick joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Laurant watched her brother run up the steps and go back inside. \u201cHe\u2019s more nervous than he was in Kansas City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>Tommy came back outside a minute later and took the steps two at a time with his long stride. Noah was hot on his tail. It was then that Nick and Laurant saw what Noah was wearing. Nick started laughing first, but Laurant quickly joined in.</p><p>Noah was dressed like a priest in a black suit, black clerical shirt, and a white Roman collar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna go straight to hell,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>She had to look away so she could stop laughing. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s wearing a gun?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe has to carry a gun,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cAll the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t bother with a greeting. He was determined to make Tommy agree with him on a subject the two of them had obviously been arguing about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it isn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you,\u201d Tommy answered.</p><p>Noah snorted. \u201cNot for any man.\u201d</p><p>Nick guessed what they were quarreling about. \u201cCelibacy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cA priest never getting to have sex . . . that\u2019s just not right.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. Tommy shook his head and then tried to change the subject. \u201cWhere are we eating?\u201d</p><p>Noah wouldn\u2019t let the matter go. He couldn\u2019t seem to get past the celibacy rule. \u201cIt\u2019s just not healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even notice all those women coming on to you. Do you?\u201d</p><p>Tommy\u2019s patience was wearing thin. \u201cYes, I notice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I ignore them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. It\u2019s just not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tommy cut him off. \u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s just not normal. Now let it go, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Noah decided to accommodate him. \u201cDamn, you smell good, Laurant. Or is that you, Nick?\u201d he joked.</p><p>Before either one of them could answer, Noah said, \u201cHave you noticed the ungodly number of vans in this town? Hell, they\u2019re everywhere. I figure Wesson\u2019s running the plates. He is, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The question broke the carefree mood and the conversation became serious.</p><p>\u201cI called him earlier to find out if he had any news. I figured he had run the plates on the cars of the workmen on Laurant\u2019s block, but Wesson wouldn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018I\u2019m doing my job.\u2019 That\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cSo, we\u2019re the hired guns, is that it? He\u2019s gonna keep us out in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell with that. I\u2019m not going to work blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>Tommy began to grill Nick with questions and suggestions, and by the time they parked in the back of the Rosebriar Restaurant, Laurant had lost her appetite.</p><p>Noah grabbed Tommy\u2019s arm when he tried to get out of the car. \u201cListen up, priest. You stay close. You go running off again, and I\u2019ll shoot you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled, his good mood restored. Tommy got out of the car and opened Laurant\u2019s door for her. She swung her legs out and stood, self-consciously tugging on her skirt.</p><p>Noah let out a low whistle of appreciation. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a beautiful sister, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for priests to whistle at pretty women.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced at Nick. \u201cIt\u2019s been nonstop criticism since I put on this collar. I\u2019m trying to be patient and helpful, but he\u2019s making it tough.\u201d</p><p>Tommy walked ahead with Laurant, his head bent down toward hers as they talked, and Nick fell into step beside Noah.</p><p>\u201cHelpful in what way?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cI offered to hear confession for one of the other priests, but Tom got all bent out of shape and wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>Tommy heard the comment and glanced back. \u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend takes this priest stuff seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll priests are supposed to take their job seriously,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI should have warned Tommy about your warped sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s easy to rattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you know what buttons to push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>Noah winked. \u201cHave you been pushing any of her buttons? I noticed the way you\u2019ve been looking at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s off-limits. Wait up, Tommy,\u201d he called out. \u201cLet one of us go inside first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff-limits for you, or for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor both of us. She\u2019s not the kind of woman you mess around with unless you\u2019ve made a commitment.\u201d</p><p>The cobblestone path curved around the building. Noah strode ahead of Tommy and Laurant while Nick trailed behind. Both agents were busy looking at the terrain.</p><p>Terra-cotta pots brimming with red and white geraniums lined the path to the door. The Rosebriar was an old sprawling Victorian-style house that had been converted into a restaurant. The dining room was richly appointed with crystal vases filled with spring flowers on all the white linen tablecloths. The china looked old and expensive.</p><p>The room they were shown into was in the back of the house, overlooking a duck pond and the woods. They were led to a round table in front of the window so they could enjoy the view, but Noah nodded toward a corner table and asked to be seated there instead.</p><p>The room was quite full. It was noisy with laughter. Quite a few families were dining with their children. As they threaded their way to the corner, heads turned to watch Laurant. Even the children were mesmerized by her. Laurant seemed oblivious to the admiring gazes of every man in the restaurant.</p><p>The waiter pulled the table out so that Laurant could sit in the corner. Nick sat beside her. Noah and Tommy faced them, but Noah hated having his back to the room, and so he angled his chair to see the other diners. He started to take his jacket off, realized his gun would show, and pulled it back up over his shoulders.</p><p>Tommy couldn\u2019t sit still. Every other second he turned to look around the room. His head snapped up each time he heard a burst of laughter.</p><p>\u201cSit still and try to relax,\u201d Noah ordered. \u201cYou\u2019re drawing attention squirming in your chair like that. And quit staring at the other people. Don\u2019t you know most of them?\u201d</p><p>Tommy shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I\u2019m watching them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us watch them,\u201d Nick suggested. \u201cNow get with the program. Okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you should try to smile, Tommy,\u201d Laurant whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be celebrating tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to order a bottle of champagne,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Laurant held up her hand. \u201cNick and I are officially engaged.\u201d</p> <p>Tommy did smile then. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you got all decked out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not all decked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got makeup on too, don\u2019t you? You never wear makeup.\u201d</p><p>She knew her brother wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to embarrass her, but she still wanted to kick him under the table to get him to stop.</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s different too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI curled it. All right? Honestly, it\u2019s no big deal. And by the way, if anyone asks, you\u2019re thrilled that I\u2019m going to marry your best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I may have to marry your sister after all,\u201d Nick said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ran into a friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorna isn\u2019t my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded. \u201cAnd Laurant will do anything to keep Lorna from saying I told you so.\u201d</p><p>Tommy laughed. \u201cLorna\u2019s always rubbed Laurant the wrong way. I guess you will have to marry her.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. His gaze bounced from Laurant to Nick, and then back again, and then he said, \u201cYou know that wouldn\u2019t be bad at all. You\u2019re kind of suited for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to marry me. I\u2019m not safe enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding\u2019s at seven o\u2019clock on the second Saturday in October, and you\u2019re marrying us,\u201d Laurant said. \u201cI just know Lorna\u2019s going to talk to you, so act happy and don\u2019t forget the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, the second Saturday in October,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t forget. But when this is over, you\u2019re going to have to tell Lorna the truth.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was vehemently shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ll move first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to marry me to save face.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is a holy sacrament,\u201d Tommy reminded them.</p><p>\u201cLighten up, Tommy,\u201d Laurant suggested. \u201cGo with the flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, lie through my teeth, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me ask you this. If I\u2019m marrying you and Nick, who\u2019s going to walk you down the aisle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about that,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHow about if I marry Nick and Laurant, and Tom, you can walk your sister down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a plan,\u201d Nick agreed.</p><p>Tommy looked exasperated. \u201cOkay, Noah, let\u2019s go over the rules one more time. You\u2019re not really a priest. You\u2019re just pretending to be one, and that means you can\u2019t marry anyone, you can\u2019t hear confessions, and you can\u2019t date.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed, drawing stares from the other diners. \u201cDamn, it doesn\u2019t take much to get you riled up. We\u2019re pretending that Nick and Laurant are getting married, aren\u2019t we? So I\u2019m pretending I\u2019m going to marry them.\u201d</p><p>Tommy looked at Nick. \u201cHelp me out here, will you? The abbot went out on a limb for Noah. Pete talked to him and convinced him to go along with this plan. He agreed to tell everyone that Wesson\u2019s a cousin and that he\u2019s letting him stay in the cabin. The man\u2019s being real accommodating,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we don\u2019t like people impersonating priests, and Noah promised he wouldn\u2019t do anything to discredit the collar. Five minutes after we leave the abbot\u2019s office, Noah\u2019s winking at Suzie Johnson and calling her darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretending to be a friendly priest,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cAnd I still think priests ought to have one day off a week to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tommy stopped him. \u201cYeah, I know. A day off to have sex. That\u2019s not the way it works.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s phone rang. He listened for half a minute, then said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff just got out of a new, red Ford Explorer. He\u2019s headed this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he alone?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lodge holds its weekly meetings here,\u201d Laurant explained. \u201cThe others are probably upstairs in one of the smaller dining rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Brenner a member of the lodge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe after we eat, I\u2019ll go up and say hello,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI\u2019d sure like to meet good old Steve Brenner.\u201d</p><p>A minute later the sheriff strutted into the entry. Dressed in his gray uniform and cowboy boots, he didn\u2019t bother to remove his hat when he entered the restaurant. Nick watched the hostess pick up a menu and lead the sheriff up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBrenner\u2019s the local talent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cIt looks that way,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018the local talent\u2019?\u201d Tommy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe guy who tries to run the town. The bully,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cThere\u2019s always at least one in every town this size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what Brenner is,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cHe is trying to run the town, and my sister is the only person here who\u2019s willing to stand up to him.\u201d He noticed Laurant was admiring her ring and smiled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too attached to that ring, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting on a show, Tommy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut the ring is lovely, isn\u2019t it? I had no idea Russell\u2019s carried so many beautiful things.\u201d She began to wonder what it would be like to be married to Nick. To know that when she woke up every morning, he would be there? To be loved by\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of return policy does the store have?\u201d Tommy asked, practical to the bone.</p><p>She put her hand back in her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s usually ten days, but Mrs. Russell is making an exception for me. She\u2019s giving me thirty days. Do you know what she said to me? \u2018Because of your sorry history with men, dear, I\u2019ll allow you a whole month to change your mind.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Tommy laughed. \u201cMy sister\u2019s got quite a reputation in town for scaring men away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to all the lies Lorna prints in the paper about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest, Laurant. You do scare men, and just for the record, I think that\u2019s just fine. It keeps the creeps from hounding you.\u201d</p><p>Tommy glanced over his shoulder once again when he heard a commotion behind him. Then he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Frank Hamilton. He\u2019s the high school football coach, and those other two are assistants. They\u2019ve all been dying to meet you, Nick. Come on. Let\u2019s say hello before they head upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they know Nick?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cThe football tape the sports channel runs a couple of times a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d Nick muttered. He tossed the napkin on the table and followed Tommy out of the room.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s never going to live that game down, and he hates all the fanfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened during the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never saw the tape?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, and Tommy\u2019s never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick scored the winning touchdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s a little more to it than that. Nick caught the short pass, then zigzagged his way through the defense, which he was real good at doing. He could turn on a dime, and that\u2019s why he got the nickname Cutter,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnyway, his head was turned and he was looking up at the top of this cement wall. When you see the tape, you hear the announcer asking, \u2018What\u2019s number eighty-two looking at?\u2019 That was Nick\u2019s number,\u201d he added. \u201cSo then, while the one camera was focused on Nick, there was another camera searching the stands to see what had grabbed his interest, and after the game was over, they spliced those two tapes together.\u201d</p><p>He paused to take a drink of water before continuing. \u201cThere was this guy leaning over the cement wall. Turns out he was real drunk, and he was shouting like all the other fans, holding a beer in one hand, and a little kid in the other. He had the toddler sitting on the ledge. Can you believe how stupid that was?\u201d he asked. \u201cBut like I said, he was drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he drop the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure did, but Nick had been watching. He told me later that, when he was running, he saw the man grab at the kid once, but he didn\u2019t pull him back. He just kind of hung on to him and let him dangle half off the wall. Nick was running like there was no tomorrow at this point, and he didn\u2019t have anyone on his tail. He scored the touchdown but kept on running as he was turning. He thought he\u2019d stand under that wall until someone made the father remove the kid, but when he was about ten feet away, the guy lost his grip and the kid came flying down. The fall would have killed him. Nick caught him, and honest to God, it was a beautiful thing to see.\u201d</p><p>The story astounded her. She thought of a hundred questions to ask, but Noah turned her attention when he said, \u201cAfter the game, Nick was suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAfter the game was over, the father came into the locker room with the cameramen. He was still drunk, of course, and some of the guys told me he was loving the attention he was getting. Anyway, he wanted to thank Nick for saving his kid, but Nick came around the corner, saw him, and hauled off and decked him. He knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he was suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it didn\u2019t last. The public outcry swayed the coach, who probably really didn\u2019t want to suspend Nick anyway. I could understand where Nick was coming from. He didn\u2019t want to hear any excuses from the drunk.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared and placed a basket of rolls between them. Noah grabbed one as he said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s your turn. You tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come Tommy lived with Nick\u2019s family while he was growing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was opening an office in Boston and had come over to set up a house, and he\u2019d brought Tommy along so that he could get registered at school and start a new term. I was just a baby then, and I stayed with Mother. She was going to finish packing and follow Father. But then everything changed. Father was killed in a car crash, and for a while, Tommy was left in the care of the housekeeper. Mother couldn\u2019t cope with the loss. Tommy was only supposed to stay in Boston until the school year ended, and Mother was supposed to fly over and stay with him until then, but she wasn\u2019t stable enough to go anywhere. Grandfather told me she was drinking heavily and taking pills. Some of the pills were to help her sleep, and some were to help her wake up. She died of an overdose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes. Grandfather said it was a combination of alcohol and sleeping pills. He wanted to believe it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a deadly combination.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAfter she died, Grandfather was stuck with Tommy and me. He wanted to do the right thing, and he knew Tommy was happy in Boston. Judge Buchanan called him out of the blue and suggested that Tommy live with his family until things settled down. Nick and Tommy had become best friends, and Tommy spent most of his time with the family anyway. The judge can be very persuasive. Like Mother, Grandfather thought it would be for a little while, but then he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Tommy got to stay where he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulders. \u201cI was placed in a boarding school. After I graduated from university, I went to Paris for a year to study art, then I came to the United States and took a job in Chicago. I lived there for nine months, and then I moved to Holy Oaks. Nothing razzle-dazzle about my background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were left out in the cold, weren\u2019t you? Tommy had this nice big family to call his own, but you didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere they come,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Nick was chuckling as he sat down. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>He looked at Laurant before he answered. \u201cThe men in town have given Laurant a nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So what do they call her?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cIce Woman, or just plain Ice,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>All three of them laughed, but Laurant wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cYou\u2019re a blabbermouth, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, he asked.\u201d</p><p>She gave her brother a look that told him she was going to give him hell later. Then Nick drew her attention when he leaned close to her and whispered in her ear. \u201cYou sure don\u2019t kiss like ice.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared to take their orders, but as soon as he left, the men took turns teasing her. Finally, when she had had enough, she took the upper hand.</p><p>\u201cI heard Penn State is going to have a real bad football season. They lost their star quarterback.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard any such thing, of course, but that didn\u2019t matter. As soon as she said the word football, their minds clicked into sports mode. It was as easy as getting a baby to eat candy. She leaned back in her chair and smiled complacently.</p><p>Nick and Tommy had played ball for Penn State, and Noah, as it turned out, had been a running back for Michigan State, so each one of them believed he was the authority. During dinner they argued about draft choices and pretty much ignored her. She couldn\u2019t have been happier.</p><p>On their way out of the restaurant, a family of six called Tommy over to their table. Noah stayed with him, and Nick and Laurant went on outside.</p><p>Lonnie was waiting for them. His Chevy Nova careened into the parking lot as Nick and Laurant were heading toward their car. The Chevy came to a screeching halt in the center of the lot, just a few feet from them. Nick pushed Laurant between two cars, then got in front of her, waiting to see what the driver was going to do.</p><p>Lonnie wasn\u2019t alone. There were three others in the car with him, all from the nearby town of Nugent, and all with juvenile records. Whenever Lonnie had an important job to do for Steve Brenner, he made sure his friends were included. He gave them only a pittance of the money Steve paid, but they were too stupid to think that he might be screwing them out of their fair share. Besides, they were in it for the fun, not the cash, and Lonnie had another reason for involving them. If things went bad, they\u2019d take the rap. His good-for-nothing father would have to let him go. How would it look if the sheriff\u2019s son were tossed in jail? Being a big man around town meant everything to him, and Lonnie figured he could get away with murder as long as he was careful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steve had told Lonnie that Laurant and her boyfriend were driving an Explorer, and they were standing next to a new, red Ford Explorer. Steve hadn\u2019t told him anything about Nick, just that he was claiming to be Laurant\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Since Steve planned to marry Laurant, Lonnie needed to put the fear of God into Nick. \u201cRun him out of town,\u201d Steve had ordered, and Lonnie, salivating over the wad of cash Steve dangled in front of him, promised to do just that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sheriff\u2019s son, Lonnie,\u201d Laurant whispered. \u201cWhat\u2019s he up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to find out real soon,\u201d he whispered back. Then he shouted, \u201cHey, kid, move your car.\u201d</p><p>Lonnie left the motor running as he opened the door and jumped out. He was tall and gangly, his complexion marred by acne scars. His thin lips disappeared inside his sneer, and his hair hung down in his face in long, oily strands. Nick judged him to be around eighteen or nineteen years old.</p> <p>This one was already a lost cause. He could see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with the car,\u201d Lonnie told his friends. \u201cTrash it.\u201d He pulled his switchblade knife out of his back pocket. Snickering, he boasted to his friends, \u201cI\u2019m going to scare the shit out of Mr. Big City. Watch and learn.\u201d He flipped the dirty blade open as he slowly advanced. \u201cLaura, you\u2019re gonna be riding home with us, \u2019cause your boyfriend\u2019s car\u2019s going to be a piece of shit by the time I get finished with it.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. It wasn\u2019t the response Lonnie had anticipated. \u201cWhat\u2019s so damned funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Nick answered. He spotted Noah shoving Tommy behind him as he rushed down the stairs toward them. He called out to him. \u201cHey, Noah, the local thug wants to trash the new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s . . . ,\u201d Tommy began.</p> <p>\u201cSure it is,\u201d Nick interrupted.</p><p>\u201cLonnie, what do you think you\u2019re doing? Put that knife away,\u201d Tommy ordered.</p><p>\u201cI got some business with Laura,\u201d Lonnie said. \u201cYou and the other priest go on inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this guy stupid or what?\u201d Noah asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking he must be,\u201d Nick drawled as he reached inside his jacket and flipped the snap holding his gun in place.</p><p>Furious that he was being mocked in front of his friends, Lonnie lunged forward and thrust the knife into the left front tire. Then he stabbed it again, smiling when he heard the hiss of air.</p> <p>\u201cStill think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord we have a spare,\u201d Noah called out. He was busy keeping Tommy behind him and trying to watch the morons at the same time.</p><p>Lonnie reacted just the way Noah hoped. He sliced the other tire. His friends hooted with laughter, and that only encouraged him. He carved a jagged line in the grille, then did the same to the hood.</p><p>Then he stepped back to survey his handiwork. \u201cNow how are you going to get home?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI figured I\u2019d drive my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith two flat tires?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my car.\u201d</p><p>Lonnie blinked. Nick took a step toward him as he called out, \u201cNoah, maybe you ought to go inside and get the sheriff. He\u2019ll want to know his kid\u2019s been messing with his car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d Lonnie shouted.</p><p>\u201cDrop the knife. Do it now,\u201d he ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t make this any worse than it already is. You\u2019ve destroyed private property, and threatening a federal\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was about to tell Lonnie he was an FBI agent but wasn\u2019t given the chance.</p><p>\u201cNobody makes a fool out of me,\u201d Lonnie hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou did that all by yourself,\u201d Nick countered. \u201cNow drop the knife. This is your last warning.\u201d</p><p>Lonnie lunged, shouting, \u201cI\u2019m going to cut you up into pieces, you as**ole.\u201d</p><p>The boast was empty. \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Nick said as he kneed Lonnie, then snatched the knife and tossed it to the ground. He slammed him into the car, setting off the alarm.</p><p>It happened so fast, Laurant didn\u2019t have time to blink. Lonnie was doubling over, screaming in agony. She saw the knife and stepped back so she could kick it under the car.</p><p>The second the alarm went off, Lonnie\u2019s buddies scrambled to their car and piled in. Nick let go of Lonnie and watched him collapse.</p><p>\u201cYou as**ole. I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look. Here comes Daddy,\u201d Nick said cheerfully.</p><p>The sheriff was running down the stairs, his big stomach jiggling up and down. In the meantime, the three boys in the car were all frantically trying to find the keys. Noah strolled over to the driver\u2019s side and said, \u201cLooking for these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do nothing. It was all Lonnie\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ricky,\u201d the boy in the backseat shouted.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the car,\u201d Noah ordered. \u201cNice and easy, and keep your hands where I can see them.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to blow his cover, but he had his hand in his jacket on the butt of his Glock just in case one of them pulled a gun on him.</p><p>The sheriff looked like he wanted to cry. \u201cMy new car? Look at my new car. Did you do this, boy? Did you?\u201d</p><p>Lonnie struggled to his feet. \u201cNo,\u201d he sneered. \u201cThat as**ole did it,\u201d he added, pointing to Nick. \u201cAnd he kicked me in my knee too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you I bought myself a new car,\u201d the sheriff continued, as though he hadn\u2019t heard a word Lonnie had said. \u201cI was going to tell you. I was going to let you drive it too.\u201d He trailed his hand along the deep scratches in the hood, his eyes misty. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even perfect for one whole day. I just picked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the as**ole did it,\u201d Lonnie said again.</p><p>\u201cThe kid needs some work on his vocabulary,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to believe me or not?\u201d Lonnie shouted at his father. \u201cI\u2019m telling you for the last time, he cut your tires and scratched the paint.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was incensed. She pushed past Nick to face the sheriff. \u201cI know he\u2019s your son and that this is difficult for you, but you are the sheriff, and you have to do your job. Lonnie\u2019s lying. He did the damage. He thought your new car belonged to my fianc\u00e9. Like it or not, you\u2019re going to have to arrest him.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd put his hands up. \u201cSlow down, Laura. No reason to be hasty. It\u2019s my car and I\u2019ll make sure my boy pays the consequences if he did the damage, but he\u2019s saying your boyfriend\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laurant cut him off. She was so angry, she was sputtering. \u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThere are four witnesses. My brother, Father Clayborne, Nick, and me. You have to arrest him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, the way I see it, that\u2019s four against four, \u2019cause I\u2019m sure Lonnie\u2019s friends are going to back him up, and I don\u2019t have any reason at all not to believe them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonnie threatened us with a knife.\u201d</p><p>Looking past Laurant to Nick, the sheriff demanded, \u201cYou\u2019d best get your woman under control. I\u2019m not going to put up with her yapping at me. Now you just back away, Laura, and hold your tongue.\u201d</p><p>Laurant couldn\u2019t believe the sheriff was talking to her as though she were a naughty child. \u201cHold my tongue? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cDo something,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>The sheriff glared at her. \u201cI am going to do something,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou there,\u201d he muttered, pointing to Nick. \u201cI want to see some identification, and I want to see it now.\u201d</p><p>Laurant\u2019s temper exploded. She turned to Tommy and spoke in rapid French, telling him what an incompetent fool she thought the sheriff was. In fluent French, Nick told her to calm down.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s hands were balled into fists, and he kept glancing at his son. He wanted to kick some sense into the boy, and it took a good deal of discipline to control his fury. Besides, if he did give in to his temper, there was a good chance that Lonnie would strike back and beat the crap out of him. Lonnie had done it before, and Lloyd knew he would do it again.</p><p>\u201cI said I want to see some identification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Nick replied as he pulled out his badge and flipped it open. \u201cNicholas Buchanan, Sheriff. FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh shit,\u201d the sheriff moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to lock him up. I\u2019ll come by tomorrow and fill out the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat paperwork, Mr. FBI agent? It was my car that got damaged. Lonnie, stop your snickering or I swear I\u2019ll backhand you.\u201d</p><p>Noah came up behind the sheriff. \u201cI\u2019m not real familiar with the law, being a priest and all,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it seems to me that a crime was committed here by your son. Lonnie threatened an FBI agent with a knife, and that\u2019s some kind of a crime, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, maybe it is and maybe it isn\u2019t,\u201d the sheriff hedged. \u201cI don\u2019t see a knife, so what you\u2019re claiming might just be fabrication. Do you see my dilemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe knife\u2019s under the car,\u201d Noah told him.</p><p>Trying to buy some time while he figured out what he was going to do, the sheriff muttered, \u201cHow\u2019d it get under the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kicked it there,\u201d Laurant said.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing with a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of . . . ,\u201d she began.</p><p>The sheriff took his hat off and scratched his head. \u201cNow here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. You all go on home now and let me deal with this. You can come on by the office tomorrow, but you call me first,\u201d he told Nick. \u201cI\u2019ll have it all sorted out by then. Go on home now.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was so furious she was shaking. Without a word, she turned her back on the sheriff and walked to Nick\u2019s car, her high heels clicking hard on the pavement.</p><p>Nick could hear her muttering under her breath. As he opened the passenger door for her, he took hold of her hand. \u201cAre you all right? You\u2019re trembling. You weren\u2019t scared, were you? I wouldn\u2019t have let anything happen to you. You do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just angry, that\u2019s all. The sheriff isn\u2019t going to do anything about Lonnie. He certainly won\u2019t arrest him. You just wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a knife,\u201d she cried out. \u201cHe could have hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Nick was taken aback. \u201cYou were worried about me?\u201d</p><p>Tommy and Noah were getting into the backseat, and she didn\u2019t want them to hear her. \u201cOf course I was worried about you. Now will you stop grinning like an idiot and get in the car? I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to kiss her, but he settled on squeezing her hand instead. It was a sorry substitute.</p><p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d Nick called out as he walked around to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m going to want to talk to your son tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Tommy was craning his neck to look out the back window when Nick drove the car out of the parking lot. He could see the sheriff arguing with Lonnie.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Lonnie could be the guy who\u2019s stalking Laurant, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to check him out,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man we\u2019re after. Lonnie doesn\u2019t strike me as real intelligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s a moron,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you did your part to spur him on,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I do that?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord we\u2019ve got a spare? Isn\u2019t that what you said to Lonnie after he cut the first tire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Noah allowed. \u201cI wanted to keep him busy so he\u2019d leave you and Laurant alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right? I figured you wanted to see how far he\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged while he tugged on his stiff collar. It was chafing his neck. \u201cThis thing feels like a noose,\u201d he told Tommy.</p><p>\u201cNick, were there any agents at the restaurant? And if there were, why didn\u2019t one of them come forward to help?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was under control,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cWesson ordered me to let Tommy hear confession,\u201d Noah told Nick.</p><p>\u201cPete doesn\u2019t want him to,\u201d Nick responded. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told him.\u201d</p><p>From Noah\u2019s tone of voice, Laurant knew he didn\u2019t like Wesson any more than Nick did. She turned in her seat to ask him why.</p><p>Nick pressed his thumb against the disc so Wesson couldn\u2019t listen in.</p><p>Noah noticed what he was doing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I want Wesson to hear me. For the record, I think he\u2019s a glory seeker and power hungry. He doesn\u2019t give a damn who he steps on to get to the top, including Morganstern.\u201d</p><p>Noah was on a roll and wasn\u2019t going to stop until he\u2019d spilled all of his pent-up frustration with the man running the operation. \u201cHe sure isn\u2019t a team player,\u201d he added. \u201cBut then neither am I. Still, I avoid publicity just as much as you do, but Wesson goes looking for it. Remember the Stark case?\u201d he asked, and before Nick could answer, he added, \u201cOf course you do. You have to kill someone . . . you don\u2019t forget that. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Stark case?\u201d Nick asked, looking in the rearview mirror at Noah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you were surprised when you opened your newspaper a couple of days later and read that human interest story about you saving that kid. Didn\u2019t you think it was damn odd that the reporter wrote all that stuff about you, your family, and your best friend, Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Wesson leaked the story?\u201d Nick asked. He was getting mad just thinking about the possibility.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I\u2019m saying it,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou did notice Wesson\u2019s name was splattered all over that article, didn\u2019t you? If I could get that reporter alone in a room for a couple of minutes, I could prove it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Wesson do it?\u201d Laurant asked. \u201cWhat does he have to gain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a grudge. Plus, he wants to run the Apostles,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been his goal, and I think he figures the more publicity he can get for himself, the better his chances will be. I\u2019m telling you, Nick, as soon as Morganstern retires or accepts a promotion, Wesson\u2019s going to move in. When that day comes, you\u2019d be smart to get out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick pulled the car into the parking lot behind the abbey and stopped.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just concentrate on our jobs for now. Get some rest, Tommy. You look worn-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow at the picnic,\u201d Tommy said. He reached over the seat and squeezed Laurant\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou still doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Good night, Tommy.\u201d</p> <p>Noah climbed over the seat and got out on Tommy\u2019s side. Leaning back in, he said, \u201cNighty-night, Icy.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>The picnic was in full swing by the time Nick and Laurant arrived. He could hear the band playing as he took Laurant\u2019s hand and walked across the dirt road toward the crowd gathered around the bandstand and the picnic tables. The hill beyond the flat area was littered with colorful blankets, and from the distance it looked like a patchwork quilt. Children were running wild, ducking in and out between couples dancing to the music of The Hilltops. The aroma of smoking barbecue hung heavily in the air.</p><p>Tommy and Noah were busy turning hamburgers on the grill, but Tommy spotted them and waved hello. Laurant carried a blanket over her arm. She found a vacant spot under a gnarled tree and spread the blanket out there.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t like the size of the crowd. It appeared that most of the town had turned out for the affair. It was twilight now, and someone plugged in the Christmas lights that had been strung from tree to tree around the wooden bandstand.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the band great?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he said as he continued to look over the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHerman and Harley Winston started the group,\u201d she explained. \u201cHerman\u2019s the one playing the sax, and Harley\u2019s on the drums. They\u2019re the twins I told you about who are doing the remodeling on my store. They\u2019re so sweet. You should meet them.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at the bandstand and smiled. There were six members in the band, and all of them appeared to be in their seventies. The twins were identical and dressed alike in red checkered shirts and white pants.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re old men,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re young at heart,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd master craftsmen. In Holy Oaks, we don\u2019t put the elderly out to pasture. The contribution they make to this town is very important. When you see my store and my loft, you\u2019ll understand how talented these men are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t criticizing,\u201d he said. \u201cI just noticed, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The bandleader, a bald-headed gentleman with a toothy smile, sparkling eyes, and terribly stooped shoulders, thumped on the microphone to get everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, as you all know, this here picnic is the abbot\u2019s way of saying thank you to all of you folks out there who have worked so darn hard to get the church finished in time for the anniversary. The abbot expects you to have a fine time tonight,\u201d he added. \u201cNow as you know, me and the boys in the band only play the oldies, because those are the only songs we know how to play. We just love to take requests, so if you got a special gal you want to impress, come on up and write the name of the song on a piece of paper and stick it in that hat over there on that card table. We got plenty of pencils and paper. We\u2019ll be drawing the requests out of that hat till we have to shut down. Now the first song is going out to Cindy Mitchell and her husband, Dan. This is Cindy\u2019s first outing since she had that gallbladder taken out, and it\u2019s real good to see her up and about. Come on, Dan, bring her on out to the dance floor. This song is one of my favorites,\u201d he added as he stepped back and lifted his hands like a symphony conductor. Tapping his foot, he counted, \u201cOne, two, three. Hit it, boys.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed the command. The bandleader turned around to find out what was wrong, then chuckled. Speaking into the microphone, he sheepishly explained, \u201cI guess I ought to tell the boys the name of the song we\u2019re playing. It\u2019s \u2018Misty.\u2019 Now let\u2019s try it again.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t like the idea of Laurant being in such a large crowd. He knew the picnic was a good place for them to be seen together, and for him to observe the people around her, but he was still having trouble with it. The crowd could swallow her up, and he didn\u2019t want her out of his sight, not for one second.</p><p>Her friends made his job difficult. As soon as they spotted her, they wanted to pull her away from him. They were, of course, very curious about him. Several men came up to shake his hand and introduce themselves. They were open and friendly, and they tried to draw him into their group of friends around the beer kegs while Laurant was being tugged in the opposite direction. To keep her close, Nick anchored his arm around her waist and held tight. He wouldn\u2019t let her budge.</p><p>She didn\u2019t put up with his behavior for long. Leaning up on tiptoes, she whispered into his ear, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let me talk to my friends and neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t disappear on me,\u201d he whispered back, and then, because he knew they were being watched, he kissed her softly on her lips. \u201cTry to stay between Noah and me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised, and then she kissed him. \u201cNow please smile, Nick. This is a party, not a funeral.\u201d</p><p>Someone called her name, and Nick reluctantly let go of her. She hadn\u2019t taken five steps away from him before she was surrounded by women. They were all talking at the same time, and he was pretty sure he was the topic, because they kept glancing at him. He put his hands in his pockets and kept his gaze locked on Laurant. She had the most incredible smile.</p><p>One of the women screamed, and Nick took a quick step forward, but then he saw that Laurant was showing off the ring, and that was what had excited the young woman. He backed off and once again looked over the crowd. When he turned back to Laurant, she was slowly threading her way toward the bandstand. As Nick watched her mingle with the young and the old, he realized how vital she was to their community. She was also loved. The townspeople could obviously see what a gentle and caring woman she was. They responded to her the same way he did, by wanting to get closer to her. He could tell that she was genuinely interested in what they were saying. She made people feel good, and what a hell of a gift that was.</p><p>Nick was smiling as he watched her, but the smile vanished when she was stopped yet again by two men about her age. From the way they were drooling, he knew neither one was put off by her reputation. He felt a surprising burst of jealousy. Then one of the men put his hand on her arm, and Nick wanted to punch him. He knew his response was totally inappropriate. It wasn\u2019t like him to be so possessive.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t figure out what was the matter with him. A relationship with her was impossible. He knew that, and he accepted it.</p><p>Why was he having so much trouble maintaining his distance? Because he was damn hot for her, he admitted. This wasn\u2019t lust. He was old enough and had been around long enough to know the difference. Lust he could control with cold showers, but this feeling was totally different. It worried the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cAre you Nick Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>Nick turned. \u201cThat\u2019s me all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Christopher Benson,\u201d the man said as he stuck his hand out to shake Nick\u2019s. \u201cLaurant\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s best friend. Mine too,\u201d he added with a grin. \u201cI wanted to meet you and say hello.\u201d</p><p>Christopher was a likeable, easygoing man. He was built like a linebacker. He was as tall as Nick, but outweighed him by at least fifty pounds.</p><p>After they exchanged small talk, Christopher admitted sheepishly, \u201cMichelle sent me over to get as much information out of you as I could. She thinks that because I just finished law school, I should be able to grill anyone I want.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cWhat exactly does she want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual stuff, like how much you make, where you\u2019re going to live after you marry Laurant, and most important, are you always going to be there for her. You might be getting the idea that Michelle\u2019s nosy, but she isn\u2019t. She\u2019s just looking out for Laurant.\u201d</p><p>They both turned to watch Laurant. There were men standing in line to take a turn dancing with her. She was circling the floor now with donut boy.</p><p>He answered as many questions as he could and hedged on others.</p><p>When Christopher was finally satisfied, he remarked, \u201cLaurant\u2019s an important part of this town. People depend on her. She and Michelle are like sisters,\u201d he added. \u201cThey bring out the devil in each other, and, man, do they like to laugh.\u201d</p><p>Nick was wondering when he was going to get a chance to dance with Laurant. He sure as certain wasn\u2019t going to get in line. Being a fianc\u00e9 had a couple of perks, didn\u2019t it? Even if he was all pretend.</p><p>Christopher seemed to read his mind. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get Laurant. The food\u2019s going to disappear fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>He shouldered his way through the crowd, tapped donut boy on the shoulder, and pulled Laurant into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m cutting in, kid.\u201d</p><p>Laurant softened the teenager\u2019s disappointment. Leaning to the side, she asked him to save her a dance later, after dinner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only encouraging him,\u201d Nick told her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sweet boy,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk about the kid. He pulled her closer and continued to dance.</p><p>\u201cLook like you love me, honey,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI do love you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that thing you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing is called a dress. A sundress to be exact, and thank you. I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something. If all the men in this town are afraid of you, how come they\u2019re lining up to dance with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe because they know I won\u2019t say no. They don\u2019t ask me to go out on dates though. I think Tommy might be right. I might scare them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said with smug satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her question. \u201cLet\u2019s eat,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cViola and Bessie Jean are waving at us. I think they want us to sit with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Nick hissed.</p><p>His reaction startled her. \u201cI thought you liked them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot them,\u201d he answered impatiently. \u201cI just spotted Lonnie. What the hell is he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get to say I told you so?\u201d she asked. She found Lonnie in the crowd, sitting alone on a picnic table, an insolent expression on his face. No one else was sitting at the table, and Laurant noticed several people, obviously nervous around the bully, who were avoiding making eye contact with him.</p><p>Nick was searching the crowd for the sheriff. \u201cI don\u2019t see dear old dad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt he\u2019s here. He wouldn\u2019t answer your phone calls all day, and the jail was locked up when we stopped by. I think he\u2019s hiding from you, Mr. FBI Agent,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to do something about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to find him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the sheriff,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to do something about Lonnie. He\u2019s a complication we don\u2019t need now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d</p><p>Nick draped his arm around Laurant\u2019s shoulders and headed for the buffet that was set up behind the bandstand.</p><p>\u201cNoah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What can Noah do?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo make Lonnie get off that table first,\u201d she suggested. \u201cThen we\u2019ll eat. People need places to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, but as he turned to the tables, he saw Tommy heading for Lonnie from the opposite direction. He had a spatula in his hand and a look on his face that indicated he wasn\u2019t going to put up with any of Lonnie\u2019s terror tactics today. Noah was busy scooping up burnt hamburgers, but he kept his eye on Tommy while he worked, which explained why two of the hamburgers ended up on the ground. Lonnie\u2019s friends materialized out of nowhere and stood by the table as Tommy approached.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you go help my brother?\u201d she asked, the worry there in her tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cHe can handle himself.\u201d</p><p>Lonnie had a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. Tommy said something to him, and Lonnie shook his head, then flicked the cigarette at him. Tommy stepped on it. Then as quick as a blink, he grabbed Lonnie by the scruff of his neck and jerked him off the table.</p><p>Lonnie\u2019s hand slipped into his pants pocket, and that\u2019s when Noah came running. So did a good number of the men attending the picnic. They ran to Tommy to help. The show of solidarity infuriated Lonnie, and within seconds, his face had turned purple with rage. Noah shoved his way through the men just as Lonnie pulled the switchblade out. Noah whacked him hard on the wrist with his spatula and tripped him at the same time. Howling in pain, Lonnie dropped the knife. Tommy picked it up and tossed it to Noah, then hauled Lonnie to his feet and ordered him and his friends to leave.</p><p>Laurant let out a sigh of relief. As Tommy and Noah headed back to the grill, several men stopped them to shake their hands. One enthusiastic man pounded them on their shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow can we eat?\u201d Nick grabbed two plates, handed one to her, and headed for the hamburgers.</p><p>After they had filled their plates with salads and chips at the buffet table, they joined the Vandermans. The sisters were sitting with the three men who were temporarily living in the house across the street. Bessie Jean scooted closer to Viola so Laurant and Nick could sit on the bench with them.</p><p>Viola made the introductions, adding information she\u2019d gleaned from the weary-looking workmen. Two of the men, Mark Hanover and Willie Lakeman, owned farms in northern Iowa and were supplementing their incomes with carpenter jobs. Justin Brady had just purchased his uncle\u2019s land in Nebraska and was diligently trying to pay off the mortgage as soon as possible by picking up extra work. All three men were in their early thirties and all three were wearing wedding rings. The calluses on their hands proved they were hard workers, and the empty cups lined up in front of them proved they were also hard drinkers. Nick leaned his elbows on the table and listened to the three men describing the work at the abbey, all the while sizing them up.</p><p>Mark downed a sixteen-ounce plastic cup of beer in two long gulps. Nick understood why the man was drinking so much when Bessie Jean asked him if he had any children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mark lowered his gaze to his cup in his hands. \u201cMy wife died last year. We didn\u2019t have any kids. We were waiting until we got some of our bills paid off.\u201d</p><p>Viola reached across the table and patted Mark\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019re all terribly sorry about your loss, but you\u2019ve got to get on with your life and try to look to the future. I\u2019m sure your wife would have wanted you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied. \u201cWith the drought, we all have to pick up work whenever we can. I\u2019ve got my parents to look after, and Willie and Justin have families depending on them too.\u201d</p><p>Willie pulled out his wallet to show off his family, a redheaded wife and three carrot-topped little girls. Justin wasn\u2019t going to be outdone. He carefully removed the photo of his wife and handed it to Bessie Jean.</p> <p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Kathy,\u201d he said, pride radiating in his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s due to have our first baby August first or thereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting a boy or a girl?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>Justin smiled. \u201cKathy and I decided we didn\u2019t want to know. We want to be surprised.\u201d Glancing over his shoulder at the bandstand, he said, \u201cKathy loves to dance. I sure wish she could be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all putting in fourteen-hour days,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good money, so none of us mind,\u201d Justin interjected.</p> <p>\u201cJustin, we haven\u2019t properly thanked you for helping us with our garden,\u201d Viola said. \u201cAs busy as you are, you made time to lend us a hand. I believe I\u2019ll bake you a nice chocolate cake. It\u2019s my specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, ma\u2019am, but we\u2019re putting in long hours at the abbey, and I won\u2019t be getting home until after dark. I sure do love chocolate cake though.\u201d</p><p>Viola beamed. \u201cWell then, I\u2019m baking you one. I\u2019ll just leave it on your doorstep or put it in your kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Mark started talking about all the work they still had to get done before the anniversary. Willie ribbed Justin, teasing him about getting the easy work in the choir loft while they had to climb up and down the scaffolding with their paint cans.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m doing my part,\u201d Justin said. \u201cThe fumes from the varnish collect in that loft and make me light-headed. That\u2019s why I take more breaks than you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ve got your feet planted on the floor while you\u2019re working. Willie and I are hanging by our necks half the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing in the loft?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cTearing out the old, rotting wood and replacing it. There was a lot of water damage around the organ,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s tedious work, but it\u2019s going to look real nice when I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you like living at the Morrison\u2019s house?\u201d Bessie Jean asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Mark said, shrugging. \u201cJustin thought we all should split the chores, so we each took a room to keep clean. It makes it easier.\u201d</p><p>Nick devoured two hamburgers while he listened to the conversation. Feinberg had told him that Wesson had already ruled out these three men. He\u2019d run a background check on all of them. They were farmers working as carpenters and racing against the clock to get renovations finished, but as far as Nick was concerned, they were still suspects. So was every other man attending the picnic. He wasn\u2019t about to rule out anyone in Holy Oaks.</p><p>One of the high school boys tapped Laurant on her shoulder and asked her to dance. She graciously accepted before Nick could come up with a reason to object. He followed them to the edge of the dance floor and stood there with his arms folded across his chest, watching.</p><p>The band was playing an old Elvis Presley song. Laurant swayed to the music while her enthusiastic dance partner gyrated wildly in a circle around her. She had to duck his elbow a couple of times because the kid\u2019s arms and legs were going every which way. Nick thought he looked like an extra in a bad karate movie, and he knew Laurant was having trouble maintaining a straight face. Other couples were giving the kid a lot of room, probably so they wouldn\u2019t get kicked.</p><p>For the next hour she was dragged onto the dance floor again and again as the bandleader called out the dedications and played the requested songs. When Laurant wasn\u2019t dancing, she helped clean up, and she was constantly being stopped by men and women, children too, to say hello. She moved through the crowd with an ease and comfort he envied.</p> <p>She had told him that in Holy Oaks, people cared about one another, but now he was seeing it firsthand. He used to think it would drive him crazy if everyone knew what he was doing. Now he wasn\u2019t so sure. It might be kind of nice. He didn\u2019t know any of his neighbors in Boston. When he came home at night, he drove into the garage, went in his house, and stayed there until it was time to leave again. He had never had the time nor the inclination to interact with any of his neighbors. He didn\u2019t even know if there were any children on the block.</p><p>Laurant was dancing with Justin now and was laughing at something he\u2019d said. The song ended and Nick spotted a man about his age heading toward Laurant. He decided she\u2019d done enough dancing for one night. He got to her first, pulled her into his arms, and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re in love,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cHave you been telling people how we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ve told the story at least twenty times now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you tell them what the experts are saying about your stalker?\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chin, then put her head down on his shoulder and closed her eyes so that anyone watching would see her snuggling up to her lover while she danced with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it so many ways, I\u2019ve run out of adjectives. I\u2019ve called him stupid and sloppy, and I\u2019ve told them the FBI\u2019s convinced he has a very low IQ, that he\u2019s to be pitied because he\u2019s so dysfunctional. You name it, Nick. I\u2019ve said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Have you been telling people how we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, every chance I get,\u201d he answered. \u201cI met Christopher,\u201d he added. \u201cI liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Michelle yet. Uh-oh, here comes Steve Brenner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna be dancing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to dance with him.\u201d</p><p>The song ended. As Nick and Laurant were leaving the dance floor, they were intercepted by Brenner.</p><p>Nick sized him up with just one quick look. The man was all about control. The way he moved and the way he dressed were giveaways. The man\u2019s appearance was extremely important to him. His Ralph Lauren shirt and pants were crisply pressed, and there wasn\u2019t a hair out of place. The only concession he made to casual picnic attire was not to wear socks with his new Gucci loafers. As Nick shook his hand, he noticed Brenner was sporting a Rolex watch.</p><p>Brenner touched Laurant\u2019s shoulder sympathetically. \u201cLaurant, I want you to know how sorry I am about that article Lorna wrote. I was embarrassed when I read that nonsense about the two of us. I have no idea where she came up with that story, and I hope it didn\u2019t cause you any distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLorna told me that you and Nick are engaged, or was that another fabrication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got that right. Nick and I are getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. Congratulations to both of you. You\u2019re getting a good woman,\u201d he said to Nick. Looking at Laurant again, he asked, \u201cHave you set the wedding date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond Saturday in October,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Holy Oaks,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll still be fighting you on the town square.\u201d</p><p>The smile went out of his eyes. \u201cI expect you will, but I think I\u2019ve come up with an offer you won\u2019t want to refuse. I\u2019d like to drop it off tomorrow after work. Are you going to be home? We could sit down and discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t be home. Nick and I are going to the rehearsal at the abbey for the wedding. And then there\u2019s dinner after,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe won\u2019t be getting home until after midnight.\u201d</p><p>Brenner nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I give you a call next Monday. That should give you time to recover from Michelle\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting engaged and setting a wedding date . . . that happened pretty quick, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Nick answered, \u201cI\u2019ve known Laurant a very long time, since she was a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when we saw each other again in Kansas City, we just . . . knew . . . didn\u2019t we, darling?\u201d Laurant added.</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations again,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I better go get a hamburger before they\u2019re all gone.\u201d</p><p>Nick kept his eye on Brenner as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of anger pent up inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you tell that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he was congratulating us, his hands were fisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making his life miserable right now. He was probably clenching his fists to keep from wringing my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re single-handedly blocking his plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he a suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is,\u201d he replied. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go sit on the blanket and make out like teenagers.\u201d</p><p>The suggestion made her laugh. Several men and women turned and smiled at the happy couple.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the abbot would approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are. I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>Michelle came hurrying across the grass. Her fianc\u00e9, Christopher, had hold of her hand and was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Michelle was a beautiful woman. Petite, with delicate features, she had long golden hair that framed her heart-shaped face. She had a killer smile that demanded a response.</p><p>Laurant\u2019s friend wore a metal brace on her right leg, and when she tried to sit down at the picnic table, she winced in pain. Christopher was telling Nick a joke he\u2019d just heard as he swept Michelle up into his arms and then sat down with her in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still limping,\u201d Michelle said to Laurant.</p><p>\u201cBut barely,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I noticed the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shattered my knee in a car accident,\u201d she explained to Nick. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be able to walk at all, but I beat the odds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle knows all about percentages,\u201d Christopher explained. \u201cShe has degrees in mathematics and accounting, and she\u2019s going to get her CPA after we get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping Laurant\u2019s books for her store,\u201d Michelle added.</p><p>The bandleader caught everyone\u2019s attention when he thumped on his microphone and announced that the next song would be the last for the evening.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to dance, honey,\u201d Christopher insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd so do we,\u201d Nick said. As he was pulling Laurant toward the dance floor, he said, \u201cI like your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey like you.\u201d</p><p>The bandleader opened the piece of paper and smiled. \u201cAh, now folks, this here song is a slow one, and it\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d he announced. \u201cAnd so is the little girl it\u2019s dedicated to. It\u2019s for our own sweet Laurant Madden, and it\u2019s from Heartbreaker.\u201d</p><p>Nick had just taken Laurant into his arms when the bandleader made the announcement. He heard her drawn-in breath and felt her stiffen. He pulled her close, an instinctive response to danger.</p><p>He saw Noah and Tommy moving toward the bandstand. Another man separated from the crowd and came forward from the opposite direction. Nick knew at once that he was an agent. Damn, none of them knew who they were looking for, and the crowd was watching them, surrounding them, smiling because the song was for Laurant.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNick, what do we do?\u201d she whispered in a shaky voice.</p><p>\u201cWe dance,\u201d he said.</p><p>Laurant felt as though the world was closing in on her. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath, couldn\u2019t think. She tucked her head under Nick\u2019s chin and closed her eyes. He wants me to know he\u2019s here, watching me. Oh God, make him leave me alone. Please God . . .</p><p>\u201cNow folks, grab your partner \u2019cause like I said, this is our last request. The name of the song is \u2018I Only Have Eyes for You.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>He stood in the crowd and watched, the intoxication building to a feverish pitch inside him. Laurant, his sweet Laurant. She mesmerized him. So lovely, so untouchable. For now.</p><p>Soon, my love. Soon you will be mine.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the mule walking toward her. He smiled then. He had snapped his fingers, and they had come. He was the spider now, and they were caught in his web.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the mule. He watched him cross the grass and pull Laurant into his arms. It was all a game. Oh yes, he knew what they were doing. Trying to upset him, as though he were a simpleton.</p><p>And still he couldn\u2019t turn away. They were dancing, and he didn\u2019t like the way the mule was holding her. It was too close . . . too intimate. Then Nick kissed her. He felt such a burst of rage explode inside him his knees buckled and he had to sit down. It was a game, a game. They were playing with him, tormenting him. Yes, he knew what they were doing . . . and yet, he was livid.</p><p>How dare they torment him!</p><p>The surprises weren\u2019t over. He was blatantly staring at them now, studying them, and he could see the way Laurant was looking at the mule. He jerked back against the bench. She loved him. It was as plain as day to someone as clever and astute as he was. She couldn\u2019t hide it, not from him. Green-eyed girl had fallen in love with a mule. Lordy, lordy, what was he going to do about that?</p><p>She was ruining his good time. When the last song was announced and it was for Laurant, he\u2019d felt flushed and dizzy. The joy and the rage were almost more than he could bear. And while he stood there in plain sight and watched his prey on the dance floor, smiling and laughing and acting like they were having a mighty fine time, he knew there must be mules rushing through the crowd searching for him. Fools, all of them. They didn\u2019t know what he looked like, or who he was, so how were they expecting to find him? Did they think he was going to pull out a gun and point it to himself? He laughed just thinking about it. Priceless, he thought. Their stupidity was truly priceless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he spotted good old Father Tom, running toward his sister with another priest by his side. There was a beautiful look of terror in Tom\u2019s eyes. He savored it and sighed with pleasure. Now what in tarnation did those silly priests think they were going to do? Pray him into giving himself up?</p><p>Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord. Was Father Tom thinking about vengeance now? The possibility amused him. Perhaps the next time he went to confession he would ask him. A priest should understand. That was his job, wasn\u2019t it? To understand and forgive? Maybe understanding would come with death. He mulled over that philosophical possibility and then shrugged. What did he care if Tommy understood or not?</p><p>My, oh my, he hadn\u2019t had this much fun in a long, long time. And it was only going to get better, as long as he kept the anger reined in, controlled it, soothed the beast with promises of the havoc to come. How dare they think they could outwit him? Ignorant mules, all of them.</p><p>Still, caution was called for now. Bide his time, that was the ticket. He certainly wasn\u2019t afraid or even worried about the mules. He had invited the FBI boys to Holy Oaks, now hadn\u2019t he? But he so wanted to be a gracious host, a regular Martha Stewart, if you will, and so he needed to know the exact number he would be entertaining. There had to be enough refreshments to go around. Did he bring enough C-4 with him? He thought about it for a minute and then smiled. Why, yes, as a matter of fact, he did.</p> <p>Heartbreaker was always prepared.</p><p>His goal was to eliminate as many of the mules as he could, as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with his primary objective. The target. Get the target and have a little old-fashioned fun at the same time, while he proved to the world that he was The Superior Being. None of the FBI boys were a match for him. And soon now, very soon, when it was too late and they couldn\u2019t run and hide, they would realize it.</p><p>He would take care of his unfinished business and at the same time let the world mock them all on national television. Prime time. KABOOM. Film at eleven. Yes, sirree.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>Another day passed and the pressure was mounting.</p> <p>The thought of another crowded gathering was making Laurant physically ill, but she wasn\u2019t about to disappoint Michelle on one of the biggest nights of her life, her wedding rehearsal and the dinner that followed.</p><p>After the first course, Michelle noticed that Laurant hadn\u2019t touched her food. Leaning across the table, she whispered, \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Laurant answered, forcing a smile.</p><p>Michelle knew better, and she turned to Nick for help. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Laurant home and put her to bed,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>When Laurant opened her mouth to protest, Michelle stopped her. \u201cI don\u2019t want you getting sick. I am not walking down that aisle tomorrow without you.\u201d</p><p>Laurant and Nick said their early good-bye\u2019s and headed home.</p> <p>A dozen red roses were waiting on the front porch when they arrived. Nick picked up the vase on his way inside the house.</p><p>\u201cThey were delivered right after you left,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Nick read the card out loud. \u201cPlease forgive me and come home. Love, Joel.\u201d</p><p>Laurant took the vase and put it on the dining room table. Nick and Joe followed. The two men stood side by side frowning at the roses.</p><p>\u201cIt seems such a waste to throw them out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I usually do. I don\u2019t want to be reminded of Joel Patterson every time I walk through this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often does this creep send you flowers?\u201d Nick asked, trying not to let his irritation show.</p><p>\u201cAbout once a week,\u201d she said. \u201cHe won\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d He picked up the vase, went into the kitchen, and emptied the water in the sink, then dropped the vase and the roses into the trash can. \u201cHe\u2019s a tenacious bastard, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatterson\u2019s the man in Chicago who was doing his secretary while he was chasing you, right?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>His frank assessment didn\u2019t faze her. \u201cYes, he\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s having trouble letting go,\u201d Joe remarked. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. Nick will take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t take care of him,\u201d she countered, a bit more sharply than she\u2019d intended. \u201cJoel Patterson is my problem, and I\u2019ll deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Joe said, surprised by the burst of anger. \u201cWhatever you decide is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignoring him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to be working,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cLet him spend his money on flowers. I don\u2019t care. Now can we please drop the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand to her brow. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I snapped at you. It\u2019s just . . . after what happened at the picnic . . . he was there, Joe. And he wanted me to know he was watching me. \u2018I Only Have Eyes for You.\u2019 That was the song he requested. Cute, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard all about it,\u201d Joe said as he followed her into the kitchen. He had already guessed what she was going to do. Make tea. Joe knew the strain was getting to her. In the harsh kitchen light, she looked pale, as though she hadn\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in weeks.</p><p>Joe blurted out what he was thinking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay strong.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around to face him, one hand defiantly on her hip. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done, Joe thought. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go into the living room and watch a little television?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a cup of hot tea. Would you like some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. It felt like it was 110 in the kitchen, but if she wanted to make hot tea for him, he\u2019d drink it.</p><p>He sat down and watched her work. Nick was in the back hallway, talking on his phone, his head bent, his voice too low to make out any of the conversation. Joe figured he was either talking to Morganstern or Wesson.</p><p>Laurant took the kettle to the sink and held it under the faucet. She stared at the fleur-de-lis painted on the white tile above the splash guard while she thought about the picnic.</p><p>Nick had finished his call and came back into the kitchen in time to hear her say, \u201cLonnie was there at the picnic. He left early, but he could have put that piece of paper in the hat before Tommy chased him away.\u201d</p><p>Nick got a Diet Pepsi out of the fridge and popped the lid. He took a long swallow and then said, \u201cYeah, Lonnie could have done that, but he couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and we know he hasn\u2019t left Holy Oaks in the last month. He was in town when the unsub talked to Tommy in the confessional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find that out?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>\u201cI go that bit of information from Feinberg this morning.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the sink. \u201cSo who wasn\u2019t here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The kettle was filled, and water was now pouring down the sides. Nick took it out of her hands, poured out half the water, and then put the kettle on the stove top.</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff was out of town,\u201d Joe told her. \u201cAnd so was Steve Brenner. He told friends he was going fishing.\u201d</p><p>Laurant got out the tea bags and cups from the cupboard and put them on the table. She didn\u2019t seem to notice that Nick was drinking a Pepsi. She was still going to make him a cup of tea. He smiled while he watched her work. The quirky habit of hers was odd but sweet.</p><p>She sat down to wait for the water to heat. Restless, she picked up the deck of cards Joe had left and began to shuffle them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the crime scene Wesson was so excited about? Shouldn\u2019t we have heard something by now?\u201d</p><p>Joe answered. \u201cThe lab\u2019s working on the evidence they\u2019ve collected. I do know the scene was contaminated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContaminated by what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCows,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t block the picture Joe had just evoked and whispered, \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal the cards,\u201d he suggested, hoping to turn her attention. \u201cWe\u2019ll play gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, but she continued to sit there, shuffling the cards. Joe finally took them out of her hands and dealt them for her.</p><p>\u201cI know it seems like a lot of time has passed, but\u2014\u201d Nick began.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cThey won\u2019t find his fingerprints. They won\u2019t find any evidence that could lead them to him.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat down, straddling the chair with his arms braced against the back. \u201cDon\u2019t make him superhuman. He bleeds like the rest of us. He\u2019s going to mess up, and then we\u2019ll nail him.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her cards and looked them over. \u201cThe sooner the better, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then why don\u2019t we make it happen sooner. I think Wesson\u2019s right. Maybe I should go running alone tomorrow, and maybe I should spend the day doing errands on my own. Don\u2019t shake your head at me. He\u2019s looking for an opportunity, and I think we should accommodate him. You could make sure I was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was emphatic.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we should discuss this before you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She held her temper. \u201cI really think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cI promised your brother I wouldn\u2019t let you out of my sight, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Nick, chill out,\u201d Joe suggested.</p><p>The burst of anger was short-lived. \u201cYeah, right,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>The tension was getting to both of them. Laurant knew why she was feeling so frustrated. Her every movement was being controlled by a lunatic. Yes, that was exactly what was happening, and God, how she hated it. But why was Nick losing his temper? He should be used to working under this kind of strain, shouldn\u2019t he? Up until tonight, he\u2019d been very laid-back and as steady as a rock. How in God\u2019s name was he able to do it, day in and day out? The special unit he worked for searched for abducted children. She couldn\u2019t think of anything more terrifying than a child in danger. The pressure had to be tremendous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the expert. I\u2019ll let you decide what\u2019s to be done. If you don\u2019t want me to run alone, then I won\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>She\u2019d done a complete turnaround in a matter of seconds, and Nick couldn\u2019t figure out why she was suddenly being reasonable again. \u201cHow come?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make your job any more difficult than it already is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNow that you two are calm, I kind of hate to bring this up,\u201d Joe said. He discarded a card and picked up a new one. \u201c \u2019Cause I know Nick\u2019s going to get upset again, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get upset. What do you need to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the unsub doesn\u2019t poke his head out of the woodpile within the next couple of days, I\u2019m going to be reassigned.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Nick\u2019s jaw flexed.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know you\u2019ll be reassigned?\u201d Laurant asked Joe.</p><p>Nick answered. \u201cWesson. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cHe thinks maybe the unsub knows I\u2019m here, and if I make a big deal about leaving, then maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break,\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose if the unsub still doesn\u2019t try to grab her, then Wesson will reassign the other agents so the unsub will feel more comfortable? I\u2019ve got an idea. Why don\u2019t we all pack up now and leave? Laurant can leave the front door open so he won\u2019t have any trouble getting inside. That\u2019s pretty much Wesson\u2019s game plan, isn\u2019t it, Joe. He\u2019ll stay in Holy Oaks though, you can bet your ass on that.\u201d</p><p>Joe pointed at the disc to remind Nick that Wesson could be listening in. Nick couldn\u2019t have cared less. He wanted him to know what he thought of his methods.</p><p>Nick unpinned the disc and held it up so he could speak directly into the microphone. \u201cYou want to be the big man to catch the unsub, don\u2019t you, Jules? At any cost. That\u2019s the plan, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019ll look great on your record, and your political ambitions are far more important than Laurant\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>Feinberg\u2019s voice responded. \u201cSorry to disappoint you, Nick, but I\u2019m monitoring the line, not Wesson, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, you guys are talking about the weather.\u201d</p><p>The agent was doing his best to protect Nick, but the effort wasn\u2019t appreciated. Wesson couldn\u2019t hurt Nick professionally, and even if he could, Nick wouldn\u2019t have cared. How would he feel if he got fired? Maybe relieved, he thought. Bad attitude, he decided, but he couldn\u2019t make himself care about that either.</p><p>Morganstern was right. Nick needed a vacation, and he needed sex. Lots of sex, but not with just any woman. He wanted Laurant.</p><p>\u201cGin.\u201d Laurant smiled at Joe when she showed him her cards. He groaned.</p><p>The kettle began to hiss. Laurant got up to fix the tea. She poured water into all three cups, then put the kettle back on the stove and turned to walk out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about your tea?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs now. I think I\u2019d like to take a hot bubble bath.\u201d</p><p>Nick gritted his teeth. Now, why in the hell did she think they needed to know that? Damn. His mind went wild, and all he could think about was her lush body covered in a mist of bubbles. He wanted to follow her and dive into the tub with her. He headed to the guest room instead and took a cold shower.</p><p>Joe was watching a movie downstairs, so Nick, dressed in his jeans and his favorite old T-shirt, went into Laurant\u2019s room to watch Sports Roundup.</p><p>Theo called to check in. It was late in Boston, but his brother never slept. He was in the mood to talk about the latest bizarre case he was prosecuting. Nick tried to pay attention, but his eyes were locked on that bathroom door, and x-rated images kept flashing through his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d he asked Theo.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay with you?\u201d</p><p>Hell, no. \u201cSure,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou know how it goes. It\u2019s the waiting that makes me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you haven\u2019t mentioned Laurant? I haven\u2019t seen her in years. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s changed. What\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Tommy\u2019s sister. That\u2019s what she\u2019s like.\u201d Big mistake, Nick realized as soon as the words were out of his mouth. He\u2019d sounded defensive, and Theo\u2019s reputation for being a top-rate prosecutor wasn\u2019t just talk. He immediately went for the jugular. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes Tommy know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve got the hots for his sister.\u201d</p><p>Before Nick could answer, Theo laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell him.\u201d</p><p>Nick pictured his hand going through the phone and grabbing his brother by the throat. \u201cTheo, if you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll stop fishing. There\u2019s nothing to tell. Laurant\u2019s fine. Just fine. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. \u201cTell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she still have those long legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>He came in through the back door.</p><p>He\u2019d tried using the key he had duplicated, but the bitch had obviously changed the locks. Now why had she done that, he wondered. Had she found the camera? He stood on the back stoop nervously flipping the key over and over in his hand while he pondered the possibility and finally decided no, she couldn\u2019t have found it. It was too well hidden. Then he remembered how old and rusty the lock was, and he assumed that it had simply broken.</p><p>Fortunately, he had worn his black windbreaker, and he could use it to protect his hand and break the glass. He\u2019d put on the jacket so that he could blend into the night and wouldn\u2019t be seen by the two, dried-up old hags living next door to Laurant. They were like cats sitting in their windows looking out. He\u2019d parked the car three blocks away, another precaution against her nosy neighbors, and walked over to her house, making sure he stayed away from the streetlights and close to the bushes.</p><p>Twice he felt like someone was following him, and he got so spooked he considered turning around and going back home, but the rage inside of him kept propelling him forward. The need to strike out was eating at him like acid, forcing him to take the calculated risk. He craved hurting her the way an alcoholic craved a drink of whiskey. The need wouldn\u2019t leave him alone, and he knew he would take any risk to get even.</p><p>He slowly removed his jacket, carefully folded it to double thickness, wrapped his hand inside the material, and then, imagining the glass was Laurant\u2019s face, he slammed his fist through the window, exerting far more force than was necessary. The glass imploded, shattering fragments into the back hallway.</p><p>The rush of adrenaline felt like an orgasm, and he almost shouted God\u2019s name in vain just for the sheer thrill of it. He suddenly felt powerful and invincible. No one would touch him. No one.</p><p>He certainly wasn\u2019t concerned about being heard, for he was sure the house was empty. Nick and Laurant had been picked up by her brother and another priest and had gone to the rehearsal dinner. He\u2019d watched them leave before he\u2019d gone back home to wait and then get ready. It was just after eleven now, and they wouldn\u2019t be back until well after midnight. Plenty of time, he thought, to do what he wanted and get out.</p> <p>He reached in, unlocked the dead bolt, opened the door, and came inside. He had to resist the urge to whistle.</p><p>The silent alarm began to flash the second the door opened, but Nick already knew someone was inside the house. He and Laurant had returned home earlier than expected, and he had taken the watch while Joe caught up on his sleep. Nick was upstairs on the landing and had just started down the steps when he heard the sound of glass breaking. The noise was distant but unmistakable.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. Drawing his gun, he flipped the safety off and headed for the guest room to alert Joe. He was reaching for the doorknob when the door opened and Joe stepped out, his Glock already in his hand, the barrel pointed to the ceiling. He nodded to Nick to let him know he was ready, then faded back into the darkness of the room, leaving the door wide open. Nick pointed to the flashing alarm, and Joe quickly unplugged it.</p><p>Without making a sound, Nick turned and hurried into Laurant\u2019s room. He quietly closed the door behind him. She was sound asleep on her back, her hands at her sides, an open Frank McCourt memoir resting on her chest. He went to the side of the bed, squatted down next to her, and put his hand over her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t make any noise when she woke up.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, wake up. We\u2019ve got company.\u201d His hushed voice was calm.</p><p>She woke up trying to scream. Her eyes flew open, and she tried to focus as she instinctively shoved his hand away. Then she realized it was Nick touching her. His words registered at the same time that she saw the gun.</p><p>\u201cI need you to be real quiet,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded. She understood. Nick pulled his hand back and she pushed the sheets aside as she bolted upright. The forgotten book went flying and would have struck the hardwood floor had Nick not grabbed it in midair. He put it down on the bed, reached up to switch off the reading lamp, then took her hand and gently pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Her heart was pounding frantically, and she had trouble catching her breath. The room was so dark they had to feel their way along the wall. Nick led her into the bathroom, and she was reaching for the light switch when his hand covered hers.</p><p>\u201cNo lights,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He stepped back into the bedroom and quietly pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She wanted to beg him to stay with her, but she knew he wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>It was pitch black inside, and she was afraid to move for fear she would accidentally knock something over and let the intruder know the household was awake. Head bowed, she folded her arms across her stomach and stood frozen while her mind raced. How could she help? What could she do that wouldn\u2019t be a hindrance?</p><p>She was terrified for Nick. The unexpected could trip up even the most experienced man. Everyone had a vulnerable point, and Nick was no exception. If anything happened to him, she didn\u2019t know what she would do. Please God, keep him safe.</p><p>It was deadly quiet. She pressed her ear against the door and strained to hear any little sound. She stood that way for over a minute\ufffd\ufffdit seemed like an eternity to her\u2014and still nothing but the sound of her heart pounding in her ears.</p><p>Then she heard it. A scratching noise, like a branch scraping across a window, but the sound wasn\u2019t coming from inside the house. It was above her. The roof. My God, was the intruder on the roof? No, no, he was already inside downstairs. She tried then to convince herself that the noise she had just heard had simply been a branch swaying in the wind.</p><p>She strained to listen. She heard the sound again. It was closer now to where she stood, and it didn\u2019t sound like a scraping noise at all this time. Now it sounded like an animal, a raccoon or a squirrel, she thought, scurrying across the roof ledge outside the bathroom window.</p><p>Was the window locked? Yes, of course it was. Nick would have seen to that. Calm down. Don\u2019t let your imagination run wild.</p><p>She stared at the window. It was above the bathtub, but it was too dark to see if the lock was latched. She needed to check it. If she moved slowly and carefully, she wouldn\u2019t make any noise. She was beginning to inch away from the door when she saw a red, pencil-point beam of light shine through the windowpane. It danced across the vanity mirror, closing in on her. Searching . . . looking for a target.</p><p>She dropped to her knees, then to her stomach, and edged over to the bathtub. She pressed the length of her body against the cool porcelain, her eyes glued to the red beam. Too late, she realized she should have gotten out of the bathroom when she had had the chance. The beam would catch her if she moved now. It was bouncing along the door, back and forth, back and forth. My God, if Nick opened the door and tried to come inside, whoever was on the ledge would have him clearly in his sights.</p><p>Calm down. Think. How could he have gotten on the roof without being seen? Nick had told her that there were agents watching the house night and day, but there was a treed lot next to her bedroom and bath, and another empty lot behind her backyard. It would be easy to climb up one of the hundred-year-old trees and make his way from the treetops to her roof. Easy, she thought.</p><p>But without being seen? It would be daring, tricky, but it could be done. Don\u2019t panic. Wait. Maybe it was one of the FBI agents on the roof. Yes, that could be it. He could be covering the bathroom window to make certain the madman didn\u2019t try to escape. All the windows were probably being covered by the FBI now.</p><p>As desperate as she was to believe that was true, she wasn\u2019t about to stand up to test her theory.</p><p>The beam was moving again, back to the mirror. Laurant seized the opportunity, thanking God there wasn\u2019t a moon tonight. The darkness was a blessing. She scrambled to her knees to get the door open, then crawled into the bedroom, scraping her knee on the metal threshold.</p><p>She never took her eyes off the beam. She could see it closing in on her as she swung the door shut. Grimacing over the faint click the lock made, she leaned back against the wall and tried to catch her breath.</p><p>She would be able to hear the window opening. It was old and warped, and it would make a lot of noise if it were pried up. And so she sat there listening, waiting, every muscle in her body tense in anticipation, ready to spring.</p><p>Nick heard the faint rustle as she crawled out of the bathroom. What the hell was she doing? Why hadn\u2019t she stayed inside?</p><p>He stood, pressed against the wall adjacent to the bedroom door and quietly pulled it open a crack. He could see out into the hallway that was faintly lit by the night-light on the chest at the far end of the wide landing. He waited for the intruder to either pass Laurant\u2019s door or come inside.</p><p>He could hear him creeping up the steps. He knew when his foot struck the fifth stair. It creaked. If he\u2019d been inside the house the number of times Nick thought he had, he would have remembered the noise the step made and avoided it. Was Nick giving him too much credit? No, he didn\u2019t think so. This man was careful. He was a planner, every bit of information they had on him indicated as much. And he was organized. Methodical too. Yet, he hadn\u2019t been quiet when he\u2019d broken into the house, and his method had been crude, not sophisticated. A tiger doesn\u2019t change his stripes. There were instances where an organized killer became disorganized, like Bundy and Donner, but it took time for them to disintegrate, get sloppy. This unsub was exhibiting a radical change.</p><p>The back door opened and then slammed shut. Whoever was coming up the stairs went running back down. Nick heard quick footsteps on the first floor, then harsh whispers. There were two of them in the house now. What the hell? That didn\u2019t make any sense at all. Everything they knew about the unsub pointed to a loner.</p><p>Until now. No, this was all wrong. The two intruders were arguing, but their voices were muffled whispers, and Nick couldn\u2019t catch any of what they were saying. They were by the front door, but only one of them rushed up the stairs. Nick could hear the other one moving around below. Then a crash, maybe a vase, Nick thought, followed by a shredding noise, like material being ripped apart. The son of a bitch was either looking for something or trashing Laurant\u2019s house.</p><p>The adrenaline was pouring through his veins now, and he couldn\u2019t wait to get his hands on both of them.</p><p>The other intruder was on the landing now. He had a penlight. First the beam, then the shadow crossed the threshold of Laurant\u2019s bedroom. He continued on to the hall linen closet. He was going for the camera, Nick decided. He was either going to remove it or turn it back on.</p><p>Joe flipped on the hall light as Nick swiftly moved into the hall to block any retreat.</p><p>\u201cFreeze,\u201d Joe ordered, his gun trained on the suspect.</p><p>Steve Brenner yanked his hand back from the closet ceiling and shielded his eyes from the blinding light. \u201cWhat the . . . ,\u201d he shouted as he turned and tried to charge past Nick.</p><p>Nick clipped him on the side of his head with the butt of his gun. Stunned by the blow, Brenner reeled back, then attacked, his fists flailing like a drowning man. Nick easily dodged the assault, then threw an uppercut to his nose and heard the crunch of bone. Blood spurted as Brenner, screaming in pain, staggered back and went down on his knees. Both his hands cupped his nose as he began to shout obscenities.</p><p>\u201cYou got him?\u201d Nick shouted as he turned and raced toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on him,\u201d Joe yelled back. He shoved Brenner to the floor on his stomach, then held him there with his knees pressed into his spine. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick took the flight of stairs in two leaps. He swung over the banister, dropped to the floor in the front hallway, and raced on. The caustic smell of gasoline was heavy in the air, and by the time he was halfway across the living room, his eyes were tearing. He saw the gallon can of gasoline on the floor near the dining room table and Laurant\u2019s pink bridesmaid dress in a heap next to the overturned can. The gown had been shredded into a wad and was soaked. Nick muttered an expletive as he ran on.</p><p>He caught a fleeting glimpse of Lonnie\u2019s profile as he turned the corner into the kitchen. He didn\u2019t see the matches though.</p><p>Lonnie struck one match in the back hallway, then lit the rest and threw the flaming pack behind him into the kitchen. Frantic to get away before he was caught, he clawed at the doorknob, but his hands were sticky with gasoline. On the third try he got the door open. He ran outside, tripped on the back step, and went flying into the yard. Scrambling to his feet he ran into the back lot, hooting with laughter because he knew he\u2019d trapped Nick inside, and he had gotten away scot-free.</p><p>The floor was slick with gasoline, and the fire was instantaneous as the match flames ignited the fuel with a loud, greedy swoosh. The breeze coming in through the open back door whipped the fiery wall into a frenzy, and within bare seconds, the kitchen was a raging inferno. Nick stumbled back into the dining room. He tried to shield his eyes with the back of his arm as he regained his balance, but the heat was so intense he couldn\u2019t go forward. The fire was loud, almost deafening. Popping, crackling, hissing. The kitchen floor had turned into liquid fire, moving like a ferocious wave toward the dining room, drowning everything in its path.</p><p>\u201cLaurant!\u201d Nick shouted her name as he raced back through the living room. He thought he heard the squeal of tires out front and he stopped at the front door long enough to unlock the dead bolt, but he didn\u2019t open the door because he knew the fresh air would only feed the fire.</p><p>Joe had handcuffed Brenner and was trying to get him to his feet, but his prisoner was fighting him every inch of the way.</p><p>\u201cGet him out through the front door, but hurry. The fire\u2019s out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch,\u201d Brenner screamed. \u201cThat miserable little piece of shit. I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe pulled Brenner to his feet and shoved him ahead of him down the stairs.</p><p>Nick burst into Laurant\u2019s room. She had already put on jeans and loafers and was pulling a T-shirt down over her midriff.</p><p>She\u2019d packed too. He couldn\u2019t believe it. The empty overnight bag she\u2019d left on the floor by the closet door was now on her bed and stuffed full. The bathroom door was wide open, and he could see that the counter had been swept clean.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He had to shout to be heard over Brenner\u2019s screams. \u201cLeave it,\u201d he ordered when he saw her reach for the bag. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring his order, she grabbed the bag and slung the strap over her left shoulder. Then she noticed he was barefoot. She grabbed his loafers and shoved them in the bag on top of the photo album.</p><p>Nick flipped the safety on his gun and slipped it into his holster. That gave her two more seconds to grab his wallet, the car keys, and her purse from the top of the dresser. She was shoving them into the side pocket of the bag when Nick grabbed her. He pulled her tight into his side and half carried her along the hallway and down the stairs. She had a death grip on the strap, and she could hear the bag banging on the steps behind her.</p><p>Black smoke rolled up the stairs to meet them. Nick shoved her head down against his chest and continued on.</p><p>She heard an unearthly sound behind her, like a dragon wheezing, and then a crackling roar followed. The air conditioner in the dining room window crashed to the floor and exploded. The force was so great the walls shook, and the hardwood shivered beneath her feet. The living room window shattered then, and shards of glass the size of butcher knives shot out onto the porch. The fire hissed and then roared again as it fed on the gust of wind that rushed inside the open doorway.</p><p>They made it outside just in the nick of time. Another few seconds and they would have had to climb out one of the bedroom windows. The fire chased them outside, the flames licking at their heels. They stumbled down the steps and onto the front walk, coughing from the inhaled smoke.</p> <p>She squeezed her eyes shut to try to get rid of the stinging. Nick recovered much quicker than she did. He spotted Wesson leaping out of his car and running toward Joe and Brenner. The agent and his prisoner were standing in the empty lot beside Laurant\u2019s house. Feinberg was still in the car, the motor running.</p><p>How had the agents gotten here so soon, Nick wondered. First things first, he thought. He squeezed Laurant. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, his voice hoarse from coughing.</p><p>She leaned into him, thankful for his strength. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked around her in a daze. The entire neighborhood was waking up. Families up and down the street began to spill out of their houses onto their front porches and lawns to watch the fire. She could hear the sirens wailing in the distance. She saw Bessie Jean and Viola standing by the big old oak in their front yard where they had kept Daddy chained. Both ladies were dressed in heavy, fuzzy robes, one pink, the other white, that made them look like giant bunny rabbits. Bessie Jean, her hair in pin curls, was wearing an old-fashioned hairnet, the knot she\u2019d tied in the netting hanging down on her forehead. Viola was dabbing at her eyes with her lacy handkerchief and shaking her head as she watched the fire.</p><p>Laurant turned back and saw the flames shooting through the roof over her living room. It had been a near miss, she realized then. But Nick was all right, and so was she, without a blister between them.</p> <p>She watched the fire and thanked God no one had been hurt. Suddenly, the fog lifted and the truth settled. She began to shake.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got him. It\u2019s over Nick. The nightmare\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her bag and threw her arms around him. He held her close. Then he heard her whisper, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to celebrate just yet. Let\u2019s take this a step at a time.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. When I heard him shouting at you in the hallway, I recognized his voice and I knew it was Steve, but I just couldn\u2019t put it together in my mind. I was so shocked.\u201d She took a deep breath and tried to be more coherent. \u201cYou told me he was a suspect, and you were right all along.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop trembling. Impatiently wiping the tears away with the back of her hands, she remembered the man on the roof. \u201cThere were two of them,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, two,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cThe other man was Lonnie. He started the fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLonnie?\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she was stunned to know the sheriff \u2019s son had been involved. Brenner had obviously been the brains. He had been the one to plan the nightmare from start to finish.</p><p>Nick was looking around for Lonnie. Where the hell was he? He should have been cuffed by now with at least one agent on him.</p><p>Willie and Justin came running across the street to help. Justin immediately went to Bessie Jean\u2019s yard to turn on her garden hose to try to contain the fire. It was pitifully inadequate.</p><p>Nick pulled Laurant toward Wesson. The agent was talking on his phone.</p><p>\u201cI got him, sir. I certainly did, and as soon as I get the warrant, I\u2019m positive I\u2019m going to find more evidence to nail him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got him?\u201d She repeated Wesson\u2019s boast to Nick.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard what he said.\u201d</p><p>Joe had obviously also heard. He was glaring at Wesson, letting him see his hostility. The agent in charge ignored him and continued to speak into his slick, palm-size phone. Wesson could barely contain his enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cBy the book, sir. That\u2019s how I got him. And for the record, instinct didn\u2019t have anything to do with the apprehension. It was careful planning and following through. No, sir, that wasn\u2019t a criticism of your methods. I\u2019m simply telling you that it was hard work and not anything else.\u201d</p><p>The fire truck barreled down the street, the siren blaring. Feinberg moved his car out of the way of the fire hydrant and parked it in front of Bessie Jean\u2019s house, then got out and ran over to Joe. Like everyone else, he watched the blaze.</p><p>Volunteer firemen wearing yellow slickers and hats jumped from the truck and raced to hook up the hoses. The driver turned off the siren and then shouted, \u201cIs everyone out of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s out,\u201d Joe shouted back.</p><p>Nick was seething inside. He swore that if Wesson didn\u2019t get off the damn phone in the next five seconds, he was going to rip it out of his hand and beat the hell out of him if that was what it would take to get some answers. Where was Lonnie? And where were the agents who were supposed to be watching the house?</p><p>\u201cLaurant, I want you to get in the car and stay there. I\u2019ll move it onto the street,\u201d he said as he grabbed her hand and pulled her along.</p><p>She could hear the anger radiating in his voice. He was still acting as though he was supposed to protect her and she couldn\u2019t understand why. They had caught Brenner, and they knew who his accomplice was.</p><p>\u201cNick, it\u2019s over.\u201d Maybe it hadn\u2019t sunk in yet. Yes, that was it, she thought. \u201cYou did it. You and Joe got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later,\u201d he said curtly as he reached down and picked up the bag.</p><p>When they reached the car, he muttered, \u201cAh, hell, the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got them.\u201d</p><p>He held the bag while she dug until she found them. Her hands were shaking so much she couldn\u2019t get the key in the lock.</p><p>Nick took the keys from her, unlocked the car door, and tossed the bag into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Laurant, how come that guy\u2019s handcuffed?\u201d Willie asked.</p><p>Justin jogged over from the Vandermans\u2019 yard. He too was curious to hear the details.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Steve Brenner?\u201d Justin asked. \u201cHe\u2019s a big shot in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how come he\u2019s cuffed? What\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe broke into my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet inside the car, Laurant,\u201d Nick said. He took hold of her elbow to get her moving, but she turned back when Brenner started screaming.</p><p>\u201cTake these handcuffs off me. You can\u2019t hold me. I haven\u2019t done anything illegal. I own that house, and if I want to put a camera inside, you can\u2019t stop me. I signed the papers two weeks ago. It\u2019s my house, and I\u2019ve got the right to know what goes on in there.\u201d</p><p>Joe had used up all his patience. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got is the right to remain silent. Now shut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>Justin\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHe put a camera in your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he put it?\u201d Willie asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She sagged against Nick\u2019s side. Her eyes were fixed on Brenner. He turned, saw her watching him, and sneered. There was dried blood caked on his perfectly capped teeth and more smeared on his lips. He was a reptile.</p><p>Brenner couldn\u2019t control his fury. He blamed everyone but himself for getting caught. If the bitch hadn\u2019t brought the FBI boyfriend home, he wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament. Most of all he blamed Laurant. Joe grabbed him when he lunged toward her. Brenner tried to shove himself free while he shouted profanities at her. All his plans were ruined. Damn her.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d he shouted. \u201cThis is my house now. I paid that old lady a lot of money and you know what? There isn\u2019t a damned thing you can do about it. When I\u2019m finished suing everybody, I\u2019m going to own the FBI. I have rights,\u201d he added in a roar. And then, hoping to humiliate her, he added, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you undress almost every night. I\u2019ve seen everything you\u2019ve got to offer.\u201d</p><p>She saw the evil radiating like hot coals in his eyes, and she didn\u2019t have any doubt at all that he had killed those women. Brenner was clearly demented.</p><p>\u201cJoe, put a gag in his mouth,\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>\u201cGet her away from here,\u201d Wesson ordered.</p><p>The profanities Brenner hurled at her didn\u2019t shake her as Nick led her back to the car. Some of the women in the crowd weren\u2019t so indifferent, however. One mother cupped her hands over her son\u2019s ears. Her neighbors might be shocked by Brenner\u2019s conduct now, but when they learned the truth about the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde living in their midst, they were going to be sickened.</p><p>Nick got her inside the car, then backed into the street and parked it behind Feinberg\u2019s vehicle.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. I want you to stay in the car with the windows up and the doors locked.\u201d He flipped on the air conditioner so she wouldn\u2019t swelter.</p><p>\u201cI want to get out of here. Could we please leave now?\u201d</p><p>She sounded close to tears. \u201cIn just a minute,\u201d he promised.\u201cOkay? I\u2019ve got to talk to Wesson.\u201d</p><p>She woodenly nodded. \u201cYes, all right.\u201d</p><p>She watched him sprint across the yard, then she turned to look at the house. The fire seemed to have been contained, and she thought it was odd that she didn\u2019t feel much emotion at all while she surveyed the destruction. It had been her home, but now that Brenner owned it, she never wanted to go inside again.</p><p>The flashing lights, the noise of the crowd, Brenner\u2019s screams\u2014it was all too much. She put her hand to her forehead and slumped down in her seat. And then she began to cry for the two women Brenner had murdered.</p><p>They could rest in peace now. The monster couldn\u2019t hurt anyone else.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>The sheriff was the last to arrive at the scene. His Ford Explorer rounded the corner on two wheels. Swerving to avoid hitting Little Lorna, the car skidded to a stop.</p><p>Lloyd left his SUV in the middle of the street. Grunting as he eased his bulk out from under the steering wheel, he got out of the car and stood there with his hands on his hips, surveying the crowd. He tried to look important. Frowning so that anyone who might be watching him would know he considered this situation a serious matter, he hiked his pants up with his belt, straightened his shoulders, and strutted into Laurant\u2019s front yard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cThe house is on fire.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd scowled at Joe to let him know he didn\u2019t appreciate his sarcasm. Then he noticed Brenner\u2019s hands were behind his back and there was blood all over his face. Leaning to the side, he saw the handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cHey, now, what\u2019s Steve wearing those cuffs for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreaking the law,\u201d Joe replied.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Brenner ranted. \u201cLloyd, I didn\u2019t do anything illegal. Make them take these damn cuffs off me. They\u2019re chafing my wrists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn due course,\u201d Lloyd assured him. Then his eagle-eyed gaze homed in on Joe, and he took a threatening step toward him. \u201cAren\u2019t you that fella who was fixing Lauren\u2019s sink? What are you doing here? Did you strike this citizen? His nose looks to be broken. Now I\u2019m asking you straight out, boy, and I want a straight answer. Did you hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit him,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI should have shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you be a smart mouth, boy. This here is a serious matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Nick agreed. \u201cAnd if you call me boy one more time, I\u2019m going to handcuff you. Got that, Lloyd?\u201d</p><p>Lloyd nervously took a step back to put some distance between him and Nick, and acted like he was contemplating the situation. In reality, the sheriff was getting the feeling that he was in over his head, but he knew that Brenner would kill him if he didn\u2019t get him out of this mess. He warily looked up at Nick. The FBI agent reminded him of a mountain lion, relaxed one second, and sinking his teeth into his prey the next.</p><p>\u201cLloyd, do something,\u201d Brenner demanded. \u201cHe broke my nose. I want him arrested.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd nodded and forced himself to look Nick in the eyes. The frost there gave him a chill. He was proud of himself for resisting the urge to look away. \u201cThat\u2019s battery, hitting a citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I can arrest an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s answer was immediate. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Brenner muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that,\u201d Lloyd blustered. \u201cSteve\u2019s got to get to the hospital and get that nose fixed, and I\u2019m going to take him there. I\u2019m in charge, \u2019cause this here is my jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked at Nick before answering. \u201cThis here is my prisoner, and you aren\u2019t touching him.\u201d</p><p>Nick moved to stand beside Joe, a show of unity against the sheriff, but also he wanted to be able to keep his eye on Laurant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay now, what are you wearing a gun for?\u201d Lloyd asked Joe, seeing for the first time the weapon and holster attached to his belt. \u201cYou got yourself a permit for that thing?\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled. \u201cI sure do. I\u2019ve got a badge too. Want to see it? I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s bigger than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being a smart-ass, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s FBI,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>Lloyd was losing ground fast and needed to find at least one area over which he could take control.</p><p>\u201cAre you responsible for this here fire?\u201d he asked Nick.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t think the question merited an answer. He shoved his hands in his pockets to keep himself from grabbing the sheriff by the neck.</p><p>Lorna was standing about five feet away from the two men, taking furious notes on a Big Chief tablet. She took a tentative step toward Nick, saw the look in his eyes, and backed away.</p><p>Joe motioned for Wesson to join them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to arrest Steve for?\u201d the sheriff demanded. \u201cBurning down his own house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been arrested,\u201d Joe informed him.</p><p>\u201cOn what charges?\u201d Lloyd asked.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d Wesson called out as he came running over.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Lloyd asked.</p><p>\u201cSenior officer in charge,\u201d Wesson responded.</p> <p>Joe grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s FBI too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of you fellas are there in Holy Oaks? And what are you doing here anyway? This is my town,\u201d he stressed. \u201cAnd you all should have come directly to me if you knew about a problem here.\u201d</p><p>A heated exchange followed. Lloyd kept insisting that he was taking Brenner with him, but there was no way that Wesson was going to let that happen. He also wasn\u2019t going to tell the sheriff what the charges were, despite Lloyd\u2019s protests that Wesson\u2019s secrecy was plain unconstitutional.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestigation of what?\u201d</p><p>Nick was seething, but his anger was fully directed on Wesson. He wasn\u2019t going to wait much longer to get some answers, and if that meant having an argument in a public forum, then that\u2019s the way it was going to go down.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d Joe whispered. \u201cThe two of them are in a pissing contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, they can figure out who\u2019s the bigger man later. Hey, Sheriff, where\u2019s your son?\u201d</p> <p>The question distracted Lloyd. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to arrest him.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd\u2019s bushy eyebrows shot up. \u201cThe hell you are. My boy hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d Making a wide sweep with his arm he added, \u201cYou can see for yourself, he ain\u2019t even here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Lloyd dragged the word out. \u201cI\u2019m saying he wasn\u2019t here, and I\u2019m not gonna let you pin this on my boy. He was home with me all evening. We watched wrestling together on the television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have seen him \u2019cause, like I just told you, he was home all evening with me.\u201d</p><p>Nick addressed Wesson. \u201cI want a word in private with you. Now.\u201d</p><p>He saw Lorna start toward them and turned around and walked toward the empty lot, away from prying ears. Wesson looked perturbed but followed Nick.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Anger punctuated Nick\u2019s words. \u201cWhere the hell were the agents you told me you assigned to watch the house? If they were here, then how come Lonnie got past them? The kid went out the back door.\u201d</p><p>Wesson\u2019s lips formed a thin line of disapproval. He didn\u2019t like anyone questioning his decisions.</p><p>\u201cThey left yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were given new assignments.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Nick\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cWho gave the order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Feinberg and Farley were sufficient backup. I felt that was all the manpower I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think it was necessary to inform Noah or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Wesson answered very matter-of-factly. \u201cYou volunteered to be Laurant\u2019s bodyguard, and you\u2019re the one who brought in Noah to guard her brother. Frankly, if you hadn\u2019t gotten Morganstern\u2019s approval, you wouldn\u2019t even be on this case. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have approved it. You\u2019re too personally involved, but because you\u2019re one of Morganstern\u2019s golden boys, he bent the rules and let you in. I don\u2019t bend the rules,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want or need your input. Have I made myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are a son of a bitch. You know that, Wesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour insubordination is definitely going to be reported, agent.\u201d</p><p>The threat didn\u2019t faze Nick. \u201cBe sure to spell it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off the case.\u201d</p><p>Nick exploded. \u201cYou put Laurant in jeopardy by trying to make this a one-man show. That\u2019s what\u2019s going in my report.\u201d</p><p>Wesson was determined not to let Nick know how furious he was. \u201cI did no such thing,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cWhen you have had time to calm down, you\u2019ll realize that I didn\u2019t need a dozen agents running around town, sticking out like sore thumbs. It\u2019s the bottom line that counts. I got the unsub and that\u2019s all the boss is going to care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough evidence to prove Brenner\u2019s the unsub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLook at the facts. Not everything has to be as complicated as you think it should be. Brenner was out of town and cannot account for his whereabouts. He had plenty of time to get to Kansas City, threaten the priest, and get back to Holy Oaks. He was careful about filing off the serial number on the camera, but he admitted he placed it in her house, and the only reason he went there tonight was because he thought you and Laurant were at the party. He\u2019s been careful, but he made a mistake. They all do,\u201d he added sagely. \u201cWe also know from witnesses that he was obsessed with Laurant and that he had plans to marry her. We can make a strong case that he snapped when she spurned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat witnesses?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cSeveral people in town I\u2019ve already gotten statements from. Brenner\u2019s always been the primary suspect. You knew that. One of my agents is on his way back from the judge now with a warrant, and when he gets here, I\u2019m personally going to go through Brenner\u2019s house. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to find more evidence to convict him. By the book,\u201d he added smugly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too pat, Wesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d he countered. \u201cIt was solid investigative work that nailed Brenner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting your ego cloud your judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd that he decided to bring another man in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re referring to Lonnie, and the answer is no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd or out of character. Brenner simply took advantage of an opportunity. He probably figured he could pin the crime on the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about Lonnie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let the local authorities take care of him.\u201d</p><p>Nick gritted his teeth. \u201cThe local authority happens to be his father.\u201d</p><p>Wesson didn\u2019t want to be bothered with that detail. Tying up all the loose ends was a job for the underlings. \u201cIf everything goes according to schedule, Feinberg and I will be pulling out of here by tomorrow night at the latest. Farley\u2019s leaving now,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t see any reason for you or Noah to hang around. I meant it when I said you were off the case.\u201d</p><p>Without a word or a backward glance, Nick walked away from the complacent bastard. Wesson was in his glory, and Nick knew he wasn\u2019t going to listen to anything he had to say. Brenner was the unsub. Case closed.</p><p>When Nick got into the car, Laurant took one look as his face and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m officially off the case. Not that I was ever really on it,\u201d he added derisively. \u201cWesson\u2019s convinced that Brenner\u2019s our guy. He\u2019s waiting for a warrant so he can go through his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Wesson was waving at him, trying to get his attention, but Nick ignored him and started the car.</p><p>\u201cNick, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s Brenner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have any concrete reasons, but my gut\u2019s telling me he isn\u2019t the unsub. It\u2019s too easy. Maybe Wesson\u2019s right. Maybe I\u2019m trying to make this more complicated than it really is. He\u2019s kept Noah and me in the dark, so I don\u2019t know what evidence they\u2019ve got that convinces them. Hell, let\u2019s get out of here. I\u2019ve got to get some distance so I can think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vandermans offered us their extra bedroom, and Willie and Justin also offered us beds. I told them we were going to sleep at the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled out into the street. \u201cDo you want to go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s get the hell out of Dodge.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>They headed north into lake country. As soon as they left town, Nick called Noah to tell him what had happened. He suggested that he wait until the morning to tell Tommy.</p><p>\u201cBe sure to stress that Laurant is okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>As soon as he disconnected the call, Laurant asked, \u201cWhat about the house? I saw you talking to the fire chief. Is everything gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cThe south side of the house is trashed, but the upstairs on the north side is still intact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the closets are okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried about your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some of my paintings stored in the guest closet. It\u2019s okay,\u201d she hurried to add. \u201cThey aren\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know they aren\u2019t good? Have you ever let anyone see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, painting is just a hobby,\u201d she answered.</p><p>She sounded so defensive, he decided to drop the subject. Their clothes smelled like smoke, and so he rolled his window down and let the breeze clear the air.</p><p>He stayed on the main two-lane highway for over an hour. Finding lodging wasn\u2019t a problem. There were billboards crowded together near every crossroad advertising seasonal rates. He finally turned onto a tributary leading to the west and chose a strip motel located two miles from Lake Henry. The garish purple and orange neon sign was still flashing vacancy, but the office was dark. Nick woke the manager, paid for the room in cash, and to the old man\u2019s delight, purchased two extra-large, red T-shirts sporting a white wide-mouth bass on the front and the name of the motel in bold white block letters on the back.</p><p>There were twelve units and twelve vacancies. Nick chose the end unit and parked the car behind the motel so that it wouldn\u2019t be seen from the road.</p><p>The room was sparse but clean. The floor was gray and white linoleum squares; the walls were cement blocks painted gray, and there were two double beds against the far wall with a wobbly, three-legged nightstand in between. The shade on the chipped ceramic lamp was torn and had been patched with duct tape.</p><p>It was well after two in the morning, and both of them were exhausted. Laurant dumped the contents of the overnight bag on the bed and then gathered up their toiletries and put them on the shelf in the bathroom. She took her shower first, and when she was finished, she washed out her lacy underwear and hung the bra and panties on a plastic hanger to dry. She didn\u2019t know what to do about her jeans and T-shirt. If she tried to use the bar of soap to wash them it would take forever, and she knew they wouldn\u2019t be dry by morning. She was going to have to wear them again, but maybe they could find a Wal-Mart or Target on their way back to Holy Oaks, and she could buy clean clothing and change. There certainly weren\u2019t any department stores this far north.</p><p>She put the concern aside and dried her hair with the blow dryer the owner had chained to the wall next to the mirror.</p><p>When she came out of the bathroom wearing the new T-shirt with the giant bass covering her chest, Nick smiled, the first bit of emotion he\u2019d shown since they\u2019d left town.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, babe.\u201d</p><p>She tugged the T-shirt down to her knees. \u201cI look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He grinned again. \u201cThat too,\u201d he admitted as he headed for the bathroom. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got the charger for my phone. I\u2019m damn glad you did though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on the nightstand next to my glasses. I just grabbed everything I could get my hands on. I\u2019ll tell you, it was scary going back into that bathroom, and I just threw things in the bag.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the covers back and got into one of the double beds. Nick left the bathroom door open while he showered. The clear plastic shower curtain didn\u2019t conceal much, but she tried not to stare. She only put on her glasses so she could write a shopping list. Of course, glancing into the bathroom every now and then was just natural curiosity on her part, that was all. Liar, liar. If she\u2019d been wearing any pants, they\u2019d be on fire now.</p><p>Nick was built like a Greek god. He was turned away from her, so she could only see his backside. The muscles in his upper arms and thighs were incredibly well defined. She thought his body was just about perfect.</p><p>When she realized her behavior bordered on that of a voyeur\u2014and how disgusting was that\u2014she took her glasses off so she couldn\u2019t see anything if the temptation became too irresistible again. The man deserved a little privacy, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>She picked up the remote, smiling when she saw that it too was chained to the wall, and then turned on the television and squinted at the screen.</p><p>They were acting as though they\u2019d been married for years. At least Nick was. He seemed thoroughly relaxed with her and hadn\u2019t even given the double beds a second glance. He was taking their situation in stride.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. She was a nervous wreck inside, grossly uptight, as Tommy would say, but she was determined not to let it show. If Nick guessed anything was wrong, she was fully prepared to lie and tell him that it was the trauma tonight that had put her on edge. She couldn\u2019t tell him the truth because it would be a terrible burden for him, but she couldn\u2019t help but wonder how he would react if he knew what was going on inside her head.</p><p>Did he have any idea how she felt about him? What would he say if she told him she wanted him, and damn the consequences? One wonderful night together, and the memory could and would last her a lifetime. Not an affair or a fling, she qualified. Nick couldn\u2019t handle that, and neither could she. But one night and no regrets. Not ever. Oh, how she longed to have his arms around her. To have him hold her and caress her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t going to happen, though. Nick had been up front with her from the very beginning. He didn\u2019t want marriage or children, and because he knew she did, he would never touch her.</p><p>Even though she was certain a lasting relationship was out of the question, she still ached to touch him. She loved him, God help her. How had she allowed herself to be so vulnerable? She should have seen it coming and done something, anything, to protect herself. It was too late now. When he left her, he was going to break her heart, and there wasn\u2019t anything she could do about it.</p><p>Knowing the pain that lay ahead didn\u2019t change how she felt about him. One night, she told herself. That was all she would ever need, but she knew Nick wouldn\u2019t see it that way. He would see it as a betrayal of her brother, and yet she still considered all the arguments she could give him to try to sway him.</p><p>They were consenting adults. What happened between them wasn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business.</p> <p>Laurant knew what Nick\u2019s answer to that argument would be. She was Tommy\u2019s kid sister. End of story.</p><p>Laurant knew Nick cared about her. But did he love her? She was afraid to ask.</p><p>Nick came out of the bathroom wearing a pair of plaid boxer shorts. He was towel drying his hair but paused when he saw her frowning. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was just thinking . . .\u201d</p><p>He tossed the towel over a chair, then went to the side of the other bed and pulled back the covers as he asked, \u201cAbout tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what were you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. You don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. Tell me what you were thinking,\u201d he prodded as he stacked the pillows against the headboard and then reached over to turn the lamp off.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will. I was trying to figure out how to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>His hand was halfway to the lamp when he froze. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d blurted out the truth that way. But she certainly had grabbed his full attention. He stayed perfectly still, like a deer caught in the headlights, then slowly straightened and turned to stare at her.</p> <p>His expression was priceless. Had she not been mortified, she would have laughed. Nick looked dumbfounded. He was obviously waiting for some kind of a disclaimer or clarification, or maybe even a punch line, she supposed, but she honestly didn\u2019t know what to tell him, and so she lifted her shoulders in a shrug, as if to say, there it is, believe it or not, take me or leave me.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p><p>She slowly shook her head. \u201cHave I shocked you?\u201d</p><p>He took a step back, shaking his head. He\u2019d obviously decided not to believe her.</p><p>\u201cYou did ask me to tell you what I was thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>Her face was the color of the red T-shirt.</p> <p>\u201cNo reason to be,\u201d he stammered.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about what I just said?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. She pushed the covers aside and got out of bed. He quickly backed away from her. Before she could blink, he was halfway across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to attack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cNick . . .\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cStay right where you are, Laurant.\u201d He pointed his finger at her as he gave the order . . . or, rather, shouted it. And he kept backing away until he bumped into the television, which would have crashed to the floor had it not been bolted to the wall.</p><p>She was mortified. He was acting as though he was afraid of her. She certainly hadn\u2019t anticipated such a bizarre response. Disbelief maybe, even anger. But fear? Until this moment, she hadn\u2019t believed Nick was afraid of anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question. That\u2019s what\u2019s the matter with me. Now stop it, Laurant. Stop it right this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking crazy.\u201d</p><p>Too embarrassed to look him in the eyes, she bowed her head and stared at the floor tiles. It was too late to take the words back or pretend she hadn\u2019t said them, and so she decided to make everything a hundred times worse and tell him everything.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d she said, her voice whisper soft.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his protest. \u201cWhen you kiss me, I get this funny, tingling feeling in my stomach, and I don\u2019t want you to stop. I\u2019ve never felt that way before. I just thought you should know.\u201d She heard him groan but couldn\u2019t make herself look at him yet. \u201cAnd you know what\u2019s really odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him, desperate to get the declaration out before she lost her courage. \u201cI think I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She dared a quick look up to see how he was taking the announcement and wished to God she hadn\u2019t bothered. To his credit, he didn\u2019t look like he was afraid of her any longer. No, now he looked like he wanted to kill her. It wasn\u2019t what she would consider a step in the right direction.</p><p>She seemed driven to make it worse. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not falling in love with you. I do love you,\u201d she stubbornly insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhen the hell did that happen?\u201d he demanded. The anger in his voice stung like a whip. She flinched and blinked away the tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She sounded bewildered. \u201cIt just did. I certainly didn\u2019t plan it. You\u2019re all wrong for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle an affair. I want it all, marriage till death do us part, and I want babies. Lots of babies. You don\u2019t want any of that. I understand we don\u2019t have a future together, but I thought that if I could persuade you to make love to me just this one time, that it would be enough. It wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, stop shaking your head at me. Forget I mentioned it. And by the way, I find your reaction insulting. I thought that you felt . . . that you cared as much as I . . . oh, never mind. A simple \u2018no thank you\u2019 would have sufficed. You didn\u2019t need to let me know how appalled you are by the notion of sleeping with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Laurant, try to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand. You\u2019ve made your position perfectly clear. You don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d The question sounded like a threat.</p><p>She\u2019d die before she admitted it. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She wiped the tears from her face, but it didn\u2019t stem the tide. \u201cIt just looks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Laurant, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he begged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my allergies.\u201d A sob escaped. \u201cI need a tissue.\u201d</p><p>She tried to walk past him to the bathroom, but he reached for her and pulled her toward him. She collapsed against his chest and let the tears come. He wrapped her in his arms, kissed the top of her head, then her forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me, Laurant.\u201d He sounded like a drowning man desperate for help. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You don\u2019t love me. You\u2019ve been through hell and you\u2019re frightened, and your emotions are all mixed up now.\u201d</p><p>He knew what was happening to her. She was mistaking gratitude for love. Easy to do, given the circumstances. Yes, that was it. She couldn\u2019t love him. She was too good for him, too sweet, too perfect. And he didn\u2019t deserve her. He had to stop this now, before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s in my heart, Nick. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that.\u201d</p><p>He sounded angry, but he was kissing her fervently at the same time, and he was being so very gentle. She didn\u2019t know how to interpret the mixed signals. She couldn\u2019t stop holding him, touching him.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, please stop crying. It\u2019s making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy allergies are acting up,\u201d she cried against his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have allergies,\u201d he whispered as he brushed his lips against her neck. He loved her scent. She smelled like flowers and soap and woman.</p><p>He was lost and he knew it. He cupped the sides of her face with his hands and gently kissed the tears away. \u201cYou are so lovely,\u201d he whispered, and his mouth covered hers, demanding and urgent now, unrelenting, his tongue stroking hers. He began to tremble like a young man experiencing his first attempt at lovemaking. Only this wasn\u2019t awkward. It was perfect.</p><p>God, how he wanted this. And yet there was still a part of him that tried to pretend he was merely offering her comfort. Until his hands slid up under her T-shirt and he was caressing warm, silky skin. The hell with comfort. He wanted her with a burning intensity that shook him to the core and scared the hell out of him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop stroking her. She felt so good against him, so soft, so right. He was pulling her T-shirt over her head and trying to kiss her at the same time, even as he told her that they couldn\u2019t do anything they would regret in the morning light.</p><p>She frantically agreed as she tugged on the snap of his shorts, and then pushed them down. Her hands slid back up his thighs and began to caress him intimately.</p><p>Her fingers were magical, the feather light touch against his groin exquisite torture. He was hard and throbbing, and when he knew he wouldn\u2019t last another minute if she kept stroking him, he grabbed her hands and lifted them up around his neck. Then he roughly pressed against her, and the feel of her soft full br**sts against him was damn near his undoing. Velvety skin rubbed against his as he tried to devour her with his mouth.</p><p>He pulled away from her. \u201cWait, I\u2019ve got to protect you,\u201d he whispered and then went into the bathroom to get what he needed from his shaving kit. He returned and paused for a moment. \u201cLaurant, I . . .\u201d Any second thoughts he may have had vanished when she wrapped her arms around him and kissed him.</p><p>They fell into bed together, all legs and arms. He shifted positions so that he lay on top of her, nudging her thighs apart so he could rest between them. He lifted his head and looked at her swollen lips and was suddenly overwhelmed by her beauty.</p><p>His hand cupped one breast, his fingers slowly circling the hard nipple. She let out a little gasp and closed her eyes, letting him know she liked that, and so he did it again and again as he watched her aroused response.</p><p>He was determined to slow the tempo, to give her as much pleasure as he could before he surrendered.</p><p>\u201cI have wanted you for the longest time,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFrom the moment I saw you, I wanted those long legs of yours around me. It\u2019s all I could think about.\u201d</p><p>His face was dark with passion, and his blue eyes glittered dangerously. She gently trailed her fingertips down the line of his hard jaw, then his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou know what else I\u2019ve wanted?\u201d</p><p>And then he showed her with his hands and his mouth what he had been thinking about. He knew where to touch, how much pressure to exert, when to withdraw. She moved restlessly against him, her caresses soon becoming more and more demanding, until her nails were biting into his shoulders and she was begging him to end his teasing.</p><p>His mouth was driving her crazy while his hands slid down the sides of her body. His fingers stroked her inner thighs, so soft, so sensitive. He felt her arch against him and heard her gasp as his knuckles deliberately brushed against the swirling dark curls between her thighs. He loved the sexy sound she made when he touched her so intimately.</p><p>He made love to her, telling her without words how he adored her.</p><p>Laurant had never experienced bliss like this. Such exquisite sensations coursed through her. She arched up against him again, far more demanding now.</p><p>\u201cNow, Nick . . . please. Oh, God, now . . .\u201d</p><p>He thrust into her forcefully, unable to quell the groan of sheer satisfaction as he became part of her, and when she wrapped her legs around him, he groaned again. Reality was much better than fantasy. She was better than anything he could have ever imagined. Fully imbedded inside her, his head dropped to the crook of her neck, and he took a deep, calming breath and tried to slow the pace. Nick was determined to make their lovemaking unforgettable.</p><p>He began to move slowly within her. \u201cDo you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d he whispered as his hand slid down between their joined bodies to stroke her. Her cry of ecstasy was all the encouragement he needed. Her arm curled around his neck, and she dragged him down for a long, hot kiss.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever stop,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He drove deep once again. She lifted her hips, straining against him to take as much of him inside her warmth as possible. She wanted to please him, but in the web of passion that he had created, there wasn\u2019t room for worry or for the fear of disappointing him.</p><p>Neither one of them could slow the pace, both frantic now to find release.</p><p>She came before he did and began to sob with the beauty of her surrender and the love she felt for him. Nick felt her tremble in his arms as every part of her body tightened around him, and with a near shout of pleasure, he cl**axed deep inside of her. The orgasm was unlike any he had ever experienced in the past. He neither questioned the difference nor understood it. He merely accepted that this was unique and so special he would never be able to settle for anything less again.</p><p>He stayed inside of her a long time, but when he finally rolled to his side and tenderly took her into his arms to hold her close, she trustingly curled up against him, her hand splayed across the curly mat of hair on his chest.</p><p>Laurant was too overwhelmed to speak. She could barely form a coherent thought. When she was finally able to breathe again, she leaned up to look at his face.</p><p>She stared into those deep blue eyes, so intense now with the residue of raw passion, and smiled as she arched against him like a well-fed cat. She loved the feel of his hard body against hers. The hair on his legs tickled her toes, and she loved that feeling too.</p><p>She loved him. Now and always, she admitted. Then she saw the worry creep into his gaze, and she tried to think of a way to ward off the regret she knew he would be feeling soon. She gave him a long, lingering kiss, and then she smiled at him again. \u201cYou know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked on a yawn, still too exhausted and content to move.</p><p>\u201cI could get really good at this.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, but then she felt the low rumble building in his chest, and he suddenly was laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill me if you get any better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou liked it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask me such a question?\u201d</p><p>She traced the corded muscle along his shoulder, noticed the faded jagged scar on his upper arm, and leaned up to kiss it.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFootball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d she asked as she touched the faint scar on his hip. \u201cWas it a bullet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootball,\u201d he said again. She didn\u2019t look like she believed him. \u201cHonest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a football cleat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been shot?\u201d Her voice trembled when she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cStabbed, punched, kicked, scratched, and spit on, yes, but shot, no.\u201d Not yet anyway, he silently qualified. A scar from a knife wound\u2014an ice pick actually\u2014was on his back, down low by his left kidney. A couple of inches higher and he wouldn\u2019t have lived. Maybe Laurant wouldn\u2019t notice that scar, but if she did, he decided he wouldn\u2019t lie to her.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the scars are from football,\u201d he said.</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his hair. \u201cExcept for the ones you carry inside.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t get sentimental on me. Everybody carries around a little baggage.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to close up on her, to pull away emotionally, but she wouldn\u2019t let him take the coward\u2019s path. When he rolled onto his back and curtly told her it was time they got a little sleep, she ignored the suggestion.</p><p>She rolled over on top of him. Stacking her hands under her chin, she stared down into his eyes.</p><p>His hands were already on her hips. He wanted to make her get off him and go to sleep before he gave in to his desire and made love to her again, but he couldn\u2019t make himself let go of her.</p> <p>\u201cPromise me something, and I\u2019ll let you sleep,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sounded suspicious.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets. All right, Nick?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhat about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets,\u201d she vowed.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo regrets.\u201d</p><p>And both of them were lying.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>Heartbreaker didn\u2019t like surprises, unless, of course, he was the one doling them out.</p><p>Tonight was chock full of unpleasant surprises. He had already heard that the mule was ridiculing him, and he had taken it all in stride. He expected stupidity from mules, so he was only mildly bothered to hear some of the names he was being called. Sticks and stones . . . words couldn\u2019t hurt him. Until tonight, when he heard that Laurant was also spreading vile lies. She had called him impotent. He could barely stand the thought of her lips forming the hideous word. How dare she betray him? How dare she?</p><p>He had to get even, and he was driven to act quickly. The need to punish her overrode caution. How long had he stood in the back lot looking up at her window? At least an hour, maybe two. He didn\u2019t know. When the need grabbed hold of him, time wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>And then he\u2019d seen Lonnie. The stupid boy was climbing up the tree, the very same tree Heartbreaker had used countless times to get inside her house and watch her during the night.</p><p>He watched Lonnie crawl across the roof and slip onto the overhang outside the bathroom window. Just the way he had done. Clever boy, he thought. Following in my footsteps.</p><p>While waiting to see what Lonnie was going to do, his attention was distracted by another man. Good old Steve Brenner was creeping around to Laurant\u2019s back door. Now what was he up to?</p><p>The neighbor\u2019s dog couldn\u2019t tell on him. Heartbreaker had killed the animal so that he could move freely about the yard during the night. He had seen to the yapping dog, and now Lonnie Boy and Steve Brenner were taking advantage of his work.</p><p>The surprises kept coming, escalating until the house was in flames and Brenner was surrounded by mules.</p><p>He could walk away now and no one would be the wiser. They thought they had their man. After he\u2019d taken a little stroll down the streets of Holy Oaks and found what he was looking for, he\u2019d made a little deposit and gone happily on his way. The opportunity had fallen into his lap. Yes, he could walk away, but would he? Now that was a question haunting him.</p><p>What a quandary. Yes, sirree. Could he? Would he?</p><p>His obsession was turning him into a cold-blooded murderer. No, that wasn\u2019t true, he forced himself to admit. He was already a killer. A perfect killer, he qualified. His ego insisted that he give himself his due. A part of him was quite analytical about it all, and he was able to recognize what was happening to him, but he couldn\u2019t make himself mourn the loss of what others would call his sanity. He wasn\u2019t crazy. No, of course, he wasn\u2019t. But he was vengeful. No doubt about that. It was his sacred duty to give back what had been given to him.</p><p>He paced about the little room, planning and fuming. That sleazy little Lonnie boy had messed things up good, and he couldn\u2019t let him get away with it, could he? Because of him, the perfect plan had been ruined, and what was he prepared to do about it?</p><p>The stupid ingrate was forcing him to move up his timetable. What an inconvenience that was, and Lonnie should have to pay, shouldn\u2019t he? Why, yes, indeed he should. Fair was fair, after all, and besides, he\u2019d noticed Laurant didn\u2019t like the young slug. But then who would? Maybe it was time he showed her how much he cared for her. He decided to give her a gift, something special . . . like Lonnie\u2019s spleen or liver, maybe. Certainly not his heart. He wanted to please her, not insult her, and he wouldn\u2019t have her thinking Lonnie was a heartbreaker. No, sirree.</p><p>He glanced at the clock on the nightstand. My oh my, where does the time go? So much to do, so little time left to do it, thanks to Lonnie boy. Oh, he\u2019ll pay all right, with his spleen and his liver and maybe even a kidney or two. But first things first, he cautioned. There was work to be finished.</p><p>Preparation, after all, was everything. The party had to be perfect.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>She loved sleeping with him, tucked safely in his arms with her legs trapped under one of his thighs. She awakened before he did but was feeling too content to move. Nick looked so peaceful. She didn\u2019t want to disturb his rest, and so she stayed perfectly still while she studied his face with the critical eye of an artist. He had the most wonderful profile. The chiseled line of his jaw, the straight nose, the perfectly sculptured mouth. She wanted to paint him, to capture the strength she saw in his eyes. She wondered if he knew how beautiful he was or if he cared. He was such a practical man. He didn\u2019t have time for such thoughts or vanities.</p><p>She wanted him to wake up and make love to her, but she knew that wouldn\u2019t happen. He\u2019d turned to her again and again during the night, but now it was morning and everything was different. She had asked him for one night, and the cost, she knew, had been dear. She couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t ask for more.</p><p>How was she ever going to go back to the ways things were? She was a strong woman. She could do anything she set her mind to, and she was a master at hiding her feelings. She could pretend that it had been a glorious night of recreational sex, that was all, a simple way to release pent-up frustrations and tensions . . . but oh, God, how was she ever going to pull that off ? She wished she could be more worldly. She had plenty of friends at school in Europe and at work in Chicago who believed it was perfectly all right to take a man they had only just met home with them for the night and then never see him again. Women had needs, after all. What was wrong with a one-night interlude? Everything, Laurant thought. Because the heart had to be involved. She could never have given herself to Nick so completely if she hadn\u2019t already made a commitment and acknowledged that she loved him.</p><p>Memories . . . she would have the memories of their night together, and that would be enough. She squeezed her eyes shut. She wanted more than memories. She wanted to wake up next to Nick every morning for the rest of her life.</p><p>She hated feeling this vulnerable and wished to God there was a way to harden herself. Throwing the sheet back, she nudged Nick\u2019s thigh away and got out of bed.</p><p>No regrets.</p><p>Both of them were in a hurry to leave the motel. He wanted to get out of the room before he grabbed her, threw her on the bed, and made love to her again. She wanted to leave as quickly as possible before she started crying again . . . like the stupid, small-town girl that she was.</p><p>The silence between them was strained and horribly uncomfortable. She stared out the window while he drove. She wondered what he was thinking but didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>Nick was silently cursing himself for being such a bastard. What kind of man was he to take advantage of his best friend\u2019s sister? A sick, perverted bastard. That\u2019s what he was, all right, and Tommy was never, ever going to understand.</p><p>Regrets? Hell yes, he had regrets, yet he knew that if they had stayed in that motel room another five minutes, he would have made love to her again.</p><p>They stopped at a superstore off the main highway and spent a quick half hour shopping. At a filling station, Laurant changed while Nick got a couple of Diet Cokes out of the machine. When she came out, she was wearing a seven-dollar pink-and-white checked blouse tucked into a fifteen-dollar pair of stonewashed blue jeans, but the inexpensive clothes looked like designer labels on her. The fabric hugged the curves of her luscious body, and he had to look away until he got his heartbeat regulated. Scum, he thought. I\u2019m lower than scum. Then he looked again and noticed that her hair shone with copper highlights in the sun. He remembered how the soft curls felt when she was leaning over him. Realizing what he was doing, he cursed himself again. He had the discipline of a pig.</p><p>She walked to the car, gliding over the pavement with her sexy, long-legged stride. He handed her the can of Coke, frowning as though she\u2019d done something offensive, then got behind the wheel and didn\u2019t say another word to her for a good twenty miles. As much as he tried to keep his mind on the road and other pressing matters, he couldn\u2019t keep himself from glancing over at her every few minutes. She had the sexiest mouth, and when he thought about the things she\u2019d done with it, a tightness settled in his chest.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t block the images. \u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Pete called you back yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He was a grouchy as a hungry bobcat. She calmly repeated the question.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered curtly. \u201cI told you he was on his way to Houston. His plane won\u2019t land for another hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI thought I did.\u201d</p><p>The road curved to the east, the sun blinding. Nick put on his sunglasses and then took a long swallow from the can.</p><p>\u201cAre you always this grumpy in the morning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been living together long enough for you to know the answer to that question. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a mood,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a mood?\u201d He glanced at her with a quick scowl. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re acting like a jerk,\u201d she calmly explained. \u201cWhat do you think is causing it?\u201d</p><p>Gee, I don\u2019t know, he thought. Maybe it\u2019s due to the fact that I spent most of the night screwing my best friend\u2019s sister.</p><p>He thought it prudent to keep silent. He finished his Coke and dropped the can in the cup holder.</p><p>\u201cAre you still thirsty?\u201d she asked, offering him her drink.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have it.\u201d</p><p>And that was the end of their conversation for the next ten minutes. Laurant waited for him to get past whatever was bothering him, and when she couldn\u2019t stand the silence another minute, she said, \u201cI imagine Noah\u2019s told Tommy by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, I hope not. It\u2019s my job to tell your brother. Not Noah\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to know,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>It occurred to her then that they might not be talking about the same thing. \u201cThe fire, Nick, I was asking you if you thought Noah had told Tommy about the fire yet,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd about Steve Brenner being arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s told him by now. At least I hope he did before Tommy read about it in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d he said, gripping the steering wheel. \u201cI thought you were asking me if Noah told Tommy about us.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cAnd you said you should be the one to tell him. You did say that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to tell my brother about last night.\u201d She was vehement.</p><p>\u201cI think I should,\u201d he argued, and he suddenly sounded quite calm and reasonable.</p><p>She thought he was out of his mind. \u201cAbsolutely not. What happened between us stays between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally that would be true,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut you\u2019re . . . different. I should tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are, sweetheart. Your brother\u2019s my best friend, and he also just happens to be a priest. Yeah, I\u2019ve got to tell him. It\u2019s the decent thing to do. Besides, he\u2019s gonna figure it out. He\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t clairvoyant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to pull anything over on him, not since second grade. He\u2019s always known what\u2019s going on inside my head. He\u2019s bailed me out of a lot of trouble. For a while, when we were at Penn State, he was like my conscience. No, I\u2019m not going to lie to him.\u201d</p><p>She could feel a headache coming on. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie. You don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you he\u2019s going to know. I\u2019ve got to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not telling him. I know you feel as though you\u2019ve betrayed him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cOf course I feel like I\u2019ve betrayed him. He trusted me, damn it.\u201d</p><p>The road was deserted and so he pulled the car over on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be a little awkward for you, but you\u2019ll get past it,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t believe they were having this conversation. \u201cNick, my brother trusted you to keep me safe. You\u2019ve done that. You don\u2019t need to tell him about last night.\u201d</p><p>Astonishment had given way to anger and embarrassment, and she was so upset tears came to her eyes. She vowed she\u2019d die before she cried in front of him again.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAnd you promised me you wouldn\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I lied.\u201d</p> <p>She jabbed him in the shoulder. \u201cIf you feel so guilty, then go to confession.\u201d</p><p>She was glaring at him now, and all he could think about was how pretty she was when she was angry. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if sparks flew out of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought about going to confession,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd then I pictured Tommy\u2019s fist coming through that grille, and I thought, no, that wouldn\u2019t be right. I can\u2019t tell him that way. It should be face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand to her brow to try to stop the pounding. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you to go to confession to Tommy,\u201d she said. \u201cGo to another priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get into a lather.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have nothing to feel guilty about,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI seduced you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cThen tell me, how\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you feel sorry for me. I cried.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI see,\u201d he drawled. \u201cSo I made love to you out of pity? Is that the way you see it?\u201d</p> <p>She seriously contemplated getting out of the car and walking back to town.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d she said then, trying to make him realize how unreasonable and stubborn he was being. \u201cYou have slept with other women, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou want the number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she countered. \u201cI want to know what happened after you had sex with them. Did you feel compelled to tell their mothers?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said before, honey. You\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms across her chest and stared straight ahead. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this any longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLaurant, look at me. How about if I promise you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother? You don\u2019t keep your promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking me promise I wouldn\u2019t have any regrets was just plain stupid, so I don\u2019t think that should count. I\u2019ll keep this promise,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t ask, I won\u2019t tell. I won\u2019t say anything to your brother for a couple of days. That should give you enough time to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d she countered. \u201cSince you\u2019re compelled to be a blabbermouth, you have to wait until you\u2019re back in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should tell him face-to-face so, if he wants to punch me, he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston,\u201d she gritted out between clenched teeth.</p><p>He finally relented. They got back on the road and headed for home again.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He sounded downright cheerful now. He was the most exasperating man.</p><p>\u201cAny other bombshells you want to drop on me before we get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come to think of it, there is one more thing I should probably mention.\u201d</p><p>She mentally braced herself. \u201cWhat is it? No, let me guess. You want to put it in the paper.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Now she sounded cranky.</p><p>\u201cWhen I go back to Boston . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight until I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ve got the right guy under lock and key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes. Until I\u2019m satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you to Boston while the anniversary is going on here, but then I have to come back. I have to find a place to live, open my store, make some decisions about what I\u2019m going to do with the rest of my life. I need some time to sort things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about something else while I\u2019m thinking of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t in love with me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cYou just think you are. You\u2019re confused,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou\u2019ve been under a hell of a lot of stress, and we\u2019ve been tied together.\u201d</p><p>She knew where he was headed. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called transference. It\u2019s kind of like a patient falling in love with her doctor. It\u2019s not real,\u201d he stressed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m suffering from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot suffering, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019ve confused gratitude with love.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to ponder the possibility for a long minute and then said, \u201cI believe you might be right.\u201d</p><p>She swore that if he looked the least bit relieved, she would do him bodily harm.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d He sounded a little stunned.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said more forcefully.</p><p>He wanted confirmation. \u201cSo you realize you don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought. I realize that telling you I love you terrifies you because it means commitment and taking a chance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I realize,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s that transference thing all right. I was confused, but I\u2019m not any longer. Thank you for clearing it up for me,\u201d</p><p>He shot her a hasty glance. \u201cThat was pretty damn quick, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d He was suddenly furious with her and didn\u2019t care that it showed. Damn it, she had told him she loved him, and after a one-minute argument, she caved. What the hell kind of love was that? \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually there is just one more thing I\u2019d like to mention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>Laurant used Nick\u2019s phone to call Michelle and give her the bad news about the bridesmaid\u2019s dress.</p><p>Michelle answered on the first ring. \u201cWhere are you? Are you all right? I heard about the fire, and Bessie Jean told Mother you left with Nick, but no one knew where you went. My God, can you believe Steve Brenner turned out to be such a pervert? Did you know he\u2019d hidden a camera in your house?\u201d</p><p>Laurant patiently answered her questions and then told her about the dress. Michelle took the news surprisingly well. \u201cIf only you\u2019d left the dress with Rosemary,\u201d she said, referring to the dressmaker who had fitted the gown for her.</p><p>\u201cYou told me to pick it up, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but when have you ever listened to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle, what are we going to do? Should I just bow out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Michelle cried. \u201cYou can wear something of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking. You\u2019re tiny. Nothing of yours would fit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Laurant. I\u2019m stuck with Christopher\u2019s two insipid cousins in my wedding, but I\u2019m not letting either one of them be my maid of honor. Are you or are you not my best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen improvise. I don\u2019t care what you wear. Come na*ed if you want. No, you better not do that. You\u2019d cause a riot,\u201d she said. \u201cChristopher wouldn\u2019t remember his vows,\u201d she added with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find something,\u201d she promised, wondering how in God\u2019s name she was going to have time to shop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll still be here at four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me at least until five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the dress destroyed by the fire? Maybe the dry cleaners could repair it if it wasn\u2019t burned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town\u2019s in an uproar over Brenner,\u201d she said then. \u201cHow stupid was he to torch his own house? Did you know he\u2019d brow-beaten poor Mrs. Talbot into selling it to him. He didn\u2019t have any insurance either. Did you know that? The pervert paid cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find all that out?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMother\u2019s nosy friends. Little Lorna\u2019s called Mother three times in the past hour to give more information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve didn\u2019t start the fire,\u201d Laurant said. \u201cLonnie did. I guess he didn\u2019t know Steve had bought the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the paper,\u201d Michelle exclaimed. \u201cThe sheriff \u2019s son was in on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Laurant answered. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more too, Michelle, but I can\u2019t go into it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me everything while we get dressed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I mean everything. I\u2019ve got to hang up now. I\u2019m getting my nails done. I\u2019ll see you at five, and please, stop worrying. It\u2019s going to be fine. Nothing can ruin this day for me, and do you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re marrying the man of your dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no matter what, I\u2019m going to have hot incredible sex tonight. Uh-oh, Mom\u2019s glaring at me. Got to go.\u201d</p><p>Laurant handed the phone back to Nick. \u201cLet\u2019s go by the house first,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the fire didn\u2019t reach the second floor, maybe I can find something suitable to wear in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour clothes are going to smell like smoke,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the dry cleaners could probably clean the dress before five.\u201d</p><p>She mentally went through her wardrobe of once-upon-a-time clothes. That\u2019s what she called them, the beautiful designer dresses and suits that the head of the European modeling agency had given to her, trying to entice her to work for them. The ice blue Versace might do, or the peach Armani. Both of the formal dresses were long, and her high-heeled sandals would work with either one. If the clothes had been destroyed in the fire, she didn\u2019t know what she could wear. The local ladies\u2019 dress shop didn\u2019t carry formal attire.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you have to do before the wedding?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cFind a place to stay tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until tomorrow to pack up whatever I can salvage from the house. It\u2019s too overwhelming to think about today. We have to get a suit for you to wear to the wedding,\u201d she added. \u201cDid you bring one with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my navy blazer and a couple of pairs of dress pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will work. We\u2019ll drop them at the cleaners too.\u201d She sounded weary.</p><p>\u201cCheer up, honey. It\u2019s going to get better.\u201d</p><p>She tried to think of something optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day for a wedding, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your friend upset about the dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Laurant replied. She smiled then. \u201cMichelle doesn\u2019t get upset about things like that. She told me nothing could ruin today for her.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, but it wasn\u2019t Morganstern, as Nick had hoped. Noah was on the line, wanting to know when he and Laurant would be coming to the abbey.</p><p>\u201cIs Tommy worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cHe just wants to know if we should hang around or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in about an hour. Make him stay put.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was getting hungry, but she didn\u2019t want to take time to eat. There was so much to get accomplished before tonight, and it was already going on noon.</p><p>They reached Holy Oaks and wound their way down the quiet streets to her house.</p><p>\u201cYou know what Michelle told me? Lonnie didn\u2019t make the newspaper. She thought Steve Brenner set the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarley told me he would pick him up and take him to Nugent,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe and Brenner can share a cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish you were there, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as he admitted, \u201cYeah, I do. I\u2019d love to sit in on the interrogation. Look Brenner in the eyes. Then I\u2019d know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s the unsub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d He sounded sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cUntil last night, I never would have believed that Steve could be a Peeping Tom,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you hadn\u2019t seen the dark side of good old Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly saw it last night. His face was contorted with hate, and the venom spewing out of his mouth shocked me. I think he is capable of anything, even murder. You know what strikes me as odd though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s always been very uptight, around me anyway. He\u2019s very controlling, or organized, as you would call him. Always planning,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cHe was pretty smooth the way he manipulated the shop owners into selling. He\u2019d purchased five stores before the town found out what he was up to. He was sneaky and very clever, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to have known from reputation alone how volatile and unpredictable Lonnie was. Why would he involve him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he thought he could use him as his scapegoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHow did Steve get in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came in through the back door. He broke the glass, reached in, and unlocked the dead bolt. It was sloppy,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI think Lonnie was looking for a way in through a window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me he was on the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard him outside the bathroom window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t see him, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe could have been checking to make sure no one was home. He didn\u2019t see me. I dropped to the floor the second I saw the light.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick pulled up to a stop sign and waited while two little boys, about seven or eight years old, rode their bikes across the intersection. What were their parents thinking to let them out of their sight? Hell, anyone could grab them. Anything could happen, and they wouldn\u2019t know about it until it was too late.</p><p>His attention returned to Laurant. \u201cLonnie had a flashlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was more like a penlight, a red one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA red penlight . . . you mean, a laser beam, maybe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this last night?\u201d he demanded impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI told you Lonnie was on the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe son of a bitch could have had you in his sights.\u201d His face was tight with anger. \u201cWhere in God\u2019s name would he get his hands on that kind of equipment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom his father\u2019s cabinet,\u201d she answered. \u201cThe sheriff prides himself on his gun collection, and Lonnie would have easy access.\u201d</p> <p>Nick picked up his phone and started dialing. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you came out of the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cWho are you calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarley,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe can find out if Lonnie was on that roof or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else could it have been?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>Agent Farley was just about to step onto a plane in Des Moines when his phone rang. When he heard Nick\u2019s voice, he moved away from the crowd filing on board.</p> <p>\u201cYou just caught me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother minute and I would have turned my phone off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pick up Lonnie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to ground, and I\u2019ve been reassigned. Wesson\u2019s letting the Nugent sheriff and his deputies go after Lonnie and bring him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Feinberg still around, or did Wesson send him packing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Farley answered. \u201cThey both went to Nugent with Brenner,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they could still be there. This isn\u2019t sitting right with you, is it, Nick? You don\u2019t think Brenner\u2019s our man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have anything to prove it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could be an easy case, and you\u2019ve just never had one of those before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to stay in Holy Oaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I had to bail on you, but I didn\u2019t have a choice. As soon as Wesson E-mailed headquarters and let them know I was ready for reassignment, they pounced,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetroit. There\u2019s a situation brewing there, and it\u2019s a messy one. Be thankful you\u2019re on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be careful,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnd Joe, thanks for helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of damn good I did. I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019ve worked with Wesson a couple of times in the past, and he was always a pain in the ass, but he was never this difficult. I think it\u2019s you,\u201d he added. \u201cYou bring out the worst in him. He\u2019s gone too far this time though. I\u2019m never going to work with that egomaniac again, even if means handing in my badge. By the book, my ass. Wesson doesn\u2019t know what teamwork is, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going in my report,\u201d Joe paused a second. \u201cNick you know what\u2019s worrying me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting on that plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s your hang-up, not mine. It\u2019s that gut feeling of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re right, and Brenner isn\u2019t the unsub, then you and Noah are out there all alone. God help you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Laurant found a couple of gowns that would work for the wedding, and after they dropped off the clothes at the cleaners, they drove to the abbey. Noah was in the kitchen eating cold fried chicken with all the trimmings. Nick pulled out a chair for Laurant as he grabbed a chicken leg.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat something, honey.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s right eyebrow shot up, and his gaze bounced between Laurant\u2019s flushed face and Nick\u2019s pained expression. Then he burst into laughter. \u201cIt took you long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d Nick warned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start what?\u201d Noah asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cNick calls everyone honey,\u201d Laurant blurted, feeling like a fool.</p><p>\u201cSure he does,\u201d Noah agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s been calling Tommy and me honey every chance he gets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it alone,\u201d Nick insisted. \u201cWhere is Tommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in one of the conference rooms with that editor woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d Laurant asked.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cBeats me.\u201d</p><p>Nick heard a door close behind him and crossed the kitchen to look out the window. He saw Lorna hurry down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere did this feast come from?\u201d Laurant asked Noah.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s fan club,\u201d Tommy answered from the doorway.</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cThe ladies like me. What can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing a little counseling.\u201d Tommy shook his head in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was having trouble looking at her brother. It was Nick\u2019s fault, she knew, because he had planted the ridiculous notion that Tommy would know what happened last night if he looked in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, I want a word in private with you,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>Nick gave her an I-told-you-he\u2019d-know look and turned around. \u201cTommy, you and I have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Laurant all but shouted as she pushed the chair back and stood. \u201cWhat do you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorna was just here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d Laurant asked. \u201cShe has enough news to keep her busy for the next month, what with the fire and Steve Brenner. Is she trying to figure out a way to blame me for all that too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is writing another article about you, but it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the fire or Brenner. She wanted confirmation from me. It seems she ran into the banker\u2019s wife, who mentioned the money you borrowed for your store, and one bit of gossip led to another. Damn it, Laurant,\u201d he said, his voice shaking with anger, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me the trust was gone? All this time, I thought you were fine and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about you.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was stunned by Lorna\u2019s audacity. \u201cI had to fill out a financial statement, and I had to explain about the trust in order to get the loan,\u201d she cried. \u201cBut the banker had no right to tell anyone, not even his wife. That was confidential information. And how dare Lorna poke her nose in my affairs.\u201d She took a step toward her brother. \u201cDid you hear what you just said to me? All this time you thought I was fine and you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about me? I\u2019m not ten years old, Tommy, but you can\u2019t seem to get that through your head. The money was gone before I turned twenty-one and could do anything about it. The lawyers took it. Every cent. I didn\u2019t tell you because I knew you\u2019d get upset, and there wasn\u2019t anything you could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillions of dollars . . . our grandfather\u2019s hard-earned money gone? When I signed my trust over to them to put with yours, I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s expression made her want to cry. He looked devastated. And horribly disappointed in her. He made her feel as though she had squandered the money.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your sister\u2019s fault,\u201d Nick said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not acting like you do.\u201d</p><p>Tommy\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cWhen exactly did you find out the money was gone?\u201d His face was red with the anger he was trying to contain.</p><p>\u201cOn my twenty-first birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told your family then. Maybe something could have been done.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew it wasn\u2019t his place to interfere, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He looked Tommy in the eye and said, \u201cWhat family? From what I\u2019ve gathered, Laurant didn\u2019t have one of those when she was growing up. Who exactly was she supposed to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her family,\u201d Tommy railed.</p><p>\u201cTry to see it her way,\u201d Noah insisted. \u201cWhen you were growing up, you had Nick\u2019s family to help you, and when you joined the priesthood, the church became your new family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister will always be part of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in Europe, and you were here. You can\u2019t change the way things were. The guilt is making you angry because she was left out in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Tommy looked tormented. Laurant slowly shook her head and went to him. \u201cThat isn\u2019t true. I wasn\u2019t out in the cold. I always knew you were there for me. I knew you were fighting to get me to the United States. Tommy, I always knew you loved me. Please don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>He put his arms around her and hugged her. \u201cIt just came as a shock, that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t keep things from me, Laurant. Big brothers are supposed to look out for their little sisters, no matter how old they are. Look, let\u2019s make a pact, okay? From now on, we don\u2019t hide anything from each other. If I have to have chemo, I tell you, and if you have a problem, you tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to solve my problems for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know you don\u2019t, but you should be able to talk to me about them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the article going to run?\u201d Nick asked. He was trying to figure out if there was time to stop it.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be in the paper. Lorna and I had a little talk.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cDid you threaten her with the fires of hell?\u201d</p><p>Tommy wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, but I did talk to her about being jealous of Laurant. She didn\u2019t want to hear my opinions, but she agreed not to run the article. She\u2019s afraid other people will think she\u2019s jealous because she\u2019s gone after Laurant so many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a glass of milk,\u201d Laurant said. Her stomach was upset, thanks to Lorna, and she hoped the milk would settle it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it. You go sit down,\u201d Tommy offered.</p><p>Noah pushed her plate in front of her. \u201cEat,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you can do about those lawyers?\u201d Nick asked her.</p><p>\u201cI am doing something.\u201d</p><p>Tommy poked his head out of the pantry. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suing them.\u201d</p><p>Her brother grabbed a glass and hurried back into the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re suing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe day after I found out, I started searching. It took a year to find an attorney who was willing to take on the giants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid against Goliath, huh?\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Noah, you\u2019re starting to think like a priest. Maybe you ought to consider joining up,\u201d Nick teased.</p><p>Noah grimaced. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Tommy got the gallon of milk out of the refrigerator and poured some into Laurant\u2019s glass. \u201cBut about the suit? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>She took a drink before she answered. \u201cI won the first round, and then I won again. They\u2019ve been dragging it out with motions to delay, but my attorney told me that this next round is the last appeal. I should hear something soon. Win or lose, it will be final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, there\u2019s a good possibility you could get the money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could go either way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared for either outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you drive that junky old car,\u201d Nick said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been living on a shoestring.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling at her, as though he thought she had done something remarkable.</p><p>\u201cI budget like most people do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I happen to like my car.\u201d</p><p>The conversation came to an abrupt end when the sheriff came storming into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is my boy?\u201d he demanded in a snarl. He had his gun half drawn as he shouted, \u201cWhat have you done with him?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s back was to the door, but Noah sat facing the stampeding sheriff. In a heartbeat, his hand reached inside his black robe and pointed the gun under the table at Lloyd. \u201cYou pull that weapon out, and you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd stopped, frozen in his tracks. He was stunned by this priest who dared to threaten him.</p><p>Laurant hadn\u2019t even had time to turn in her chair before Nick had whirled around and drawn his weapon. He was standing now, shielding her, and the barrel of his gun was pressed against Lloyd\u2019s temple.</p><p>Tommy came up behind the sheriff and took the gun away from him. Then he calmly suggested that Lloyd sit down and discuss the problem in a reasonable manner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the authority here,\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Nick informed him. He put his gun back in the holster and told the sheriff to do as Tommy had said and sit down.</p><p>Lloyd chose the chair at the far end of the table. \u201cGive me my gun back.\u201d</p><p>Tommy handed Nick the weapon, and he quickly unloaded the magazine before he slid the gun toward the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d Tommy asked.</p><p>\u201cMy boy,\u201d Lloyd muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s gone missing. That\u2019s what the problem is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hiding,\u201d Nick told him. \u201cHe started that fire, and now he\u2019s hiding.\u201d</p><p>Lloyd shook his head. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna get into all that fire business \u2019cause you and I see it different from each other. My boy knows he\u2019s got me for his alibi. He wouldn\u2019t think he had to hide. He was in bed, sleeping sound, when I got home from Nugent. I was dead tired,\u201d he added. \u201cUp most of the night, and I was just getting myself in bed when the low-life sheriff from Nugent knocked on my door. He said he was gonna take Lonnie and book him on arson. We argued a bit, but then I decided to let the lawyers handle it, and I let him on in. Lonnie weren\u2019t in his bed though, and his window was wide open.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Noah, who promptly shook his head to let him know he hadn\u2019t done anything with Lonnie.</p><p>Nick said then, \u201cMaybe Wesson decided to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t what happened.\u201d The sheriff was whining now. \u201cHe\u2019s still with the others cooped up with Brenner in a two-by-four room, questioning him. They wouldn\u2019t let me listen in, didn\u2019t want me to know nothing that was going on. I finally gave up and was heading out the door when I heard they were accusing him of murder. One of the sheriff \u2019s deputies told me they had the goods on him.\u201d He took his hat off and rubbed his brow. \u201cIt\u2019s all going in the toilet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you really care what happens to Lonnie?\u201d Noah asked bluntly.</p><p>The question flustered the sheriff. Seeing the turmoil in Lloyd\u2019s face, Tommy took over. He dragged a chair to the end of the table and sat down next to Lloyd.</p><p>\u201cYour son\u2019s given you a lot of heartache over the years, hasn\u2019t he, Lloyd?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff \u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cHe ain\u2019t never been right in the head. Never. He\u2019s got a real mean temper.\u201d</p> <p>Tommy coaxed Lloyd to talk, urging him to let go of all the anger and disappointment he\u2019d kept inside for so long, and within minutes, the sheriff was spilling his guts, telling him all the problems he\u2019d had to clean up for his son. The list was appallingly lengthy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done some terrible things. I know he has, but he\u2019s my son, and I had to protect him. I\u2019m so sick of it. I know I\u2019m supposed to care about the boy, but I can\u2019t, not anymore. I\u2019ve still got to find him because if I don\u2019t and he comes home, he\u2019ll be . . . upset with me, and I don\u2019t want that to happen. He can forget himself and get violent.\u201d He wiped at his eyes as he confessed, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but I\u2019m afraid of my own boy. He\u2019s going to kill me one of these days. He\u2019s come damn close a couple of times already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time Lonnie learned the consequences of his actions,\u201d Noah suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come after me. I know he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need time to think about your options,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get in your car and leave Holy Oaks for a week or two, just until things calm down and Lonnie\u2019s behind bars.\u201d</p> <p>The sheriff leapt at the idea. \u201cWhat will folks say? I don\u2019t want them thinking I\u2019m running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t think that,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to take some time off, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I am,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd maybe . . . just maybe, I won\u2019t never come back. I\u2019ll leave it all here, won\u2019t pack a thing, so my boy won\u2019t think I\u2019m gone for good. Then he won\u2019t come looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll catch him and put him behind bars,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou be sure to let Father Tom know where you are.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff was suddenly in a hurry to get out of town. He was walking out the door when he stopped and turned to Laurant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been skimming money from the very beginning,\u201d he said. \u201c</p> <p>Who?\u201d Laurant asked. \u201cBrenner?\u201d</p><p>Lloyd nodded. \u201cHe\u2019d tell his backers at Griffen it was gonna cost a hundred grand to buy a store, then offer half that amount to the owner and pocket the difference. He\u2019s got himself an account, but I don\u2019t know where it is. You might want to look into that before the town meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will,\u201d she said.</p><p>The sheriff turned to leave again, but Nick stopped him.</p><p>\u201cHow deep are you in all of this, Lloyd?\u201d</p><p>Lloyd turned away. \u201cI helped him some. I\u2019ll testify against him. Maybe if I help make this right, I won\u2019t have to serve time.\u201d He gave Nick a hopeful glance, and then spoke to Tommy. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know where I am. I\u2019ll come back when you call me.\u201d He shuffled back like a broken-down old man and placed his gun and badge on the table, then walked out the door.</p><p>They watched him leave.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to let him go?\u201d Noah asked Nick.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he won\u2019t go far,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>Nick tried to get Wesson on his cell phone, but he didn\u2019t answer. Then he tried Feinberg and got his voice mail. His frustration mounted. He kept glancing at his watch. Morganstern should have landed in Houston by now. Why the hell hadn\u2019t he returned his call?</p><p>Tommy had gone back into the pantry in search of potato chips, and Nick followed him. Laurant heard him tell her brother that he shouldn\u2019t let his guard down until Nick was convinced Brenner was the unsub.</p><p>The two stood in the pantry and talked. It appeared that Tommy was doing most of the talking. Laurant was so busy watching the two of them, she didn\u2019t notice that Noah was watching her.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned her attention to her food. \u201cI\u2019m not worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are. You think Nick\u2019s going to tell Tommy that he slept with you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think about trying to deny it. She looked into those devilish blue eyes and asked, \u201cAre you always this blunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way both of you are avoiding looking at each other. I\u2019ve known Nick a long time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen him this uptight. I figure you\u2019re the reason.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a chicken wing and then put it down. \u201cNick might tell Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, and Tommy\u2019s going to be upset, being a priest and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cBut you\u2019re a big girl now, and it really isn\u2019t any of his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t see it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you been in love with Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I am?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI know women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning I know you\u2019re not the kind of woman who would go to bed with a man unless you loved him. Nick knows that too. You must be scaring the hell out of him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do scare him. He doesn\u2019t want any of the things I want, but he doesn\u2019t want to hurt me. Last night was a mistake,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s over,\u201d she added. She tried to sound as though she\u2019d already moved on, but she knew she\u2019d failed when Noah patted her hand.</p><p>\u201cDid it feel like a mistake last night?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, but like you just said, I\u2019m a big girl. I can get on with my life. I\u2019m not so easily shattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re humoring me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else,\u201d she suggested. \u201cCould I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What do you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come Wesson dislikes Nick so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes way back,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut what started the antagonism?\u201d she asked with another quick glance at Nick.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say it was a cat that started the rivalry, although now that I think about it, Nick\u2019s attitude also played a part. He was new to the section, and he thought he knew it all. Morganstern had only just gotten the okay to run the Apostles, and Nick was his second recruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the first recruit?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he answered with an arrogant grin. \u201cPete was handpicking his agents, getting them from outside and putting them through his own special training program. Wesson was dying to be a part of it. Actually, I think from the very beginning he wanted to run the program, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Wesson become one of Morganstern\u2019s recruits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Morganstern didn\u2019t take him in, and that really chafed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what started it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was a cat,\u201d he patiently repeated. \u201cThere was this particular case. A three-year-old girl was missing, and the FBI was called in. Wesson was on the rotation schedule, and there was no way he was going to let one of Morganstern\u2019s hotshots come in and take over. Wesson wanted to solve the case and solve it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Nick did. Here\u2019s what happened. The little girl was with her mother in a department store. The building was real old, with wooden floors that squeaked and groaned when you walked on them, and high plastered ceilings, and big old vents along the baseboards. It was drafty and cold inside. The building was located near the warehouse district and the city market right next to the river. It was a nice little shopping area, all the buildings had been buffed and restored, but there was a problem with rats, and so the owner of this particular family-owned department store kept a cat there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she urged, wanting Noah to finish before Nick and Tommy returned.</p><p>\u201cIt was around noon on the Saturday before Christmas, and the store was crowded with last-minute shoppers. It was real chaotic and loud, with Christmas music blaring, but one salesclerk happened to notice a man in his midthirties wandering around the store. She thought he might be a shoplifter. He was wearing beat-up old clothes and a long gray raincoat. She said it was dirty and torn. She couldn\u2019t give a great description other than to say he was thin and had a scraggily beard. She told us she was going to call security, but then she saw him heading for the front door, and she thought he was leaving. She was being pulled in twenty different directions by impatient customers.</p><p>\u201cA customer in line remembered seeing the man squat down next to the little girl and talk to her. She said the mother had elbowed her way to the counter and was digging through her purse, looking for her charge card, and she didn\u2019t notice her daughter was talking to the stranger. Then the customer said the man got up and walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he take the little girl?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cAnother customer said she almost tripped over the child when she darted out in front of her. The little girl was chasing the cat,\u201d he added. \u201cAbout five or ten minutes later, the mother was frantically searching for her daughter. Everyone was helping, of course, and then the clerk remembered the man in the raincoat, and the customer remembered she\u2019d seen him talking to the child. The security officer called the police while the owner called the FBI. To his credit, Wesson got there fast,\u201d he added. \u201cMorganstern got the call from Wesson\u2019s superior and wanted Nick and me to get a little experience, and so he sent us in, but neither one of us could get there until late that night. I came in from Chicago, and Nick caught a plane out of Dallas. He got in about fifteen minutes before I did, rented a car, got a map, and picked me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesson wasn\u2019t happy to see you, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly. It didn\u2019t matter to us though. He didn\u2019t have any authority over us. We reported to Morganstern and no one else. Wesson was extremely reluctant to share what he had with us, and that really pissed . . . I mean, angered Nick. When he gets mad, his temper\u2019s worse than mine,\u201d Noah said with admiration in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe let Wesson know what he thought of him. Nick could have been more diplomatic, but, anyway, he backed Wesson into a corner, and Wesson told him he had a suspect, and that the situation was under control, which, of course, wasn\u2019t the case. Wesson also went on record as saying that Morganstern\u2019s team was a waste of time and money, and that Nick and I should go home and find real jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, butt out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Noah said. \u201cOf course, we didn\u2019t care what Wesson thought or wanted. We had a job to do, and we were going to do it with or without his approval. While Nick was looking around, I got one of the other field agents aside and read his notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the little girl all right? Just tell me, please. Did you find her in time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we did, thanks to Nick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of those too few happy endings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that,\u201d Noah said. \u201cEveryone left the store. It was around two in the morning, and it was freezing inside that building. Wesson had set up a command post at the police station a couple of blocks away, and every available man was out on the streets searching for the man in the raincoat. Nick and I were standing on the curb outside the store, trying to figure out what we were supposed to do. The security officer was locking the doors to go home when Nick told him he wanted to go back inside. He convinced the old man to turn the alarm off and give us the keys.</p><p>\u201cBoth of us went through the building from top to bottom again. We found nothing, so we left. I was driving,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure where I was headed. I was just trying to clear my mind the way Morganstern taught us, and I remember I had just driven past a hospital when I asked Nick what the hell we were going to do, being squeezed out by Wesson the way we were.\u201d</p><p>Noah paused to smile and then added, \u201cNick didn\u2019t say anything. He popped a piece of gum in his mouth, and I figured he was doing the same thing I was trying to do. You know, trying to clear his mind. And all of a sudden, he turned to me and said, \u2018So, where\u2019s the cat?\u2019</p><p>\u201cWe started doing what Morganstern would probably call a little free-associating then. Kids love animals, most do anyway, and a customer had reported she\u2019d seen the little girl chasing after the cat. We both figured out what might have happened then. I was driving like a bat out of hell, trying to get back to the department store as fast as I could, but then I saw the hospital emergency entrance, and I pulled in. Nick and I went running into the emergency room, flashed our badges, and grabbed a doctor who was just going on break. Nick told him he was going with us and to bring his stethoscope with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little girl was still in the store, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure she was,\u201d he said. \u201cShe went in one of those big old vents after the cat,\u201d he explained. \u201cCrawling around on the floor by the walls, no one would have noticed her, as busy and crowded as the store was. The vent didn\u2019t hold her, and she went down two and a half floors and got trapped on a ledge above the basement. The fall should have killed her,\u201d he added. \u201cShe had hit her head and was unconscious when we finally got to her. The cat stayed with her. We could hear the faint meowing through the stethoscope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was all right.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. \u201cYeah, she was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Nick must have been jubilant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were, but we were also frustrated with ourselves at the same time. Both of us had missed the obvious. We let the guy in the raincoat get in our way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have noticed the vent the girl crawled into was a little bit off-kilter from the others, but we missed it. And we shouldn\u2019t have taken so long to notice the cat was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found her within hours of your arrival,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut if we had been more observant, we could have cut the time in half. We were damn lucky she was still alive. She could have been bleeding down there, and if that had been the case, we would have been too late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laurant knew that nothing she could say would change his opinion of his performance.</p><p>\u201cNormally, Wesson would have been just as happy and relieved as everyone else,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a monster, or at least he wasn\u2019t back then,\u201d he qualified. \u201cBut jealousy was eating him up. Sure he was happy the little girl was all right . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick deliberately left him out. He should have told Wesson what he suspected and let him run with the ball.\u201d Noah paused for a moment. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what he should have done, but I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t. Tit for tat, as childish as that was. And in his defense, and mine because I backed him, we were young and stupid back then, and neither one of us gave a damn about career politics. We still don\u2019t. Nick had to be sure the kid was there, and so did I. Anyway, Wesson found out about the girl after the fact, from Morganstern. Nick and I were already on our way to the airport. Nick had wanted to prove a point, but he had humiliated Wesson, and ever since then, the mere mention of his name or mine gets the same kind of reaction as pouring salt on an open wound. Neither one of us have had to work with him since, until this case.\u201d</p><p>Laurant propped her elbow on the table, resting her chin in the palm of her hand. She stared at Noah, but didn\u2019t really see him. She was thinking about the story he had just told her.</p><p>Until this moment, there had been a tiny little hope in the back of her mind that Nick would quit his job. And, oh God, how selfish and wrong she had been to want such a thing.</p><p>\u201cLife doesn\u2019t have any guarantees, does it?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got to grab what you can while you can. Nick\u2019s good at what he does, but he\u2019s burning out. I can see it in his eyes. The stress is going to kill him if he doesn\u2019t get some balance in his life. He needs someone like you to come home to at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may not want it, but he needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and Nick are something else, you know that? Being on the outside, observing, it\u2019s really easy to see what\u2019s going on. Want me to enlighten you? I\u2019ll warn you in advance. You won\u2019t like what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cEnlighten me. I can take it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHere\u2019s the way I see it. You and Nick are both trying to alter reality. You\u2019re both running away from life. Don\u2019t argue with me until I\u2019m finished,\u201d he told her when he saw she was about to interrupt. \u201cNick\u2019s trying to close himself up, to distance himself from everyone, even his family, and that\u2019s a big mistake in his line of work. He needs to feel, because that\u2019s the only way he\u2019s going to stay sharp and focused. I can see he\u2019s getting to the point where he doesn\u2019t want to take a chance on feeling anything at all because that would make him too damned vulnerable. If he keeps going this way, he\u2019s going to become hard and cynical. And he sure as hell won\u2019t be any good at his job. Now as for you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She straightened in the chair, tense now as she waited to hear his verdict about her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing the same thing, just in a different way. You\u2019re hiding out here in this little town. I know you don\u2019t see it that way, but that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re more afraid of taking a chance than Nick is. If you don\u2019t put yourself out there, you can\u2019t get hurt. That\u2019s how you view life, isn\u2019t it? And if you keep going this way, you\u2019re going to turn into a bitter, old, dried-up prune, and a coward to boot.\u201d</p><p>She knew Noah wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to be cruel, but what he had just said devastated her. Was that how he saw her? Laurant shrank back and gripped her hands together. A coward? How could he think she would ever become a coward?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished. There\u2019s more. Want to hear it?\u201d</p><p>She braced herself. \u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw one of your paintings.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze flew to his. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked, astonished. Why did she feel the sudden pang of fear?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hanging in Tom\u2019s bedroom,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the most powerful paintings I\u2019ve ever seen. You should be damned proud of it. I\u2019m not the only person who thought it was incredible. The abbot wanted to hang it in the church. Tom told me he stole the painting from you. He also told me that you keep all your paintings wrapped up tight and hidden away in your storage closet so no one can see them. That\u2019s one sure way to beat rejection, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s safe. Like the kind of life you\u2019re building here. Well, guess what, babe. There\u2019s no such thing as a safe life. Bad things happen, like your brother getting cancer, and there isn\u2019t a damned thing you can do about it. You\u2019re sure trying though, aren\u2019t you? Maybe thirty years from now you\u2019ll have convinced yourself that you\u2019re content with your perfect, safe life, but I assure you, it\u2019s going to be lonely. And by then, the amazing talent you have will probably have dried up.\u201d</p><p>Laurant shuddered under the weight of the future Noah had just described. He was forcing her to open her eyes and take a hard look at herself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. You just don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head as she mentally argued against his bleak prophecy. Perhaps when she\u2019d first moved to Holy Oaks, she had been running away from life. But it wasn\u2019t like that now. She\u2019d fallen in love with the town and the people, and she had become involved with the community. She hadn\u2019t just sat back and let the world revolve around her.</p><p>Noah was right about her painting. She had always considered it too personal to share with anyone else. It was a part of her, and if others saw her work and rejected it, she felt that they would be rejecting her.</p><p>She had been a coward. And she would lose what little talent she had if she kept on this path. If she didn\u2019t experience life, how could she possibly translate it onto canvas?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t throw them away,\u201d she admitted hesitantly. \u201cI keep the paintings.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cSo maybe you might want to think about unwrapping them one of these days and letting other people see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. After a moment\u2019s reflection she looked at him and smiled. \u201cYes, maybe I should do that.\u201d</p><p>Noah took his plate to the sink and rolled up his sleeves as he prepared to do the dishes. He was complaining about the fact that the abbot wouldn\u2019t spend the money for a dishwasher while he worked.</p><p>Laurant wasn\u2019t paying any attention. She was still lost in thought. Noah had just given her a wake-up call. He\u2019d opened a door for her, and she had the choice of going outside or pulling the door closed again.</p><p>When Tommy came back into the kitchen, Noah said, \u201cI told Laurant you took one of her paintings.\u201d</p><p>Tommy immediately took a defensive stance. \u201cI stole it, and I\u2019m not sorry. You want it back now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one was it?\u201d she asked. Suddenly, she was very hungry. She took a bite of the chicken and reached for a cold biscuit.</p><p>\u201cThe only one I could get my hands on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was in front of the others in the closet. I didn\u2019t even know what I was taking until I got it home and unwrapped it. And do you know what\u2019s a crying shame, Laurant. It\u2019s the only painting you\u2019ve done that I\u2019ve ever seen. You keep them hidden away, like you\u2019re ashamed of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut which one was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids in the wheat field with all that light shining down on them. I love it, Laurant, and I want to keep it. You know why? Because there\u2019s such joy and hope in it. When I look at it, I see heaven smiling on the children. It\u2019s as though the streams of light are actually God\u2019s fingers reaching down to touch them.\u201d</p><p>Emotion welled up inside her. She knew that he meant every word he\u2019d said. Joy and hope. What a glorious compliment. \u201cOkay, Tommy. You can keep it.\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked shocked. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you like it.\u201d</p><p>Nick wasn\u2019t about to be left out. \u201cDamn it, I want to see it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Noah winked at her, and she suddenly felt like laughing. \u201cYes, I mean it, but I\u2019ll warn you, it\u2019s not one of my best efforts. I can do much better.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s phone rang, interrupting the conversation. Smiles vanished in a heartbeat, and the atmosphere in the kitchen became tense with anticipation. Nick answered as he walked into the pantry for privacy.</p><p>Pete was on the line, and he had stunning news. Tiffany Tara Tyler\u2019s phone had been found in Steve Brenner\u2019s white van, neatly tucked under the front seat. This new evidence put a lock on the case. They had their man.</p><p>\u201cDid they find any prints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wiped it down, but he was a little sloppy,\u201d Pete said. \u201cHe missed a spot on the bottom of the phone. The tech found what looks like a partial thumbprint next to the metal charger. He thinks it\u2019s going to be enough for a solid match. It looks like they\u2019re about to wrap this one up, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Nick was shaking his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d he said. He paused and then added, \u201cSo that\u2019s it. Case closed. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d Pete agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s other evidence, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as I understand the situation, Agent Wesson didn\u2019t share what he had collected against Brenner with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke briefly with Agent Farley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Wesson has enough to convict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the woman\u2019s phone in his car? Yes, he has quite enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could have been planted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said. \u201cHad you been given information as it was being collected, I think you\u2019d be feeling more confident that Brenner\u2019s our man. You were kept out of the investigation,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I plan to address that problem with Agent Wesson\u2019s supervisor first thing Monday morning. This will not happen again,\u201d he added emphatically. \u201cAs for you, I suggest you take Father Tom fishing. Relax a little. God knows, you\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed the back of his neck, trying to ease the knots of tension. He was weary and frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Pete. My instincts are telling me that this is all wrong. I think maybe I\u2019m losing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour objectivity?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. I really did figure it all wrong. Tell me something. They\u2019re running a voice match from the confessional tape and Brenner\u2019s interrogation, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenner hasn\u2019t confessed, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Nick was filled with self-doubt. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want to believe what was staring him in the face. From the very beginning, Wesson had put him in the position of trying to work the case blindfolded. Tiffany\u2019s phone was found in Brenner\u2019s van. That should have clinched it. And yet he still wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you fighting this?\u201d Pete asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good result here.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed. \u201cYes, sir, I know. I guess I do need to take some time off. You were right,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cI got too personally involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw that coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ll deal with it. You\u2019ll let me know what the lab results are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Pete promised. \u201cGive my best to Father Tom and Laurant.\u201d</p><p>Nick disconnected the call and stood in the pantry for a long minute staring into space. He was trying to work it out in his mind, to go with it, to believe that it was over. He told himself he was trying to make the case more complicated than it was. Some cases were easy. Like this one. Yeah, it was finished. Case closed. They had their man.</p><p>And still the nagging doubt wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>The nightmare was finally over. Tommy and Laurant were astounded to learn that Tiffany\u2019s phone had been found in Brenner\u2019s car. Nevertheless, both brother and sister were overjoyed that the killer was now behind bars. When Noah suggested they celebrate, Tommy nixed the idea. He reminded him that two women had been murdered and said that he was going to go into the church to say a prayer for the souls of Tiffany Tyler and a young woman named Millicent.</p><p>\u201cHe sure was good at masquerading his voice when he was whispering to me in the confessional,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cHe fooled me all right,\u201d he added with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cHe fooled all of us,\u201d Laurant said. She felt weak with relief. She decided to join her brother in the church for a prayer.</p><p>She stood and looked directly at Nick when she asked, \u201cSo you and Noah will be leaving soon, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nick answered without a second\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNo reason to hang around, is there?\u201d Noah looked at Nick as he asked the question.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered curtly. \u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>Laurant turned away so he wouldn\u2019t see how his words had hurt her. She knew she was overreacting. From the beginning, she had known he would leave when his job was finished. His life was in Boston. He had stopped everything to help his friend, but now he would, of course, need to get back home.</p><p>\u201cPlaces to go, people to see . . . ,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Tommy was holding the door for her. \u201cCome on, Laurant. Quit dragging your feet.\u201d</p><p>She put her napkin down on the table and hurried after her brother. Nick and Noah followed. When they reached the back of the church, Nick pulled Noah aside while Laurant and Tommy went on ahead to one of the pews and knelt down together.</p><p>There were at least a dozen workmen rushing around trying to get the church ready in time for the wedding. Five of them were dismantling the scaffolding from the center aisle while a couple of others were folding up the tarps and carrying paint cans outside. The people from the local flower shop were standing up front, holding vases of lilies, impatiently waiting for Willie and Mark to finish wet mopping the steps and marble floor in front of the altar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick and Noah moved under the balcony to get out of the way when the double doors opened behind them and two strapping men rolled in a baby grand piano on a dolly.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want this, Father?\u201d one of the men asked Noah.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Noah replied.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Father. This thing\u2019s heavy. Could you find out for us?\u201d</p> <p>Justin hurried down the aisle toward them. He was carrying a video camera and had a long, red extension cord looped over his shoulder. He slowed to say hello.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where the piano\u2019s supposed to go?\u201d Noah asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re putting the choir on the south side of the church in that little alcove.\u201d</p><p>He backed out of the way so the men could roll the piano around to the side aisle.</p><p>\u201cHow come they don\u2019t just use the organ?\u201d Noah asked.</p> <p>Justin turned to answer. \u201cThey have to get those pipes cleaned first. The abbot says all the dust in the air will mess up the chords if it isn\u2019t cleaned before it\u2019s used again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with the video camera?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been roped into filming the ceremony from the balcony,\u201d he explained. \u201cMichelle\u2019s father asked me. He\u2019s already got a professional guy filming downstairs, but he wants all the angles covered I guess. I don\u2019t mind doing it,\u201d he added, grinning. \u201cHe\u2019s paying me a hundred dollars, and I can use the money. Besides that, he\u2019s invited Mark and Willie and me to the reception, and we\u2019ll get free food and beer. You coming to the wedding?\u201d he asked Nick.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSee you later then,\u201d Justin said as he raced on. \u201cI just hope the church is ready. We\u2019ve got a heck of a lot of work to get done before seven.\u201d</p><p>They moved out of the way again so Justin could open the wrought iron gate and go up the stairs to the balcony.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, what were you going to tell me?\u201d Noah asked as he followed Nick to the back pew.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenner?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be convinced when I hear the reports. They\u2019ve got a thumbprint, a partial anyway, and they\u2019re working on a voice match with the confessional tape. When the results are in confirming Brenner\u2019s the unsub, then I\u2019ll relax. Until then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know Pete\u2019s going to be calling you with another assignment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to fend him off. Besides, we\u2019re going to hear what the techs have concluded by tonight. Tomorrow at the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this, Noah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t feel right to you, then of course I\u2019m staying. Do I have to keep wearing this dress?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cYou probably should keep wearing it until you leave Holy Oaks. Too many people know you as a priest. Let\u2019s leave it that way.\u201d</p><p>He looked Noah up and down and then asked, \u201cWhere are you hiding your gun? Ankle strap?\u201d he guessed as he glanced down at Noah\u2019s feet. The tips of his black tennis shoes were protruding from the hem of the long robe.</p><p>\u201cToo hard to get to,\u201d Noah answered. He lifted the full sleeve covering his left arm. The holster holding the gun was strapped just below his elbow. \u201cThank God for Velcro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cTell me something. Don\u2019t you think you should tell Tom and Laurant you still have reservations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to tell them? The evidence is pretty conclusive, and God only knows what else Wesson has on Brenner. Besides, Laurant and Tommy have been living under a tremendous strain, and Laurant\u2019s been looking forward to her friend\u2019s wedding. I want her to be able to enjoy herself tonight. You keep your eye on Tommy, and I\u2019ll watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to work that way. You do what you want with Laurant, but I\u2019m telling Tom to stay sharp. I don\u2019t want him to relax until you\u2019re convinced.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Pete how you\u2019re feeling about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Nick shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019m not being objective because I\u2019m too personally involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the reports are in, I\u2019ll stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go home,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnother day, another case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to walk away from her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Noah sounded incredulous. \u201cShe\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to you, but you\u2019re too chicken to take the chance. You\u2019re nuts. You know that?\u201d</p><p>Nick responded to the question by turning around and walking away from his friend.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Michelle\u2019s father returned from the abbey at a quarter of six to report that the scaffolding had been removed, and the red carpet had been rolled down the center aisle. The florist and her assistant were frantically working to tie the bouquets to the ends of each pew. It would be close, he told his wife, but he was sure the church would be ready when the wedding march began.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s mother, a vision in blue chiffon, continued to worry, but the bride took all the last-minute wrinkles in stride. She sat on the bed with her back against the headboard and watched Laurant dress while she caught her friend up on the latest gossip she\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got an APB or a ABP\u2014whatever it is\u2014out on Lonnie now. They\u2019re going to charge him with arson and hopefully lock him away for the rest of his life. He\u2019s gotten away with so much in the past couple of years. He deserves to rot in prison.\u201d She paused to take a sip of lemonade. \u201cAnd everyone is still in shock about Steve. Don\u2019t pin your hair up, Laurant. Leave it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Laurant agreed. She picked up the peach silk dress she\u2019d draped over the chair and slipped it on. She had her back to Michelle as she zipped the dress up and adjusted the bodice. Then she turned around, the full skirt floating about her ankles. \u201cWhat do you think? Does this work or not? I could wear the blue Versace, but I thought this color would blend better with the dark pink dresses the other bridesmaids are wearing.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brockman walked into the bedroom to try once again to hurry her daughter along. She came to an abrupt stop when she saw Laurant.</p><p>Both mother and daughter appeared to be speechless. Laurant felt self-conscious under their close scrutiny. \u201cSay something, Michelle,\u201d she demanded. \u201cDo you like the dress or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a princess in a fairy tale,\u201d Michelle whispered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cMy dear, you look exquisite.\u201d</p><p>Michelle awkwardly scooted off the bed and held on to the post as she stood. Her mother noticed her grimace. \u201cIs the new brace still bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Michelle admitted. Her gaze was locked on Laurant. \u201cIf I could look like that . . . Turn around and look in the mirror. Mother, Laurant doesn\u2019t have any idea how beautiful she is. She doesn\u2019t see herself the way the rest of the world does. I should make her wear a grocery sack over her head because every eye in the church is going to be on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ll be staring at the beautiful bride.\u201d Laurant laughed then. \u201cWell, you will be beautiful as soon as you get your hair out of those ridiculous jumbo rollers and put some clothes on. Or were you planning to wear that old robe down the aisle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it, Laurant. Hurry her along. She won\u2019t listen to me, and she\u2019s going to be late for her own wedding,\u201d Mrs. Brockman said as she turned Michelle around and gave her a gentle nudge. \u201cI\u2019m too old for this stress,\u201d she added. \u201cI was already old when I had Michelle,\u201d she reminded them.</p><p>Michelle grinned. \u201cYes, Mother. I was your change of life baby, and I changed your life.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a blessing. Now get dressed, or I\u2019m going to send your father in here.\u201d</p><p>Michelle tightened the belt on her robe and began to pull the Velcro rollers out of her hair.</p><p>\u201cLaurant, your bra\u2019s showing,\u201d she said. \u201cJust below the straps.\u201d</p><p>Laurant tugged on the bodice, but the white lace continued to show. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other bras with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t wear one,\u201d Michelle suggested.</p><p>Her mother gasped. \u201cLaurant will not go braless into the house of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m not suggesting she go topless. No one will know if she\u2019s wearing a bra or not. The dress is lined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod will know,\u201d her mother announced. \u201cI\u2019ll get the safety pins.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the door closed, Michelle said, \u201cShe\u2019s a nervous wreck, and so is Daddy. He got all teary-eyed this morning. He told me he was losing his little girl. Isn\u2019t that sweet?\u201d</p><p>Laurant pulled out the chair for Michelle so she could sit at the vanity table.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you remind him that you and Christopher will be living two blocks away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to cry when he walks me down the aisle, and I\u2019ll be crying too if the church isn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>Laurant picked up the brush and handed it to her friend. \u201cDo you realize how lucky you are? You have such wonderful, loving parents, and you\u2019re about to marry the most wonderful man. I envy you,\u201d she added in a sigh.</p><p>Michelle looked at her friend in the mirror. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before I\u2019m helping you get ready for your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Laurant could have told her the truth then, that it had all been a lie and that she and Nick weren\u2019t getting married, but she kept silent. Today was Michelle\u2019s day, and Laurant didn\u2019t want her friend to waste a minute thinking about anything else.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get all emotional on me,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cOr mother will put you to work too. That\u2019s how she deals with tears,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe had poor Dad running all over town. She\u2019s already made him make two trips up to the abbey. First, she made him go see for himself that the scaffolding was down. Then, she made him go back to make sure the flowers had arrived. And before he drives us to the church, he has to drive over to the Vandermans and pick up Bessie Jean and Viola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBessie Jean has a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen her drive it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve seen the car parked in her garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to drive. She wants to be chauffeured. She told mother, with so much traffic these days, it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraffic in Holy Oaks?\u201d</p><p>They burst into laughter. \u201cAnd get this,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cShe blames the Catholics. Says we drive like maniacs.\u201d</p><p>They laughed again, but Michelle\u2019s mother put an end to the conversation when she came rushing into the bedroom once more. \u201cMichelle, I\u2019m begging you now. Get dressed.\u201d She headed for Laurant, brandishing two giant safety pins. \u201cThese were all I could find,\u201d she said apologetically as she pinned Laurant\u2019s bra to the lining of her dress.</p><p>Michelle was finally ready to leave for the church at twenty minutes to seven. Her beaded ivory wedding gown was a replica of a Vera Wang design she had seen in a magazine and had fallen in love with. It fit her petite hourglass frame perfectly. When she finally turned to face her mother and Laurant, they both grabbed Kleenex to dab at their eyes and wipe their noses.</p><p>\u201cOh, Michelle, you look beautiful,\u201d Laurant whispered. \u201cAbsolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daddy\u2019s going to cry when he sees you,\u201d her mother announced, sniffling.</p><p>Michelle adjusted her veil, then squeezed Laurant\u2019s hand. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As she was walking to the door, she called over her shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wear the necklace I gave you.\u201d</p><p>Laurant would have forgotten it if she hadn\u2019t been reminded. At the rehearsal dinner Michelle had given to all the bridesmaids a delicate gold chain as a gift.</p><p>It took her several tries to get the necklace fastened. Then she stood in front of the full-length mirror and put on her diamond-studded earrings. The only other piece of jewelry she had on was the engagement ring. She held her hand out in front of her and stared down at the shimmering diamond for a long moment. Tears blurred her vision. Her heart felt as though it were breaking. She thought about taking the ring off and giving it back to Nick right away, but then she changed her mind. She would wait until after the reception. Then she would give him the ring and say good-bye.</p><p>Dear God, how was she ever going to get through that? Oh, how she loved him. He had come into her life and changed it forever, for he\u2019d made her open her eyes and her heart to the world around her, and to all the possibilities.</p><p>How was she ever going to live the rest of her life without him? Laurant stared at herself in the mirror and slowly straightened her shoulders. Her heart would be broken, yes, but she would survive.</p><p>Alone, once again.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>The church was packed. Everyone who lived in Holy Oaks must have been invited to the wedding, Nick decided as he stood in the back of the church, watching the people stream in. Several families tried to go upstairs, but the iron gate that led to the balcony was locked, and there was a hand-printed sign above simply stating, DO NOT ENTER. Some of them tried to jiggle the lock loose and go upstairs, but then they gave up and went searching for a seat inside the main church.</p><p>Two ushers were urging guests to move closer together so that more people could squeeze into the pews even as the mother of the bride was being escorted down to the front row.</p><p>Nick was trying to stay out of the way. Laurant was with the bridal party in the vestibule below the balcony. The door was open, but the bride couldn\u2019t be seen. Nick watched Laurant open the closet door and put her purse on the shelf inside. She caught his eye as she was turning around, gave him a hesitant smile, and then walked out of sight.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s father had partially closed the double doors leading into the church so that the wedding party could line up and not be seen. He stood with his hand on the doorknob, peeking inside as he waited for Father Tom to come out of the sacristy and take his place in front of the altar. Worried and flustered that he would forget what he was supposed to do or that he would trip on his daughter\u2019s dress and send her flying, he began to pant with anxiety. In a few minutes, he was going to be giving his only daughter away. He reached into the vest pocket of his rented tux and pulled out his handkerchief. It was while he was mopping his brow that he remembered the Vanderman sisters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, good Lord,\u201d he whispered loudly.</p><p>His daughter heard him. She saw the panic on her father\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Daddy? Did someone faint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot the Vanderman sisters,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you can\u2019t go get them now. The wedding\u2019s starting.\u201d</p> <p>Her father frantically looked around for help, spotted Nick, and grabbed him. \u201cCould you please go and get Bessie Jean and Viola? They\u2019re probably waiting on the curb, and I\u2019ll never hear the end of it if they miss this wedding.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t want to leave Laurant, but he was the only available man or woman in the vestibule who wasn\u2019t in the wedding. He knew it would only take him a couple of minutes to drive down the hill and back, yet he still resisted.</p><p>Laurant saw his hesitation. She got out of line and hurried over to him, her silk skirt rustling about her ankles. \u201cYou won\u2019t miss anything,\u201d she said loud enough for Michelle\u2019s father to hear. Then she leaned closer and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s over, remember? You don\u2019t have to worry about me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he agreed reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019ll go in just a minute, after you walk down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you hurry\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to watch you walk down that aisle,\u201d he said a bit more abruptly than he\u2019d intended. In truth, what he wanted was to make sure she was in Noah\u2019s capable hands before he left the church.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to argue further, had that been her inclination. He slipped inside the church and hurriedly walked along the back wall to the south corner so that he was directly in line with the sacristy. He was waiting for Tommy and Noah to come out so that he could get Noah\u2019s attention.</p><p>A hush of expectancy fell over the crowd. Then Tommy walked out, and with a noisy clatter, the guests got to their feet. Tommy was wearing his ceremonial white and gold robes, and he was smiling as he slowly made his way around the altar to take his place at the top of the three steps in front of the main aisle. Once he was in position, he folded his hands, then glanced at the pianist and nodded.</p><p>The second the music started, the crowd turned in unison to the double doors, craning their necks and shifting for the best view when the bride appeared at the entrance.</p><p>Noah had followed Tommy out onto the altar, but he stayed in the background by the sacristy door with his arms folded across his chest. His hands were hidden inside the sleeves of his black cassock, his right hand curled around the butt of his Glock as he slowly scanned the audience.</p><p>Nick raised his hand and motioned to Noah. The first bridesmaid had just started walking toward Tommy when Noah went down the side steps and crossed to the side aisle heading for Nick.</p> <p>By the time he reached the corner where Nick was waiting, the second bridesmaid had just stepped into the main aisle.</p><p>\u201cI got stuck doing an errand,\u201d Nick said. \u201cOnce Laurant\u2019s down at the altar, I\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll only be gone a couple of minutes, but I need you to cover her and Tommy until I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he assured him. \u201cI won\u2019t let either one of them out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked relieved. \u201cI know I\u2019m being stubborn about this . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ve got to go with your gut,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019d trust your instinct over Wesson\u2019s hard evidence any day of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m only going to be gone five, ten minutes tops.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded toward the back doors. \u201cThere\u2019s Laurant. Lord, she\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in church, Noah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, but man oh man, does she look . . . good.\u201d</p><p>Nick barely glanced at her. While Noah slowly made his way back to the altar\u2014getting waylaid by young women who grabbed hold of his hand to say hello as he passed their pews\u2014Nick searched the faces in the crowd.</p><p>Nick spotted Willie and Mark near the front. Neither one of the men had shaved, but they had changed their clothes to short-sleeved shirts and ties. They, too, focused their complete attention on Laurant.</p><p>As soon as she reached Tommy and turned to join the other bridesmaids at the bottom of the steps, Nick went out the side door. He ran to his car, cursing loudly when he saw that the parking lot was crammed with cars blocking his exit. He got inside, started the motor, and then drove over the curb, and down the manicured lawn, trying to avoid the flower beds brimming with impatiens and rosebushes.</p><p>He went at a snail\u2019s pace until he reached the main driveway. Then he floored it and sped down the street. He was fighting the instinct to turn around and go back to the church. He tried to reason away the panicky feeling. Laurant and Tommy were safe with Noah. He wasn\u2019t going to let anything happen to them. As long as they were in church, they were okay. The ceremony and the mass would take about an hour, depending on how long Tommy\u2019s sermon ran. Even if Nick was delayed, everything would be fine.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be so tense if he had the results of the damned reports. What was taking so long? Nick thought about calling Pete now to find out if he knew anything more, but then he changed his mind. He knew Pete would call him the second he had the information.</p><p>He was going sixty by the time he reached the Vandermans\u2019 street and had to brake hard to come to a screeching stop in front of their driveway. The car was still rocking as Nick shoved the gear into park. Bessie Jean and Viola were waiting on the sidewalk. He left the motor running as he jumped out and ran around to the other side to open the back door for them. He noticed Viola was holding a large plastic container but didn\u2019t want to waste time asking her what it was. Besides, Bessie Jean was lacing into him, irritated that she was missing the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI just hate to be tardy. I don\u2019t like to be late for anything, not even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be helped,\u201d Nick said, cutting into her complaints. \u201cLet\u2019s go, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might as well take our time now,\u201d Viola said. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed the bride walking down to meet the groom, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course we have, Sister. The wedding was set to start at seven o\u2019clock, and it\u2019s after that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get in the car, ladies,\u201d Nick urged, trying to hold on to his patience.</p><p>Viola wasn\u2019t going to be rushed. \u201cNicholas, will you be a dear and run this cake across the street? Put it in the kitchen, please. The boys aren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at the wedding,\u201d Bessie Jean said. \u201cThey probably got there in plenty of time too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI baked the cake for Justin,\u201d Viola said, \u201cbecause he helped with the flower bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you take it over tomorrow?\u201d Nick asked, his frustration near the boiling point.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, it will go stale,\u201d Viola said. \u201cI would carry it over, but I\u2019m wearing my brand-new patent leather shoes, and they\u2019re pinching my toes. It won\u2019t take you but a minute,\u201d she added as she held the cake out to him.</p><p>It was quicker to do what she asked than stand on the curb arguing with her. Nick grabbed the cake out of her hands and ran across the street.</p><p>\u201cI told you to wear sensible shoes, but you never listen to me,\u201d Bessie Jean chided Viola.</p><p>Nick crossed the yard and ran up the stone steps. He wanted to leave the cake at the front door, but he knew Viola was watching, and if he didn\u2019t follow her instructions, she might nag him into going back.</p><p>What a pain in the ass, he thought as he shoved the door open. It was dark inside, and cool, the only sound the gentle hum of the central air conditioner kicking on. He crossed the cluttered living room, stepping on old newspapers and discarded pizza boxes and empty beer cans littering the floor. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a cockroach scurry into one of the boxes. He noticed the beer cans and bottles on all the tables and on the carpet by the coffee table, that also was piled high with old newspapers and empty beer cans. On top of the stack of papers was a large pink and yellow seashell, obviously meant to be decorative, but instead being used as an ash-tray. The shell was overflowing with cigarette and cigar butts, and the air in the room was rank and stale.</p><p>The place was a pigsty. The dining room table was covered with an old, torn, paint-splattered tarp, and on top were several unopened cans of house paint and a couple of big plastic sacks from the local hardware store with paintbrushes sticking out. A swinging door connected the dining room to the kitchen, exactly like the one in Laurant\u2019s house. Nick pushed the door open and then stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The first thing that struck him was the pungent smell. It was strong, acrid . . . familiar. Whatever the stringent combination was, it made his eyes tear and his throat burn. Unlike the other rooms, the kitchen wasn\u2019t cluttered. No, it was immaculate. The counters were bare, spotless, shining . . . like another kitchen he\u2019d been in. Recognition was sudden. He remembered the odor . . . vinegar and ammonia . . . and he remembered exactly where he\u2019d smelled it before. His gaze frantically searched the kitchen. Truth slammed into him like a wrecking ball. Everything clicked into place. He dropped the cake and instinctively reached for his gun as he whirled around toward the table, guessing before he looked what he was going to find. There in the center of the table, placed neatly between the salt and pepper shakers, was an extra large, clear plastic, quart-size jar of antacid tablets. Pink. The tablets were pink, just like he remembered. And right beside the jar sat a tall, narrow-necked bottle of red hot sauce. The only thing missing was the cocker spaniel trembling in the corner.</p><p>\u201cLaurant!\u201d He lunged through the doorway. He had to get back to the abbey before it was too late. As he ran through the living room, he crashed into the coffee table, overturning it. He leapt over the legs and ripped the front door open. The church. The bastard was going to grab her when she left the church. Shoving the gun back into his holster, he raced to get to the phone in his car.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t waste valuable time trying to reach the closest authorities. Pete could sound the alarm and get him help while Nick and Noah protected Tommy and Laurant\u2014the pawns in Heartbreaker\u2019s deadly game.</p><p>He reached the street, shouted to Bessie Jean, \u201cGo inside and call the Nugent sheriff. Tell him to get every available man to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>He dove into the car, leaving the door open as he reached over to pull a Glock and another magazine out of the glove compartment. He grabbed the phone and continued to shout at the stunned ladies watching him. \u201cGo,\u201d he screamed. \u201cAnd tell them to come armed.\u201d</p><p>He jerked the gear into drive and slammed his foot down on the gas pedal. The momentum shut the door as the car shot forward. He punched the speed dial for Pete\u2019s cell phone. He knew he always carried it and that the only time the power was turned off was when he was home or in the air.</p><p>He got his voice mail on the first ring. Shouting a blasphemy, Nick disconnected, then hit the speed dial for Pete\u2019s home number. As he raced up the hill, going seventy miles an hour now, he chanted into the phone, \u201cCome on, come on, come on.\u201d</p><p>One ring. Two rings. Then on the third ring, Pete answered the phone.</p><p>Nick shouted, \u201cIt isn\u2019t Brenner. It\u2019s Stark. He\u2019s using Laurant to get to me. It was a setup from the very beginning. He\u2019s going to kill her and Tommy. Get some help, Pete. We\u2019re all targets.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Donald Stark, known to the residents of Holy Oaks as that nice, polite farmer, Justin Brady, was crouched down below the railing of the choir loft, waiting and watching for his opportunity. Oh, how he had planned for this day. The celebration was finally at hand. It was going to be his moment of glory, and Nicholas Buchanan\u2019s day of reckoning.</p><p>His good mood was being sorely tested now, though, by Nicholas. The mule was, in fact, making Stark quite frantic. Trying to ruin all of his wonderful plans by making him waste time worrying.</p><p>Once again he slowly inched up over the wall and searched the crowd below. He could feel the rage building inside and fought to contain it. All in good time, he promised himself. And then he looked again. Where had the mule disappeared to? After searching through the crowd a third time, Stark concluded he wasn\u2019t in the church. Where oh where could he have gone? And then the thought occurred to him that perhaps the mule was standing in the back, under the balcony.</p><p>Stark had to be sure. He decided he would have to risk it and sneak downstairs to look for himself. He had to be certain. Had to, had to, had to. It was imperative that the mule attend the celebration. He was the guest of honor, after all.</p><p>Keeping his head down, Stark crawled back to the bench where he\u2019d put the key to the iron gate. He was reaching up to grab it when he heard the screech of tires. Scrambling over to the window, he peered out just as the mule\u2019s green Explorer came barreling up the driveway.</p><p>Stark grinned. \u201cGood things come to those who wait,\u201d he whispered. Then he sighed. Everything was back on schedule. The guest of honor would be strolling into the church any minute now.</p><p>He picked up the rifle, adjusted the scope, and then got into position, hunched down on his knees beside the tripod.</p><p>The video camera was focused on the altar, and he reached up and pushed the button to start the tape. Timing was everything, of course. What good was killing Father Tom and Laurant if the mule wasn\u2019t there to watch? No good at all, Stark reasoned. He was determined to get both the murders on film too\u2014how could he boast that he had bested the FBI if he didn\u2019t have the goods to prove it? Stark knew he was smarter than all the mules put together, and soon now, very soon, the world would know it too. The tape would mock them, prove their incompetence, humiliate them in the same way that Nicholas had humiliated him.</p><p>\u201cYou messed with the wrong man,\u201d he whispered, his voice shimmering with hate. His fingers curled around the smooth barrel. He could feel the power under his fingertips growing stronger, more potent with each caress.</p><p>And still he waited for the pretty boy priest to finish the wedding ceremony and go up the steps and get back behind the altar table to start mass. Stark had done his homework. He knew exactly where everyone in the wedding party would be sitting. He\u2019d been pretending to be working in the balcony while the rehearsal was going on, and he knew that the bride and groom, the best man, and the maid of honor were going to follow the priest up on the altar and sit in chairs, like royalty, slightly behind the altar table and to the right, against the north wall. Both brother and sister would be center stage in the camera\u2019s lens.</p><p>It was going to be perfect. He would kill Tommy boy first\u2014one shot through the center of his forehead that would look absolutely marvelous on film. And while Nicholas was still reeling from the shock\u2014who wouldn\u2019t, after witnessing his best friend\u2019s death\u2014Stark would swing the rifle to the right and kill Laurant. The camera would be capturing her reaction to her brother\u2019s death. Stark pictured the look of horror in her eyes the scant second before he killed her, and he smiled again. It was going to be delicious. Bam, bam, thank you, ma\u2019am. He\u2019d get the brother and sister before the crowd had time to react. Stark was counting on the guests to panic and stampede their way like cows to the doors. He needed the pandemonium to give him time to get downstairs through the trapdoor he\u2019d built in the floor behind the organ. He\u2019d land in the closet off the vestibule, get outside through the front window, and blend in with all the hysterical men and women. He might even decide to have a little more fun and do some screaming too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo much to do, so little time,\u201d he whispered. For, in those precious two or three seconds, maybe even as many as four, before the crowd swelled from their seats, he was going to try to kill Willie and Mark. They were seated next to the main aisle, six rows from the front. Stark knew he was being greedy, but he didn\u2019t care. He had to get rid of them. He\u2019d been fantasizing about it for as long as he\u2019d had to endure living with them. His housemates were pigs. Vile, filthy pigs. He couldn\u2019t abide the thought of letting such garbage continue to pollute the world. No, that wasn\u2019t an option. They had to die, and if he couldn\u2019t kill them today, then he would come back and get them later. He wouldn\u2019t bother to film their deaths, however, for like the whore, Tiffany, Willie and Mark weren\u2019t worthy enough to be remembered.</p><p>He stifled a girlish giggle as he thought about the garage door opener he\u2019d made such clever adjustments to. It was clipped to the visor in his van. No one would notice it or give it a second thought. It wasn\u2019t going to open any garage doors. No, sirree. One push of the button, and wham, bam. News at eleven.</p><p>Are we having fun yet? Oh, yes, yes indeed.</p><p>Because of Michelle\u2019s metal leg brace, she wasn\u2019t able to kneel, and for that reason Tommy married the couple at the beginning of the ceremony instead of waiting until the middle of the mass, as was the usual custom. He had great hopes for this couple. Christopher was a good, decent man and very levelheaded. He believed in marriage and commitment, as did his lovely bride. Both of them had endured hardships in the past and had survived with grace and dignity, and Tommy knew that they would fight to keep their vows to each other when they hit those inevitable rocky patches.</p> <p>It was a joy to marry them. He smiled as Christopher put the wedding ring on Michelle\u2019s finger. Her hand was trembling so, it took the groom two tries. Christopher was as steady as an old oak.</p><p>Tommy gave the blessing and then turned to go up the stairs. The choir began to sing \u201cO Precious Love.\u201d While the other members of the wedding party quietly filed into the front pews, the bride and groom, flanked by the best man and the maid of honor, followed Tommy up to the altar. Crossing behind him, they walked to the chairs against the wall and took their seats. Laurant straightened the long train on Michelle\u2019s wedding dress and then sat down next to her. None of them would get up again until communion was served.</p><p>The two altar boys, cousins on Michelle\u2019s side of the family, sat on the opposite side of the altar by the sacristy door. Noah stood beside them. As Tommy was coming around the altar, he noticed Noah slouching against the wall. He frowned at him and, cupping his hand at his side, motioned for him to stand tall. Noah immediately complied.</p><p>Tommy turned to the congregation then. He bowed his head, braced his hands on the cool marble top, and then slowly genuflected.</p><p>And that was when he noticed the flowers. There, tucked under the altar was a beautiful crystal vase filled with white lilies. Tommy assumed the flowers had been placed there by the florist to get them out of the way while the altar was being prepared for the wedding ceremony. Whoever had put the white linen cloth across the marble top had simply forgotten to put the flowers back. Tommy bent down and leaned in to pick up the vase, but as he was lifting it, he saw the tiny, pin-size, red light blinking at him.</p> <p>Puzzled, he leaned in to get a closer look. Then he saw the oblong block attached underneath the altar top. It was about the size of a brick covered in a mass of gray duct tape. There were red and white and blue wires protruding from the tape, and in the center was a red light.</p><p>He knew exactly what he was looking at now. It was a bomb. And from the size of it, Tommy thought there was enough there to blow the church apart. The blinking red light indicated the bomb had already been activated.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he whispered, so stunned he couldn\u2019t move. His heart felt as though it had just stopped. His immediate reaction was to jump up and shout a warning, but he was able to stop himself in time. Stay calm. Yes, he had to stay calm. The last thing he wanted to do was cause a panic. He let go of the vase, then grabbed it before it toppled over. His hands were shaking violently now, and he could feel the sweat beading on his forehead.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name should he do? Still down on one knee, he half turned toward Noah and motioned for him to come to him.</p><p>Noah saw Tommy\u2019s stricken expression and immediately hurried toward him. He thought Tommy was sick. His complexion was as gray as the marble.</p><p>Tommy had to grip the edge of the altar to get to his feet. All he could think about was getting the congregation outside. His mind raced. He hadn\u2019t been down on his knee for more than four, five seconds at the most, but it was still long enough for the crowd to wonder what he was doing. He held on to the altar top with one hand, grabbed the vase with the other, and stood up just as Noah reached him. Tommy forced a smile on his face, put the flowers on the altar, next to the microphone, and then stepped back. He didn\u2019t want the microphone to pick up his whisper when he told Noah what he had found.</p> <p>Noah moved to stand in front of Tommy with his back to the congregation. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Tommy leaned close and whispered into his hear, \u201cThere\u2019s a bomb under the altar.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He simply nodded as he whispered, \u201cLet me have a look.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned toward the crowd, made a hasty sign of the cross the way Tommy had taught him, and knelt down. He wanted the congregation to think he was participating in the ceremony. Bowing his head, he ducked lower and leaned in. \u201cLord,\u201d he whispered. He\u2019d wanted to see what he was dealing with, his hope that it was a simple, homemade device that could easily be dismantled. No such luck. One glance told him the explosive was damned complex, too complex for him to deal with. It would take an expert to figure out which wires to clip, and where in God\u2019s name were they going to find an explosives expert in a town the size of Holy Oaks?</p><p>Noah pulled back and looked up at Tommy. \u201cCan\u2019t undo it.\u201d</p><p>As he raised to his feet, Tommy whispered. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got to get them all out of here. I\u2019ll get Christopher to help. You get the altar boys moving.\u201d</p><p>Tommy hurried toward the groom. He was halfway there when he stopped and motioned for Christopher to get up and come to him. He didn\u2019t want Michelle to hear what he was going to say. She was watching him closely, a puzzled look on her face, and then she leaned toward Laurant and whispered to her. Laurant shook her head slightly, indicating she didn\u2019t know what Tommy was doing.</p><p>In a low, urgent whisper, Tommy said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem here, and I need your help getting everyone outside. There\u2019s a bomb under the altar. We don\u2019t want a panic,\u201d he added when he heard Christopher\u2019s drawn-in breath. \u201cWe can do this. They\u2019ll follow you and Michelle. Now go,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>\u201cThe grotto,\u201d Christopher whispered. \u201cTell everyone to follow us to the grotto, like I\u2019ve got a surprise for Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, good,\u201d Tommy whispered. He quickly turned around and headed back to the altar. Adjusting the microphone, he took a breath and said, \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, Christopher has a surprise for Michelle. Please follow the bride and groom to the grotto at the bottom of the hill.\u201d</p><p>Christopher had already reached Michelle before Tommy began his announcement. She looked quite stunned when he pulled her to her feet, then swept her up into his arms.</p><p>\u201cChristopher, what are you doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust smile, honey. We have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Michelle wrapped her arms around his shoulders and smiled as he had instructed. She whispered, \u201cAm I going to like this surprise?\u201d</p><p>Christopher didn\u2019t answer her. He strode across the altar, down the steps, and up the center aisle.</p><p>His enthusiasm made Laurant smile. Christopher was practically running. She and David, the best man, waited until Tommy had finished his announcement. Then they stood. Laurant slipped her arm through David\u2019s and followed the bride and groom, but at a much more sedate pace.</p><p>A murmur rolled through the crowd, and it became quite noisy as the wedding guests gathered up their possessions, kicked the kneelers back, and stood up to file out of the church.</p><p>Stark couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. They were leaving. No, his mind screamed. This was not acceptable. No one could leave. What surprise was the priest babbling about? Leaving early wasn\u2019t part of the rehearsal. The grotto? Why were they going to the grotto? What had he missed? His mind was speeding now, his thoughts getting jumbled together in his mind. Not acceptable. Laurant. She was leaving too. No, No, No. She\u2019s walking across the altar now. Tom first, then Laurant. Like he planned. But the mule, the mule had to see it happen.</p><p>The priest was speaking into the microphone again. \u201cThose of you who are close to the side doors should go out that way. It will save time,\u201d he added.</p><p>Stark, shaking with fury, could feel his control slipping away, disintegrating, but then, just as he was about to leap to his feet and start shooting, he saw the side door open, and there he was, the mule himself, trying to get inside as the crowd was pushing out. Nicholas had finally arrived. \u201cThere now, there now, it\u2019s all right now,\u201d he whispered. He felt like shouting with joy. He was so thrilled to see the mule, he wanted to wave to him. Good to see you, Nicholas. Yes, sirree.</p><p>There was still time . . . show time . . . if he acted quickly. Swinging his rifle up, he went for his first target. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. Don\u2019t laugh,\u201d he whispered, but the thrill was so exquisite, he didn\u2019t know if he could stop himself. He looked through the scope as he slipped his finger on the trigger. Gentle now. Gentle now. Wait for it.</p><p>Noah had just nudged the altar boys toward the side door and was turning to intercept Laurant before she reached the center aisle. He wasn\u2019t about to let her out of his sight. She would leave with Tommy and him.</p><p>He was about twelve feet away from Tommy when he saw the beam of light bouncing across the wall. He instantly reacted. \u201cGun!\u201d he shouted as he pulled his own weapon from his sleeve and raced toward Tommy. His attention was focused on the choir loft as he fired at the source of the light.</p><p>Nick had seen the laser beam skipping across the altar toward Tommy just as Noah shouted the warning. \u201cGet down!\u201d he yelled as he shoved his way through the startled crowd.</p><p>Tommy didn\u2019t have time to react. He heard a spitting sound, and a chunk of the altar splintered into the air. One second Noah and Nick were shouting, and the next, Noah was firing his gun at the balcony as he made a diving leap at Tommy and knocked him to the floor. Noah\u2019s head struck the edge of the marble top as they went down, and then he fell like a dead weight on top of him. Tommy pushed himself free and scrambled to get the unconscious Noah behind cover. As he struggled to pull him back, Tommy saw the blood pouring from Noah\u2019s left shoulder.</p><p>The screams from the crowd, frantic to get out of the church, pierced the air. The aisles were crammed with hysterical men and women. Nick had his Sig Sauer in his right hand, and as he pushed forward, knocking people out of his way, he reached behind him under his jacket and pulled out the loaded Glock from his waistband. He leapt onto a pew and opened fire. Running along the tops of the benches, he fired the guns in succession, trying to keep the bastard pinned down.</p><p>Stark ducked behind the railing. What was happening? The blond-headed priest had pulled out a gun and started shooting at him, and he\u2019d been able to get off only a few shots. He\u2019d seen Father Tom go down, then the other priest, and he was sure he\u2019d hit both of them.</p><p>Now he had to get Laurant. Stark inched the gun up and got her in his sights. She was down on her knees at the bottom of the altar steps. She was struggling to get up when he fired. She went down again, but he couldn\u2019t tell where the bullet had struck her. Gunshots were blazing away at him. He dropped the rifle and scrambled on his belly to get to the trapdoor. The videotape. He had to get the tape. The air around him sizzled with bullets. One nearly got him in his hand as he reached for the video camera. Couldn\u2019t get it, but he couldn\u2019t leave without it. Stark crawled to the outlet next to the organ, then jerked the cord. Gunfire and screams ricocheted around him. The camera crashed to the floor, shattering, and he reeled it toward him. A second later, he had the tape. He shoved it into the pocket of his windbreaker, zipped it closed, and then scrambled behind the organ and lifted the trapdoor. Swinging his feet in first, he slid down onto the ledge he\u2019d built in the ceiling below. Then he reached up, pulled the trapdoor closed, and slipped the bolt in place.</p><p>There was so much noise he didn\u2019t worry about anyone hearing him kick through the ceiling. He landed in the closet, opened the door, and peeked out. No one was inside the vestibule, but he could see the swarm of people pushing and shoving to get out the front doors. Stark decided to blend in with the mob. He ran through the vestibule and then elbowed his way into the crowd. An old woman grabbed his arm to keep from being pitched forward, and gentleman that he was, he wrapped his arm around her and helped her outside.</p><p>He glanced back once and had to fight the laughter. Nicholas was probably still fighting the crowd, trying to get to the iron gate. Eventually, he\u2019d make it up the stairs, but would he find the trapdoor? Stark didn\u2019t think so. It had been so cleverly designed. He could just picture the mule standing there, scratching his head in puzzlement. Where oh where had Justin Brady gone? Yes, that\u2019s who the mule would be looking for, but when Nicholas next saw him, Stark was sure the FBI agent wouldn\u2019t recognize him. The beard would be gone, the farmer\u2019s haircut would be longer, styled, and dyed a different color. He\u2019d also change the color of his eyes, maybe green or blue. He had such a nice collection of contacts to choose from, every color of the rainbow at his disposal.</p><p>Stark believed he was the master of disguises. Subtle changes, that was the ticket. Nothing dramatic, just a little of this and a little of that to make a world of difference. Why, his own mother wouldn\u2019t have recognized him today if he\u2019d walked up to her and tapped her on her shoulder. Of course, Mother Millicent wasn\u2019t seeing much of anything these days, rotting as she was in her backyard under the petunias she was so partial to. Still, if she could see him in his farmer\u2019s getup, Stark was sure she\u2019d get a kick out of it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let go of the old woman on his arm but dragged her along with him as he turned the corner. He kept close to the building so that when the mule got up to the loft, he wouldn\u2019t see him if he looked out the window.</p><p>The hag was crying. He reached the side door where the crowd was spilling out of the church, and she started to resist. \u201cLet me go. I have to find my husband. Help me find him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shoved her away from him and watched her fall into the bushes. Then he moved on, pushing his way through the throng of people and turning again to make sure the mule wasn\u2019t hot on his trail.</p><p>He let out a low squeal. Father Tom was rushing outside, and the crowd was parting for him. He was carrying the other priest. Tom\u2019s white vestments were bloody, but Tom didn\u2019t look any the worse for wear. And Laurant. God Almighty, she was coming out of the door with him.</p><p>He was so shocked to see that both of them were still alive and kicking, he almost shouted at them. He recoiled against the wall, his shoulders pressing into the cold stone. What to do? What to do? No time to plan, no time at all, but he had to do something before the opportunity slipped away.</p><p>A crowd surrounded Tom now. Stark watched as he slowly lowered the other priest to the grass, then knelt over him and whispered into the dying priest\u2019s ear. Praying for him, no doubt, as if that would do any good.</p> <p>Only, the priest he\u2019d shot wasn\u2019t a priest, was he? He had a gun. He was a mule, a pretender. How dare they trick him? How dare they? He was a mule all right. But now he was dying.</p><p>Stark desperately wanted to kill Tom, yet he knew he couldn\u2019t get a clear shot at him\u2014too many people running around like chickens with their heads cut off.</p><p>He turned his attention to Laurant. Easy pickings, he thought. She was standing by the door, against the wall, trying to stay out of the way, but every couple of seconds she turned to try to look inside. She wasn\u2019t more than thirty feet away from him. He slowly crept forward. She looked dazed, and that gave him an added advantage.</p><p>He pulled the gun out of his pocket and hid it inside his jacket.</p><p>\u201cLaurant,\u201d he shouted her name and tried to sound pitiful. He doubled over, his head down, but he peeked up at her as he called out to her again.</p> <p>\u201cLaurant, I\u2019ve been shot. Please help me.\u201d He staggered closer. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Laurant heard Justin Brady call her name, and without a second\u2019s hesitation, she started toward him.</p><p>He pretended to stumble. Then he groaned loudly. An Academy Award. He should get an award for his flawless performance.</p><p>Laurant took a step in Justin\u2019s direction and a sting pinched the calf of her right leg. Most likely she\u2019d cut herself when she\u2019d been thrown to the floor by one of the bridesmaids trying to push ahead of her into the aisle. She could feel blood trickling down into her shoe.</p><p>She was limping but moved as fast as she could. When she was about fifteen feet away from him, she suddenly stopped. Something wasn\u2019t quite right. She heard Nick\u2019s voice inside her head. Don\u2019t believe anything anyone tells you. And that\u2019s when she glanced down and saw what was wrong.</p><p>Justin watched her take a step back, away from him. He had his right hand inside his jacket, holding his gun flush against his side. He kept stumbling toward her, half doubled over, trying to look as though he were in terrible pain.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t buying it. What was she staring at? His hand. She was staring at his hand. He looked down and then he saw it. The surgical glove. He had forgotten to remove the surgical gloves. Jolted by his own carelessness, he ran at her like a charging bull. She was turning to run away, shouting for Nicholas, when he slammed the butt of his gun against the base of her skull, silencing her scream.</p><p>Hurry, his mind told him. Get her, get her, get her. She was unconscious, falling, but he caught her around the waist before she hit the ground and dragged her back, and around the corner of the building. People were still pouring out of the church, and there were clusters of men and women and children in the parking lot, but no one tried to stop him. Did they see what he was doing? Did they see the gun pressed against Laurant\u2019s chest? The barrel was pointed upward, the muzzle under her chin. If anyone dared interfere, Stark knew exactly what he would do. He would blow her pretty little head off.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to die, not yet anyway. He might have to make a few adjustments, but he still had such grand plans for her. After he locked her in the trunk of his other car\u2014the old souped-up Buick that none of the mules knew belonged to him\u2014he\u2019d drive somewhere safe and tie her up. There were lots of abandoned cabins up in this neck of the woods. He knew he\u2019d find the perfect spot easily. He\u2019d leave her there trussed up like a turkey with a gag in her mouth, and then he\u2019d go shopping. Yes sir, that\u2019s what he was going to do. He\u2019d buy another video camera\u2014high quality, of course, only the best would do\u2014and he\u2019d purchase at lease a dozen videotapes as well. Sony if they had them, because the resolution was oh, so much better. And then he would return to his sweet Laurant and film her death. He\u2019d try to keep her alive for as long as he could, but when the inevitable occurred and the light went out of her eyes\u2014and it would\u2014he would rewind the tape and relive the glorious execution. Stark knew from past experience that he would spend hours and hours watching and rewatching the tape until he had every twitch, every scream, every plea memorized. Only when he was completely satisfied would he be able to rest.</p><p>Once he had disposed of her body in the woods, he would go home. He would make copies of the tapes and send them to everyone he wanted to impress. Nicholas would get one for a keepsake, a reminder of how impotent he had been, daring to go up against the master. Another tape would be sent to the head of the FBI. The director might want to use the gift as a training tape for future mules. Stark would, of course, keep several for his own personal library\u2014even the best tapes eventually wore out after all\u2014and the last tape he would make would be auctioned on the Internet. Although he wasn\u2019t driven by the almighty dollar, a nice nest egg would give him the freedom to go searching for another perfect partner, and this tape would bring a fortune. There was a large following out there surfing the Internet with similar tastes in voyeurism.</p><p>Laurant lay slumped on the ground next to the van while Stark got his keys out. No one could see them, tucked in as they were between two other cars. He unlocked the door, slid the panel back, and then lifted Laurant and threw her inside. As he pulled the door closed, her long skirt got caught, but he was in too much of a hurry now to open the door again. He knew he was being sloppy, but that couldn\u2019t be helped. Things were changing so quickly\u2014and then there was also his own forgetfulness with the gloves. He ran around to the driver\u2019s side, saw the ambulance threading its way up the drive, trying to get through the crowd and the cars. The siren was blasting away.</p><p>Stark knew he couldn\u2019t get down the driveway, which was the only exit. \u201cNot to worry,\u201d he whispered. He started the motor and slowly edged the van over the curb. Then he gunned the engine. The van lurched forward and crashed into the rosebushes. A thorny branch flew up against the window, and Stark instinctively ducked, as though it were going to slice through the windshield and strike him. He was all but standing on the gas petal now, pushing down with all of his weight. The van raced down the grassy slope, bouncing and rocking along. Stark felt like he was flying.</p><p>He glanced in the rearview mirror and then began to laugh. No one was following him. He was as safe as a bug in a rug.</p><p>Should he do it now? Blow them all to kingdom come? The detonator was just above his forehead, clipped like a real garage door opener to the visor.</p> <p>No, he wanted Laurant to watch the fireworks. He decided to stick with his original plan then. He\u2019d blow up the abbey on his way out of town. He\u2019d already picked the spot. Best seat in the house, at the top of the hill outside of town. He\u2019d be able to see every brick explode. And oh, what a sight that was going to be. My God, he ought to film that too. Send it to all the television stations. News at eleven. Yes, sirree . . .</p><p>\u201cGreen-eyed girl, won\u2019t you wake up and play. Wake up and play . . . Laurant, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at his watch and was shocked at how little time had passed. Then he heard the screech of tires, and his head snapped up. He looked in the rearview mirror and saw the green Explorer at the top of the hill. The SUV was soaring through the air, the front tires coming down as Stark watched in disbelief. His rage was uncontrollable. \u201cNot acceptable,\u201d he screamed as he pounded his fist against the steering wheel.</p><p>The van careened onto the main street, sideswiped a parked car, and slid into a spin sideways. Stark slammed his foot down on the gas pedal, sped forward, and fishtailed around the next corner. He was going eighty now as he raced toward the park. The van almost turned over as he took another corner on two wheels, but it righted itself as he swung the wheel hard to the left. He turned yet another corner and there it was, the back entrance to the park through the preserve.</p><p>The mule wasn\u2019t behind him now, and Stark was certain he\u2019d lost him. Giggling, he slowed down and entered through the joggers\u2019 path. The van bounced along the black tarred surface, the left wheels gliding on smooth surface and the right wheels grinding over rocks at the edge of the path.</p><p>He thought he heard Laurant groan. He had to stop himself from leaping over the seat and tearing her skin to shreds with his bare hands. The rage was getting stronger, and the thoughts were coming so fast now, he was having trouble concentrating. He reached up to adjust the mirror so he could watch her. She was huddled in a ball on her side with her back to him, and she wasn\u2019t moving. His mind was playing tricks on him, convinced now that she hadn\u2019t groaned. He\u2019d only imagined it.</p><p>He was so busy watching her, he almost drove the van into the lake. He swerved back onto the road, then adjusted the mirror again so he could see behind him. Because of the angle the path took, he had to slow the van down even more. He couldn\u2019t slow his mind though. He glanced over his shoulder to look at Laurant again, but it wasn\u2019t Laurant that he saw. It was the whore, Tiffany. He shook his head. Then, just as suddenly, it was Laurant again.</p><p>He wanted to stop and close his eyes. He wanted time to clear his mind and get organized again. He had to be organized. He was a planner, meticulous down to the very last detail. He didn\u2019t like surprises. That\u2019s why he was so rattled, he decided.</p><p>The surprise of seeing the blond priest leap in front of Tommy boy. The priest with the gun, shooting at him. The priest who wasn\u2019t a priest at all. Stark couldn\u2019t get over the fact that the mules, as stupid as they were, had actually tricked him. He\u2019d never considered, not for one second, that Tommy\u2019s friend was a mule in disguise.</p><p>Oh yes, that was why he was so rattled now. They had tricked him into making a mistake. He sighed then. He could feel himself becoming centered again. The thoughts weren\u2019t bombarding him. Control, that was the ticket. He was getting his control back.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he sang out to Laurant. He slowed the van so he could edge through the pines when he reached the main road that wound around the lake. Then he increased the speed again. The Buick was about two hundred yards away, parked between the trees behind the abandoned shack. He couldn\u2019t see it yet, but he knew it was where he\u2019d left it, ready and waiting.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he repeated. All he had to do was drive around the entrance to the park, then along the curve, and hide the van among the trees.</p><p>He had just reached the road to a cabin when he saw the green Explorer again. The SUV shot through the entrance of the park and then slowed to take the turn.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Stark slammed on the brakes. There wasn\u2019t time to back the van, turn it around, and try to outrun the mule. He couldn\u2019t go forward either. Nicholas would see him and block him. What to do? What to do? \u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d he chanted.</p><p>He threw the gear into park, grabbed his gun, and jumped out of the van. Because he\u2019d removed the door handles on the inside so that his lady friends couldn\u2019t escape while he was busy driving, he had to run around and open the door from outside.</p><p>He shoved the gun in his jacket and then reached with both hands to lift her. A new plan. Yes, a new plan. He could do it. He\u2019d get her inside, where it was nice and dark, and he\u2019d work on her there, with the doors locked. The mule would be outside, trying to get in, listening to Laurant\u2019s screams. The mule would make mistakes then. Yes, he would. And then Stark would kill him.</p><p>Laurant didn\u2019t come awake slowly or in a foggy daze. It was instantaneous. One second she was unconscious, and the next she was struggling to keep from screaming. She could feel the bile burning the back of her throat</p><p>She was inside his van. She didn\u2019t move for fear he would see her in the mirror or hear her groping around the floor for something to use as a weapon. She dared a quick look, saw the toolbox, but she\u2019d have to move to get it. It was against the back door. Could she get out that way? Swing the door open and jump? Where, where was the latch? She squinted in the darkness, and then she saw the gaping hole in the back door. The madman had taken the handles off. Why would he do that? Her feet were pressed against the side door, but she couldn\u2019t see if that handle had been removed as well unless she moved, and she didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>She was shaking now and tried to stop, terrified that he would notice and know she was awake. The van hit something in the road. She was lifted and then thrown into the back of the front seat. A second later, she was thrown back again when the van lurched forward. She felt cold metal against her chest. The safety pin was pressing into her skin. She fumbled to get it open. Her hands were trembling, so she almost dropped it, and she caught the whimper before it escaped. She unhooked it and then bent it until it was straight. She didn\u2019t know what she was going to do with it, but it was the only weapon she had. Maybe she could drive the pin through his throat. Tears stung her eyes. Her head hurt so much, it was an effort to think at all. Was he watching her now? Did he have a gun in his hand? Maybe she could jump him from behind, surprise him.</p><p>Ever so slowly she moved her legs up, thinking she could turn and spring upward, grab him by the neck, and then slam his head into the steering wheel. But something was holding her. Her skirt was caught. She was afraid to turn her head and look for fear that he would see.</p><p>The van suddenly came to a jarring stop. She did drop the safety pin then, but she grabbed it from the floor before she heard the door open. Where was he going? What was he going to do?</p><p>Oh God, he\u2019s coming for me.</p><p>She had to be ready. When he tried to get her out of the van, she would have to be ready. Frantic, her hands violently shaking now, she hooked the pin around her middle fingers, just above the knuckles. The metal fastener dug into her skin, tearing it as she hooked it there, anchored so that the long needle was sticking straight out. She cupped her left hand around it, trying to hide it.</p><p>Don\u2019t let him have his gun in his hand. Please, God, don\u2019t let him have the gun. She couldn\u2019t spring up and get him if he was holding the gun. He\u2019d kill her before she touched him. If he does, I\u2019ll wait. Make him carry me. He\u2019ll put the gun down if he has to carry me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The van moved when the side door was slid open. Her eyes were tightly closed, and she was trying not to cry as she silently prayed.</p><p>Help me, God, please help me . . .</p><p>She could hear his harsh breathing. He grabbed her by her hair and jerked her toward him. When he bent down to pull her out of the van, she opened her eyes and saw the gun. His fingers dug into her sides as he lifted her over his shoulder.</p><p>He was strong, terribly strong. He ran with her draped over his left shoulder as though she weighed no more than a speck of dandruff on his collar. Laurant\u2019s eyes were wide open now, but she didn\u2019t dare lift her head for fear that he\u2019d feel the movement. As long as he thought she was unconscious, he wouldn\u2019t focus on her. She recognized the abbot\u2019s cabin up ahead.</p> <p>She heard a car coming toward them, then the madman\u2019s obscenity. He ran up the steps and then suddenly stopped.</p><p>She heard him jiggling the doorknob, but it was locked. A second later, a gunshot went off next to her ear. She flinched, and she was sure he felt it.</p><p>Stark was in such a state to get inside, he kicked the door and tore it from its hinges. He hit the wall switch, and two lamps, one on a credenza by the door and another on a table upstairs on the balcony, lit the cabin. Still holding her on his shoulder, he ran across the front room and into the kitchen. He put the gun down on the countertop and ripped the drawers open, throwing them to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d he cried out gleefully when he found the drawer of knives. He grabbed the biggest one there. A butcher knife. It looked old and dull, but he didn\u2019t care if it was sharp or not. The work he intended to do wasn\u2019t going to be meticulous. There simply wasn\u2019t time. This one would do nicely. Yes, sirree.</p><p>He grabbed his gun, then turned around and ran back into the living room, kicking drawers and utensils out of his path. When he reached the center of the room, he stopped and shrugged her off of him. She crashed into the coffee table, then hit the floor, her left side taking the brunt of the impact.</p> <p>He waited until she was down, then grabbed her by her hair again and jerked her up to her knees.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, bitch. I want you to look out the door. Look at the mule when he comes running in here to save you.\u201d</p><p>As he was speaking, Stark realized he had the butcher knife and the gun in the same hand. He let got of Laurant and switched the knife into his left hand. \u201cThere now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was I thinking? Can\u2019t shoot and cut with the same hand, now can I? Look at me, Laurant. See what I have for you?\u201d</p><p>She was still up on her knees, and he squatted down behind her. Her body would shield him from Nicholas\u2019s gun. He held the knife out in front of her face. \u201cNow what do you think I\u2019m going to do with this?\u201d</p><p>Although he hadn\u2019t expected an answer, he was still disappointed she didn\u2019t cry out when she saw the knife. She would though, once he started working on her. Oh yes, he knew how to get what he wanted. He was still the master. He jabbed her left arm with the knife and then chuckled with delight when she screamed. Blood spurted down her arm, thrilling him. Then he stabbed her again. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Keep screaming,\u201d he encouraged, his voice eerily high-pitched, manic with excitement. \u201cWe want Nicholas to hear you.\u201d</p><p>He squatted and waited. He braced her shoulders against his with his arm as he pointed the barrel of the gun at the open doorway. He kept his head down behind hers, but he peeked around her toward the door. He jabbed her again, just for fun, but she didn\u2019t cry out this time. He put the tip of the bloody knife against the side of her neck.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to be brave, Laurant? When I want you to scream, by God, you will.\u201d</p><p>He heard her whimper and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret. I won\u2019t shoot the mule right away. I want him to watch me kill you. Tit for tat,\u201d he sang. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking Nicholas so long? What\u2019s that boy up to? Maybe he\u2019s trying to sneak in through the kitchen door. Oops, there isn\u2019t one. He can\u2019t do that, can he?\u201d</p><p>Had he not been talking, he would have heard the faint creak above him. Nick had come in through the bedroom window. The tree branch had given way just as he grabbed hold of the window ledge, but the crashing noise he heard from inside covered the sounds he made.</p><p>The bedroom door was open, and Nick crept forward. He could see Laurant and Stark below the balcony, halfway across the room, facing the front door. Nick had his gun in his hand, and the Glock tucked into the back of his waistband.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get a clear shot at the bastard. If the bullet went through his body it would hit Laurant. He couldn\u2019t risk it. He couldn\u2019t go down the stairs either. Stark would see him. What the hell was he going to do?</p><p>Laurant looked up and saw the shadow on the ceiling. It moved ever so slightly, and she knew that Nicholas was upstairs. It was only a matter of time before the man behind her saw the shadow too.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this, Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. I have to listen for the car. I have to hear the mule coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were too quick for him. He must not have seen your van, and he turned north instead of south. He\u2019s on the other side of the lake.\u201d</p><p>Stark strained to hear footsteps on the gravel outside, but he was smiling. \u201cYes, I was quick, wasn\u2019t I? A mule can\u2019t outsmart me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the mules the FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019re a very clever girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She had to keep him talking. Keep him focused on what she was saying so he wouldn\u2019t look up. \u201cNot as clever as you. Why did you choose me? Why do you hate me?\u201d</p><p>He drew his thumb down the side of her face. The rubber glove was cold. \u201cHush that talk. I don\u2019t hate you. I love you,\u201d he crooned. \u201cBut I\u2019m a heartbreaker. I break hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why me?\u201d she persisted. Her head was down, but her eyes were looking up, watching the shadow slowly creep forward.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mule killed my wife, and then he bragged about it in the newspapers. Oh yes, that\u2019s what he did. All that time and energy training her was wasted. She was almost worthy. I sought perfection, and she was getting there. Yes, she was almost perfect. Then Nicholas killed her. They called him a hero. He ruined my life, and they called him a hero. They said he was oh so smart. I couldn\u2019t have that, now could I? I had to prove to the world that I was the master.\u201d</p><p>She cringed at the hate in his voice. She didn\u2019t have to ask him another question. He seemed to want to explain himself to her. The words were coming faster now. He wanted to tell her everything, to brag about how he had fooled the mules.</p><p>\u201cWhen I read the newspaper article and knew who had killed my wife, I had to retaliate. Don\u2019t you see? I was forced into it. Your brother was mentioned in that article, and I wanted to know more about good old Father Tom. I read that he and Nicholas had been best friends since they were little boys. At first, I thought I\u2019d kill Tom and then go after the mule\u2019s family, but then I thought, why give Nicholas the home advantage? Holy Oaks was the perfect town for what I had in mind. It\u2019s so nicely isolated. I did my research, found out everything I could about Tommy boy, and imagine my joy when I found out about you.</p><p>\u201cIt was Nicholas I was after all along,\u201d he said, snickering. \u201cUntil I met you. Then I wanted you too. When I met my wife, there was something about her that reminded me of my mother. You remind me of her too. There\u2019s a bit of perfection in you, Laurant. Had the circumstances been different, I would have trained you.</p><p>\u201cMother\u2019s gone now. There wasn\u2019t any reason to keep her alive. She had reached perfection, and I knew I had to act quickly.\u201d</p><p>The second he stopped, she blurted, \u201cWho was Millicent? Did she exist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so you listened to the confession tape, did you?\u201d</p><p>Laurant felt him nod against her. She could smell the sweetness of the Calvin Klein cologne mixed with the sourness of his breath.</p><p>\u201cDid Millicent exist?\u201d he repeated. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many did you kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he answered. \u201cMother doesn\u2019t count. You can\u2019t kill perfection, and whores don\u2019t count either. No, of course not. So you see? You\u2019ll be the first.\u201d</p><p>He saw the shadow. He swung Laurant around and shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll kill her. I\u2019ll kill her. Drop the gun, Nicholas. Do it now, now, now, now.\u201d</p><p>Nick had reached the center of the balcony. He put his hands up, but he didn\u2019t drop the gun. The dining room table was directly below him. If he could just get over the railing . . .</p><p>Stark was still crouched behind Laurant, trying to turn her with him so he could face the steps and be fully protected by the wall behind him.</p><p>\u201cDrop the gun,\u201d he shouted again. \u201cAnd come on down and join the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to be able to sneak away this time,\u201d Nick said. He could see the terror and pain in Laurant\u2019s eyes. If he could just get Stark to move away from her, just a fraction, he could get a shot before he got hit.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m going to get away. I\u2019m going to kill Laurant and you, and I\u2019m going to get away. The stupid mules will be looking for the hick farmer, Justin Brady. I\u2019ll cut her throat if you don\u2019t drop the gun.\u201d</p><p>Nick let go of the weapon. It barely made a sound as it dropped onto the carpet at his feet.</p><p>\u201cKick it out of reach,\u201d Stark screamed, waving his gun as he gave the order.</p><p>Nick did as he was told but slowly lowered his hands until they were level with his shoulders. Every second would count. He wanted his hands close to the railing so he could spring when the time came.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you now, don\u2019t I, mule?\u201d Stark shouted. \u201cWho\u2019s the master? Who\u2019s the hero? They\u2019ll never find me, no sirree,\u201d he gloated. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they do,\u201d Nick called out. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known. You\u2019re Donald Stark, and we know all about you. You\u2019re a sleazy filmmaker. You use prostitutes to simulate amateur death scenes. S and M crap,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd not at all believable. Homemade stuff. You barely make a living selling the junk on the Internet, and you\u2019ve got a lot of dissatisfied customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDissatisfied?\u201d he roared.</p><p>Nick deliberately shrugged. \u201cYou aren\u2019t any good, Stark. You ought to get in another line of work. Maybe you can learn a new trade in prison.\u201d</p><p>Stark\u2019s full attention was riveted on the balcony. He wasn\u2019t aware that he\u2019d lessened his grip on Laurant or that the butcher knife was now pointed at the doorway and not her throat.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re lying. No one knows who I am. You heard me talking to Laurant, and that\u2019s how you knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ve always known who you are, Stark. The article we planted in the papers was just a way to draw you out. Everyone was in on it, even Tommy. We planned it down to the last detail.\u201d</p><p>Nick could tell that his lies were working. The bastard\u2019s face was red and blotchy, and his eyes bulged out of his head. He hoped that Stark\u2019s anger would push him into making a mistake. Nick only needed a second.</p><p>Come on. Come and get me. Forget about her. Come after me.</p><p>Laurant saw the barrel of the gun coming up, felt the madman tense against her. He was trying to lift her up with him as he shot Nicholas. Then she heard the screech of tires on the gravel outside the door. Was it Tommy? Oh, God, no. Whoever came through the doorway was going to get killed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she screamed as she twisted in his arms and threw herself backward. Her shoulder knocked the hand grasping the gun. Stark fired wild, hitting the glass picture window, shattering it. The blast was so close to her face she could feel the burning heat. She kept fighting and pushing as she turned, but he was too strong. He wouldn\u2019t let go of her and he wouldn\u2019t be budged.</p><p>Stark\u2019s gun was swinging upward again just as Jules Wesson appeared in the doorway. Crouched down in a shooter\u2019s stance, his arms straight out, both hands on his gun, he waited for a clear shot.</p><p>Laurant jerked back, twisted again, fighting with all her might until she faced Stark. Then she attacked. Her left hand gripped his wrist, her nails digging into his skin to keep him from aiming his gun. He tried to reach around her to stab her hand with the knife, and that\u2019s when she swung her right hand up and rammed the needle into his eye.</p><p>Stark screamed in agony. He dropped the knife and reached for his eye, howling like a crazed animal.</p><p>The second Laurant struck Stark, Nick grabbed hold of the railing and swung over. Shouting for her to get down, he reached behind him, grabbed the Glock and started firing.</p><p>Stark leapt to his feet, uncontrollably firing his gun. Wesson dove for the floor, narrowly missing a bullet, and then he too fired.</p><p>Nick fired in midair, landed on the table and fired again. The first bullet struck Stark in the chest. Wesson blew the gun out of Stark\u2019s hand, and Nick\u2019s second shot got him in the head as he was turning to run. The third shot struck his leg.</p><p>Stark was on his back, one leg twisted under him, his eyes wide open. Nick stood over him, his chest heaving as he tried to calm his rage.</p><p>He heard a sob and whirled around. Laurant was on the floor, her head in her hands. As Wesson rushed forward, Nick dropped to his knees beside her and put his hand out to touch her. Then he stopped. He was afraid that he would only make her pain worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. I brought this to you and Tommy. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>She threw herself into his arms. \u201cIs he dead? Is it over?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and held her tight. Then he closed his eyes. \u201cYes, love. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>By the time Nick got Laurant to the hospital, Noah was already in surgery. Tommy, still wearing his bloody vestments, came running down to the emergency room when he heard from one of the nurses that his sister had been brought in.</p><p>He was in a panic until he saw Laurant. She looked like she\u2019d been through hell, but she was breathing and even managed a smile for him. Nick was sitting on the exam table beside her with an arm around her waist. Tommy thought he looked worse than she did, which was pretty awful. Nick\u2019s face was gray and his eyes had a haunted look.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Noah?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re working on him now,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cThe doctor told me the bullet didn\u2019t hit anything major, but he\u2019s lost a lot of blood. He\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d he assured them. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take him time to get his strength back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long has he been in surgery?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes. He\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou know Noah. He\u2019s as tough as nails.\u201d</p><p>Laurant sagged against Nick and put her head down on his shoulder. Her hand was in his lap and he was holding tight. She hurt everywhere. She couldn\u2019t make up her mind which was worse, her head, her arm, or her leg. Every inch of her body seemed to be throbbing in pain. She wanted to rest, but when she closed her eyes, the room began to spin, and that made her queasy.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is the doctor?\u201d Nick demanded.</p> <p>\u201cThey just paged him,\u201d Tommy said. He went to his sister and gently brushed her hair away from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d He tried to sound certain, confident, but it came out all wrong, and it sounded like he was asking her a question.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened? You were right behind me when I carried Noah outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was there, and he called to me. He asked me to help him. I think he told me he\u2019d been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho called to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJustin Brady,\u201d she answered. \u201cOnly he wasn\u2019t really Justin.\u201d She looked up at Nick. \u201cI started to go to him, but then all of a sudden I could hear your voice in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe anything anyone tells you. I knew something wasn\u2019t right about him, and then I saw the glove on his hand. It was a surgical glove, I think.\u201d She looked at Tommy when she added, \u201cI tried to run, but he came after me, and the next thing I remember was waking up inside the van. He took all the door handles off, and I couldn\u2019t get out. Tommy, he showed me a photo of his wife. It was at the picnic, and he showed me a photo. He must have stolen it from someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this later,\u201d Tommy suggested when he saw how upset she was. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy, go hurry up the damned doctor,\u201d Nick barked.</p><p>The physician, a cranky, middle-aged man named Benchley, pulled the curtain back just as Tommy was leaving to go search for him. The doctor took one look at Laurant and then ordered Nick and Tommy to leave.</p> <p>He had the bedside manner of a Doberman. Shouting for a nurse to assist him, he glared at Nick when he didn\u2019t move from the table, and once again he demanded that he get out.</p><p>Nick refused to leave Laurant\u2019s side. He wasn\u2019t diplomatic in his refusal either. Fear made him hostile and belligerent, but he didn\u2019t realize he was up against someone just as belligerent. Dr. Benchley had worked in Los Angeles for over twelve years in a rough inner-city emergency room. He had seen and heard it all. Nothing intimidated him, not even an armed FBI agent with a crazed look in his eyes.</p><p>Tommy stepped in and dragged Nick out of the cubicle before he lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cLet him examine her,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good doctor. Come and sit down in the waiting room. If you sit near the door you can see the curtain from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d Nick said, but he couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced instead.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go upstairs and wait,\u201d Nick suggested. \u201cHave the nurse page me when Noah comes out of surgery. I want to talk to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up in a minute,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cBut I want to stay here until Benchley finishes with Laurant. She\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d he added, more of an assurance for Nick. \u201cShe looks bad, but she\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she isn\u2019t? Tommy, I damn near got her killed. He had her. The bastard had her pinned up against him with a knife at her throat. I\u2019ve never been so scared in my life. One second. That\u2019s all it would have taken to cut an artery. And it\u2019s all my fault. I should have known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnown what?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t immediately answer. He was reliving those terrifying moments when he\u2019d crept out onto the balcony and had seen Laurant down below.</p><p>\u201cI should have figured it out before he had a chance to grab her. And he never should have gotten that chance. Because of my incompetence, Laurant almost lost her life, and Noah got hit.\u201d</p><p>Tommy had never seen Nick so shaken. \u201cStop beating yourself up, and tell me what happened. What should you have known?\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed his brow and leaned back against the wall. His gaze was glued to the curtain. He told Tommy everything, and when he was finished, Tommy needed to sit down.</p><p>\u201cMy God, you both could have been killed.\u201d He expelled a long breath and then stood. \u201cYou know I\u2019d tell you if I thought you screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t screw up,\u201d Tommy insisted. \u201cPete didn\u2019t figure it out either,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou did your job. You protected my sister, and you saved her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she pretty much saved herself. There I was, armed to the hilt, and she nailed the son of a bitch with a safety pin. Drove it right through his eye.\u201d</p><p>Tommy flinched. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have nightmares.\u201d</p><p>A nurse came to get Nick. There was a phone call from Agent Wesson. Tommy stayed in the waiting area. He happened to look down and only then realized he was still wearing his white robes and that Noah\u2019s blood had saturated the garment.</p><p>\u201cWesson found the detonator. It was inside a garage door opener,\u201d Nick said when he returned.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bomb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe abbey\u2019s blocked off, and the bomb squad is coming in by helicopter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Nick, we\u2019re fortunate that no one else was hurt.\u201d He was trying to keep his friend occupied because he knew Nick had about had it with waiting. He didn\u2019t want him to go charging into the exam room.</p><p>\u201cWhy is the doctor taking so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being thorough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully damn calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of us has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her brother, and you saw what she looked like. If I were you and it was my sister in there, I\u2019d be going nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant\u2019s a strong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s strong, but a body can only take so much.\u201d</p><p>The curtain parted, and the nurse who had been assisting the doctor came out. She went to the desk and picked up the phone.</p><p>The doctor stayed with Laurant. One-on-one with his patient, his bedside manner had vastly improved. He was kind, soft-spoken, and gentle. He numbed the arm and cleaned the wound. Then he wrapped it in gauze to keep it protected until the plastic surgeon arrived to stitch it. He probed the area around her left eye but stopped when she winced. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a doozy of a shiner.\u201d</p><p>The doctor told her he was sending her to radiology. The swelling at the base of her skull worried him, and he wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t have a concussion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep you overnight for observation.\u201d</p><p>He put another strip of tape on the gauze to hold it in place as he remarked, \u201cI heard what happened at the church. Bits and pieces anyway. You\u2019re lucky to be alive.\u201d</p><p>Laurant felt numb and a little disoriented. She was finding it difficult to concentrate. She thought the doctor had asked her a question, but she wasn\u2019t certain, and she was too weary to ask him to repeat it.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse will help you get into a hospital gown.\u201d</p><p>Where was Nick? Was he out there with her brother, or had he left? She wanted him to take her in his arms and hold her. She moved her leg and bit her lip to keep from crying out. It felt like it was on fire.</p><p>The doctor was turning to leave when he heard her whisper, \u201cI think it\u2019s bleeding again. Could I have a Band-Aid, please?\u201d</p><p>Benchley turned around. \u201cYou need stitches in your arm. Remember I told you that the plastic surgeon was on his way?\u201d</p><p>He was talking to her as though she were a child. He held up two fingers and asked her how many she saw.</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d she answered, squinting against the penlight he was shining in her eyes. \u201cI was talking about my leg,\u201d she explained. \u201cI fell down, and it\u2019s bleeding.\u201d</p><p>The queasiness was getting worse, and deep breaths didn\u2019t seem to be helping.</p><p>Benchley lifted her skirt and saw the blood on her slip. \u201cWhat have we got here?\u201d he asked as he gently pushed the slip up over her knee and then lifted her leg. He examined the bloody wound.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see the injury. The skirt was in her way. \u201cI just need a Band-Aid,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou sure do,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut first we\u2019re going to need to remove the bullet.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon had a busy evening. Pulling his cap off, he walked into the waiting room to report that Noah was in recovery. He assured Nick and Tommy that there hadn\u2019t been any surprises or complications and that the agent was going to be fine. Then he turned around to scrub again and operate on Laurant. While he worked on her leg, the plastic surgeon stitched her arm.</p><p>A nurse gave Tommy his sister\u2019s watch and engagement ring. Without a thought, he handed them to Nick.</p><p>Laurant wasn\u2019t in the operating room long, and for a short while she and Noah were in recovery together. She was still unconscious when she was wheeled into a private room.</p><p>After checking on Noah, Nick went to Laurant\u2019s room and stayed with her all night. As soon as Noah was taken to ICU so that he could be closely monitored, Tommy went back to the abbey to change clothes. Then he returned to the hospital and sat with Noah.</p><p>Pete Morganstern arrived around two in the morning. He went to see Noah first. Tommy had fallen asleep in a chair, but he woke up as Pete was reading Noah\u2019s chart. They went out into the hall to talk, and then Tommy told him where he could find Laurant and Nick.</p><p>Laurant slept fitfully. In those random moments of consciousness she called out to Nick. The anesthetic was slow to wear off. She couldn\u2019t quite manage to open her eyes, but she felt him taking hold of her hand, and she would fall asleep again comforted by his soothing voice.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I threw up on Dr. Benchley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Another hour passed. \u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>She felt him squeeze her hand. \u201cDid you tell Tommy we slept together?\u201d</p><p>She heard a cough, and then Nick answered, \u201cNo, but you just did. He\u2019s standing right here.\u201d`</p><p>She fell asleep, but this time she didn\u2019t have any dreams or nightmares.</p><p>When Pete walked into the room, he saw Nick bending over Laurant. He stood there and watched him slip the engagement ring on her finger and then clasp the watch around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d he asked, his voice low so he wouldn\u2019t disturb her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a scratch on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I was asking.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the hallway to talk. Pete suggested they go down to the cafeteria, but Nick didn\u2019t want to leave Laurant. He wanted to be there in case she called out to him again.</p><p>And so they sat together in the hallway in chairs Pete carried over from the nurses\u2019 station.</p><p>\u201cI came here for two reasons,\u201d he began. \u201cFirst was to see Noah, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other reason?\u201d</p><p>Pete sighed. \u201cTo talk to you and to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cI messed up, not you. I should have listened to you. When Brenner was arrested, you told me it didn\u2019t feel right to you, and how did I respond? By ignoring everything I trained you to do. I was so certain you couldn\u2019t see the forest for the trees because of your personal involvement in this case. I ignored your instincts, and that was a mistake I won\u2019t ever repeat. Do you realize how close to disaster we came this time?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. He leaned back against the wall and stretched his legs out. \u201cA lot of people would have been killed if that bomb had gone off.\u201d</p><p>Pete began to question Nick then and didn\u2019t stop until he had heard every detail and was satisfied.</p><p>\u201cReading the article in the paper . . . yes, that\u2019s what set him off,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife was almost perfect. That\u2019s what you heard him tell Laurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nick said. \u201cStark\u2019s wife had to have known what was coming. Once Stark decided she couldn\u2019t get any better, that she was as perfect as she could be, he was going to kill her, just like he killed his mother. Knowing all the facts now, I think maybe her mind did snap, and that\u2019s why she took the little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know what her motive was,\u201d Pete said. \u201cIf I were to speculate, I would suggest that perhaps she thought a family would change things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn him into a doting father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe she wanted to end it . . . let us get her instead of him.\u201d</p><p>Pete nodded. \u201cYou could be right. What about Laurant?\u201d he asked then.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors say she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be staying around?\u201d</p><p>Nick knew what Pete was asking. \u201cI\u2019ll stay long enough to tell her how sorry I am I got her into all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d His mind was made up.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at Pete. \u201cDamn. I really hate it when you say that. You sound like a shrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t shield your heart, Nick. Running away won\u2019t solve your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to tell me what my problem is, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he agreed smoothly. \u201cLoving Laurant makes you human, and that\u2019s what\u2019s frightening you. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running away. I\u2019m going back to work. What kind of a life could I offer her? She deserves to be happy and safe, damn it, and I can\u2019t guarantee that. Stark used her and Tommy to get to me. It could happen again. God knows, I\u2019ve made enemies since I started working for you. What if another creep comes after her? No, I can\u2019t let that happen. I won\u2019t take that chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll isolate yourself even more than you already have? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made your mind up?\u201d Pete pressed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>Pete knew he wasn\u2019t going to win this argument, but he felt compelled to interfere a little more. \u201cPsychiatrists are trained to notice little things. We observe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I walked into Laurant\u2019s room, I noticed you were putting the engagement ring on her finger. I found that very curious.\u201d</p> <p>Nick couldn\u2019t explain his actions. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to wake up and think she\u2019d lost it. She can take it back to the store and get a refund. That\u2019s all there was to it. Now let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more comment, and then I\u2019ll stop hounding you. I promise. Actually, it\u2019s a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. He sounded miserable.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to find the strength to leave her?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p> <p>Aweek had passed since Noah was shot. The agent was recuperating at the abbey, but he was getting very little rest, what with the anniversary celebration and the constant stream of visitors, most of whom were women bearing gifts. The abbot was thrilled. They had enough home-cooked food to last a month.</p><p>Tommy had just walked one of the parishioners to the door, thanked her for the casserole, and returned to the den where Noah was sprawled out on the sofa. Tommy dropped down in the easy chair and put his feet on the ottoman. He was catching Noah up on the latest developments, but he kept getting interrupted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, where was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were telling me what happened with Laurant at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Neither Nick nor I knew Laurant had a bullet lodged in her leg. So, the doctor comes out and tells us she\u2019s been shot. Nick goes crazy then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove will do that to a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Tommy agreed. \u201cHe was already acting nuts, but this news pushed him right over the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Noah asked, smiling. \u201cI wish I could have seen it. He\u2019s always so cool and calm. What\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe starts shouting, \u2018What the hell do you mean she was shot? What kind of a place are you running here?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cWho was he yelling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Benchley. You met him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a real charmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s shouting back at Nick, \u2018Hey, Buddy, I didn\u2019t shoot her,\u2019 but Nick\u2019s out of his mind now, and I start to worry he\u2019s going to shoot Benchley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then what happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNick wouldn\u2019t leave her side. He stayed with her all night, but he told Pete and me that, as soon as she woke up, he was going to say good-bye. He did too. He shook her hand.\u201d</p><p>Noah burst into laughter. \u201cWhat\u2019d she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called him an idiot and went back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love your sister, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick was real determined. He had a lot of follow-up work to do, and that kept him in Nugent a few days. They found Lonnie holed up in a motel outside of Omaha. He\u2019s been charged with arson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brenner? Did they find the bank account the sheriff told Laurant about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they did. Brenner was altering the books and stealing from Griffen, the developers. Steve\u2019s going to be going away for a long time. Hey, did I tell you what Christopher did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe groom?\u201d</p><p>Tommy nodded. \u201cWhile he and Michelle were in Hawaii on their honeymoon, he spent a lot of time on the phone putting together a deal. He convinced Griffen to buy another parcel of land the city owns and leave the town square alone. The way he worked it out, some of the profits will go to renovating the square and bringing in new businesses. Christopher\u2019s done a very good thing for this town. As soon as he gets settled, he\u2019s going to hang his shingle two doors down from Laurant\u2019s store. When the store opens, Michelle\u2019s going to manage it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will Laurant be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainting.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to take another antibiotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wash it down with a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock in the morning. You can\u2019t have a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou priests are too damned strict.\u201d</p><p>Tommy got him a Pepsi and sat down again. \u201cI heard that Wesson is thinking about resigning.\u201d</p><p>The smile left Noah\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe should be encouraged to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should cut the guy a little slack,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cNick told me he made himself a target in the cabin, trying to divert Stark and help Nick get a clear shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was too little, too late. I don\u2019t want to talk about Wesson. Pete already filled me in on what went down. So, tell me,\u201d he continued, \u201cdid Nick leave her or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Where\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Paris.\u201d Tommy was beaming when he added, \u201cShe won the lawsuit. She got every penny of Grandfather\u2019s money back, plus a heck of a lot of interest. She had to fly over to sign some papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Nick why she went.\u201d</p><p>Noah raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat did you tell him.\u201d</p><p>Tommy shrugged. \u201cThat she went to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImplying it was permanent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell he went after her. Getting on a transatlantic flight. He\u2019d never do that, not in a million years.\u201d</p><p>Tommy looked at his watch. \u201cHe should be landing in Paris any minute now.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed again. \u201cHe is nuts. It was okay for him to leave her, but he couldn\u2019t stomach the notion of her leaving him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he got to Des Moines before he turned around and drove back. Then I had to tell him she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Tommy nodded. \u201cTough love,\u201d he explained. \u201cI love Nick like a brother, but I had to get tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you lied to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. I think you just committed a sin. Want me to hear your confession?\u201d</p><p>Laurant was exhausted. She cried most of the way to Paris, and when she wasn\u2019t weeping, she was fuming because she had fallen in love with an idiot. She didn\u2019t get any sleep at all, and as soon as the plane landed, she had to go directly to the law firm\u2019s offices to sign the papers.</p><p>They wanted to celebrate. She wanted to go to Boston and find Nick, but couldn\u2019t make up her mind what she would do once she found him. One minute she thought she would kiss him, and the next she thought she would give him a piece of her mind, but then, she didn\u2019t know her mind anymore. She used to be such a practical, down-to-earth sort of woman, but Nick had changed her. She couldn\u2019t sleep, she couldn\u2019t eat, she couldn\u2019t do anything but cry.</p><p>She checked into the hotel and took a long, hot shower. She had packed a pretty nightgown, but she put on the red T-shirt with the open-mouthed bass on the front instead.</p><p>How could he leave her? The tears started flowing again, and that made her angry. She remembered his reaction when she\u2019d told him she loved him. He\u2019d looked horrified. She thought it was because she was complicating his life, but now she stopped fooling herself and accepted the truth. He didn\u2019t love her. It was that simple.</p><p>Laurant grabbed a Kleenex, got into bed, and called Michelle to cry on her shoulder.</p><p>Michelle answered on the first ring. She sounded sleepy. \u201cIf you\u2019re calling to tell me how sorry you are about the wedding, I forgive you, just like I did the last three times you called me in Hawaii. None of it was your fault. Okay? Mother forgives you, Daddy forgives you, and so do Christopher and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me, Michelle.\u201d</p><p>Her friend was suddenly wide awake. \u201cWhat do you mean, he left you? Nick? Where are you anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d she answered, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying, aren\u2019t you? You lost the lawsuit. Laurant, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re rich again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound very happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said? Nick left me. I didn\u2019t tell you the last time I called, but he left me the day after the wedding. He shook my hand, Michelle, and then he left. He doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shook your hand?\u201d Michelle burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t funny. This phone call is costing money, so be sympathetic and be fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cThere, there. It will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re being sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you going to do about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the way he was looking at you while you were dancing at the picnic. It\u2019s the same way Christopher looks at me when he wants . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lust, not love. I scared him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. You do have a knack for doing that. There\u2019s only one thing left to do,\u201d she advised. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go after him. Hunt him down.\u201d</p><p>Laurant sighed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t helping. I\u2019m feeling miserable. I hate being in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo after him,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? I can\u2019t make him love me. I hate feeling like this. If this is what love is all about, you can have it. You know what I\u2019m going to do? I\u2019m going to get on with my life and forget him. Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Michelle agreed, and Laurant could hear the smile in her voice. \u201cJust one question. How are you going to forget him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with him almost overnight, so it probably isn\u2019t the real thing. That makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Do you hear yourself ? In your heart you know this isn\u2019t an infatuation. I fell in love with Christopher after our first date. Sometimes it happens that way. I just knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. Go after Nick, Laurant. Don\u2019t let pride mess this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. If he loved me, he wouldn\u2019t have left me. It\u2019s over, and I have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>Laurant felt like her heart was shattering. Michelle was talking now, but she wasn\u2019t listening. She interrupted her friend to say good-bye. She wanted to go home, but she didn\u2019t know where that was anymore.</p><p>She called room service and ordered hot tea. Coping. That\u2019s what Nick had told her she was doing when she fixed herself tea.</p><p>She was suddenly anxious to get out of Paris. She called the airline and moved her flight up. She could sleep on the plane, she thought. She got out of bed and started packing her bags again. She had just closed her overnight bag when there was a knock on her door. Tea had arrived. She grabbed a tissue on her way across the room and then opened the door.</p><p>\u201cJust put\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nick was standing in the corridor, glaring at her. She was so stunned to see him, she couldn\u2019t speak, couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>He looked awful. His hair was down in his face, his clothes looked like he\u2019d slept in them, and his eyes looked haggard. She thought he was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cDid you even have the chain on? What were you thinking opening the door like that? I didn\u2019t hear the dead bolt. Was the door locked?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. She just stood there staring up at him with a stunned expression on her face. He could see she\u2019d been crying.Her eyes were red and swollen. He had to nudge her back inside before he could shut the door.</p><p>\u201cThis is how you lock a door,\u201d he said as he turned the bolt.</p><p>He had her now. He leaned against the door so she couldn\u2019t get past him. He took a deep breath, and the panicky feeling he\u2019d been carrying around vanished. She was just a foot away from him, and the world was suddenly making sense again.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m FBI. It\u2019s what we do. We find people who try to run. Damn it, Laurant, how could you leave me like that? Without a word, you pack up and move to Paris? What the hell\u2019s the matter with you? Don\u2019t you know what you put me through? What were you thinking?\u201d he railed. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell someone you love him and then run away. That\u2019s just damn cruel.\u201d</p><p>Laurant was trying to follow along, but Nick was talking so fast and furiously, it was difficult. Why did he think she had moved to Paris? And what made him think she was running away from him?</p><p>She was going to demand he explain as soon as she got over the fact that he was there, acting like a complete, adorable idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll quit,\u201d he said. He nodded to let her know he meant it. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it will take to get you to marry me, then by God, I\u2019ll quit.\u201d</p><p>He only then noticed she was wearing the T-shirt he\u2019d bought her, and that conjured up all sorts of hot memories. He smiled that wonderful, melting smile of his, and then he pointed at her and said, \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>He tried to take her into his arms, but she backed away. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make you feel safe, but you\u2019ve got to stop running. No matter where you go, I\u2019ll follow you. Damn it, Laurant, I\u2019m never going to let you leave me again.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand out to fend him off when he tried to grab her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t running away. You left me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I came back and you were gone. You sure didn\u2019t waste any time pining away for me. Tommy didn\u2019t even want to tell me where you\u2019d gone, but I made him.\u201d</p><p>She was starting to catch on. Her brother had become a matchmaker. \u201cAnd what did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you moved to Paris. It made me crazy knowing you were so far away,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI have to have you in my life. I want to come home to you every night. I want to grow old with you. I need you, Laurant.\u201d</p><p>She started crying again. He wouldn\u2019t let her back away from him this time. He pulled her into his arms and held her tight. He kissed her forehead as he whispered, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t marry a man who can\u2019t hold a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take the coordinator position they\u2019ve offered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what you do is too important. You have to promise me you won\u2019t stop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cYou mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t quit.\u201d</p><p>He nudged her chin up and leaned down. He kissed her passionately, letting her know how much he loved her.</p> <p>\u201cMarry me, Laurant. Put me out of my misery.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped back. She was suddenly looking stunned again. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her dodge his question. \u201cMarry me,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI want babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said. \u201cWith you, I want everything. I\u2019ll be a neurotic father, worrying about them, but with you as their mother, they\u2019ll turn out all right. We\u2019ll be a good balance for them. As long as I have you by my side, anything is possible. I love you, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>She was fervently kissing his neck. \u201cI already know you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? When did you figure that out?\u201d</p><p>She hoped their babies would have his blue eyes. They were so beautiful. \u201cWhen I saw you at my door. That\u2019s when I knew you loved me. You got on a plane and flew across an ocean for me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLosing you was more terrifying. Besides, it wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re over your phobia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am,\u201d he choked.</p> <p>She smiled, kissed him gently, and whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ll go home by boat.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
