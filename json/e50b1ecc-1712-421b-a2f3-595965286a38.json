The booming knock at my door sounded again and I dragged myself out of bed. I held my gun at my side, out of view, and opened the door a few inches. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t appear to be armed, I\u2019d give him that. But I was, even if it was my personal sidearm, and knocking so loudly before my alarm went off was almost enough to make me shoot him. But I was a professional. An agent with the Otherworlder Enforcement Agency. And shooting a man for waking me up before dawn would result in a heck of a lot of paperwork.</p><p>I hated paperwork.</p> <p>By the looks of his expensive suit, obviously tailored to his lean frame, he wasn\u2019t delivering a package. But he had the slightly pale pallor of a vampire, which meant a standard-issue bullet would probably just piss him off unless I got in a really lucky shot.</p><p>My bleary gaze sharpened. Shock hit me as I studied the line of his jaw, and the paleness of his blue eyes. What the hell was he doing here?</p><p>\u201cBeatrice?\u201d His gaze slid down my oversized flannel pajamas as if my outfit wasn\u2019t quite what he was expecting. \u201cLong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I fought the heat flushing my face but lost. What did I care what the bloodsucker thought of my pj\u2019s? It was five o\u2019clock in the damn morning. What was I supposed to be wearing? Even agents got cold in St. Louis in March. \u201cWhy are you here, Claude?\u201d</p><p>The Chicago detective ran a hand through his hair, and for a split second I could feel its softness sliding between my fingers.</p> <p>\u201cI need your services.\u201d He flashed me a grin, and I frowned at his flirting tone. Once upon a time I might have flirted back\u2014okay, I definitely would have flirted back. But it had been a rough couple of weeks. A rough year. Ever since my former partner and I had worked a big case involving succubi being kidnapped and sold to the highest bidder, I\u2019d struggled against dark emotions. I had seen too many horrible experiences, and I hadn\u2019t been able to let up or take a break from work for far too long. Lives had been on the line, succubi kidnapped and murdered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for us to go through this kind of thing, hit a breaking point and need to slow down and take some time away. But I didn\u2019t like it. I was at my best when I was working, and there was always another criminal to take down.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of services?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour services as a psychometrist, of course. I have an object that I believe may carry a psychic imprint,\u201d he clarified, but his flirtatious grin didn\u2019t falter.</p><p>\u201cNo shit. Here I was figuring you\u2019d stopped by to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you charming before your first cup of coffee?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t grin at his joke, but it was a near thing. Of course he was looking for my services as a psychometrist. Investigators didn\u2019t show up at my door at this time of night looking to chat. My ability to read the psychic imprints left on objects was at a premium these days. Not that my interpretations could clinch a case. Fact was, half the time my powers didn\u2019t work. True emotional trauma had to have occurred near the object for a psychic imprint\u2014unless I was able to read something physically connected to a person, like their hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a long way from Chicago.\u201d</p><p>The vampire was something of a legend among cops. As a member of the Chicago Paranormal Unit, he\u2019d solved several high-profile crimes that had made the national news. And more than that, he was rumored to be high up in whatever private echelon vampires used out of the public eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth the trip,\u201d he said. Then, at my glare, he quickly added, \u201cYou\u2019re the best psychometrist in the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bull.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best in the country.\u201d I gave him a lazy smile. Okay, maybe I was up to flirting a bit, even if seeing him still stung. Claude had shown his true colors long ago. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Especially considering that I wasn\u2019t, strictly speaking, on duty for the next two weeks\u2014if psych even approved me to come back then.</p> <p>My gut twisted at the thought, but Claude laughed, and some of my tension released. The man was too damn pretty and, laughing, he was something else. Light brown hair topped his head, cut in a longish way that I suspected was designed to appear messy.</p><p>Of course, I knew the muscles that were only hinted at under that jacket were stronger than those of any human. I knew how they flexed and moved in the light. I knew how they felt under my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cYou are the best in the country. Glad to see you realize it.\u201d He stepped forward and leaned on the doorframe, slightly in my personal space, as if casually asking for a date. But I wasn\u2019t fooled, and I didn\u2019t back up. I could see the wariness in his eyes and the tension in his body. As if he was ready to be attacked at any moment. The Claude I knew was cool and collected\u2014whatever he was here for, it was putting him on edge. This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cI need a favor. I have some evidence that needs your special touch.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cYou ever hear of something called a formal request? Or the fucking phone? Or, I don\u2019t know, waiting for daylight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds terribly time-consuming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing about doing shit the right way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. It\u2019ll take five minutes. The official paperwork will get to you eventually\u2014you know how long that can take.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed a sigh. Five minutes? More like two hours of paperwork once the official request caught up to me. But the man had come all the way from Chicago. And it was pretty damned unlikely he\u2019d done that on a whim.</p><p>But I was over what had happened between us\u2014not that there had been anything to really get over. And no matter that I jerked his chain now, I was always willing to help out another investigator. Besides, I was stir-crazy. I\u2019d been away from work for two weeks already, and it was likely to be another two before I\u2019d be back on duty\u2014minimum. Annoyance rushed through me at the thought, but I pushed it down.</p><p>\u201cFine. But not here. There\u2019s a diner down the road.\u201d I gave him quick directions to the twenty-four-hour place. It would be almost empty this time of morning.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThis is kind of private\u2014evidence and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be discreet. Or, we can go to my office. I don\u2019t bring my work into my home.\u201d Not purposefully anyway. It was my sanctuary. The one place I didn\u2019t have to think about death. Didn\u2019t have to see it, experience it. Not that my visions didn\u2019t follow me here\u2014didn\u2019t follow me everywhere. But that didn\u2019t mean I had to invite them inside.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAs you wish. The diner sounds good. I\u2019m a tad peckish.\u201d He flashed his teeth and headed down the sidewalk.</p><p>I glared after him, annoyed at the thrill that ran through me at seeing him. And worse, at the flash of his fang.</p><p>The last bit of winter clung to the St. Louis streets, seeping into my bones the second I stepped out of my house. The drive to the diner took less than five minutes\u2014not long enough for the heater in my car to kick from cold to hot.</p><p>The diner door dinged as I opened it, then smacked the doorframe when I let it slam behind me. A man dressed in jeans and a heavy flannel shirt occupied one corner booth, nursing coffee. The large semi-truck taking up one side of the small parking lot no doubt belonged to him. I guessed the diner staff must not care about parking this early.</p><p>Claude had taken a booth on the opposite side of the diner from the trucker, hidden from view from the front door and off to one side of the counter where the waitress refilled the coffeemaker.</p><p>I sat across from Claude, noting he\u2019d made sure to keep his back away from the front door. I was not so lucky. Then again, I wasn\u2019t paranoid enough to think someone was going to sneak up on me at this time of the morning. But I hadn\u2019t been alive long enough to gather the enemy list Claude probably had. Of course, he knew what I was like in the morning, pre-coffee. He might be right to be nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get for ya?\u201d The waitress looked like every man\u2019s grandma. Glasses perched on the end of her nose, and tightly curled gray hair touched her ears.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, please.\u201d Claude gave the waitress a world-class smile, and she smiled back at him patronizingly, unimpressed with his good looks.</p><p>\u201cDecaf for me,\u201d I said. The smell of bacon and eggs filled the air enticingly, but I refused to eat breakfast. That would be as much as admitting that I was up, and I was going back to bed the second I returned home. To sleep.</p><p>Hopefully, a dreamless sleep.</p><p>The waitress nodded and left, then returned with our coffee and a bowl of various flavors of creamers. I grabbed a couple of hazelnut packets and poured them into my cup.</p><p>\u201cThanks again for your help,\u201d Claude said. \u201cHow have you been, mon chou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDump the small talk, Claude.\u201d I resisted the urge to tug on my hair. How, after all this time, could the man make me immediately angry? The term of endearment pushed my buttons. It made me wonder what would have happened if things had ended differently. But it was an old wound I wasn\u2019t keen to reopen with what-ifs.</p><p>He reached for the creamer, his hand brushing mine slightly as I went for the sugar packs. A bolt ran through me, recognition and need merging with regret to form a ball in the pit of my stomach. I stilled, and slowly he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to anger you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen dispense with the pretty endearments.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows but didn\u2019t argue. From the seat next to him, he grabbed a rolled-up paper bag and slid it across the table to me.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. Give me some background info,\u201d I said. He frowned, so I added, \u201cIt\u2019ll help put the images I see into something that might actually make sense.\u201d And it would. But mostly, I didn\u2019t like to touch shit without knowing what I might be in for. Even for Claude Desmarais.</p><p>My resistance seemed to surprise him, but that made sense. Six years ago I\u2019d been a bright-eyed, positive girl without a real clue about the world, and willing to go the extra mile for a smile of approval from a star among cops. And I\u2019d had a hell of a crush. A crush he\u2019d been more than willing to explore after just a bit of convincing on my part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was still a legend, and just as striking and ageless.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t that girl anymore.</p><p>Claude paused for a moment, then nodded\u2014more to himself than to me. \u201cAll right. There have been a series of murders back in Chicago. We think it\u2019s a serial killer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo OWEA involvement yet?\u201d The Otherworlder Enforcement Agency was similar to the FBI in that we mostly waited until locals called us in.</p><p>\u201cNot until you.\u201d</p><p>I grunted, keeping my opinion on the matter to myself. The Chicago Paranormal Unit\u2014or PNU\u2014was a good unit, but the OWEA had more resources.</p><p>\u201cPeople have been disappearing. We\u2019ve found several bodies thus far that seem related to the same guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many still out there that might be related?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way of really knowing.\u201d He took a sip of the coffee and grimaced.</p><p>I sipped my coffee, relishing the hazelnut flavoring while I considered what he had said. \u201cHow do you know the deaths are related?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were all branded using an honest-to-God branding iron.\u201d</p><p>I choked on my coffee. Claude handed me a napkin and I nodded for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cThe brand is in the bag\u2014that\u2019s the evidence I need you to touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec.\u201d I took a deep breath and coughed again to clear my throat. \u201cYou managed to get the brand? How the fuck did you do that?\u201d</p> <p>The trucker passed our table, heading toward the men\u2019s room. He nodded in greeting, and I nodded in return.</p><p>Claude shrugged and lowered his voice. \u201cGot lucky. The end must have broken off in the fire. We found it settled in some old ash.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Something didn\u2019t jive with his story. Brands didn\u2019t just break off. Not that luck didn\u2019t help solve the occasional investigation\u2014hell, routine traffic stops caught a shitload of criminals who\u2019d done far worse. Of course, the vampire wasn\u2019t giving anything away. I was willing to bet the man had been able to lie easily since before I\u2019d been born.</p><p>Not that he looked it. I was twenty-eight, but looked like I was in my early twenties\u2014despite the stress inherent in my job. Claude looked a few years older than I did. But he had the poise of a much older person. And while I couldn\u2019t feel much of the signature vampire fear aura radiating from him, that didn\u2019t mean much. The intimidating aura that exuded from vampires seemed to have little to do with their power or age.</p><p>\u201cTell me the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of on a timetable here. Tell you what, read the brand for me and I\u2019ll send you the file.\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath in a big whoosh of air. Truth was, I didn\u2019t want to handle the icky brand that had probably been used in some sort of sick, ritualistic murders. I didn\u2019t want to watch people die in my head. And I most definitely didn\u2019t want to carry that memory with me until the day I died.</p><p>But that was the job.</p> <p>Granted, not a job I was supposed to be doing without authorization, but my skills were far too useful to the OWEA for them to fire me for skirting the line.</p><p>I nodded and he slid over the bag. I unrolled the heavy bag. It was a normal evidence bag, but it didn\u2019t have the normal tags. No case number. Nothing. That bothered me, so I made a mental note to check up on it later.</p><p>Air whooshed in and out of my lungs as I purposefully hyperventilated. I had passed out twice from lack of oxygen during a vision before I realized that such a simple thing could help.</p><p>I stuck my hand in the bag and gripped the branding iron.</p><p>A loud rush of sound filled my ears, as if I\u2019d just plunged my head into a bucket of water. Inky darkness overtook my vision for half a second, and I fought sudden claustrophobia.</p><p>Every time, I experienced the same overwhelming feeling of being trapped in a dark, airless, white-noise-filled room. And I always tried to move\u2014even knowing that movement was impossible.</p><p>Then the fear and sensory deprivation was gone. And what replaced it was worse\u2014always worse.</p><p>Glowing with orange fire, what could only be the brand filled my vision. The symbol was unfamiliar. Five lines converged into a triangle, with a swirl cutting across the lines. Smaller symbols that looked like eyes peeked out from the spaces in between the lines.</p><p>A man\u2019s face replaced the brand. He frowned at me, and I had a difficult time focusing on him. My vision blurred. He was saying something, but I couldn\u2019t hear him. His frown deepened and he turned away, still talking. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. The realization seemed unimportant. Foreign emotions ran through me, too fast to identify them. But fear soaked it all. Fear and almost debilitating panic.</p><p>The metal edges of the diner table came into focus first, and I sucked in a breath of air. Then Claude asked if I was all right. I waved him off, trying to get my bearings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I managed. I wasn\u2019t really. I never was after a particularly violent vision. Not right after. Not even a week after. It took time for them to fade.</p><p>Luckily, this vision hadn\u2019t been terrible\u2014of course, the initial one usually wasn\u2019t. Sometimes I witnessed the torture, the death. But something about this vision felt off. The man\u2019s face had almost seemed...familiar. And a sickness filled my stomach, as if the coffee disagreed with me.</p><p>I shook my head. Maybe the OWEA shrinks were right. Maybe these visions were getting to me.</p><p>I raked my eyes over the room, over the painfully handsome vampire sitting across from me in the booth, over the old and worn decor of the diner around us, over his tailored suit. I barely allowed myself to blink. It took my body a few minutes to stop shaking, and just as long for the sight of the solid room around me to convince my brain that I was no longer trapped in that cold place with the flaming brand.</p><p>Claude waited silently. Too silently. His eyes were on me, and his body betrayed no movement. Vampires did that sometimes. Creepy.</p><p>I broke the silence the way I always did, with my first impressions. \u201cI saw the brand, then it went away and a man replaced it\u2014a vampire. He said something\u2014was talking. But not to me\u2014the vic, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at his question, but before I could come up with an appropriately smart-ass reply, he answered his own question.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Psychometrist visions are sight-only. No auditory or olfactory.\u201d He leaned forward and a bit of his hair fell onto his forehead. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Just sight-only impressions? If only. Not that watching murders happen from the point of view of the victim or murderer wasn\u2019t bad in its own right, but the emotions are what stuck with me.</p><p>What would I tell Claude? The victim was afraid as he was being branded? That the victim was beyond thinking, because he\u2019d been tortured so long his pain became psychically linked to the brand used in his torture?</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything interesting in the background?\u201d Claude pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I rarely get anything from the background with a first pass. And sometimes the images just flash\u2014a floating face, an object set against a black background. Some emotions.\u201d I shrugged and, finding my muscles tense, I rolled my shoulders. \u201cIt takes time and repeated sessions for me to get more of the picture.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at that. \u201cOkay. Can you describe the man in the vision to me?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and recalled him as well as I could. \u201cI can do you one better.\u201d Again my stomach turned when I brought the man\u2019s face to mind.</p><p>I pulled my sketchpad out of my oversized purse and drew the face I\u2019d seen. A few quick swipes and I had a basic drawing done. I added some key features, lines around his eyes, and the way his hair swept across his forehead. The slight hint of fang amidst his perfect set of teeth. Then I stopped to look at it. My hand shook. I shoved my pencil back into my bag to cover my shaking fingers, then turned the picture to Claude. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath. Something about the picture bothered me\u2014probably just seeing the face in a vision that had turned so horrible, so fast.</p><p>A crunching noise made my eyes flutter open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Claude said, and I couldn\u2019t look away from his expression. By all accounts, Claude was an old vampire. And old vampires were masters of controlling their emotions, of keeping their thoughts off their faces. But the wide eyes and tense set of the vampire\u2019s jaw was hardly controlled. Something about the picture surprised him. Something he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>I scanned the area for the source of the odd crunching noise. Had Claude heard it, too? \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure. But if you let me keep the brand for a week or so, I can probably get you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d The vampire stood and gave me a short bow. \u201cThank you for your help. It was nice to see you again.\u201d He turned to go, then halted next to me. His hand closed around my shoulder and squeezed, and I couldn\u2019t help the small shiver that ran through me. \u201cReally. I appreciate this, mon chou. And I am...happy to see that you are well. I wish\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThank you, again.\u201d Then, without another word or a backward glance, he was gone, with the bagged brand slipped under his jacket.</p><p>What the hell? I reached for my coffee and something on Claude\u2019s side of the table caught my eye. I slid out of the booth and walked to his side to get a better look.</p><p>My breath caught. Two palm-length imprints were etched into the smooth table. I took a long drink and then leaned down to look under the table. Sure enough, it looked like fingers had been dug into the particleboard underneath.</p><p>Claude had gripped the table hard enough to leave dents. That was the crunching sound I\u2019d heard while showing him the man\u2014the vampire\u2014I\u2019d seen in the vision. There was only one explanation that I could come up with.</p><p>Claude knew him.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Squealing tires cut through the early morning stillness. Someone cried out, and a car door slammed.</p><p>I tried to see through the darkness, but I could only hear the laughter. I could only see the face, grim and sinister.</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>Bright light pierced my curtains when I awoke for the second time that day. My breath came fast, and I struggled with confusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hadn\u2019t had this nightmare in years. Hadn\u2019t experienced the horrible dream that had plagued me as a child. But it was back. He was back.</p><p>And he wore the face I\u2019d seen when I touched the brand.</p><p>Less than twelve hours later, I stepped into the elevator of Claude\u2019s opulent condo building, after the suspicious-yet-polite doorman received permission from Claude to let me up. The vampire might not live traditionally, but he did live in style. The building was set on Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast, the nickname locals gave the area of the city adjacent to Lake Michigan. The views were certainly worth the title, but the prices clinched it. A person practically needed a pile of gold to buy one.</p> <p>The elevator ticked up the floors, and my temper ticked up with it. I half wished I\u2019d brought my personal sidearm with me, but I wasn\u2019t too keen on explaining away why I\u2019d brought a gun with me when I wasn\u2019t on a case. Or even on the job. Damn the vampire anyway. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in Chicago. And I wasn\u2019t supposed to be running down a case that didn\u2019t even exist.</p><p>Anger was good. It grounded me when everything else felt surreal. But I tugged on my hair and tried to calm down. Fiery redhead was just too clich\u00e9. Had to keep a lid on the rage, although anger was far preferable to longing for something I couldn\u2019t have. After all, it was obvious that Claude struggled with no such emotion.</p><p>In my hand, I clutched the folded paper. The portrait of a psychotic killer. But I didn\u2019t need it.</p><p>I saw him every time I closed my eyes.</p><p>It was a face I\u2019d seen for the first time as a ten-year-old girl in visions that had become nightmares. Ones just like the nightmare that had propelled me out of bed in the late morning straight onto a flight bound for Chicago.</p> <p>A ping sounded as the elevator doors announced that I\u2019d reached the penthouse. A short hallway revealed only a single door. How much had the vampire had to pay to avoid neighbors? Whatever. If I\u2019d had centuries to accumulate wealth, I could live in a high-rise, too.</p><p>I\u2019d not allow myself to be intimidated by a shiny apartment.</p><p>Dressed far less impressively than he had been earlier in the day, Claude answered the door. He was wearing an AC/DC T-shirt and jeans so worn they looked older than me. But this time, his expression wasn\u2019t open or friendly. Anger twisted his mouth, and his eyes looked weary. He gestured for me to enter, but I paused in his doorway, unsure for a moment what bothered me about him. I\u2019d expected the anger. But I hadn\u2019t expected him to look so drained.</p><p>Vampires, as a general rule, just didn\u2019t look tired.</p><p>\u201cYou called the station to check up on me,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. You showed up with an unmarked evidence bag and no paperwork, and you expected me not to check? What kind of an investigator do you take me for?\u201d I ached to mention the man from the vision\u2014the vampire. Claude knew who he was, that much was obvious. But there was direct, and then there was rude. And rude wouldn\u2019t get me the answers I so desperately needed.</p> <p>And I wasn\u2019t so sure I should show my hand just yet.</p><p>Some of the anger drained from his expression, but the weariness remained. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I should have expected that.\u201d A hint of a smile touched his mouth. \u201cGuess I\u2019m a little off my game. Are you thirsty?\u201d</p><p>I followed him to the living room and then sat on a plush leather couch while he went to get me a soda. Decorated in an understated style, the condo was lovely, if a bit plain. A few antique furnishings and paintings that offered to sweep me away to another place brightened the room and made up for the lack of other personalized touches.</p><p>And any plainness was made up for by the view. The lake stretched so far that a person might mistake it for an ocean. Dark blue and calming.</p><p>Claude swept back in, and I snagged a coaster from a small stack on one of the end tables to set under my glass. The coffee table wood was old and pitted, but in a purposeful style.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to tell me what this is about?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at that, and the grin on his face never faltered. \u201cWhat? No accusations of misconduct? No suggestions that I\u2019m taking money on the side to investigate cases? What kind of interrogation is this?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re a good cop, by all accounts. And I don\u2019t see you taking money on the side. Look at this place. Hell, you probably forget to cash your paychecks.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at that, and my mouth went dry. The man was more than attractive, with his intense eyes that belied his casual look. But laughing...damn.</p><p>So not fair to the women of the world.</p><p>The amusement drained from his expression when I only offered a small grin in return. At least, I hoped it looked like a grin and not a grimace. The man\u2019s laugh was infectious, but not infectious enough to overcome the tight chest and headache I\u2019d been overrun with since waking up from that nightmare.</p><p>\u201cAnd I feel like I know you, a little bit. I mean, we have worked together in the past,\u201d I added. I opened my mouth to tell him that he\u2019d made an impression on me, and that I still thought of our time together, now and then. But I couldn\u2019t say that. It would betray too much, and make me sound like the naive girl I once was.</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to ask you for an explanation,\u201d I said, instead.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave this alone.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d For more reasons than he realized.</p><p>Our eyes met and all the air left the room for a moment. Just being here, around him, felt unreal. My fingers itched to reach out and touch his skin, to confirm that he was really there, sitting so close to me, after all these years. Seconds ticked by, marked by a grandfather clock that stood in one corner of the room.</p><p>My throat tightened. I knew more about him from his reputation than I did from the time we\u2019d spent together alone. Watching Claude now, his expression enigmatic and his motivations hidden behind his amused expression, it hit me that I\u2019d never really known him at all.</p><p>\u201cYou need to let this go. It\u2019s a personal investigation, and it\u2019s unnecessary for the OWEA to be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who dragged me into this. Look...\u201d How much to confide? I opened my hand, where I still clutched the picture I\u2019d drawn. Carefully, I unfolded it. The face appeared, marred now by the folds and smudged because I\u2019d drawn it up in pencil.</p><p>But my body\u2019s reaction was immediate and fierce. My vision closed up, and all I could see was that face. Snarling, fangs flashing. Dark eyes narrowing. I didn\u2019t realize how hard I was clutching the paper with the tips of my fingers until Claude tugged it from my grasp.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at the picture. I guessed he didn\u2019t have to. Instead, he sat next to me, close enough that I could feel the slight coolness of his body. Vampires weren\u2019t as cool as salamanders, but they ran a couple of degrees colder than humans.</p><p>His closeness was somehow comforting, which was silly; I barely knew the man, no matter what I liked to think in the dead of night when I was alone. But my body disagreed, and I fought the urge to lean against him and, just for a moment, take comfort. Breathe in his scent. Feel his hands on my skin, while his body moved against mine. Let the real world slip away.</p><p>Like I had once before.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The full truth almost fell from my dry mouth before I could stop it. But I caught myself. \u201cI\u2019d like to help you, for old time\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>If it was possible, he grew even more still. \u201cYou can trust me, Beatrice.\u201d His voice was low, caressing, and far too close to my ear. Trusting him when he still hadn\u2019t confided anything in me\u2014had in fact just lied to my face only hours before\u2014would be stupid. No matter how much I wanted to.</p><p>It had been so long since I\u2019d been able to trust someone like that.</p><p>I pushed up from the couch, unsettled. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve already shown trust by not reporting your little side case. I\u2019m offering you my skills as an investigator and a psychometrist\u2014temporarily anyway. Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.\u201d</p><p>He considered me for a moment, expression sharp and thoughtful. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I guess if you can have that much faith in me...\u201d He got up from the couch and paced back and forth across the room. \u201cI\u2019m after a killer, a man who has done horrible things. But he hides in the shadows. Using his name and connections and money to cover his trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not running this through your department because. . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust over a month ago, my partner was involved in a case with an OWEA agent while I was out of town on vampire business. The case involved a vamp homicide. Vic was killed on Luc Chevalier\u2019s\u2014the Magister\u2019s\u2014casino ship.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard about the case\u2014a murder so closely connected to a Magister that it had made the national news. The details had been dramatic, with a lycan OWEA agent injured, and two of Chicago\u2019s finest losing their lives. Another Chicago detective had been at the heart of the case, too. A young woman whose face had made headlines alongside the agent for cracking the case.</p><p>\u201cHolmes,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes. Astrid Holmes. My partner.\u201d Affection was obvious in his tone. He resumed pacing. \u201cThe case was all but tied to the Magister\u2019s son, Nicolas. But, once again, he wriggled free. All witnesses dead, and we were left with only circumstantial evidence to connect him. And that was flimsy.\u201d</p><p>Officially, vampires were guided by Magisters, who coordinated leadership and law enforcement with the official lawmakers. Unofficially, the vampires were rumored to have a much more complex system in place, and used the human system only when it suited them. The Magister\u2019s son would no doubt have an important role in the local hierarchy.</p><p>\u201cAnd this explains you not running the brand through normal channels...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a leak in our department\u2014probably more than one. One of the killers was a detective in our unit.\u201d</p><p>Recalling the details, I cursed under my breath. \u201cRight. Helping his psycho girlfriend or whatever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the official version, but I think he had been working for Nicolas Chevalier\u2014the Magister\u2019s son\u2014all along. That detective, and others like him, are why Nicolas is able to squirm his way out of charges. If he\u2019s infiltrated the local police so effectively, I have to assume that he also has eyes in the agency.\u201d He took a deep breath and let it out in a rush. Then moving precisely and slowly, he walked to the couch and sat across from me. His eyes caught mine, and I couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the ice-blue pureness of his irises\u2014although they were striking\u2014it was something else that held me. And for a brief moment, memory flooded back. His strong arms around me. His nimble hands sliding down my body. His wet mouth against my neck.</p><p>\u201cI know that if I take this through the normal channels, he\u2019ll find out I have the brand. He\u2019ll bury this\u2014whatever this is. His latest scheme. And he\u2019s got something big going\u2014all the hints and bits of evidence I can find point to something going down soon. Very soon.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the big things I\u2019ve connected him to\u2014circumstantially\u2014that he\u2019s done lately have occurred while I\u2019ve been out of town on vampire business. And I\u2019m scheduled again next week on business for Luc. This time for a few weeks, longer than I\u2019ve been gone for years. Very convenient timing for him. He\u2019ll strike then.\u201d</p><p>I shook myself, and looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the son of one of the most powerful vampires in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m aware of that. But Beatrice, if he pulls off whatever he\u2019s working on, it\u2019s going to be bad. Something that\u2019ll hurt a lot of people. And I don\u2019t see him succeeding without taking out some key people first. Like his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think his endgame is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing Nic? Power. He covets his father\u2019s position. He might be making a move to take over.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut to take over as a local Magister, he\u2019d need local otherworlder support. Leaders of various factions. And he\u2019d have to deal with any challengers among Luc\u2019s clan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI take it the current Magister would have to have moved on for this plan to work?\u201d Damn. If there was even the slightest chance of a huge upheaval in the local vampire world, it was big. Too big for the two of us to handle. But what were the odds he was right, and that no one had picked up on this big plot except for him?</p><p>\u201cYes. Luc would have to be dead\u2014or have agreed to step down, which isn\u2019t likely.\u201d His tone took on a fervent quality. \u201cNic would have to take out his father either in a challenge fight, which will never happen because Luc would wipe the floor with him one-on-one. Or, he\u2019d have to take out Luc without being connected to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever taken this to the Magister? Sounds like something he\u2019d be equipped to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Claude\u2019s expression turned grim. \u201cI\u2019ve taken many things concerning Nic to Luc, but he cannot bring himself to admit Nic\u2019s nature. For me to prove this to him, the evidence must be ironclad. Undeniable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, you sound a little off-kilter. And this is all just a story right now. You said yourself the evidence seems thin.\u201d My assessment was too honest. Uncomfortable, I shifted in my seat, keeping my eyes purposefully away from his, though the desire to look into that light blue ocean gripped me. Was this some kind of strange vampire power I\u2019d never heard of? Or was it just leftover attraction\u2014simple fascination?</p><p>Or was I lonely?</p> <p>Okay, sure, our past might have pushed me to get on that plane to Chicago\u2014but getting more information about the vampire from my dream was the main reason. Any residual feelings were just that\u2014leftover from our past with no bearing on our present.</p><p>\u201cThis could get you into a lot of trouble,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that you\u2019re not breaking any laws by investigating this on your own, off the books?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help the derision in my tone.</p><p>He turned to face me. My gaze locked with his, and raw emotion flashed in his eyes. What emotion, I couldn\u2019t be certain. It was gone before I could get a read on it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not breaking any laws. There aren\u2019t any bodies that can be tied to this brand\u2014not yet. Once I get that tie, I\u2019ll have enough to make a case.\u201d His expression turned grim. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s going to be especially difficult. The brand must have been spelled, somehow, to affect your power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d If I\u2019d been a cat, my fur would have bristled. The idea of something affecting my power was ridiculous. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Why the hell would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the face you drew\u2014it\u2019s not possible he was involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>My pride flared at the insinuation that my powers could be corrupted. \u201cMaybe you know him, but I\u2019ll bet you anything that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d He quirked an eyebrow at me and I felt my face flush. As if my reaction invited him, he leaned into my space. My stomach tensed, but I didn\u2019t move back. Not even when he reached up and tucked a bit of hair behind my ear. \u201cNow that\u2019s a bet I\u2019d like to lose.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>A couple of hours later, Claude was showing me to his guest room.</p><p>We\u2019d just returned from delivering the brand to Natalie, a Covenant witch, who seemed more like a friend than a colleague to Claude. She thought his theory that the brand was spelled to give an inaccurate vision to be far-fetched. But she had promised to look into it\u2014for a fee, of course. Friend of Claude\u2019s or no, she was still a Covenant witch.</p><p>The vampire guided me down the corridor, confident and a little distracted, as if my staying with him wasn\u2019t a big deal. As if he lent the room often. For all I knew, he did.</p><p>Staying here made more sense than going to a hotel. And the part of my mind that disagreed could kindly shut the hell up.</p><p>But he had a point. If this vampire Nicolas had gone after cops on his trail before, he\u2019d be likely to do it again. I would rest just a little easier with a powerful vampire down the hall. A hotel might not be safe.</p><p>\u201cDo you get a lot of visitors?\u201d I asked, once I\u2019d freshened up and met him back in the kitchen. Takeout Indian food lined the countertop, and I climbed onto a bar stool and reached for my Styrofoam container.</p><p>\u201cLoads. It\u2019s a regular hotel-motel around here,\u201d he said from the other side of the breakfast bar. I raised an eyebrow at that and he laughed. \u201cOccasionally. Vampires have friends, you know.\u201d</p><p>Heat flushed my cheeks. Of course vampires had friends, and after working in the OWEA with all sorts of different otherworlders, I had to admit that most were very similar to humans in how they acted\u2014at least on the surface. But behind closed doors...</p><p>Well, I\u2019d seen a lot of weird shit on the job, too.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s talk about it,\u201d I said. No point in avoiding the topic any longer. I needed to know who the man in that picture was. That was why I was still here, after all. Helping Claude was purely secondary. And if I continued to repeat that, eventually I\u2019d believe it.</p><p>He sipped a dark red wine that lingered on the glass in such a way that it made me wonder. But Claude was private, and didn\u2019t strike me as brazen enough to drink blood in front of me without asking.</p><p>\u201cTalk about what? The Indian food? Because it smells divine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the bullshit, Claude. Who is the man in the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he so important to you?\u201d</p><p>Because my vision of the vampire was real, whether Claude believed it or not. More than that, it confirmed the vision I\u2019d had during my childhood\u2014when I should have been too young to have a psychometric vision\u2014had been real, despite everyone\u2019s insistence.</p><p>And that meant Claude\u2019s friend had been involved in more than one murder.</p><p>Suddenly the air around me disappeared, and the world twisted. Of course. Few events were traumatic enough to psychically imprint an event on an object.</p><p>The same bit of logic followed for that piece of my brother\u2019s coat.</p><p>My older brother, Eddie\u2014nine years my senior\u2014had almost definitely died before they found part of his jacket. Before I\u2019d touched it. Before the police officer had brought it by for my parents to identify.</p><p>The officer had been careless while he comforted my parents and had left it on the table where I, a curious ten-year-old, happened upon it. But how could he have known it would spur a vision that would influence my entire life?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s taking time out of my life to help you on an investigation that could lead to misconduct charges. I deserve to know what you know,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I hardly think your job is at risk\u2014you are far too valuable.\u201d He leaned toward me. The breakfast bar kept a safe distance between us, but the slight smell of him\u2014spicy and clean\u2014drifted to me, present even with the Indian food permeating the air. A grin touched his lips, as if he could see my mental squirming and he resumed his perfectly straight posture. \u201cYour powers as a psychometrist are quite important to them.\u201d</p><p>That I\u2019d been thinking almost the exact same thing irritated me. That I wanted to lean toward him to see if the intoxicating smell of him was real or imagined irritated me even more. \u201cNot the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you be doing if you weren\u2019t here, helping? Not working a case, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He took a sip of his hopefully-wine as I processed what he\u2019d said. \u201cNot until psych signs off on you.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment warred with anger, and they mixed to run through me in a sickening wave. He knew. He knew that I\u2019d been put on a leave of absence. Sure, it was something that happened to psychometrists, and most went back to work afterward for another year or two, until the pressure built back up and they had to decompress again.</p><p>Until the dreams and dark thoughts pushed them to a point where they couldn\u2019t function in their jobs anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the idea that Claude knew\u2014a man I\u2019d admired, a man who had probably never shown a moment of weakness in his life\u2014shook me to my core.</p><p>Who else knew? Fuck.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let him know how much this bothered me. I twisted my finger out of the bit of hair I\u2019d unconsciously wrapped around it, and then slammed my hand down on his counter\u2014making a most unsatisfying low thump. Stupid granite countertops. \u201cTell me now or I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Claude murmured, mouth only inches from my hair.</p><p>I jumped. He stood next to me now. Fast would be an understatement.</p><p>\u201cI had no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I waved off the hand he was trying to touch my shoulder with. I didn\u2019t need comfort. \u201cJust tell me who the fuck the vampire from my vision is.\u201d</p><p>Claude sighed, almost imperceptibly, then walked at a more human speed back to the other side of the breakfast bar where he\u2019d left his half-drunk glass of wine.</p> <p>\u201cThe man in the drawing is Luc Chevalier.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the beer he\u2019d gotten me, which I\u2019d left untouched, and tipped it to my lips. The cold liquid slid down my throat, coating it as I downed half the bottle.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Magister.\u201d The vampire leader for Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. One of the most powerful vampires in the country. And father to the vampire Claude hunted.</p><p>The Magister had been involved in my brother\u2019s disappearance, and I\u2019d seen it in my vision. I\u2019d convinced myself that the flash\u2014and accompanying nightmares\u2014I\u2019d gotten off my brother\u2019s jacket eighteen years before had been my imagination.</p><p>But now I knew it was a vision, because the man\u2014the vampire\u2014I\u2019d seen, fucking existed.</p> <p>How had I not known? How had I not seen him on the news? He was the vampire equivalent of a local politician\u2014only more powerful. Maybe because most vampires were notoriously camera shy, and I didn\u2019t much care about noncriminal-related news anyway.</p><p>\u201cI know him, Beatrice. And I know he wouldn\u2019t be involved in this mess. Wouldn\u2019t take innocent lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be certain of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? How can you say that for sure? Because old vampires are terrible at hiding things, right? That\u2019s how they survive for so long\u2014excessive honesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been friends with the man for centuries. Centuries. Vampires that old don\u2019t just change. And he couldn\u2019t have hidden ritualistically killing people or torturing them with branding irons for centuries from me.\u201d</p><p>I found myself, once again, unable to look away from the pale irises. He cared\u2014really cared\u2014about this friend of his. And the way he spoke, it was as if he needed me to believe in the Magister as well.</p><p>I turned to look at my beer bottle, still clutched in my hand. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s the people closest to us who are able to fool us most easily\u2014or we fool ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s an angel\u2014he\u2019s not\u2014but he\u2019s also not a sociopath. I\u2019m not an idiot, mon chou.\u201d Exhaustion suddenly soaked his tone, and he leaned against the counter for support.</p><p>A shiver ran up my back at the familiar endearment, but I took a deep breath and ignored it. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that I could be close to him for so long and not notice that kind of flaw? We can only fool ourselves so much.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that. After centuries at the vampire\u2019s side, could he fail to notice a sociopathic nature? Sounded unlikely. And for that to happen to a man like Claude\u2014an investigator at his very core? Hell, I\u2019d heard he\u2019d served in law enforcement for decades, before vampires were even acknowledged as anything more than old wives\u2019 tales.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t let the idea go.</p><p>I forced myself to study the vampire before me. The longish hair, the AC/DC T-shirt, the light blue eyes, and the strong jawline. The wide shoulders and obvious strength in his arms.</p><p>Every instinct in my body told me that he was worthy of trust. Even our time together\u2014with its abrupt ending\u2014supported the fact that he was an honest man. He\u2019d never made me any promises, no matter what my heart had hoped for. But if I trusted him, then I had to give his friend the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Because if Luc Chevalier proved to be a villain, so too, would Claude.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll give your friend the benefit of the doubt,\u201d I said, finally, voice thick. So much for telling him about my brother\u2019s and Luc\u2019s connection. I definitely wasn\u2019t going to share it now.</p><p>Tension left him so visibly it was like a waterfall rushing to disappear into the floor beneath him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m also not letting you investigate this alone.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up and his eyes met mine. I stifled a grin. How often was Claude Desmarais startled? Not often, I would wager.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>My urge to smile faded. Saying that I didn\u2019t trust him to bring in a man with whom he\u2019d shared several lifetimes of friendship wouldn\u2019t encourage him to let me in. \u201cLike you said, I\u2019m not allowed back on active duty for a couple more weeks, and I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, he didn\u2019t argue that it wasn\u2019t safe. He didn\u2019t even try a halfhearted attempt. Instead, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate your insights, especially if Natalie is able to remove whatever is on the brand that\u2019s clouding your vision.\u201d</p><p>Thank God I\u2019d had years to perfect my poker face, otherwise I don\u2019t think I could have kept a convincingly blank expression. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He set his wineglass in the sink and then turned to me; some of the concern I\u2019d thought I\u2019d seen earlier touched his expression. \u201cNo playing hero, and no talking about this to anyone but me. I can protect you, but no reason to add to the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m no hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how I remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour memory is faulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d His voice turned wistful. \u201cIt\u2019s served me well. Gotten me through many nights alone. My memory, and wondering what might have been.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted in my chest, pushing into my throat. I\u2019d spent more nights thinking about what-ifs than I\u2019d ever admit, too. I took a drink of my beer to buy myself a moment, but my voice still came out hoarse. \u201cPondering what-ifs is a waste of time, Claude. The past is what it is. We\u2019re all on the paths we\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future is hardly set in stone,\u201d he said, but I could barely hear him, his voice was so low.</p><p>\u201cIt might as well be.\u201d I drank the rest of my beer and then muttered a good night and headed back to my room, thoughts reeling. Thinking about the emotion I clearly heard in his voice, when he talked about what might have been, was too dangerous. I forced myself to focus on the here and now. On the case. That Claude didn\u2019t even try to discourage me from helping on this case seemed...out of character. Either he was exceedingly confident of his ability to protect me, or he was more worried about catching Nicolas than keeping people safe. Me-shaped people anyway.</p><p>Or hell, maybe I just didn\u2019t know the vampire as well as I thought I did.</p><p>Maybe it was time for me to get out while I still could.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cThis place is messed up, little sister.\u201d</p><p>A toothpick flashed, in and out of his mouth, and I winced at the sight. I always worried he\u2019d stab his cheek with it, or puncture his lip. I\u2019d managed to do both when I\u2019d tried to copy the habit.</p><p>Sunlight reflected off his carrot-colored hair, bright despite the cold. It had to be cold\u2014he was wearing his brown, puffy coat. That coat...</p><p>\u201cNot a place for a little girl.\u201d He spit the toothpick out and stared out into the street beyond. We sat on the edge of a sidewalk, next to a gutter clogged with trash. The musty scent of it touched my nose.</p><p>I knew this corner.</p><p>I opened my mouth, but he turned to me and I lost my train of thought. His mouth twisted into a wry grin. \u201cBut I guess a little girl is all I got, huh? Figures you\u2019d be my only hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl,\u201d I argued, but my voice came out wrong. Different. Young.</p><p>His green eyes, so similar to my own, were bleak, but his voice was flat when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them take me.\u201d</p><p>Darkness washed over us, as if the whole world had suddenly dropped away from the sun. Streetlamps filled the shadows with their eerie glow. Tires shrieked.</p><p>I closed my eyes against the noise. And when I opened them again, my brother was gone. A torn bit of his coat remained, the edge just touching a small pool of blood.</p><p>My breath came fast and panic curdled in my stomach, but I couldn\u2019t move. A yelp cut through the silence. I couldn\u2019t see who was screaming. Couldn\u2019t see anything anymore. But I knew who cried out for help. My brother. He had my brother. And he\u2019d get me, too.</p><p>He was coming for me now. I knew it. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get away. I turned my head.</p><p>Familiar features, twisted in hunger. A predator\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He was here.</p><p>Sweat soaked my sheets when I awoke, and my heart raced, trying to beat its way out of my chest. I hadn\u2019t dreamed of my brother in years\u2014I saw plenty of fresh, new bad things to keep my subconscious busy on cases without my mind needing to dredge up old nightmares. But now, with one touch of a brand and one vision of Claude\u2019s Magister, my brother again took center stage in my nightmares.</p><p>Going home wasn\u2019t an option any longer. Even if Claude hadn\u2019t been involved, I had to stay on this case.</p><p>My brother was right. I was his only hope. Even though it was too late to save him, I could find the man responsible for his death.</p><p>And I would.</p><p>Claude was gone by the time I\u2019d dragged myself out of the shower and into the kitchen. The vampire had brewed fresh coffee. A short note left on the counter beside it said he\u2019d be back soon, and that I should make myself at home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right.</p><p>I ate fast, grabbing a muffin I found in a small stack next to the coffeemaker, then I sipped coffee while I searched the Internet. There was almost nothing to go on to locate the brand\u2019s markings within the seemingly endless streams of data on the web. I needed to confine my search. I needed to get into the OWEA\u2019s database.</p><p>I grabbed my cell phone and hit Parker\u2019s name on my contact list. Two rings, and a deep voice answered.</p> <p>\u201cParker. I need your login info for the database.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Parker. Really. I just need to do some research. Nothing stressful. Promise.\u201d I crossed my fingers behind my back.</p><p>The new recruit, still in his first year on the job, hesitated for a second longer, then rattled off the information. I thanked him and hung up before he could ask me any questions.</p><p>He was a good-enough kid, and a good-enough partner. A lycan in his early twenties. Enthusiastic about his job. A decent investigator. Easily led.</p> <p>Guilt pressed against the back of my mind, but I ignored it. Yes, I was using my influence as his senior partner. It was an abuse of power. An abuse of the crush he so obviously had on me. But hell, I wasn\u2019t asking for much. Nothing he could get more than a slap on the wrist for sharing.</p><p>The OWEA database access wasn\u2019t fully enabled from a personal laptop hooked up outside of an OWEA office, but I could access the records I needed\u2014the \u201cItems, Mystical and Magical\u201d database. I searched for branding irons first, but there were dozens of records, far more than I expected. I narrowed down the search further by adding in the term \u201critual.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen items remained. The first four proved to be standard irons, where the designs themselves weren\u2019t important to the ritual in which they\u2019d been used\u2014it had been the pain that mattered. The next two twisted my stomach, and made me wish I\u2019d never touched the muffin.</p><p>The designs weren\u2019t important in those either, but the attackers had used their initials to brand their victims. I continued to click through the branding irons, stomach hardening at each picture, at each description. Finally, after looking at fourteen irons where the brand symbology didn\u2019t seem relevant to the actual crime, I hit pay dirt.</p><p>The symbol of the brand used to mark a man in Butte, Montana, nearly a decade before wasn\u2019t at all similar to the one Claude had had me touch, but the symbol was relevant\u2014scratch that, necessary\u2014for the ritual it was used to complete.</p><p>But it was the why that got me.</p> <p>The symbol allowed the woman who branded him to drain him of his energy, like a vampire could do through a blood drain, or a succubus could do with sex. The woman who had branded him simply had to touch the branded flesh with a bit of her blood to activate the magic. A magic she could then activate whenever she wanted from a distance, with a bit more blood and a lot of energy.</p><p>My breath caught. A shaman.</p><p>But shamans didn\u2019t tend to deal in murder. With their connection to living things, killing wouldn\u2019t be easy for them. I had a hard time wrapping my brain around the idea of a shaman being involved in this.</p><p>The sound of a door clicking shut had me reaching for my sidearm\u2014a weapon I no longer possessed, and wouldn\u2019t have again until I was back on official duty.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice?\u201d Claude\u2019s voice rang out, and my blood pressure dropped.</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen,\u201d I called back.</p><p>\u201cI brought lunch.\u201d He held up a bag from a local fast food joint, Wolfy\u2019s, and I grinned. For a man who didn\u2019t require food to live, he sure knew his local eateries.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I pulled a hot dog out of the bag and eyed Claude, who had already started in on his French fries.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize vampires ate so often. I mean\u2014food-food.\u201d Had he eaten so much before and I simply hadn\u2019t noticed? No. We\u2019d both been too distracted to eat much then. By the case and by each other. For a moment, it was as if I could feel his hand sliding up my side to caress my breast, his clever tongue slipping into my mouth to tease moans from my lips. My breath caught at the memory.</p><p>He bit off the end of his fry, flashing me just a tip of fang. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give us sustenance like blood does, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t taste good.\u201d His eyes twinkled and his mouth turned up in a most distracting grin. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve found it makes humans more comfortable if they see me eat when they do.\u201d</p><p>As if I could forget he was a vampire.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can see why. Not really any shame in drinking blood though.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and their color struck me again. The man should not be allowed such lovely eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not the typical reaction I get. Humans tend to be...uncomfortable when confronted by the realities of my existence.\u201d He hesitated, as if choosing his words carefully. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s different\u2014witnessing it during an intimate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it,\u201d I plowed on and pretended my embarrassment wasn\u2019t obvious on my heated cheeks. I refused to let him finish that sentence. Red hair and the pale skin that accompanied it didn\u2019t make hiding emotions easy, but I didn\u2019t have to acknowledge it. \u201cI don\u2019t see people looking askance at a plant for absorbing energy in a way different from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But plants aren\u2019t potential predators\u2014not of human prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d The easy conversation warmed me, especially since he didn\u2019t try to bring up anything intimate again, and we ate the rest of our food in companionable silence. Swallowing the last of my Coke, I closed my eyes.</p><p>The brand, orange and bright and full of malice, filled my sight.</p><p>Claude patted my back as I choked, coughing out the soda I\u2019d inhaled.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d His hand lingered on my back, soft pressure sending warmth into my center and bits of electricity up my spine. And I almost imagined I felt a soft brush of his thumb stroking me before his hand dropped and he walked back around to the kitchen side of the breakfast bar.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I spluttered out from behind the napkin I\u2019d managed to cough most of the soda into. I didn\u2019t want to tell him about the vision echo, so I didn\u2019t give him a chance to ask. It would only worry him, make him want to send me home. I\u2019d lose any chance at finding out what had happened all those years ago to my brother.</p><p>And he\u2019d be trying to take down Nicolas Chevalier alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about shamans?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink at the sudden change of subject. \u201cAs much as the next man who\u2019s been around awhile, I guess. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there an indication of shamanic magic on the brand? Wherever you actually happened upon it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rude to answer a question with a question,\u201d he said, but amusement laced his tone.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever claim to be polite?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help grinning at my jibe.</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cQuite right. You win\u2014yes, there was shamanic magic on the brand. Just a touch, but my partner is a sensitive, and quite good at her job.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the twinge in my chest at his obvious affection for his partner, and the desire to ask him where she was in all this. If they were so close\u2014and she was so good at her job\u2014then why wasn\u2019t she here helping? Granted, sensitives didn\u2019t get visions from objects like psychometrists did, but they were able to feel the energy exuded by otherworlders\u2014even traces left behind on objects.</p><p>Useful was hardly a strong enough word for them.</p><p>\u201cSo as to what I know of them, shamans are a varied lot,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re all spirit-oriented\u2014both human and animal. As a result they tend to be very tied into the energy around them. Empathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNature lovers.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat too, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found something similar to your brand in the OWEA database. Well, similar enough. A brand used in a ritual with shamanic magic involved.\u201d</p><p>His smile faltered. \u201cI told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking deep enough for anyone to get pinged or even be able to see I was there beyond a standard search. I just hit the general objects database. Of course, if we want more details about the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. Not yet anyway. Tell me what you found.\u201d</p><p>Bossy. I frowned at him, but didn\u2019t argue. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s directly related to what you found, but a brand was used by a woman practicing shamanic magic a decade ago. She branded a symbol into a man\u2019s chest and used it to drain him of his energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds unlikely for a shaman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI Googled it after. According to news articles, she\u2019d utterly lost it after her child was killed. The branding victim was responsible\u2014DUI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it work exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough detail in the general database file to be able to tell. But it wasn\u2019t an overnight thing. She killed him over a period of months.\u201d</p><p>Claude interlaced his fingers and stretched his shoulders. \u201cWell, guess we may need to risk exposure to get the file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think he might have spies in the OWEA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible\u2014hell, probable. Why wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell him that he was wrong. That the OWEA stood for something, and the people in it were decent, hardworking law enforcement officers who wouldn\u2019t sell out. I snapped my mouth shut and gave him a short nod instead.</p><p>A wistful smile touched his mouth. \u201cFor a second there, you reminded me of someone.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped, racing for no reason I could fathom. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fiery redheaded rookie, who believed that justice would always prevail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I was never that naive.\u201d Not since I was a little girl who\u2019d lost her older brother. Not since the mystery of what had happened to him had gone unsolved. Not since I\u2019d seen a vision of Luc Chevalier when I was ten years old, a vision everyone had told me was simply a nightmare. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not fiery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d His joke failed. The wistfulness faded from his expression, and he almost looked a little sad. \u201cBut you did have a certain optimism.\u201d</p><p>Years of visions and nightmares had robbed me of that, but I couldn\u2019t say it aloud. \u201cI\u2019m a realist now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a cynic?\u201d His grin returned, and I couldn\u2019t help the tug at my own lips.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d thought visiting the house of a Covenant witch in the cold Chicago winter irritating, I\u2019d have been wrong. It had nothing on slinking down a dark alley with the wind whipping off Lake Michigan to visit a man the Covenant witch, Natalie, had suggested might have information about the brand. But the wind was the only relief to be found from the stink of old garbage and worse things that inundated the alley. The chill or the stench, I wasn\u2019t sure which was worse.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t even getting paid to deal with this bullshit.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Claude halted in front of a black door painted in such a flat tone it looked as if it had been done with a spray can.</p><p>I bumped elbows with Claude as he knocked and saw what had caught his vampire eyes. A tiny symbol\u2014three lines stacked, evenly spaced, only about an inch long, with an odd swirl beneath them. They appeared to have been scratched into the paint.</p> <p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I muttered, and the door swung open.</p><p>I backed up a step, and with one hand I reached for the gun I no longer carried, and with the other hand I sought a badge that I\u2019d surrendered. The man filled the doorway, a giant who I suspected would have to bend down simply to walk through the space. But he wasn\u2019t only tall, his shoulders were wide and he had arms bigger than my head. I\u2019d have thought him a giant, if giants had been real. He dwarfed Claude.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said through the long black beard, peppered in gray, that covered his face and neck.</p><p>\u201cCustomers.\u201d</p><p>Claude looked as if he would have said more, but the man was no longer listening. After the word customers, he jerked his head at us and turned, letting the door fall from his grip. Claude caught it gracefully, as if he\u2019d expected the man to take off. Thank goodness for vampire reflexes.</p><p>Claude shot me a reassuring grin and I frowned. I\u2019d needed to be reassured by him at one point in my life\u2014but no longer.</p> <p>The alleyway had smelled bad, but the inky dark hallway smelled purely frightening. Not stinky\u2014no. But the scents of the alleyway had at least been identifiable\u2014normal, even. The hallway stank of fire and smoke and pain.</p><p>No. That was the memory of the vision talking. The smoke that had triggered the memory, yes, that was here, but not the pain. Not the blinding brightness of the enflamed branding iron. I blinked quickly even as I followed Claude closely, suppressing the urge to grip his jacket to make sure I didn\u2019t get lost, and pushing down the urge to panic.</p><p>Claude didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble navigating the hallway, and I silently envied him his vampire sight. We followed the man until the hallway tilted\u2014a ramp leading down into even greater darkness.</p><p>My heart jumped into my throat. I didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t cry out, but Claude paused to reach back and take my hand in his. A rush of relief ran through me at the touch and, my resolve wavering, I let him hold my hand. But I managed to suppress my desire to grasp at him desperately.</p><p>After what felt like hours, the ramp evened out and a small room was revealed. Ventilation fans hovered over what looked like old-fashioned blacksmith fire pits, a curious mix of new and old. The fires weren\u2019t lit. Instead, a single fluorescent bulb glowed uncovered above a large metal desk that seemed to divide the customer area from the fire pits in the back.</p><p>I assumed it was a desk. By the height, it was more accurately described as a counter. But when the big man sat behind it and pulled out a yellow, legal-sized notepad and pen, there was no doubt how he used the thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you want\u2019n?\u201d he asked, and I struggled to figure out the accent. Sounded Irish, but was a little off. Maybe he\u2019d lived in the States long enough for it to change a bit. That didn\u2019t sound quite right either. But I was no accent expert.</p><p>\u201cInformation,\u201d Claude said.</p> <p>The giant set the pen down on the notebook and leaned back in his oversized chair. Just as large as he\u2019d appeared outside, he looked even more intimidating under the too-white glow of the fluorescent bulb. Thick gray hair stood at haphazard angles on his head, as if we\u2019d woken him up in the middle of the night. Craggy skin covered the rest of his hide and the backs of his hands. Not pockmarked, but uneven and odd. Burned, I thought. I glanced at the fire pit behind him, and was rewarded with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t got no information for the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t like cops?\u201d Claude slapped his badge down on the counter.</p><p>The giant leaned back, crossing his big arms across his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t like fangers.\u201d</p><p>Claude went still\u2014too still\u2014like only vampires could. \u201cI don\u2019t much care if you like me,\u201d he said, voice still even, almost amused. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t care either. When it comes down to it, my money spends just as well as the next guy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The beard moved, revealing yellowed teeth set in a frightening smile. \u201cS\u2019pose it does, at that.\u201d</p><p>Claude pulled out my drawing of the brand and set it on the man\u2019s desk. \u201cI need to know everything you know about this symbol.\u201d</p><p>The man named a figure that made me gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ripping me off!\u201d Claude jabbed his finger at the giant.</p><p>I gaped; I\u2019d never seen the vampire yell.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I am! That\u2019ll teach ya not to be so cocky.\u201d An evil glint touched his narrowed eyes. \u201cMaybe should charge ya double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should kick the piss out of your witch ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike to see you try, shrimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOaf!\u201d</p><p>Their insults grew cruder and more extravagant, and amusement broke slowly onto both of their expressions as my mood darkened. They were friends and he\u2019d let me assume we might be in danger. Not funny.</p><p>After Claude suggested something wholly anatomically unlikely, the witch laughed, and the booming sound filled all the corners of the room. He named another price, about half the original one he\u2019d suggested. It was still astronomical by my scale.</p><p>Claude grinned, but didn\u2019t hesitate in his reply. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Claude said, shooting me a wink.</p><p>Whatever. It was his money. What did I care that it was more than I made in half a year?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I have somethin\u2019 for ya, if there\u2019s somethin\u2019 to be found.\u201d</p><p>I made an exasperated noise, and Claude glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know you can trust him?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in two days, whether you\u2019ve called or not. I would like to have it in my possession before the gala,\u201d Claude told the giant, ignoring my question.</p><p>\u201cWhat gala?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Finally Claude\u2019s attention shifted to me, but before he could answer the giant spoke.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fancy vampire bash this weekend. Goin\u2019 to be borin\u2019 as all get out, but a fanger\u2019ll take any chance to put on a shiny suit, eh?\u201d</p><p>Claude shot the giant a glare before turning back to me. \u201cThe Chevaliers throw a gala event for the local otherworlder elite every few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTryin\u2019 to remind people they think they\u2019re in charge,\u201d the giant grumbled.</p><p>Claude waved a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not important, but this brand and my timeline are. Two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d the man said. \u201cTwo days. But I\u2019m gonna need some specifics from ya, about the metal and such. Can\u2019t make nothin\u2019 worth workin\u2019 powerful magic with that ain\u2019t made right. The metal\u2014it\u2019ll tell us somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Claude nodded and set an envelope on the counter, no doubt the down payment for services that by my guess might not ever get done. We turned to go, but the giant\u2019s words followed us down his endless hallway.</p><p>\u201cDamn fanger.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you paid a man\u2014probably a criminal\u2014that kind of money. And for what? Probably nothing,\u201d I groused after Claude called Natalie and instructed her to send the details of the brand\u2019s metal composition to the giant\u2014how the witch would determine that, I had no idea. A spell? A home chemistry kit? Claude handed over some of the takeout he had again picked up. \u201cNot to mention that show of insults. I take it you know each other?\u201d</p><p>Of course they did, and probably well. And Claude hadn\u2019t bothered to warn me about their weird, macho idea of friendship. I\u2019d been convinced I\u2019d have to run from a fight. Dammit. I needed my sidearm. At least it gave me the illusion of being on even ground.</p><p>\u201cJudging people based on looks alone? Beneath you, mon chou, to stereotype. You don\u2019t know for sure he\u2019s a criminal.\u201d The vampire was annoyingly unflappable, and he munched on his orange chicken like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Claude\u2019s grin widened. \u201cOh, yes. He\u2019s quite the criminal. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should stereotype.\u201d</p><p>Ass.</p><p>\u201cBut minor things, nothing violent. Do you have a better idea than paying off my criminal friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. I do have a better idea. We could pull in your partner. A sensitive could probably help a ton. Hell, she could have helped us at that giant\u2019s. She could\u2019ve probably sensed out a dozen reasons for us to have arrested him, or avoided paying him for nothing.\u201d</p><p>A flash of pain touched his expression. \u201cAstrid is still recovering from injuries from the Chevalier\u2019s casino ship case.\u201d</p><p>I started at that. A month had passed since that case. She had to have been hurt worse than I\u2019d thought. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been so badly injured.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt could have been much worse. But I don\u2019t particularly want to drag her into something new, even if she was at 100 percent. It takes a while to fully recover from something like that\u2014more than just healing from physical wounds. If we get something that we need a sensitive for, I\u2019ll consider it. But not unless we have something solid for her to check out.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed the urge to yank on my hair out of pure frustration. \u201cLet\u2019s pull the OWEA file, then\u2014in full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulling the file will leave a trace. A trace that\u2019ll lead right to your door.\u201d</p> <p>The file would lead right to Parker\u2019s door, more likely, since I still didn\u2019t have clearance. Or right to my supervisor\u2019s door, because Bill would probably pull it for me if I asked. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a damn sight more likely to lead us somewhere\u2014unlike paying off your giant friend. And how likely is it that someone would be looking for that exact file to be pulled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unlikely. You said yourself there were few cases similar to this one. If he has someone in the OWEA, he\u2019ll be looking to monitor similar cases.\u201d</p><p>The smell of the food finally overwhelmed my determination to ignore it until this was settled. I grabbed the chicken fried rice and scooped some onto the plate Claude had set out for me. A thought hit me as I reached for the beef and broccoli, and I stopped, my hunger suddenly less important. \u201cClaude, does this guy know his brand is missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p> <p>He took a bite of chicken\u2014to buy himself time, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cLook, did you actually just happen upon this somewhere? Or will he have reason to think someone took it? Will he suspect you?\u201d Questions ran through my head faster than I could verbalize them. If this vampire\u2014one who was obviously powerful and strong if he\u2019d evaded Claude for who-knew-how-long\u2014realized that someone was collecting evidence against him, it wouldn\u2019t take him long to figure out who. And that put both Claude and me in danger.</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, arm muscles pressing against the confines of his T-shirt. \u201cNicolas owns a cabin in Wisconsin\u2014technically it\u2019s owned by a dead acquaintance of his, to keep anyone from connecting it to him, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s very isolated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out about it?\u201d</p><p>He grinned wryly. \u201cThe old-fashioned way: police work. Research. Talking to people on the ground, looking through old records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI went there when I knew Nic would be out of state. I brought my partner, Astrid, with me. She said the place had been cleaned\u2014psychically. And the only thing she could sense anything on was the brand. It had been stuck in a bin with the fireplace tools.\u201d</p><p>Shit. This was starting to feel a lot riskier to my job than I\u2019d thought. \u201cYou broke in? Stole it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine, and my chest tightened. Why did he still have such an effect on me? We hadn\u2019t been anything to each other in years\u2014even if we had only been casual lovers enjoying each other\u2019s company then.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think that he\u2019s going to catch on? What the hell, Claude?\u201d I stepped down from the barstool, half wishing I could walk out the door. But I couldn\u2019t. Not with the man connected to my brother\u2019s disappearance involved.</p><p>My prospects weren\u2019t good, however. Claude might be able to defend himself from a vampire like Nicolas Chevalier, but I wasn\u2019t ignorant enough to think I could. I still wasn\u2019t sure that digging into anything related to my brother\u2019s disappearance was a good idea. I\u2019d avoided it for years, with good reason.</p><p>But some obsessions were harder to shut down than others, and it wasn\u2019t a wound I could poke at without consequences.</p><p>\u201cNic hasn\u2019t returned to the cabin since we were there, and he\u2019s not likely to anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he hadn\u2019t been there in six months before I went there. Besides, I have a...friend keeping an eye out. If Nicolas sets foot near that cabin, I\u2019ll know about it before he becomes a threat.\u201d</p><p>Who did he have watching the cabin? And how? The questions were on the tip of my tongue, but I shook my head. No. I didn\u2019t need to know any of that, and didn\u2019t really want to know.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d be willing to take a risk not only to your person, but to your career if anyone finds out\u2014but not be willing to pull a damn file,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>He let out a short laugh, but there was no humor in the sound. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m worried about my career?\u201d He leaned forward, again catching my gaze with his, and my stomach clenched. \u201cI have had many careers in my lifetime. I will continue to do what I do, bringing otherworlders and humans to justice for their crimes, whether or not the Chicago Police Department continues to pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not all of us have the benefit of multiple lifetimes, Claude. Astrid doesn\u2019t. I certainly don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it under control. No one\u2019s career is at stake, Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where I\u2019m standing, you have nothing under control. You\u2019re not even willing to investigate this the right way, yet you\u2019re willing to steal a suspect\u2019s property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could do better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I could. I\u2019d start by getting Natalie off that wild goose chase you\u2019ve got her on, and use her skills on something important instead. Then I\u2019d pull some damn files from the OWEA or the local police Paranormal Unit that are similar. Track down witnesses. Talk to some shamans. See what you can find using real police work.\u201d</p><p>I got up close and personal, leaving only inches between us. \u201cAnd I\u2019d take a serious look at your supposed friend, Luc Chevalier. Because he isn\u2019t clean in all this. I\u2019d bet my life on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you that Luc has nothing to do with this,\u201d Claude said, his voice a low growl. He stood over me, as if his height would intimidate me. I\u2019d finally rattled the unrattlable vampire. Go me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you that I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>Claude slammed a hand down on his countertop, and the loud boom startled me. He was a better slammer than I was, I\u2019d give him that.</p><p>\u201cI need some air,\u201d he muttered. Without another word, he turned and walked to the living room. The open floor plan made his destination obvious, and he walked out onto the balcony. Annoyingly, he moved calmly, as if he hadn\u2019t just lost his temper.</p><p>I struggled with the urge to follow him and continue our argument. Claude might not be able to see it, but he was blinded by his feelings for his friend. And could I blame him?</p><p>Minutes turned into nearly an hour, and I finally couldn\u2019t leave it alone anymore. I threw on my coat, cursing under my breath. Then I opened the door to the balcony, and stared out at the view. It was lovely. All that dark water\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have known it from the ocean. And I wouldn\u2019t have even seen it if not for the moon blazing above us. Lights shone below us and to the sides, too, but all man-made. Brisk air filled my lungs, and I was thankful I\u2019d remembered the jacket.</p><p>Movement caught my eye. I turned to face Claude. He sat in the corner, a bottle of whiskey on the small table at his side. I suppressed the urge to sigh, knowing my words would land on deaf ears even before I said them. \u201cIf it looks like a duck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d Weariness coated his tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him in another vision, Claude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much, the way you look at the picture you drew. But you don\u2019t trust me enough to give me any details about it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, but I answered anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick to death of talking about this. Let\u2019s speak of something more pleasant.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. The situation was just too ridiculous. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Vampires don\u2019t get drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever call me back?\u201d</p><p>The change of topic spun me, and I couldn\u2019t grasp my thoughts. \u201cWhat?\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cWe had amazing sex for several weeks. I know that I didn\u2019t treat you well after, but I called you after the case ended. You never called me back.\u201d He spoke slowly, as if talking too fast would be more than I could comprehend.</p><p>My mind warred. Half of me wanted to turn around and run into the condo as fast as I could. Avoid this conversation. Avoid this man who inevitably got under my skin.</p><p>But my other half was pissed.</p><p>\u201cYou called me months after the case ended, Claude. Three months. And after the way you talked to me, you expected me to be waiting for your call?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou were right. It was an affair. Fun. But that\u2019s all it was.\u201d</p><p>His voice was low, but it carried to my ears. \u201cIt took me three months to realize I didn\u2019t want just an affair with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it took me less than three months to realize an affair was all I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d I asked. He hesitated, and rage bubbled up inside of me. As did the all too clear memory of exactly what he\u2019d said to me during our final hour together. \u201cMaybe you regret telling me what we had was fun, but it didn\u2019t mean anything. That we\u2019d experienced an amusing dalliance you\u2019d grown bored of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tone was the worst, you know.\u201d I hated the catch in my throat, the too-high pitch in my quavering voice. \u201cThe disinterested, holier than thou tone that made me feel like a piece of trash. Like a silly little girl who you had to explain the ways of the world to.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cFor a while I believed you. I thought I was the one in the wrong for telling you that I loved you. I put myself out there\u2014confessed my feelings. That\u2019s not something that comes easily for me. And you humiliated me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fire drained from his expression, and for a moment I felt like I\u2019d won, as if winning this argument meant a thing.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to protect you, for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect me? From what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom my enemies for one\u2014I have acquired a few through the decades.\u201d A ghost of a grin touched his mouth. \u201cBut most of all, I wanted to protect you from me. From me hurting you even more later on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly accomplished that. You can\u2019t hurt me anymore.\u201d My mind screamed that was a lie, but I ignored it.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You have to care about someone before they can hurt you,\u201d I said.</p><p>He flinched. The motion should have sent a rush of satisfaction through me, instead it pushed a lump into my throat.</p> <p>\u201cThen why do I feel like you\u2019re more of a threat to me than Nicolas?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>There was no way to answer that. This conversation was so over. I turned to leave.</p><p>He moved again and stood in front of me before I could face the door to the condo. \u201cYou have to admit it was a hell of a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t have to admit anything, my mind insisted, but panic pushed at my throat. His lips were only inches from mine, and they curled into his familiar flirtatious grin. Daring me.</p><p>If I ran away now, it would be as good as admitting I cared. That I hadn\u2019t forgotten about our time together. That I hadn\u2019t been able to move on, and instead had compared every man I met to him.</p><p>And I\u2019d be damned if I admitted anything.</p> <p>I tilted my chin, ever so slightly. Our lips even closer, I murmured, \u201cI\u2019ve had better weeks.\u201d</p><p>A surprised laugh left him, and then his mouth was on mine. His lips were the perfect blend of soft skin and firm demand. It wasn\u2019t a first kiss\u2014not even like our first kiss, which had been soft and smooth, testing and wanting. This kiss demanded.</p><p>And I responded in kind. Because damn him, he owed me.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled him closer.</p><p>His desire pressed against my stomach, and I could feel the last bit of control I possessed slipping away. His body was hard where I was soft, and slightly cooler than my own. But against the cold night air he felt warm.</p><p>A moan escaped me and he pulled me closer.</p><p>I jerked away and turned my head because there was no room for me to step back. He tried to reclaim my mouth, and I almost let him. Desire burned through me. I knew the pleasure that waited for me in his arms. I knew the blissful quiet it would bring to my mind as he filled my thoughts, leaving no room for anything else. And I knew that for a time, I could find peace.</p><p>But it would be an illusion.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, not moving or breathing.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked. And I noticed with no little satisfaction that his voice was rough with the same passion that overwhelmed me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this,\u201d I said with a firmness I didn\u2019t really feel.</p><p>An ache filled me when he stepped back. The bitter night air felt colder than it had before.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment warred with relief when he didn\u2019t ask me why, when he didn\u2019t even attempt to convince me. But Claude wasn\u2019t the kind of man who convinced women. He probably had to fight them off with a stick.</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything else to say. Nothing that wouldn\u2019t either drag us back into an argument about his friend, or open the door to talk about us\u2014and that was a door I wasn\u2019t going to open. I couldn\u2019t risk being hurt like that again.</p><p>So without another word I went back into the apartment, leaving the vampire out in the cold.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>I tossed and turned through the night. Normal for me, but instead of visions of murder running through my mind, thoughts of Claude plagued me.</p><p>I\u2019d considered leaving. I\u2019d gone so far as to pull out my bag. But I couldn\u2019t leave this case half finished. I couldn\u2019t leave a potential tie to my brother\u2019s disappearance unchecked. And the idea of leaving Claude alone to face some vampire with the kind of connections the Magister\u2019s son had, pushed panic into my throat.</p><p>Six years had passed since I\u2019d partnered with the vampire. The case we\u2019d worked had been my first as a full-fledged agent. A rookie, I\u2019d been full of energy, unaffected by nightmares, and enamored of the legendary vampire, Claude Desmarais.</p><p>The affair\u2014and that\u2019s all it had been\u2014had lasted through the case. Six weeks. And then they had ended. The case and the affair.</p><p>And it had ended so badly, I still felt burned.</p><p>The way he\u2019d talked to me after I\u2019d confessed that I loved him had made me feel like the lowest of the low. Wrapped in a sheet, I couldn\u2019t have felt more naked, more exposed. But I\u2019d already thought of him as a safe harbor. He\u2019d never judged me, never said a harsh word to me. And in the nights we\u2019d been together I\u2019d shared so much with him. My hopes. My history. My fears.</p><p>It was only later that I realized he\u2019d never really done the same.</p><p>I\u2019d held out hope for a few weeks. Hope that Claude would apologize. I\u2019d dreamed of him confessing that he hadn\u2019t meant what he said. That he was sorry. That he\u2019d only said it all in some misguided attempt to keep me safe. Weeks had turned into months, and my warm feelings faded and twisted into hurt and anger. By the time he had called\u2014three months after we\u2019d said our good-byes\u2014I was no longer interested in his apologies.</p><p>Now he\u2019d said many of the things I would have given anything to hear back then. But it was too late. Time passing might change little to vampires, but it changed a hell of a lot for me.</p><p>When the gray light of dawn peeked in through my window, I finally admitted defeat and dragged myself out of bed and into the shower. Claude was up and on his laptop by the time I got out to the kitchen. I could feel his eyes follow me, and I poured a cup of coffee while I gathered my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll be doing any more kissing.\u201d If I could call such an overwhelming moment of passion by such a simple word. \u201cWe\u2019re professionals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will treat you as such.\u201d The intensity in his eyes made my pulse jump and my mouth go dry. \u201cBut don\u2019t expect last night to be our final chat about us. I don\u2019t have a lot of regrets\u2014I try to live true to myself. But I do regret dismissing our time together as an affair. I regret speaking to you cruelly. And those are regrets I intend to remedy.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him for several seconds, then turned away. I couldn\u2019t allow myself to hope. To think about what could have been. I could too easily see myself fitting into his life, fitting him into mine. Laughing with him in the evenings, talking cases with him during the days. Thinking about what might have been was easy. It just hurt too damn much when it turned into nothing.</p><p>\u201cSome things can\u2019t be fixed, Claude.\u201d I didn\u2019t turn to see his reaction. Instead I focused very intently on my coffee. Silence settled over us, awkward and uncomfortable. And when he finally spoke, I turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cNatalie called. She\u2019s finished with her spells, wants us to come to her house this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get this case solved, Claude.\u201d And for the love of God, not talk about us. I didn\u2019t say it, but surely he could hear the message loud and clear in my voice.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to say thank you. For helping me with this. And that I\u2019ll try to be more open-minded.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d try to consider his friend a suspect. That\u2019s what he meant. As far as commitments went, it wasn\u2019t the best. But it was a step in the right direction.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see your witch.\u201d</p><p>The drive to Natalie\u2019s went far too quickly, and her home looked no less imposing in the light of day.</p><p>Claude let us in this time, not even bothering to knock, and I couldn\u2019t help wondering again how close he was to this witch.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly are we going?\u201d I asked, following Claude down a long hallway. We emerged in what felt like another building. More of the cold winter had penetrated this area than the main living space we\u2019d been in before. We passed a small bathroom, door wide open, then what looked like Chicago\u2019s version of a sunroom. All windows and outdoor furniture and sliding glass doors.</p><p>We finally had nowhere else to go, but at the end of the hallway stood a set of double doors. The wood was old and thick. Were we headed back outside?</p><p>Claude knocked loudly, and a muffled noise came from beyond the doors. I couldn\u2019t make out the words, but the vampire apparently could because he opened the doors. They didn\u2019t lead outside. On the contrary, they led to a casting room.</p><p>I\u2019d seen witches\u2019 casting rooms before, but those had mostly been the circles of wannabe witches. Amateurs.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen anything like this.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s was quite big, for one thing\u2014several hundred square feet. A large circle occupied much of the space, and it had been carved into the floor\u2014a floor that looked like it was made of natural stone.</p><p>Aside from the circle, a small table was built into one of the walls, and upon it sat a few tools and bowls, likely for mixing spell ingredients.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Natalie said, dryly. \u201cCouldn\u2019t wait in the living room for me, could you?\u201d</p><p>I felt heat rising up my neck, even though I wasn\u2019t responsible for our presence here.</p><p>\u201cPatience is not among my virtues,\u201d Claude replied in the same tone.</p><p>For some reason, their good-natured ribbing made me almost as uncomfortable as being in a Covenant witch\u2019s casting room without her permission or invitation.</p><p>\u201cThis is quite a casting room,\u201d I said.</p><p>A small smile crept onto her mouth, and she gave up her attempt to appear angry with Claude.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s taken me a while to build it.\u201d She walked to the table, grabbed the brand from behind a bowl, and flashed it at us. \u201cLet\u2019s continue this discussion in the living room, shall we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We followed Natalie to the kitchen, a large room that was cut off from the rest of the living space, to pick up tea on our way to the living room. I distracted myself by looking at her crown moldings in an effort not to say something rude, like hurry up and tell us already. Claude revealed no impatience in his laid-back attitude and easy smile.</p><p>His attitude changed the second Natalie told us her findings.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, nothing?\u201d he asked, voice strained.</p> <p>\u201cNothing to indicate the brand was psychically altered, other than the cleaning, which as you know didn\u2019t remove the psychometric imprints. At least not completely,\u201d Natalie said, the diminutive woman not the least bit rattled by Claude\u2019s obvious shock.</p><p>Claude sank onto Natalie\u2019s couch and rubbed his face with his hands. \u201cThat isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d hear a man like Claude Desmarais with desperation on his tongue, even just a hint, and I didn\u2019t like it. \u201cThere could be an explanation, Claude.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me and the hope in his gaze twisted my heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s likely\u2014his face coming up in the initial vision means he definitely made an impression on the victim. But we don\u2019t know exactly what happened. I need more time with the brand.\u201d I glanced at Natalie and she offered me a small smile. \u201cI could even start now.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie set down the brand on the coffee table. \u201cI\u2019ll just get us some drinks, then. Dealing with murders is a bit easier with alcohol. Scotch for you, Claude?\u201d</p><p>He nodded without looking at her, his attention locked on the brand.</p><p>\u201cAgent Davis?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell her I\u2019d take a soda, but changed my mind. If I was going to handle that brand before we left, I\u2019d need a drink after. \u201cBeer if you have it.\u201d Hell, what time was it? Noon, maybe? My psychologist would love this\u2014it would open up a whole new can of worms.</p><p>\u201cRemember to keep an open mind?\u201d I didn\u2019t mean for it to be a question, but my tone lilted anyway. I wanted to go and give Claude a hug, a kiss, offer him comfort. God, I was a world-class masochist.</p><p>He nodded, offering me a grateful smile. I sat on one of the oversized chairs that surrounded the coffee table and hyperventilated. Then I gestured toward the brand. Claude picked it up and held it out to me.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said softly, then dropped the brand into my outstretched hand.</p><p>Fear rolled over me, filling my throat with bile. Luc Chevalier\u2019s face flashed, and it intermingled with the branding iron in a most disturbing way. He was yelling something\u2014silent to my ears\u2014and another man came into view. The background was clouded, but I thought I could make out earth beneath my feet. I tore my gaze away, trying to drag it back to the men. But it caught on my arm. On my hand.</p><p>On my webbed fingers and graying hand. No, not graying. But touched with fur.</p><p>I heard the bang of the brand hitting the floor, and I forced air into my lungs. I blinked away the black spots that pinged my vision. My hand came into focus first, curled like a claw forced open. A defense mechanism that psychometrists\u2019 bodies seemed to act out instinctually. One that kept us from recycling through visions, in case we couldn\u2019t muster the wherewithal to drop the object during the brief moments between images.</p><p>My hand, what was it about my hand?</p><p>The vision rushed back, bits and pieces that made no sense. My mind struggled to force them into a linear time line, into some kind of order. A square peg and a round hole, unfortunately.</p><p>Someone gripped my arm; I could feel that much again. And I blinked dumbly at Claude for a couple of seconds. The situation rushed back to me and I pulled away, averting my eyes from the strangely concerned expression on his face.</p><p>Natalie set a beer on the table in front of me and then reached down and retrieved the brand from where I\u2019d dropped it on her floor. I wondered if she\u2019d seen me. Psychometry visions weren\u2019t pretty things, although I mostly sat stiffly without breathing, or so I was told. And I guessed that wasn\u2019t so bad.</p> <p>\u201cA selkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Claude hadn\u2019t moved from where he kneeled next to me, although he kept his hands to himself since I\u2019d pulled away.</p><p>\u201cThe man who imprinted on that brand. He was a selkie. I saw his hand tied down.\u201d I touched my own hand, my mind still half expecting to see it changing from a human to a seal. \u201cWebbed fingers\u2014fur just peeking through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was kept in mid-transformation?\u201d Natalie asked.</p><p>I shook my head, then regretted the motion as pain shot through my skull. \u201cNot necessarily. Imprints aren\u2019t linear, and they aren\u2019t perfect. It could be that he shifted entirely, but that the psychic imprint happened during the shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. How do you ever figure out anything useful from your visions?\u201d Natalie asked.</p><p>I flinched.</p><p>\u201cApparently she does just fine, Natalie. Have you seen her closure rate?\u201d Claude cut in.</p><p>I stared at the vampire. He hadn\u2019t just come to me because of my reputation and our history\u2014he\u2019d done some serious digging beforehand. Not that it wasn\u2019t a reasonable step\u2014a smart move, for an investigator. No wonder he\u2019d known I was on medical leave.</p><p>The small part of me that hoped he\u2019d come because he\u2019d felt a connection to me withered.</p><p>And despite my anger at myself for even entertaining such an idea, it was disappointing.</p><p>Natalie looked embarrassed, and she shouldn\u2019t have. Sure, her comment wasn\u2019t tactful, but she hadn\u2019t intended any harm. Hell, I was surprised myself when I was able to get a particularly confusing vision to make sense eventually.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I said to Natalie. I couldn\u2019t deal with Claude right now. Our kiss was too fresh, and it tugged on very old wounds that I didn\u2019t have the strength or the gumption to open right now. \u201cTruth is, psychometrists don\u2019t always find useful evidence from visions, and we can\u2019t always make sense of them.\u201d I picked up the beer and took a long drink, then coughed a little. The dark beer was a little stronger than what I normally drank. \u201cLike the vamp said, I usually do come up with something helpful. But not with just one vision. Or two. Usually, it takes a week or two of consistent visions to make any sense out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds...unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>I forced a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Natalie still seemed embarrassed, but she also seemed as intent to forget it as I was. \u201cSo where does this leave you?\u201d she asked Claude.</p><p>The heat of his gaze hit me for a brief moment, then his eyes were back on Natalie. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I need to be more open-minded. I suppose an open-minded person might start digging through police files.\u201d</p><p>I took another drink of the beer to hide my smile from the vampire and the witch.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me selkie with \u2018man hands.\u2019 There are only two adult male selkies who have disappeared in the last fifteen years in the area. The most recent was investigated by the succubus, Marisol. Talking to her is safer than digging through the file. Requesting it will leave a trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYadda yadda. I got it. No trace, no one putting two and two together.\u201d We walked between the short granite columns that protected the building from car bombs and angry drivers. I blew a puff of warm air into my hands. So damn cold.</p><p>We walked through the revolving doors into the courthouse, pausing briefly to get through security, before cutting through the marble-lined halls to make our way to the cafeteria. I was already uncomfortable and we hadn\u2019t even seen her yet. \u201cAre you sure we should be bothering her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarisol\u2019s in court all week for a case. She has to eat, right?\u201d</p><p>Claude cut through the crowd to a small table in the back. The succubus took my breath away. Succubi had that effect on people. That I suddenly felt like a jerk wasn\u2019t succubus related.</p><p>I had never made such an ass of myself as I had toward Marisol Whitman. Granted, she\u2019d forgiven me after I\u2019d been a total bitch when I found her and my ex-partner in bed together, but I still felt like an ass every time I saw her. But she was a good cop, and my bad behavior in the past and discomfort in the present wasn\u2019t good enough reason to avoid talking to her about this case.</p><p>Claude pulled out the chair next to me, directly across from Marisol.</p><p>\u201cYou sounded so mysterious on the phone.\u201d Marisol leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cI have to sound mysterious. How will I keep my reputation intact if I don\u2019t?\u201d Claude smiled, but worry prevented his eyes from following suit. \u201cI just have some questions about an old case you were on. Might be nothing, but I need to keep this between the three of us for now.\u201d</p><p>Marisol frowned. \u201cAll right. What case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA selkie disappeared last year, a man named Lawrence Coates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I remember the case. Took two days for the family to even tell us he was a selkie. Case was turned over to the PNU then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can you tell us about it?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, perfect shoulders sliding under her long, blond hair. \u201cNot much to tell. Not a local, but had some business in the area. His wife called it in when he never went back to their hotel after a dinner meeting. He was some kind of big player in selkie politics. That\u2019s why they were so concerned about letting his otherworlder status out.\u201d</p><p>I started. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize selkies were organized enough for politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. But there are a lot of them, so I guess it makes sense. We just don\u2019t see them much here since we\u2019re so far from the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelkies have very little hierarchy,\u201d Claude said. \u201cOnly the royal family is considered above the others. You must have had some sort of selkie prince on your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what? Selkies have a royal family?\u201d</p><p>I was glad that Marisol voiced the question, so I didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019d never heard of such a thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not common knowledge.\u201d Claude grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s not even uncommon knowledge, and the selkies would prefer to keep it that way, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you\u2014\u201d I started at the same time as Marisol said, \u201cIs that even possible?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cI saved a selkie royal from a rogue vamp a while back.\u201d He turned back to Marisol. \u201cIt is possible. So tell us the rest. Did you ever figure out what happened to him? Did you ever find a body?\u201d</p><p>It was Marisol\u2019s turn to look startled. \u201cA body? No. He didn\u2019t die. He showed up a week later\u2014really pissed off that we were looking for him.\u201d</p> <p>I suppressed a sigh. A selkie who hadn\u2019t actually disappeared. What a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for taking the time to talk to us,\u201d I said, then stopped as Claude held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cGive us a rundown.\u201d</p><p>I shot him the stink eye. Seriously?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Marisol said, as she leaned back in her chair and tapped her chin. \u201cWife called the cops in the middle of the first night when he hadn\u2019t shown up after a dinner meeting. They explained that he wasn\u2019t technically missing yet. At some point\u2014the next morning, I think\u2014she showed up at the station, demanding help. Duty cop took pity on her and let her talk to a detective. They started on the investigation unofficially after that. It became official after he\u2019d been gone long enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long was he gone before he came back?\u201d Claude asked.</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his explanation for taking off like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really give one. And honestly, as an adult, he can take off on his wife if he really wants to. Nothing illegal about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he was stepping out on her? That\u2019s where he was that week?\u201d I cut in. If that was the case, this trip really had been a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say for sure, although he insinuated as much the second his wife left the room. But...\u201d She shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Claude leaned forward, a hunter scenting prey. He knew when blood hit the water.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was just a gut feeling, but something was off about how he answered our questions. Like he really didn\u2019t want us to ask about that week, and was angry about the whole thing. And he just seemed a little...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff, I guess. Sorry I can\u2019t be more specific, but he shut us down pretty quickly.\u201d She brushed her long hair back from her face.</p><p>Claude grimaced again and leaned back on his chair.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could tell you more, but the man was an adult. We had no crime to hold him for. No reason to continue questioning him after he was done talking to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for the info.\u201d Claude stood. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you eat your lunch.\u201d</p><p>We headed out of the cafeteria and Claude had his cell phone in hand before we hit the parking lot, running down the selkie\u2019s name with who knew what kind of shady contact.</p> <p>\u201cWant to go for a drive?\u201d he asked without preamble after shoving his cell phone back in his pocket. He didn\u2019t wait for my reply. \u201cLawrence Coates is in Milwaukee right now. Let\u2019s go talk to that selkie about where the hell he was during that missing week.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cYou seemed tense around Marisol.\u201d We\u2019d made it out of the northernmost burbs before he asked. Just long enough of a drive for me to relax.</p><p>\u201cI acted like a jerk to her a while back, one of my more brilliant moments in life. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too tense for it not to be a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone through my file. I\u2019m sure you know that my ex-partner is now living here, with her.\u201d Admitting to Claude how I\u2019d acted was almost as uncomfortable as talking to Marisol. \u201cHe was still my partner when they started dating, and I didn\u2019t handle it well. I acted like a jealous girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, tips of his longish hair brushing his collar. \u201cI just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Irritation flared inside of me. Between the case and Claude\u2019s kiss and having to see Marisol, I was running on a short fuse. Why\u2019d the man have to poke at all of my sore spots during the same week?</p><p>\u201cDid you have feelings for him\u2014her boyfriend, your ex-partner? I mean, were you two involved?\u201d His expression had hardened, and the skin around his eyes crinkled as if he cared about my answer.</p><p>\u201cYes. And no.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened on the steering wheel. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation.\u201d I rubbed my face with my hands. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but yes, I have feelings for my ex-partner.\u201d I could see his grip tighten even more. Pretty soon the damn steering wheel would bend. \u201cNot romantic feelings, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. Friend feelings. Partner feelings.\u201d</p><p>His grip loosened and he stroked the wheel as if apologizing silently for assaulting it. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t involved with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was never involved with him. I was just really rude to Marisol once, and I still feel like a jerk every time I\u2019m around her,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>A smile touched his lips and he reached for the stereo\u2019s volume. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, but before I could form a reply to that, he turned up the volume and an old Journey song filled the air. Fine. Whatever. I didn\u2019t want to explore why he thought that was good.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m interested in anything other than working with you on this case,\u201d I said loudly.</p><p>He gave me a striking grin, his eyes merry and full of confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to convince you.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught and I turned to watch the snow-covered ground fly by outside my window. I didn\u2019t have a good response for that, and was determined he wouldn\u2019t see the blush he\u2019d caused.</p><p>After ten minutes or so of awkward silence, we passed the rest of the trip to Milwaukee with idle chatter. Claude acted happy enough to talk about unimportant subjects, but his mind seemed to be on other things. As was mine. I tried to push down the antsy feeling that always hit me when I entered this city. I wasn\u2019t going to my parents\u2019 house. No one was going to lecture me for days, urging me to quit my job. I needed to keep my mind on the case.</p><p>How long could I let this investigation go on without pushing to interview Luc? Without pushing Claude to acknowledge that his friend was dirty?</p><p>I glanced at the vampire. His concentration was now focused on locating the right address down the winding road outside of Wisconsin\u2019s beer destination. Worry creased his mouth, but he had the same strong jawline as I remembered. The same shining hair and the same full lips.</p><p>I wondered if I looked the same to him, or if he saw the subtle way the years had touched my skin.</p><p>Not that it mattered.</p><p>Claude parked the car in front of a sprawling two-story, more mansion than house. With a circular drive, small windows revealing the second story, and marble columns around the front door, the Georgian style wasn\u2019t to my personal taste, but it was pretty. And the place probably cost more than I\u2019d make in my lifetime.</p><p>\u201cIs he expecting us?\u201d</p><p>Claude grinned. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>The woman who answered the door didn\u2019t seem surprised to see us, until Claude flashed his badge and asked to see Lawrence Coates. I couldn\u2019t read her physically like Claude could, but there was a certain wariness around her eyes when she stepped back to allow us entry.</p><p>The woman, who introduced herself as Joan Coates, Lawrence\u2019s sister, led us to a bright sitting room decorated in furniture far too garish for my taste. French or some other older European style, I guessed. Wood covered all the walls, and the red and blue rug clashed with the green and yellow floral furniture. I guessed there was a little green in the rug, but still. Looking at all the busy patterns made me dizzy.</p><p>She called for her brother. After offering us tea, which we refused, she excused herself\u2014to go to the market, or so she said. I suspected she just wanted to get away from us. And perhaps especially Claude. He was a touch pale, but he moved like a human when he wanted to appear to be one. His fear aura couldn\u2019t be triggering her response since his was so subtle.</p><p>But perhaps selkies could sense what he was. I knew less about the notoriously shy ocean-goers than I should have. They simply didn\u2019t come up in OWEA investigations as often as vampires and other more aggressive otherworlders.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Lawrence asked as soon as the sound of the front door shutting behind his sister ricocheted through the air.</p><p>Claude was silent for a split second longer than I was comfortable with, so I answered the question. \u201cWe\u2019re here to talk to you about your disappearance, Mr. Coates.\u201d</p><p>Sweat broke out on the man\u2019s forehead, and his voice was raspy when he responded. \u201cWhy? That was a long time ago. And I\u2019ve already spoken to other police\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom you told nothing,\u201d Claude cut in.</p><p>Coates sneered. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all I have to say about it.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. He was hiding something, something big. And it was as apparent in his bravado as his obvious discomfort with our presence.</p><p>\u201cWere you assaulted with a branding iron while you were missing, Mr. Coates?\u201d</p><p>I gaped at Claude, as did Coates, who spluttered out something indecipherable. Way to jump to the punch line. Not only had he shown our hand, but he\u2019d backed Coates into a corner. And most people didn\u2019t respond to that feeling by giving out information\u2014not without wearing them down first, anyway.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my house,\u201d Coates managed finally and turned away, and I cringed at his loud, screeching tone.</p><p>Claude moved faster than I\u2019d ever seen him\u2014ever seen anyone. And, in fact, moved so quickly I missed it. One second he was a few feet from Coates, with a couch and coffee table between them, and the next he was on the selkie.</p><p>I stared, my mind several seconds behind Claude. Claude grabbed at the selkie and Coates yelled an obscenity. The next thing I knew, Coates\u2019s shirt was on the floor, made of more pieces than it had been while on the selkie, and Claude had the man\u2019s arms behind his back, pretzel-like. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClaude stop\u2014let him go!\u201d I took a step toward the men, but halted in my tracks. My hand automatically strayed to where I kept my sidearm, even though I was no longer carrying. But even if I had been, I wasn\u2019t entirely certain I had it in me to shoot Claude.</p><p>What could I do? Grab him? I wouldn\u2019t even register as a blip on the radar of an out-of-control vampire.</p><p>Claude growled and pushed the selkie away. Coates fell to his knees, and I cringed in sympathy. He struggled up and turned to face us, wobbly on his hurt legs.</p> <p>My feet moved again, almost of their own volition, and I reached to help the man up. But I stopped\u2014as I had before\u2014only this time for a very different reason.</p><p>Burned into the center of Coates\u2019s chest was a symbol I recognized.</p><p>The brand.</p><p>I looked at Coates\u2019s eyes\u2014and the fear behind them bled through, almost palpable. He was muttering something softly, words I couldn\u2019t quite catch. With each syllable, his voice grew louder.</p><p>\u201c...I don\u2019t remember!\u201d Coates struggled back and fell against the arm of the couch. He sat on it, his face in his hands.</p> <p>Dammit. His breath came quickly. Hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Mr. Coates. No one is going to hurt you.\u201d I shot Claude a warning glance, one that he pointedly ignored. Triumph lit his face.</p><p>Neither of us approached Coates at first. The selkie gathered his breath and tried to calm himself. I tried to do the same, but anger hit me at Claude\u2019s actions. We weren\u2019t criminals who would strip a man against his will, even of just his shirt. Even a liar like Coates.</p><p>I understood he wanted to make progress on the case\u2014hell, I did, too. But there were lines, and he\u2019d just crossed one of them. Screw crossed, he\u2019d dove over and done cartwheels on the other side.</p><p>But I had to keep focused. Claude was a problem for later. With that in mind, I walked closer to Coates.</p><p>\u201cMr. Coates?\u201d His breathing had slowed, but perspiration covered his nearly bald head, and I could see skin connecting his fingers up to the first joint as he held his face. A sure sign of a selkie in distress. It was the first step before their joints joined and they transformed into seals. That he was still in human form given his emotional state was a testament to his control. A prince of some sort, indeed.</p> <p>As I drew closer, he looked up from his hands. Obvious distress still colored his features, but he seemed calmer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he said, voice soft. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that whole week. All I know is...\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWhen I think of talking about it, or if I even try thinking about it, a feeling of panic hits and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you walk us through it? Anything? The last thing you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I told you. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d His voice grew fiercer, more panicked. \u201cJust leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>Claude moved between us\u2014suddenly standing in front of the selkie\u2014and I decided I really hated vampire speed.</p><p>\u201cTell us what you do know. We aren\u2019t leaving until you do.\u201d</p><p>The selkie started yelling again, his words turning indecipherable, and he faded into another panic attack. I grabbed Claude\u2019s shoulder and tugged him away from the selkie.</p><p>\u201cHe has to tell us something,\u201d he said before I could speak. Emotion that I\u2019d never heard from the vampire rode his voice. Claude was rattled. \u201cWe need a next step.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t. Look at him. Really look, Claude.\u201d</p><p>Doubt flickered across Claude\u2019s face, and he glanced at the selkie.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing he\u2019s able to tell us, other than what he already has. But that could be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Something preventing him from speaking? Causing him to go into a panic attack when he tries to say too much? That stinks of magic. Maybe Natalie can make some sense of this. Use him to trace whoever created the spell.\u201d</p><p>He looked torn, his gaze all but dragged to the selkie.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Claude.\u201d Bright blue eyes flickered back to me. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you. This kind of pressure. You\u2019re hurting him.\u201d I kept my voice calm, even though I had to fight the urge to shake him, or slap some sense into him.</p><p>\u201cAnymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Something dark flickered across his features, but then it was gone, leaving only pained regret behind. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>If the drive to Wisconsin had been awkward, the drive back to Chicago was positively painful. Claude was obviously lost in thought, and far more distant and worried than I\u2019d ever seen him. I swung back and forth between wanting to rage at him for treating the selkie like that, and telling him about my vision of Luc from when I was a child, just so he would let this go. How could I get him to give up his quest to prove the innocence of a man who was anything but?</p><p>And a third urge tugged at me. An urge that was far more dangerous than the others. I wanted to comfort him.</p><p>Because this case seemed to have shaken the confident vampire to his core. And something in me didn\u2019t like that one bit. But I couldn\u2019t comfort him, and I dared not show what I knew of Luc\u2014that would risk him cutting me out of the case. Or worse, prompt a confrontation with the Magister before he was ready. Before he had backup in place. Before he had a plan.</p><p>Or worse, what if he stood by his friend regardless of what he\u2019d done?</p><p>So I watched the darkening landscape fade from buildings, to naked trees and open spaces, and back to buildings even bigger than the ones we\u2019d left behind, undecided and feeling like a wishy-washy loser.</p><p>We pulled into Claude\u2019s underground parking lot, and I shook my head to clear it. I\u2019d dozed, nearly falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou still sleep during long drives,\u201d Claude murmured as he parked in the low-lit garage.</p><p>\u201cYou still talk about stuff that\u2019s none of your business.\u201d It wasn\u2019t much of a comeback, and he laughed. I frowned and exited the car. I\u2019d need a little more time away from my almost-nap before I could think of a witty retort.</p><p>Claude didn\u2019t mention dinner, and neither did I. I could have rustled up something from his fridge, which appeared to be well-stocked. Or I could have demanded he order me something. Even after the day we\u2019d had, he would have done so. But I wasn\u2019t interested in food.</p><p>I pulled a bottle of vodka out of his freezer and mixed it with Coke from the fridge. Claude walked in after taking a shower, his hair still damp, and watched me drink half the first cup in one long swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou crossed a line back there,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I waited a beat, but he didn\u2019t offer up anything else. No explanation. No promise that it would never happen again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all I get? You know? Well, fuck, Claude. Of course you know. You\u2019re not a damn idiot.\u201d I waved my glass at him. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t think you were.\u201d Then I downed the other half.</p><p>Claude walked around the counter slowly. He took the glass from my hand and went about making me another drink.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been so obsessed with something that you couldn\u2019t see straight?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you couldn\u2019t see your future without it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lied. Why else was I here, working with Claude, if I wasn\u2019t a little bit obsessed myself. My brother\u2019s disappearance had ruined my childhood. My parents had gone from normal to fixated on keeping me safe. I\u2019d grown to actually resent him\u2014and that had made me hate myself a little bit.</p><p>And at times, when I was alone in the dark, I could almost admit I had a bit of an obsession for Claude that hadn\u2019t quite died.</p><p>But I\u2019d never hurt anyone for my obsession, not an innocent.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He handed me the refilled glass and I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I kind of get it. But I would have never done what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just a better person than I am.\u201d</p><p>Fat chance of that. And then I said it. The question that was really bothering me. The one that had haunted my mind all the way back from Milwaukee. \u201cWhat would you have done if I hadn\u2019t been there, Claude?\u201d</p><p>He turned away from me and pressed his hands against the edge of the countertop. His head dropped, but I couldn\u2019t see his face. Couldn\u2019t decide what he might be feeling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His voice was low and tired as if he carried a burden.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how branding a selkie gets Nicolas any closer to taking over as Magister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got all the answers yet, Beatrice. I\u2019m still putting together the puzzle.\u201d</p><p>I hurt for him although we\u2019d had such a short time together. Why did my body seem convinced that we\u2019d forged a real connection? I set my drink down and walked to him. I slid a hand up his back, intending to offer him a small bit of comfort.</p><p>Claude had other ideas.</p><p>He turned, an emotion that looked somewhere between pain and determination on his face, and his mouth took mine. The kiss was laced with desperation and need, and passion flared at his touch. I wrapped my arms around his neck. He pulled me against him, then up. My legs went around his waist and he carried me the couple of steps to the countertop behind me.</p><p>The granite was hard and cold. My whole body ached, and his hands slid down my sides to cup my breasts through my shirt. I cried out against his mouth.</p><p>The gravity of what we were doing niggled at me, bringing doubt. It had taken me months to get him out of my system after our brief affair. Months to quit moping around when I wasn\u2019t working. Months to convince myself that it hadn\u2019t mattered. That he didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>It was all bullshit. But it was bullshit I had needed to believe.</p><p>At the same time, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to pull away as his lips slid down my neck, his fangs so close to my skin. I shuddered. And he growled against the tender skin of my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cNeed you,\u201d he said, his voice rough and full of an emotion I wasn\u2019t keen to examine.</p><p>I tilted his face to mine and took his mouth, trying to show him without words that I was just as desperate for him as he was for me. He drew me closer, one hand wrapped around my back and the other under my butt. His hardness pressed against me through our clothes, right where I needed him. I moaned, and then we were moving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pieces of clothing flew as we walked, with the vampire somehow coordinating the removal of my clothes without a single misstep. He set me down at the foot of his bed and I yanked his shirt over his head. His skin shone in the low light. Not as pale as vampires were reputed to be, but a touch different from a normal man. Muscles stretched beneath, corded and strong. Long and lean.</p><p>Just the way I liked him.</p><p>The rest of our clothes disappeared under feverish kisses. And then he was pushing me onto the bed, his mouth on my breast. I moaned as he pulled at my nipple, and his hand slipped between us to stroke me.</p> <p>Sparks flashed almost immediately as the orgasm took me. I was almost embarrassed at how fast he could still do that to me, but his satisfied expression only made me need him again.</p><p>He brought my body back to the edge with his long fingers and clever tongue. I gripped his hardness and pulled him to me. I\u2019d be damned if I came again without him.</p><p>Lips against my neck, he nuzzled me softly, body braced to enter mine.</p><p>\u201cI need you, mon chou. All of you.\u201d</p><p>I knew what he was asking for\u2014not just sex, but something perhaps even more intimate. I could have said no, and he would have respected it. But I\u2019d never been able to tell him no. And desire for him to have me\u2014in every way that he wanted\u2014coiled inside me, tight and eager.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He thrust his hips forward, filling me, forcing me to take all of him. A split second later, a sharp sensation stung my neck. Then he sucked.</p><p>Pain mixed with pleasure as he drove into me and pulled at my vein. Faster and harder. Thoughts evaded me, and I couldn\u2019t feel anything but him. Time stopped. The orgasm hit and rolled through me so powerfully I thought for a moment I couldn\u2019t handle it. Couldn\u2019t take it. Then Claude stiffened above me and buried himself inside my body. Taking his own pleasure, he cried out against my neck.</p><p>Minutes passed before I could think again. His weight still on me as he held me in the cradle of his arms. I sighed against his chest, and his hold tightened.</p><p>What the hell had I done?</p><p>The night passed like a dream. Like every bittersweet dream I\u2019d had since Claude had ended things. But it wasn\u2019t a dream, and in the morning I woke to a belly full of regret, and the smell of something delicious.</p> <p>Everyone knows that vampire bites are pleasurable. Everyone knows that bites can be addictive for the recipient and the vampire\u2014even if it wasn\u2019t in the way that drugs are addictive, not to humans, at least.</p><p>Everyone knows that you never let a vampire bite.</p><p>Of course, this wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d made that particular mistake with Claude.</p><p>I touched my neck in the mirror. Two small holes. They would disappear more quickly than most wounds, but it would be another day or two yet. They wouldn\u2019t scar. Thank goodness for scarf weather.</p><p>I knew better than to think they wouldn\u2019t scar me in other ways.</p><p>Claude waited for me in the kitchen, cooking waffles. Actual, made-with-a-waffle-maker waffles. The vampire seemed at ease, going through the motions of cooking with an extra skip in his step. Exactly the opposite of how I felt. Not that I didn\u2019t feel a bit de-stressed from our passionate night, but new stresses now replaced the old. He kissed my cheek when he handed me a plateful, and I offered him a small smile.</p><p>\u201cThe giant called while you were in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Focus on the case. For God\u2019s sake, focus on the case. But I couldn\u2019t seem to drag my gaze from his full lips. The memory of them on my body made me flush.</p> <p>Amusement danced in Claude\u2019s eyes, but he kept to the topic at hand. \u201cHe has some information for us, thought we could head over this morning.\u201d</p><p>Some of my panic faded. Yes. This was good. We could pursue the case. I could pretend the night before never happened. It was a blip\u2014I certainly wasn\u2019t falling for him again. I dug into my waffle. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice.\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my food and met his shining eyes, crinkled with pleasure. Hell, he had noticed my eyes on him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not talking about last night at some point.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. The man\u2019s confidence knew no bounds. \u201cOh, there\u2019s plenty to talk about.\u201d</p><p>I attacked my waffle and ignored the weight of his stare, which I could feel following my every movement. We didn\u2019t have anything to talk about. Risking that feeling again\u2014the emptiness and melodramatic sadness I\u2019d felt before\u2014wasn\u2019t going to happen. I was older now. Wiser.</p><p>And I\u2019d been down that road.</p><p>So I ignored him through breakfast, and then we headed out. The drive to the metalworker\u2019s was quick, but my mood darkened as we drove, even as Claude\u2019s seemed to brighten. By the time we parked and Claude pushed quarters into the meter, I half expected the jerk to be humming.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t hum, although a smile lingered on his lips. As Chicago\u2019s bitter wind swept through my layers, I pulled my coat tighter around myself.</p><p>The metalworker answered the door quickly, as if he\u2019d waited for us by the door, a sour expression on his face. His gaze met Claude\u2019s, and his frown deepened. The vampire hesitated at the door, then shot me a questioning glance before following the large man inside.</p><p>Again we trailed behind the man down a long, dark hallway into what had to be some sort of basement area. And again he sat. But this time, the walk didn\u2019t seem quite as fearsome, and the smell of smoke didn\u2019t bring to mind the brand and burning flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou said you had info for us,\u201d Claude said, settling into a chair not far from the counter. I remained behind him, suddenly feeling out of place.</p><p>The giant sighed heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>Claude tensed, his body suddenly tight and unmoving. \u201cAnd?\u201d All friendliness had disappeared from his tone. And what remained wasn\u2019t threatening, but all business.</p><p>\u201cYer not gonna want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound the metalworker that made the brand. Found its use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it used for?\u201d I took a step toward them, tired of being left in the background. This was my case, too, whether Claude liked it or not. Whether he realized how important it was to me or not. Because it was important. More important than his beef with Nicolas.</p><p>\u201cTorture. Looks like they was experimentin\u2019 with causing pain through the brand.\u201d</p><p>There were plenty of ways to torture people, both magical and mundane. Why leave a traceable mark behind? \u201cMeaning what exactly?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMeaning they could do it from wherever. Whenever they cared to,\u201d Claude said.</p><p>\u201cThe fanger has the right of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt forms a magical connection, then? They can cause a marked person pain from a distance?\u201d Disbelief made my voice too loud, but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Claude turned to me. \u201cThat would be pretty damn useful. You\u2019d be able to use it as a targeting system. Would be able to cause pain to the person marked whenever you liked, so long as they didn\u2019t alter the mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa.\u201d I shook my head vigorously. \u201cNo way. That kind of power over someone through a simple brand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Yer misunderstanding. It\u2019s not so easy.\u201d The giant set the picture of the brand on the counter he used for a desk. \u201cThe brand is forged usin\u2019 witchcraft\u2014powerful stuff, that. Can\u2019t be sensed. Can\u2019t be magically felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his sensitive partner felt the brand\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cSure, bettin\u2019 she sensed the shaman power, though. The forgin\u2019 is only the first bit. Then they\u2019d need some time with the poor soul caught in their web. Several days, I\u2019d guess. And a shaman with as dark a soul as you can imagine to bind the spirit to the brand mark.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped. Several days. Shamanic power. But why? Who would want the ability to torture a selkie\u2014even a selkie prince, or whatever he was\u2014from afar? Surely there was little to be gained by it. And if torture had been their goal, then he probably wasn\u2019t the only one. Otherwise, why create a reusable brand?</p><p>\u201cAnd bindin\u2019 the mark...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019d make it impossible to destroy on the poor man it was branded into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his memory issues?\u201d Claude said. At the giant\u2019s questioning glance, he added, \u201cThe man can\u2019t remember what happened during the time he got the brand. Also has a tough time talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot shaman power, that. More witchcraft. Whoever be doin\u2019 this, he\u2019s goin\u2019 to a good deal of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis all sounds like a fairy tale.\u201d I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d spoken aloud until Claude replied.</p><p>\u201cNot a fairy tale, but definitely something infinitely difficult to do. You\u2019d need a shaman with no scruples, difficult to find in a spirit-based group of magic users. You\u2019d need a witch powerful enough to pull it off\u2014not easy to find among non-Covenant witches. Again without empathy, and an ability to work metal. And a witch\u2014likely a different one\u2014to work the forgetting spells, and the persuasion so he can\u2019t talk to anyone about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And neither of them be a typical skill among witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you\u2019d found the witch who made the brand,\u201d I pointed out. Hell, if we had that witch, we could no doubt track it further, to the person who\u2019d orchestrated the whole thing. Although I was pretty sure I already knew who that was. Nicolas, maybe. But I didn\u2019t doubt his father was involved.</p><p>\u201cGive me the name,\u201d Claude said, order clear in his tone.</p><p>\u201cNay. I won\u2019t be doin\u2019 that to \u2018em. And there\u2019s naught you can say to convince me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Claude\u2019s face twisted, and within half a second he stood in front of the counter, directly across from the giant. He leaned toward him, hands gripping the counter, but the threat was clear.</p><p>The small bit of friendliness on the giant\u2019s face disappeared, and something wicked flashed behind his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDun try me, vampire. Friend or no, I ain\u2019t givin\u2019 you that name.\u201d He leaned back and crossed his arms, but I could see the sweat lacing his brow that hadn\u2019t been there before Claude moved. He was bluffing.</p><p>\u201cBut I got somethin\u2019 better for ya.\u201d</p><p>Claude\u2019s stare didn\u2019t soften one bit, and his focus looked unmovable.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, but I didn\u2019t look away from Claude. What would happen if he attacked? I couldn\u2019t help either of them. Claude was one of the most powerful vampires in the country. But I would bet that one didn\u2019t get to be a metalworking witch without a heck of a lot of power.</p><p>Hell. If they fought I\u2019d be lucky to get out of the damn building before it collapsed around them.</p><p>My chest twinged at the idea. Would Claude fight the witch, oblivious to how easily damaged my human body was? Was he more interested in getting to Nicolas than my safety?</p><p>I didn\u2019t think I wanted to know the answer to that question.</p><p>The witch\u2019s gravelly voice broke the tension with a simple phrase. \u201cI know who it was that commissioned the brand, so you\u2019ll not need to seek out the witch.\u201d</p> <p>I sucked in a breath of smoke-tinged air. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Claude pulled back, blinking as if stunned there wasn\u2019t going to be a fight.</p><p>The witch, as if keen on dramatics, pulled a cigar from the top drawer of his makeshift desk and trimmed the end. \u201cWas none other than the man his self.\u201d He lit the cigar and sucked in a quick breath of smoke, then blew it out between yellowing rows of teeth. \u201cThe man who bought it was the Magister, Luc Chevalier.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Claude flew at the man. There was simply no other word for it, even if the logical part of my brain knew that vampires couldn\u2019t actually fly. My breath stuck in my throat, and for a split second I felt like I was caught in one of my visions. Caught watching images that had already occurred. Caught without the ability to change anything. All I could do was stand witness as Claude killed the witch.</p><p>But then I was moving.</p> <p>Claude gripped the man by his collar, and was yelling. Calling the witch a liar.</p><p>I grabbed Claude\u2019s arm and yanked with all my strength. He didn\u2019t move an inch.</p><p>\u201cClaude, let him go.\u201d I tried to keep my voice calm. Panicking wouldn\u2019t do anything but add fuel to the explosive situation. But when he didn\u2019t even turn to look at me, some of the fear I felt crept into my voice. \u201cClaude!\u201d</p><p>The vampire turned his head and blinked at me. He dropped the giant, and I realized that he\u2019d actually been supporting the man\u2019s weight. The giant fell back against one of his elevated fire pits, leaning against it for support.</p><p>\u201cUse your words,\u201d I told him. The vampire didn\u2019t crack a smile, but something came back into his eyes. Something I recognized.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d the giant managed to choke out. \u201cI won\u2019t pursue ya, we\u2019ve been friends so long. But I dun want to see you in here again for some years.\u201d</p><p>I tugged Claude toward the door. He turned back when we hit the threshold. And when he spoke, his voice sounded hollow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about your neck,\u201d Claude muttered, and then allowed me to lead him away.</p><p>I took his keys and drove us to a small restaurant I\u2019d enjoyed the last time I was in Chicago. They served deep-dish pizza. I wasn\u2019t hungry. But I wasn\u2019t ready to be alone with Claude, either. Not until he no longer looked so dazed.</p><p>We sat in a corner. It was still early, only ten forty-five, so the place was practically empty. I ordered the first pizza I saw on the menu in an effort to get the waiter to leave us alone.</p><p>\u201cHe was lying.\u201d Claude\u2019s hollow voice hurt my heart. I reached across the table, took his hand in mine, and gave it a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d I didn\u2019t think so, but Claude just looked so miserable. And as an investigator, it was my job to look at all the angles. \u201cLet\u2019s say for argument\u2019s sake that Luc isn\u2019t responsible. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s Nic. How would torturing that man get him any closer to taking over as Magister? Unless...\u201d I almost didn\u2019t want to voice the thought. I hated adding to his hope when it was pretty obvious that the Magister was as dirty as his son and Claude needed to accept it.</p><p>\u201cUnless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you said something about local otherworlder leader support, right?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe some kind of mental conditioning is at work here. I mean, the man was spelled not to talk about the week he was gone. Could he somehow be conditioned into supporting Nic in a coup?\u201d</p><p>A tiny bit of hope lit up his eyes and my heart jumped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing, but I\u2019m redefining what\u2019s possible with this case. Last week I would have said that torturing someone from a distance with a brand and shamanic magic was impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too high. I still think Luc\u2019s in the thick of this.\u201d It hurt to say, but it had to be said.</p><p>\u201cLuc is the only constant. The only person who has been in my life since the change. The only one who has cared about me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at my hard tone, and gave me a good facsimile of his normal grin. \u201cMaybe not. But he has been like a brother to me. I can\u2019t imagine him being involved in this. And, it\u2019s a scary thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I might truly be alone in the world.\u201d</p><p>The waiter dropped off the Cokes I\u2019d ordered with the pizza and I nodded to him in thanks. Truth was, I wanted to hug the man for interrupting before I could say something stupid to Claude. Something to take some of the pain from his voice. Something I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to say.</p><p>\u201cLook, Claude. I get that he\u2019s like a brother to you. But you\u2019re going to have to put your big boy pants on and deal with this.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. A small sound, but I\u2019d take it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe I\u2019m an idiot for ignoring the evidence.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOne way or another, I\u2019ll find out for sure.\u201d</p><p>Now that, I didn\u2019t like the sound of. \u201cLook\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. For staying with me through this. I haven\u2019t...I haven\u2019t been as good a man as I should have been with you.\u201d The fervor in his voice and expression stunned me into silence. What the hell was I supposed to say to that?</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d I said finally.</p><p>His confident grin slipped back onto his face and I almost sagged against the table in relief. Dealing with Claude so out of his normal character was exhausting. I worried about him far more than I should.</p><p>\u201cSo. I think I should spend some more time with the brand this afternoon. Maybe you can focus on shamans who might have been able to attach it to a person\u2019s spirit, and who might have that kind of inclination. Hell, that kind of power on top of being an evil son-of-a-gun can\u2019t be a common combination among shamans,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d imagine not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d And maybe tonight I\u2019d talk to him about my first vision of Luc. I couldn\u2019t talk to him about it here. Too public. Too exposed. I was too chicken.</p><p>I needed time to gather my courage.</p><p>And with the smell of pizza filling the air, I was getting hungry. I needed to eat before I talked about it. Needed to formulate responses to his questions\u2014questions I knew he\u2019d ask. Like I didn\u2019t tell him when I first saw Luc in the vision from the brand\u2014because I didn\u2019t trust him to let me stay on the investigation. Because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I trusted him?</p><p>Yeah. I needed time to come up with some better answers. At least, more tactful ones. More certain ones.</p><p>I wished I had some handy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can open a bottle of wine when we\u2019re done. Talk through what we know,\u201d I mused aloud. Maybe we could do more than open a bottle of wine. No. What was I thinking? Last night was a mistake. Not one I was willing to repeat. Not one I could repeat if I wanted to keep myself at a distance. Safe from the feelings he elicited in me without even trying.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds delightful,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll have to leave you on your own tonight. Although I\u2019d be happy to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gala is tonight.\u201d</p><p>I just stared. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re going to Luc\u2019s house for a party. With all this going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sipped his Coke and made a yuck face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just not the best thing I\u2019ve tasted today.\u201d He winked at me.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Claude. You\u2019re not distracting me with that B.S.\u201d Heat crawled up my neck. Damn vampire, anyway. \u201cGoing to this party is a stupid, risky idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? No one knows we\u2019re investigating the brand. No one knows I\u2019m looking into Nic\u2014not any more than I usually am. And\u201d\u2014he cleared his throat\u2014\u201cno one knows we\u2019re looking at Luc.\u201d</p><p>He had a point, but I didn\u2019t have to like it. At least he was more on board with looking into the Magister.</p><p>\u201cThis will be a perfect opportunity to do a little recon. To chat with them in a comfortable setting,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood point. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not risking you, frail human.\u201d A wicked smile flashed at the silly insult.</p><p>I grinned back, unable to help myself. \u201cYou just said it yourself. It\u2019s not risky. It\u2019s not a stupid idea. So you have no reason not to take me.\u201d</p><p>He gaped for a second before his mouth snapped shut. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll allow you a plus one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me or I\u2019ll find my own way in. Like you said, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity for some recon. And I\u2019m going. Do you really want me to get caught trying to shimmy in through a window? How embarrassing would that be?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The waiter interrupted Claude\u2019s response, dropping a piping hot pizza onto the middle of our table. The smell made my mouth water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not winning this argument, am I?\u201d</p><p>I reached for the spatula, slipped it under a slice of pizza, and scooped it onto my plate. \u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>Convincing Claude, as it turned out, was the easy part. The harder part proved to be finding a dress in time that I didn\u2019t totally hate and could actually afford. After refusing Claude\u2019s offer to shop with me, I finally found one at a Nordstrom at the Shops at North Bridge. It was sleeveless. Even better, it had an Asian-style neckline that was just high enough to cover part of what was left of the bite mark he\u2019d left low on my neck. I\u2019d have to cover the fading marks with makeup to be sure.</p><p>The cocktail dress was quite pretty, black and short and it fit my slender body just so. I had no doubt that it would look low-class and simple compared to many of the Magister\u2019s guests. But I shouldn\u2019t be terribly underdressed, not enough to be noticed, if Claude was right about the gala\u2019s tone. Besides, I didn\u2019t have thousands of dollars to waste on a dress I would only wear for one night. A night of spying on vampires, no less.</p><p>It would just have to do.</p><p>I packed it up with a pair of shoes and a clutch that I\u2019d found in the same store, then took a cab back to Claude\u2019s. The doorman barely glanced at me and my dress bag, and I was back up to the condo without a hitch.</p><p>Claude wasn\u2019t in any of the common areas. A couple of hours yet until I had to get ready, so I decided to spend some quality time with the brand. Pleasant or no, it might be useful. Besides, I needed to think of anything but the vampire. The horrible torture of a selkie would do the trick.</p> <p>The second I touched the brand the world around me disappeared. White noise rushed through my ears and blackness filled my sight. Then the brand burst into my field of vision, bright and almost painful to look at. Panic and confusion hit me like a punch to the gut.</p><p>Then the Magister.</p><p>His face filled my vision, anger twisted his mouth, and I tried to cringe away. The vision rolled back, flashing and moving like a stop-motion film half shot. The brand was in his hand\u2014still attached to the long handle that had once held it. He yanked at it, yelling words I couldn\u2019t hear. Clouded by the darkness of the vision\u2019s edge, another person gripped the brand, too. Were they fighting over it? I couldn\u2019t make any sense of it, too much fear. Too much panic. Needed to run.</p><p>The clatter of the brand hitting Claude\u2019s coffee table startled me, and I gasped for air. Then an arm slipped behind me and Claude sat next to me on the couch. He pulled me close to him, his strong body supporting mine. His scent surrounded me and filled my lungs.</p><p>I leaned into him, unable to resist the comfort when the vision was so fresh. Panic still tumbled through me, making me want to turn and run. But it wasn\u2019t something that I could run from. I\u2019d carry the vision within myself.</p><p>Always.</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The vision had shaken me more than I wanted to admit. So when it came time to get ready for the party, my hands trembled when I tried to do my makeup. No matter how I tried, my eyeliner refused to go on right, and no way could I use my mascara. It took a heck of a lot of smoothing to make me presentable, but I got the added bonus of a smoky look around my eyes, courtesy of the need to smudge everything together so that my squiggly lines couldn\u2019t be seen by the world.</p><p>Claude watched me walk the hallway from my room like a high school boy watching his prom date descending the stairs, wide-eyed and with hopeful passion in his eyes. Nerves fluttered in my stomach at the sight of him, too. And for half a second I forgot. I forgot that we were only friends\u2014if that. I forgot that we were headed to a dangerous gala where a sociopath waited. I forgot that we weren\u2019t in love.</p><p>And in that moment, the expression on Claude\u2019s face made me think he forgot, too.</p><p>His gaze slid slowly down my body, as if he had all night to take me in. Then his eyes met mine, and I could see so many things reflected in those light blue depths. Desire that made my stomach tighten. But something else, too. He looked almost hopeful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, mon chou,\u201d he murmured when I got close.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look so shabby himself. Hair styled back from his face revealed his strong jaw and bright eyes in a way that he normally hid. The suit tailored to his long, lean body revealed the breadth of his shoulders, and hinted at the strong muscles of his chest and legs. He was a panty-dropping hunk of vampire. He told me that I looked beautiful but he looked like he\u2019d come from another world.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, then swallowed to clear the lump from my throat. I had to stymie this line of thought. Sure, the man was pretty. But I\u2019d be damned if I had to dwell on it.</p> <p>I reached for the clutch I\u2019d bought with the dress and shoes, and paused when I saw my hand visibly shake. I shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Claude intercepted my hand, taking it with his own. His cool thumb slid across my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this happen often with visions?\u201d</p><p>Too often. \u201cI\u2019m just rundown. Can we go, please?\u201d There was a desperate note in my voice that I didn\u2019t like one bit. If I caved with Claude, I\u2019d have to admit how I felt about him. And I wasn\u2019t entirely sure that I trusted him any longer. He was a good man\u2014he was. Even if he had been a misguided jerk to me once. But he\u2019d also proven that he trusted the wrong people. And that misplaced trust could screw us both.</p><p>That dangerous hand gripped mine for a moment longer, then he pulled it to his lips and brushed them against my skin. My breath caught, and a shiver ran through my body that had nothing to do with the vision.</p><p>\u201cWe could be fashionably late,\u201d he said, voice low and smooth.</p><p>The idea sounded good\u2014too good. Being with Claude would bring me back from the vision, give me something to concentrate on that was very real, and very overwhelming. I wanted to stay and make love to him so badly that it twisted my gut and made my fingertips tingle.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly why I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I finally managed. \u201cWe have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Despite Claude\u2019s offhand assertion that we weren\u2019t already fashionably late, the party was in full swing when we arrived. A harried valet took Claude\u2019s keys, and classical music flowed from the large manor the Magister called home.</p><p>\u201cSeems like an odd time of year for a big party like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has several throughout the year. A good opportunity to politic, and to remind people who is in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I\u2019d invite people I planned on threatening into my home.\u201d</p><p>Claude grinned. \u201cThe main house is actually on the other side of the property. This is sort of a ballroom area with guest suites. It\u2019s used a lot for official visitors\u2014other Magisters, their people. Visiting dignitaries and such.\u201d</p><p>Of course the Magister had more than one house on the same property. Who didn\u2019t?</p><p>A blast of cold air hit me. Why hadn\u2019t I thought to buy a wrap? My jacket had been too casual to wear with the dress, and I\u2019d shrugged off Claude\u2019s offer to stop somewhere on the way. But thankfully the distance from the valet station to the front door was short, and I\u2019d worn my coat from Claude\u2019s condo until his car had warmed up.</p><p>Luck proved to be on my side though, because warmth flooded me as soon as I cleared the door into the manor. Whether due to the vampires\u2019 rather useful tolerance for temperature variations that exceeded that of us normals, or because they were trying just a little too hard to combat the frigid Chicago cold, they had the thermostat set just perfect for a human in a cocktail dress sans wrap. Convenient, and probably meant that this party catered to a mixed otherworlder crowd, like the giant said.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Claude asked, offering me his arm.</p><p>I took it and a tingle ran through me at the touch. Just the cold bothering me. It wasn\u2019t anticipation; it was the beginning of frostbite.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I muttered when we hit the main ballroom after traveling down a short hallway and passing a coat check along the way.</p><p>The vampires and their guests were impressive. Dresses of every shape and current fashion graced the hall. Nothing vintage, like I\u2019d thought we might see. Vampires, it seemed, did not dwell on the past.</p><p>At least not in a public forum.</p><p>Music flowed, not from a jukebox or DJ, but from a small group of men in tuxedos with string instruments held close to their bodies and sweat touching their shining foreheads. And waiters, also in tuxes, distributed drinks in crystal glasses, and several types of appetizers. I was happy to see that while some women wore evening gowns that sparkled against the low lighting, others wore cocktail dresses not too dissimilar from my own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like something from a movie.\u201d I kept my voice low, but vampires had excellent hearing.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear. I\u2019m glad that someone appreciates all of the trouble my kind assistant has gone to.\u201d The voice was unfamiliar, confident, and deep. \u201cPlease, Claude, introduce us.\u201d</p><p>Claude shifted a step back, so I could see the man who approached from his left.</p><p>The air left my lungs, and my stomach dropped.</p><p>I knew every tiny line around those eyes. The way the light glinted off his thick hair. I had seen that falsely young, handsome face in my nightmares since I was ten years old. Nightmares that had returned with renewed force since I\u2019d touched that brand.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Ma\u00eetre, this is my date and friend, Beatrice Davis. Beatrice, this is Luc Chevalier, our host for the evening and the area Magister.\u201d</p><p>I managed to mutter something appropriate, and I hoped that the Magister considered my tongue-tied nature a compliment. That his station and power had overwhelmed me. After all, the Magister didn\u2019t know me to be anything other than Claude\u2019s date. For all he knew, I was easily impressed by vampires\u2014especially Magisters.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you alone for a moment, Claude. If you don\u2019t mind, my dear.\u201d</p><p>The Magister wasn\u2019t really seeking my permission, but he was polite, I\u2019d give him that. I nodded, trying to keep a smile on my face, since I couldn\u2019t bring myself to speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like me to bring you back a drink?\u201d Claude asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. I\u2019ll show you around afterward.\u201d Claude gave me a tight smile.</p> <p>Just seeing the Magister\u2019s face, so familiar and yet brand-new, sent emotions rushing through me. Anger and rage carried by a flurry of questions I wanted\u2014needed\u2014answered. Questions about the selkie and the brand and what the hell he\u2019d been doing in the room when the brand was imprinted with that vision.</p><p>Questions about my brother.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t ask any of them. So I pushed down the anger and swallowed the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cNo rush, I can mingle just fine.\u201d I gave him a broad smile that I hoped looked bright, and not full of barely concealed rage.</p><p>Claude and the Magister disappeared into the crowd, and I grabbed a glass of champagne from the waiter. I swallowed a bit, just to fit in with the other guests, and barely withheld a grimace. There was no doubt the champagne was good, definitely expensive. But I hated the taste. Just not my drink.</p> <p>The crowd was full of interesting-looking people, vampire women with their perfect skin and rich furs, and the occasional vampire man, skin just slightly too pale. Although there were surprisingly few actual vampires. What were the others? Humans? Witches? Perhaps a mix of just about every type of otherworlder.</p><p>I almost wished for the powers of a sensitive so I could tell for sure. There were hints. A twitchy woman in the corner who moved like an imp. Two women\u2014sisters by the look of them\u2014that radiated so much sex appeal I was tempted to ask them to dance. Succubi, then.</p><p>Did the Magister keep the vampire numbers down purposefully in these mixed-group balls in order to keep the auras of fear manageable? I guessed it wasn\u2019t good manners to force your guests to concentrate on not running from the room the whole night.</p><p>They all looked rich, happy, and delighted to have been invited. But how many attended just to socialize, and how many for other purposes? Backstabbing and deal-making were doubtlessly the main reason most were here, I\u2019d bet my badge on it.</p><p>I sidestepped a portly man wearing so much cologne that I almost gagged, and then stopped in my tracks. A handsome man stood about twenty feet from me, a break in the crowd allowing me to see him clearly. Like most of the men, he wore a tuxedo and was undoubtedly good-looking. But it was his resemblance to Luc Chevalier that caught my eye.</p><p>A younger version of the Magister\u2014although in appearance he only looked ten years shy of Luc\u2014the man had probably been changed in his early twenties. The same nose and hair, the same jawline and general height. But unlike the Magister, this man had a cruel turn to his lips, as if he could either laugh or order a murder with his next breath.</p> <p>There was no doubt in my mind that I was looking at the Magister\u2019s son\u2014at Nicolas Chevalier. I could see why Claude suspected him of murder, and who knew what else. He might look human, but he wore cruelty like a cloak.</p><p>Or maybe I was only seeing what I expected to see?</p><p>I scanned the room for Claude, but the vampire had effectively disappeared. Nicolas turned and started for the far end of the ballroom, away from the entrance. Giving the ballroom one last glance for Claude, I followed.</p><p>A subtle pursuit, it was not. I did my best to move through the crowd as if at random, but the vampire was moving quickly toward a hallway and I had to struggle to keep up. I slipped inside after him. A woman in a red dress with a slit up to her waist strutted past me, headed back for the ballroom. The way my eyes wanted to follow her made her succubus nature obvious. A man passed me as well, not even sparing me a glance. Definitely a vampire\u2014my heart rate kicked up a notch at the intimidation flowing from his aura.</p><p>Nicolas moved even faster, and I trotted after him, passing a powder room and a small balcony where smokers gathered. The noise from the ballroom faded behind me, and when I took a turn I\u2019d sworn the vampire had taken, the noise completely disappeared. Had to be a noise-dampening spell.</p><p>The thought slowed my pace. Those spells worked both ways. Were they trying to keep the noise out, or in? Since I hadn\u2019t seen another partygoer for a couple of turns, I was hoping for out. But its presence made me nervous.</p><p>Sure, they weren\u2019t uncommon in a nice household like this. They could be used to keep the noise from the party away from the guest quarters. But what if this spell\u2019s purpose was darker?</p><p>I moved as silently as I could down the long hallway, which was lit by low-watt bulbs set in small sconces along the wall. For a second, I thought I\u2019d gone the wrong way. But another step and I could feel sweat break out on my forehead, and I had the sudden urge to run.</p> <p>The intimidating aura of a vampire.</p><p>Was it Nicolas? If so, the man really had a nasty aura.</p><p>Not a peep sounded until I hit another corner. The voices coming out of the room at the end of the short hall were low and hurried, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words. A small bit of light shone through the corner of the slightly open doorway where the muffled voices came from.</p><p>I crept forward, thankful for the rug that lined the floor. How close could I get without the vampire inside noticing I was here? The smart thing to do would be to leave. Because if they caught me, I would be worse than dead.</p><p>That thought sank in. What the hell was I doing? Sure, I was an investigator, but I was more the \u201ctouch things and research online\u201d type\u2014less the \u201cchase bad guys without even a sidearm to my name\u201d type. I turned to go, but a single word, ringing clearly from behind the door, stopped me.</p><p>Claude.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t convince my body to leave after that. What if the people behind that door were plotting to off Claude, and I missed the details because I was too afraid to listen in? Even if they caught me, surely they wouldn\u2019t kill me with a houseful of guests only a few turns down the hall?</p><p>The sound-dampening spell was something I decided to ignore, however. Wouldn\u2019t do to dwell on the fact that no one outside of this area could hear me scream.</p><p>Creeping forward slowly, I kept my breathing as quiet as possible. Tempting as it was to hold my breath, that wouldn\u2019t do. I\u2019d end up gasping for air and giving myself away as surely as if I walked in that door and demanded to know what was going on.</p><p>The voices grew clearer as I approached.</p><p>\u201c...doesn\u2019t have anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the brand, made by my own hand. That ain\u2019t enough for ya? The timetable ain\u2019t bendable now, fanger. We don\u2019t have time for bullshit.\u201d</p><p>My hands clenched into fists automatically, and I had to force myself to stay put. I recognized that voice. The urge to fling open the door and ask them what the hell they were up to threatened to overrun my good sense, but I couldn\u2019t let it. I had no gun. No useful otherworlder powers. And no one would hear my screams.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t proof, and my father will not act without direct and incontrovertible proof.\u201d The smooth drawl that could only be the Magister\u2019s son\u2019s was so full of confidence I wanted to slap it right out of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about yer father! It\u2019s that fuckin\u2019 vampire cop. He\u2019s got a hankerin\u2019 for ya, and a psychometrist followin\u2019 him around like a lapdog.\u201d</p><p>A surge of anger hit, but I kept my mouth shut. The voices lowered, indecipherable. My welcome was more than worn out. I needed to get away and tell Claude what I\u2019d heard before they noticed me. I stepped back, but my heel caught on the carpet. My hand slammed against the wall as my body did its best not to fall.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>I turned and rushed down the hall as quietly as I could. It was possible they\u2019d inspect the hall if they\u2019d heard me, then look no further.</p><p>Not likely.</p><p>But it was the only hope I had, so I clung to it as I ran down the winding halls.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Two turns later, I was still running down the hall. Panic overrode my desire to play it cool. When I took what had to be my fourth wrong turn, I ran headlong into a hard chest. I would have flopped ungracefully to the ground, but the man grabbed my arms and held me to him. I struggled against the impossible strength. How had they gotten ahead of me? With all the wrong turns I\u2019d no doubt made, it was no wonder they\u2019d headed me off.</p><p>\u201cLet. Me. Go!\u201d I yanked with all my strength and the man did just that, sending me flying, only to bend down just in time to catch me in his arms. Striking green eyes, laced in amusement, met mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d the Magister asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t seem to find any words.</p><p>He pulled me to my feet, and I fought against the urge to push him away. Was he here to help me? Hurt me? Was it possible that of all the people present at this big party, I\u2019d only accidentally run into Luc Chevalier?</p><p>Unlikely.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d I managed. \u201cGot lost on the way to the ladies\u2019 room. I\u2019ll just be getting back to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll guide you. I\u2019d hate for you to get lost again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh, no thank you.\u201d What to say? My mind raced and I struggled not to yell at him, ask him what had happened to my brother. A lot of good that would do me, in an empty hallway of a house I\u2019d gotten lost in, with his likely murderous son and evil witch at my heels. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to inconvenience you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no inconvenience.\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cI insist.\u201d</p><p>I took a step back\u2014or tried to. The Magister grabbed my elbow, his hand tight on my skin. I opened my mouth to yell when someone touched my back, making me jump.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right here, Luc?\u201d Claude\u2019s smooth voice had never sounded so damn good.</p><p>Luc\u2019s smile returned, but tension remained around his eyes. \u201cOf course. I was just about to help your friend find her way back to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll assist her.\u201d</p><p>Luc hesitated, then nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d Then to me he added, \u201cEnjoy your evening, my dear. Please do take care not to get lost again.\u201d</p><p>His words still hanging in the air, Luc gave us a short bow and then turned and left. But he didn\u2019t head back the way he\u2019d come\u2014instead he went in the direction I\u2019d come from. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I waited until Luc was out of sight, then whispered, \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing back here?\u201d he asked, his voice low, too. \u201cSkulking and plotting, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaude,\u201d I said, barely able to stop myself from stomping at him. I could hardly voice my worries aloud, when Nicolas could be lurking around the next corner, so I glared at him with my heart still racing and fear making me ready to jump out of my skin.</p> <p>My look seemed to do the trick. The amusement faded from his expression and a very un-Claude-like seriousness took its place. Without another word, he took my elbow with his right hand and led me down the hallway; his eyes darted quickly across the space as we walked, alert for danger.</p><p>Obviously familiar with the layout of the house, Claude led me through the maze of hallways until we hit a door. Freezing wind hit me and I blinked against it. A near full moon lit a courtyard area around us, revealing trees, benches, and plants, all washed of color by the snow and moonlight. Claude\u2019s coat came around my shoulders. Before I could thank him, we were moving again.</p><p>Relief had hit me when I saw Claude, but that relief faded as we walked. I knew he could protect me better than just about anyone else, but he was cautious and silent.</p><p>We weren\u2019t home free yet.</p><p>The stone path was well kept and had only a brush of snow on it. Claude held my elbow again, and I had no doubt that if I slipped he\u2019d catch me before I could touch the ground. So I moved with confidence, keeping up with the vampire\u2019s quick pace.</p> <p>We reached a gate and Claude flipped a latch. The gate opened, revealing a very well lit parking lot. Lamps like you\u2019d see in a commercial lot lined the area, though they were a bit short and more stylishly done than most I\u2019d seen.</p><p>Claude\u2019s car started before we reached it, and he helped me into the passenger\u2019s side before taking his place in the driver\u2019s seat. I almost bit his head off for it. I didn\u2019t appreciate chivalry when it came to things I was more than capable of doing for myself, but I held my tongue.</p><p>Now was not the time to bitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked once we were on the road.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you already have your keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI carry a spare set. I\u2019ll have to go back for the other set later.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced out at the naked trees flying by. Long shadows lurked, ready to jump out at us at any second, flashing fang and steel.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Nicolas Chevalier at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I...I followed him when he went down a hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked like he was up to no good.\u201d Not a great defense, but true.</p><p>I risked a glance at the vampire. Unhappy didn\u2019t begin to cover the tension in his frame and the thin line formed by his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m an investigator. I was following a lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an investigator who isn\u2019t on a case. You\u2019re an investigator who is currently on leave. You\u2019re an investigator without even a sidearm following a known killer\u2014who also happens to be a vampire\u2014down a secluded hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was secluded,\u201d I huffed and crossed my arms. What did he know anyway? Just because I wasn\u2019t technically on a case didn\u2019t mean the investigative part of my brain turned off. Besides, this was the most important case I\u2019d ever worked on, whether he knew it or not.</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, do you want to talk about how stupid you think it was, or do you want to listen to what I found out?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and my body clenched in response. \u201cLady\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. I was not going to fall before his charm. \u201cI overheard Nicolas talking to your giant friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. He hates the Chevaliers, especially Nic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied. Or he doesn\u2019t like you more. Or, hell, maybe he just likes money more than he hates the lot of you.\u201d I shivered and pulled Claude\u2019s coat tighter. \u201cThey were talking about you. And they called me a fucking lapdog.\u201d I tried to keep the outrage from my voice, but failed.</p><p>Claude laughed loudly, body shaking. I burned with anger, tugging on my hair and too pissed off to speak. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if I was mad at Claude or just the man who\u2019d called me a lapdog, but Claude was closer and the way I was feeling I was more than willing to use him as a punching bag.</p><p>He laughed long enough I almost told him to pull over, lest he run us off the road, but finally his amusement faded enough that he could talk again.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did they say?\u201d</p><p>I just glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a lapdog, sweet. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so damn hilarious.\u201d He shot me a sexy smile and his voice lowered. \u201cIf anything, you\u2019re a tiger.\u201d</p><p>The scenery outside suddenly became very interesting to me.</p><p>\u201cSo, did you get anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like your friend was the one who made that brand. And Nic said something about not being worried about you, that his father wouldn\u2019t act without proof. Like, doubt-free proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much I know.\u201d He pulled into the parking garage of his building.</p><p>\u201cThe giant also mentioned that they were locked into a schedule. Things couldn\u2019t be moved now. Something like that.\u201d</p><p>His face was grave when he looked at me, and I hoped some of the paleness was due to the ugly fluorescent lighting of the parking garage. \u201cMy sources and evidence were right. Something big is going down soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to call Natalie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch? Why?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Covenant. The giant falls under her purview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re going to let someone else bring this guy in?\u201d</p><p>His smile turned dark. \u201cThe Covenant doesn\u2019t bring dark witches in, mon chou. And I\u2019m not concerned with him. Nicolas is my problem. I\u2019ll let the witches deal with their own garbage.\u201d</p><p>The shower made me feel better, as if fear was washable and I could scrub it off to swirl down the drain. Not likely. But at least I could wash away the sweat. I felt safe in Claude\u2019s condo though, which struck me as especially stupid and further proof that my body couldn\u2019t be trusted.</p><p>Not that I thought Claude couldn\u2019t handle himself. For all of his humor and playful attitude, the vampire was not a man to be trifled with. But if Nicolas came, he wouldn\u2019t come alone.</p><p>However, the Magister\u2019s son struck me as subtler than that. As a man who worked in the shadows. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d strike so openly even if he did suspect we knew something.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said when I emerged into the living room. Claude had the fireplace going. A gas fireplace, but pretty nonetheless. Calming. He handed me a glass of dark red wine, and watched me over the rim of his glass.</p><p>I didn\u2019t guzzle the wine, but I certainly sipped a bit faster than normal. Not that I\u2019d get drunk\u2014talk about a stupid idea when a vampire might want you dead for hearing too much\u2014but a little bit would calm my nerves.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t well. There was little doubt that Nicolas had heard me when I ran from his room, and likely even before that when I tripped like a clumsy oaf. Damn heels, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just\u2014\u201d Freaked out. Scared shitless. Angry as hell. \u201c\u2014tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d He gave me a lazy smile. \u201cHow tired?\u201d</p><p>I took another drink of my wine. I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with the \u201cus question,\u201d but I also wasn\u2019t sure that I could continue sleeping with him with the question still in the air. Not that there was even a question. I was done with him. Shit.</p><p>\u201cDid you call Natalie?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s been working with the selkie, Coates. She\u2019s made some headway there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he\u2019s allowing it. She must be more charming than you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s freaked out enough to allow her to try to help. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go to the police. It\u2019s time to call in backup, Claude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about that in the morning,\u201d he said. But there was a finality in his tone. He was humoring me. This was his personal vendetta, not something he wanted police involvement in. No witnesses. No arrests.</p><p>Did I feel differently about my need to bring in Luc Chevalier and question him about my brother? I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>There were still so many things I didn\u2019t know. Like what exactly Natalie hoped to gain by examining the selkie\u2014information, or freedom for him from the spell conditioning? Or, what was our next step, if not going to the police? But the look in Claude\u2019s eyes halted my questions. And brought my thoughts back to him. Back to us.</p><p>But mostly back to him.</p><p>He approached me slowly, as if giving me time to run away if that\u2019s what I wanted. And logically I knew that was the right thing to do. Because he was unattainable, and he got to me on a level that no man ever had. Because he\u2019d hurt me before. Because he could so easily hurt me again.</p><p>But every instinct in my body urged me to stay.</p><p>My body was a damn traitor.</p><p>\u201cClaude\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have hurt you, you know. Done things that you can\u2019t imagine. Things he\u2019s been tied to in the past. Death would have been a blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m an OWEA agent. I can imagine a lot. Second\u2014\u201d</p><p>He touched my lips with his fingertip, silencing me. I wondered what he would do if I slipped the tip into my mouth and bit it. I knew he wanted me\u2014he\u2019d proven that. But did he want me with the same intensity\u2014the same fire\u2014that drove me back to him when I should have run away?</p><p>\u201cDo you know what would have happened to me if I\u2019d lost you?\u201d</p><p>Hope surged within me, unbidden and most unwelcome. Maybe he did feel something for me. Something powerful and real. Something like what I dared not admit\u2014even to myself\u2014I felt for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are my responsibility, you know.\u201d His words smudged my hopes, but didn\u2019t dash them. Need coated his expression, under the worry.</p><p>Need that I felt vibrating through every inch of my body.</p><p>\u201cIs that all I am? Your responsibility?\u201d A silly question. A girl\u2019s question. And I was no girl. Not the one he\u2019d had an affair with.</p> <p>I kind of missed that girl. She\u2019d been an optimist. A cheerleader. A believer in great love.</p><p>\u201cAh, mon chou.\u201d He slid the back of his fingers down my jawline and over my throat, his touch so soft I barely felt it. And his gaze weighed even more heavily on me, filled with such need that I barely believed my own eyes.</p><p>Did my eyes reveal the same?</p><p>\u201cYou never understood the way I felt. I made sure of that. You still don\u2019t. And maybe that\u2019s for the best.\u201d He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, some of his normal amusement was there. My stomach sank. His guard was back up.</p><p>And I needed to put mine back up, too. To step away. To go to bed. Alone.</p> <p>But when he lowered his face to mine, almost painfully slow, all I could do was tilt my chin to meet him.</p><p>His mouth touched mine softly, feather light before moving away, then another light touch. I ached for him, and tried to push harder against his lips, but he held me firm, intent on his soft assault.</p><p>Still moving slowly, he tugged off my clothes, one piece at a time, leaving soft kisses in his wake. He pulled off my bra, then knelt in front of me and continued his soft attack on my breasts.</p><p>\u201cClaude,\u201d I muttered. I gripped his hair and turned his face up so I could meet his gaze. I didn\u2019t say anything else, but I knew he could read the need in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you say my name,\u201d he said, his voice rough with need. \u201cWhen I\u2019m inside you, your blood filling my mouth, I forget myself. My past. My need for anything but you.\u201d</p><p>Bet you say that to all the girls was on my tongue, but the glib joke didn\u2019t make it past my lips. His eyes shone in the dark when he looked at me, reflecting his feelings without guile.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you didn\u2019t return my call, I almost came for you. I wanted to drag you back. Force you to accept my apology. Convince you to love me.\u201d</p><p>The world stopped, and then spun. I gripped his shoulders and took a long breath. \u201cClaude\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens. You should know that.\u201d</p><p>Dread rose in my stomach, mixing with my desire, curdling it. Whatever happens. What exactly did he think was going to happen? I couldn\u2019t make myself ask the question though, couldn\u2019t ruin the moment.</p><p>\u201cI would have gone with you. If you had come,\u201d I said finally.</p><p>A smile peeked out from his cloud of emotions, and he laughed softly. \u201cAh, mon amour, I\u2019m glad to know that.\u201d</p><p>Even though it\u2019s too late.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say it, but I heard the words all the same.</p> <p>And then his mouth was on mine, no longer gentle. He took what he needed from me, and I took from him. Desperate to have him all around me, I wrapped my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist. He carried me, I thought toward the bedroom, but we only made it as far as his dining room table.</p><p>I pulled his shirt off, then struggled with his belt, only managing to push his pants down just enough for his cock to spring free. He pushed his tongue against mine, mouth bruising my lips, and I gripped his hardness. Satisfaction swept through me when he moaned, long and low.</p><p>Then, hands on my hips, he pulled me to the edge of the table and thrust into me with one hard, swift motion. I cried out at the sudden fullness.</p><p>This time he didn\u2019t ask. His teeth pierced my breast near my nipple, and he sucked the wound and the nipple hard. The orgasm hit me immediately, spiraling through me as he pumped into me harder and faster with every beat of my heart. I held on to his neck with one hand, and pressed the other behind me for balance as pleasure hit me in waves.</p><p>His fingers digging into my hips, he shouted my name against my breast, then stilled.</p><p>Minutes passed, then he pulled me into a tight hug. Face buried in my neck, he took a deep breath. A fuzzy haze of pleasure enveloped me, and his scent filled my lungs. And for a moment, hope pierced my worry. Maybe we could make it through this together. Maybe we could take down Nicolas and find out what happened to my brother. Maybe we could come out of this not only triumphant\u2014but together.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Claude promptly ruined my hopeful mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost glad that you overheard them, because it lightens my load to know that Luc is innocent. But then, everything is worse. Because they know you\u2019re helping me. Even if they didn\u2019t see you, they know because I took you to that witch\u2019s den. I\u2019m so sorry, Beatrice.\u201d</p><p>My guilt that had been building since he\u2019d knocked on my door suddenly needed an outlet. He believed his friend to be innocent, and I hated to make things harder for him, to make him question his place in the world. But he had to know.</p><p>He pulled me in close and nuzzled my neck, threatening to distract me. But I couldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen Luc before. In a vision. I\u2019m sorry, Claude, but he isn\u2019t innocent.\u201d</p><p>He stilled in my arms. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>Out with it all. I was literally naked in his arms. Might as well be emotionally naked, too.</p><p>\u201cMy brother Eddie disappeared when I was ten years old. He was older, nineteen. We\u2014we never had the chance to become close, you know? And I\u2019ve always wondered if we would have been\u2014if we\u2019d had the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you mentioning him before. What happened to him?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, and he stepped back and helped me hop off the table. Underwear. Surely I had underwear somewhere around here.</p><p>\u201cHe disappeared. His body was never found. No information other than part of his jacket found on a street corner known for drug dealing. Some blood at the scene came back as his.\u201d</p><p>Ah-ha. My underwear. I dressed quickly, but Claude didn\u2019t worry about his shirt. I did my best not to let my eyes roam over his hard chest. I couldn\u2019t afford for either of us to be distracted right now, not until I\u2019d gotten all this out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw Luc? That is...difficult to believe.\u201d His joking tone returned. \u201cPerhaps you think all us vampires look alike?\u201d</p><p>I tugged my shirt over my head and met Claude\u2019s guarded expression on the other side. He might wear the grin of a man unaffected, but he wasn\u2019t as nonchalant as he wanted to appear.</p><p>\u201cThe detective came by so my parents could identify the piece of jacket. He took it out of the bag and set it on top. My mother was\u2014well, she was upset. Both of my parents were. They left the room. The detective followed.\u201d My voice sounded hollow to my own ears. Shouldn\u2019t I feel something sharper? But I didn\u2019t. I just felt numb recounting the story that had changed my life.</p><p>\u201cLeaving you alone with the fabric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting a vision so young would be...unusual.\u201d</p><p>Unlikely. Near impossible. That\u2019s what he meant, but I silently thanked him for his word choice. \u201cMy parents thought\u2014everyone thought\u2014that it was just my imagination. That I had a nightmare that was so realistic it made me think it had actually happened. The nightmare part was true, it reoccurred for years after his actual disappearance. And I eventually convinced myself that was the real order of things. That I\u2019d had a nightmare about my brother being attacked, and that it was so vivid I got confused.\u201d I took a deep breath at the thought of the nightmares. \u201cBut it was a vision that caused the nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Luc, smiling. I saw his fangs flash. A dark car. I felt Eddie\u2019s pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is all?\u201d</p><p>A rush of anger overtook my numbness. \u201cIt was enough,\u201d I growled.</p><p>He came to me and pulled me into a tight hug. I leaned against him, breathing his scent, for a brief moment allowing myself to relax.</p><p>\u201cI convinced myself that it was just a nightmare. And it made sense. I didn\u2019t show any signs of psychometry again until after high school. I took a standard test when I enrolled in the police academy. The OWEA wasn\u2019t far behind. My lack of a college degree didn\u2019t even slow down their offer when my results came back.\u201d I laughed, but it was halfhearted at best. \u201cYou should have seen my parents\u2019 reaction. They didn\u2019t even realize it ran in our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t always active in those who carry the gene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it\u2019s too weak for them to ever notice.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cEither way, they weren\u2019t pleased. Then again, they haven\u2019t been pleased by too much since my brother\u2014\u201d I shook my head. What was the use in dwelling on the past, on things I couldn\u2019t change? Not much.</p><p>His hand slid down my arm and I fought the urge to step back into the safety of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cMy brother wasn\u2019t an angel. He had been into some bad things before he disappeared. We were poor, and he wasn\u2019t happy about it. He...wasn\u2019t averse to making money however he needed to.\u201d Dealing drugs. Who knew what else? For someone so young, he\u2019d gotten himself into a lot of trouble. \u201cBut whatever he did, he didn\u2019t deserve to just disappear like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked into his case? Since joining the OWEA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d And it had taken every bit of my willpower and self-control not to at times, while at other moments I felt ill at even the thought of looking in that file. It was a Pandora\u2019s box, ready to shit all over the bit of a life I\u2019d built. Once opened, I\u2019d never be able to close it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should speak to Luc about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Something in my chest twisted. I hadn\u2019t expected him to believe me\u2014not exactly. But it would have been nice to be surprised for once.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed more evidence than my word. I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice.\u201d He slid his hand under my chin and tipped it so I would meet his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your brother. I believe that you believe what you saw was real, and was Luc. I do not doubt your word. But, the memories from childhood...they\u2019re so easy to alter in our own minds even as we seek clarity. They\u2019re shadows of reality. I\u2019d hate to condemn a man I trust based on such memories.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was right. But everything in my being insisted that Luc was in the vision I\u2019d seen as a child. And his presence in the vision from the brand hadn\u2019t yet been explained either. Even though it was starting to look more like Nicolas was responsible for that crime.</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw.\u201d There was nothing else to say but that, although I didn\u2019t have anything concrete to argue with. Frustration and helplessness rolled through me, and must have shown in my expression, because Claude stepped toward me again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried that they may have seen you. If Nicolas believes you overheard them...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t let him hurt you, mon amour.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to that. I didn\u2019t even know how to feel. My gut twisted and my pulse raced. Happiness that he cared warred with fear at the resignation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should finish getting dressed.\u201d I stepped away. I couldn\u2019t be so close to him right now and still think straight.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cAll right. I will get dressed. We will sleep. And tomorrow, we will do what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said we. We would do what needed to be done. But he\u2019d meant I. That much was obvious when I awoke alone the next morning. I called his name once, but the silence in the condo was oppressive.</p><p>\u201cFucking idiot,\u201d I muttered. He\u2019d left a note by the coffeepot. Basic, but gut-wrenching all the same. Let him take care of his problem. Couldn\u2019t let anyone else be hurt. Blah blah blah... We\u2019d do dinner.</p> <p>He was a stupid, heroic vampire. An irreplaceable man. And he was walking into a trap.</p><p>Even on the off chance Nicolas didn\u2019t expect him. Wasn\u2019t planning on him showing up to protect me or seek justice. It didn\u2019t matter. Nicolas wouldn\u2019t be alone. As the son of a Magister and powerful vampire in his own right, he\u2019d have handlers or bodyguards or a few fucking yes men to help him off Claude. And Claude was going in with a dangerous assumption: that Luc\u2019s loyalties were with him, not with his own son.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>He might hate me for it, might consider it a betrayal, but I had to go to the police.</p><p>I dressed quickly and decided to go to Chicago\u2019s Paranormal Unit. My words would carry more weight with the Otherworlder Enforcement Agency, but Chicago\u2019s freak squad was better staffed than the local OWEA branch. And they had more reason to give a shit about Claude. I considered calling, but the situation was too complex, too difficult to explain over the telephone. It would be simpler, and quicker, in person.</p><p>As if affected by my mood, gray clouds hung heavily over the city, and the oppressive cold sank through my coat and scarf almost immediately. I looked down the street for a cab. There. I raised my hand to wave, and a sharp pain stabbed the back of my neck. Someone pulled me against his body. I could see and hear the rush of the wind, but I couldn\u2019t move my head to see who held me. My mouth wouldn\u2019t work. Panic roared through me, but I couldn\u2019t cry out. Couldn\u2019t fight back.</p> <p>The gloved arm pulled me into a car, and finally I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s face. The man who was kidnapping me.</p><p>Luc Chevalier. The Magister.</p><p>Frustration fought against the panic as we pulled away from the curb. I was lain across the backseat of the vehicle, my legs across Luc\u2019s lap. I couldn\u2019t see the driver. Dark tinted windows hid us from the rest of the world. For a brief moment, I had the insane idea that they couldn\u2019t see me. That I wasn\u2019t really there. That I was instead locked into someone else\u2019s vision. An idea that Luc quickly shattered.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for the spell, Miss Davis. You\u2019ll understand that we couldn\u2019t have you calling out for help or hurting yourself trying to get away.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s voice was smooth, placating. The voice of a politician.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be harmed. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Right. Totally a politician. I could see why the vampires followed him. I almost believed him when he said I wouldn\u2019t be harmed. I wanted to believe him. But, I also wasn\u2019t an idiot. People weren\u2019t kidnapped, allowed to see their kidnappers, and then simply released. It just didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Panic rose in me again at the thought, and I pushed it down as best I could and tried to think my way through the situation. I still couldn\u2019t move. But chances were, if this was a basic disabling spell Luc commissioned, I would be immobilized for less than an hour. Surely it would take longer than that for them to take me somewhere to kill me, or whatever they had planned for me first. I\u2019d get my chance then.</p> <p>But what kind of chance would I have?</p><p>Luc was one of the strongest vampires in the country, and definitely on the shortlist for the most powerful in the world. Sure, there were probably a few who could take him out in Europe and Asia where the older families lived, but I didn\u2019t have an ancient vampire handy, so fighting my way free wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>I\u2019d have to run. Or scream. Possibly run away screaming.</p><p>Awesome plan.</p><p>Luc didn\u2019t say anything else, and we rode silently for a while. Finally, a tingle started in my fingertips. The spell was wearing off\u2014and by my estimate we\u2019d been driving nearly an hour. If I had to, maybe I could surprise them. Jump out of the car when it slowed. Bruises and broken bones were better than being dead.</p><p>Before I could contemplate how best to roll when I hit the ground, the car slowed and the light outside the windows dimmed. The car engine ceased its rumble, and Luc opened the door. We\u2019d arrived, wherever it was we were going.</p><p>Luc pulled me out of the car carefully, then carried me as if I were a bride, across the threshold into a house. The smell of cigarettes touched my nose, but I couldn\u2019t be sure if it was the house, or someone walking in front of us. A cottage-cheese ceiling was all I could make out from my vantage point, and I frowned. No way were we at the Magister\u2019s house. The vampire just didn\u2019t strike me as the type to have 1980s popcorn ceilings anywhere on his property.</p><p>My arm twitched of its own volition and Luc made an approving noise.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ll be able to move normally in a minute or two. That\u2019ll make this easier.\u201d</p><p>We emerged from the hallway, and the smell of old cigarettes filled my nose. Oh yes, it was the house that stank. Whoever lived here wasn\u2019t worried about cracking a window for a smoke. Luc lay me down on a couch, gentle again. If he really intended to kill me, would he be so careful not to hurt me now?</p><p>A door slammed in another room. A loud thump, like an exterior door, but not from the same direction we\u2019d entered. The light sound of footsteps approaching. My heart jumped into my throat. Another vampire? Why the hell not? I could handle three as well as two\u2014meaning not at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to her?\u201d The voice was familiar and, even across the room, sent hope rushing through me. But the hope was quickly stamped out by dread.</p><p>Claude was here. But so was Luc and who knew how many vampires?</p><p>What chance did we have?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple disabling spell. She\u2019s otherwise unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Movement in the corner of my eye made me start, and to my surprise, my body actually twitched.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Luc. I could have picked her up. This wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d Footsteps against carpet, then, \u201cCan you move, Beatrice?\u201d Claude\u2019s voice was low and soothing, and only inches from my ear. \u201cTry to move.\u201d</p><p>It took a couple of minutes, but with some concentrated effort and a whole lot of built up fear and anger, I was able to work myself up into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201c...Fucker,\u201d I finally managed once I could speak again.</p><p>Luc offered me a small, apologetic smile. \u201cI understand why you would be upset. But we needed to speak to you without making a scene. And Claude was otherwise detained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was checking on the capture of a rogue witch\u2014one your son is well-acquainted with. You could have given me more than fifteen minutes to return your phone call,\u201d Claude growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid time was of the essence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve...asked.\u201d Forming words was still a challenge. Like I\u2019d been tossed in a deep freeze and was trying to thaw my muscles. Thankfully minus the cold.</p><p>The room revealed by my sitting position wasn\u2019t much better than the smell. The couch I sat on was old and frayed, and a stack of beer bottles sat on the coffee table next to a full ashtray. It looked\u2014and smelled\u2014like a bachelor pad of a college-aged boy who\u2019d decided to party his early twenties away instead of actually going to college.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll understand if I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be likely to trust me, considering my presence in your visions,\u201d Luc said, and the man behind him who stood in the shadows shifted almost imperceptibly. Only two of them, then\u2014Luc and the driver? Fewer than I would have guessed if he was looking for a fight.</p><p>Luc\u2019s words sank in, and my gaze shot to Claude. Sure enough, he glanced down. Guilt covered his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou told him? My great big secret I only just confided in you? How long did you wait, Claude? Did you call him last night, or did you wait to slither out of bed this morning to do it?\u201d Betrayed. By Claude. I couldn\u2019t even grasp the emotions washing through me. Anger and fear and such an overwhelming sadness that I had to choke down tears.</p><p>Overrunning it all was exhaustion.</p><p>Why the hell had I crawled out of my comfortable bed, my safe life, to help this man? To crack open my past that would have been just fine staying where it was. In the past.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving him a chance to explain. He\u2019s an honorable man.\u201d Claude turned to Luc, his brows pinched in annoyance. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d spell you and bring you here. And I\u2019m still not clear why we\u2019re meeting in this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing he trusted me, Miss Davis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Davis.\u201d I faced Luc and the rage started to win. \u201cA good thing? I saw your face, Luc. I know you were there when my brother was killed.\u201d</p><p>Forcing myself to my feet, I struggled for balance. I couldn\u2019t face this man sitting down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen your face in my nightmares, Magister.\u201d I spit his title with as much venom as I could manage. \u201cYou\u2019ve haunted my nights since I was ten.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Luc\u2019s jaw twitched, but he didn\u2019t otherwise show any outward emotion.</p><p>\u201cListen to him, mon chou.\u201d</p> <p>I whirled on Claude, catching myself with the corner of the couch\u2019s armrest before I could topple over and ruin any chance I had of being taken seriously. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that. You just lost that right.\u201d</p><p>Claude flinched as if I\u2019d hit him with my fist instead of my words. \u201cPlease. Just listen.\u201d</p><p>Guilt hit me at his words, his pained expression. He\u2019d done what he thought was right. Was his decision so much different than my own when I\u2019d decided to get the police department involved? Not really. Biggest difference was, I hadn\u2019t had the chance to betray his secret.</p><p>\u201cI know that the last thing you want to hear is the sound of my voice, Agent Davis, so I\u2019ll be quick. I was there when your brother disappeared. But I didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at the vampire. \u201cBullshit. Visions are related to emotion. He would have seen you as the most important thing in the room for your face to imprint onto his clothing. And it would have had to have been during a heck of a traumatic event.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might have been the most important thing to him in that moment. But it\u2019s not because I killed him.\u201d Luc\u2019s eyes revealed an iron will, and I could see why he\u2019d ruled his small part of the world for so long. But I was beyond fear of this vampire. I\u2019d lived my life afraid of him, of what he represented, even when I\u2019d just thought him a nightmare. I was done being afraid.</p><p>\u201cOh, really. Then why the hell would your face be the first thing I saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I saved his life. Your brother, Agent Davis, is not dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d If the Magister had physically punched me in the gut, I didn\u2019t think it would have hurt as much as the twisting pain that struck me with his words.</p><p>I started to turn to look at Claude, but movement behind the Magister drew my eyes back. The man who had been hovering behind the Magister stepped out of the shadows, and all the air left the room.</p> <p>The fine line of his jaw was the same, as was the carrot-colored hair and pale skin. His hair hadn\u2019t darkened into a true red like mine; it had stayed lighter. But he looked smaller somehow. The young man I remembered had always seemed so large.</p><p>But then, he would have seemed so to a ten-year-old.</p><p>The young man in front of me, tentative smile on his face, was of average height and slight build. And more important, he was a young man.</p><p>My brother had been nine years my senior when he disappeared. I had been ten. The man in front of me hadn\u2019t aged a day since\u2014he looked every bit nineteen years old.</p><p>\u201cVampire.\u201d My voice was barely perceptible to my ears, but vampires had great hearing. Mind reeling, I couldn\u2019t for the life of me get it to stop. Couldn\u2019t come up with a single thought other than that word.</p><p>\u201cYour brother was injured that night. Gravely. I saved his life and made him a vampire\u2014against vampire law, I should point out. I\u2019ve had to pay dearly for it, but I\u2019d do it again. No doubt that was a powerful enough event to imprint his coat.\u201d</p><p>Something about that wasn\u2019t right, but I couldn\u2019t grasp it. But Claude wasn\u2019t as affected.</p><p>\u201cA grave injury cured by a vampire turning? Sounds like he was bitten. Another mistake of Nicolas\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t for the life of me tear my gaze from my brother Eddie\u2019s face to look at Claude, but I could hear the growl in his voice. The anger.</p><p>\u201cIs there ever going to come a time when you realize his harmless mistakes are anything but?\u201d Claude asked.</p><p>Luc smiled bitterly, and the vampire behind him\u2014my brother\u2014shifted on his feet. \u201cAs you can see, your brother is alive and well. We\u2019re in his house, in fact. He is not being held prisoner, nor is he being coerced.\u201d</p><p>I could see that, but that created more questions in my mind than it answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I shook my head, and it was as if pieces of a puzzle settled, each fitting into its rightful place. Anger settled into my chest, smothering any affection. I glared at my brother, hard. If looks could have killed, he would have dropped right then and there. \u201cYou just took off for a new life and left the old one because you didn\u2019t give a shit, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I wanted him to argue the fact. I wanted him to say he was coerced or had amnesia or was locked in a dungeon. I wanted him to tell me that my memory was faulty, that he hadn\u2019t been as unhappy with his lot in life as I remembered. That he hadn\u2019t constantly argued with our parents. That he hadn\u2019t just left without a word.</p><p>But he just shrugged. \u201cI gave a shit. Hell, I missed you, Bea. But you know how they were to me.\u201d</p><p>His words sounded hollow, and the whiny, self-entitled tone I\u2019d heard from my teenage brother was still there in this pseudo-man. He\u2019d missed me the way he might miss a favorite record. Not like he should have missed a family member. Had being made a perpetual teenager kept his attitudes the same as the truculent kid he\u2019d been back then, or would he never have grown up, even if he\u2019d been given the chance?</p><p>\u201cSince your brother is quite alive, I beseech you both to let go of this needless investigation into my family.\u201d</p><p>That would be so much easier. And in fact, I ached to leave this whole mess behind me. Leave Eddie behind me. Leave all these damn vampires to their business. Even Claude. Especially Claude. To go and find a life that didn\u2019t involve vampires of any sort. To pretend my brother died that night\u2014or hell, maybe reach out to him to figure out if he might potentially grow into a good man.</p><p>But Claude\u2014Claude had worked to bring Nic to justice for years. Maybe decades. Probably longer than I\u2019d been alive.</p><p>And despite the fact that he had blabbed my secret to a man I considered an enemy, I realized that I loved the misguided vampire. Enough to put myself on the line to help him bring his obsession to a close.</p><p>\u201cBlood isn\u2019t everything. A man as old as you should know that. Your son deserves to rot in prison\u2014or worse. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, you do, too. Go fuck yourself,\u201d I told Luc. I nodded to my brother\u2014how little he deserved that title. \u201cAnd you can go fuck yourself, too.\u201d</p><p>Luc, resignation in his posture, turned to Claude, who said, \u201cI\u2019m with her. He has to be stopped, Luc. I know that you don\u2019t want to believe him truly evil. I know you want to attribute his actions to simple rash decisions\u2014to emotional outbursts. But he will continue to hurt people. And I just can\u2019t allow it. Not any longer.\u201d</p><p>As if a light switch had been clicked, Luc suddenly looked every bit the ancient vampire\u2014the old man\u2014that he was. His perfect skin didn\u2019t wrinkle, neither did his hairline recede or his muscles fade. But he looked exhausted, and resigned. He nodded slowly, as if the gesture pained him. \u201cNicolas warned me that you would not bend on this. I\u2019d hoped that I could convince you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicolas knows of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him I was coming here, talking to you and the agent, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d I half expected Luc to attack, but he simply stood a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been helping him.\u201d Claude\u2019s voice lost all of its anger. He sounded let down. \u201cYou were there when he used the brand to mark that selkie. Just as you were there when Beatrice\u2019s brother was almost killed.\u201d</p><p>Becoming the topic of conversation didn\u2019t agree with my brother. He fidgeted when Claude\u2019s gaze slid to him, and glanced nervously at the front door behind me as if he wanted to run away.</p><p>\u201cOf course I was there,\u201d Luc said. \u201cI am present for all of my son\u2019s sins. I clean them up. I punish him. And I pray that they will not be repeated. But I am never without sorrow. Never without regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck your regret,\u201d Claude said, and finally some fire returned to his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve enabled this. You\u2019ve covered up for him for what? A century? More? I can\u2019t let this stand, and I can no longer wait for your permission or your judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t. But I promised her. I swore to always keep him safe.\u201d He struggled for his words. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep her alive, Claude. But I swore that I would do better for our son.\u201d</p><p>Claude took a step forward and Eddie jumped, just a little bit. He looked at the door again. Damn. Was Claude really that scary, or was my brother that much of a wimp?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pretend to forgive what you have done\u2014no matter how good you thought your reason. Where will you stand now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot help you in this, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve already taken a stand, haven\u2019t you? That\u2019s why I\u2019m out of town so much now, sent to handle affairs that you used to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Luc shook his head. \u201cI needed to be here\u2014to stop him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo clean up his messes, or to keep me from catching him with the evidence you couldn\u2019t refute?\u201d Claude\u2019s fists clenched and unclenched at his side, but his words came out calm. \u201cVery well, ma\u00eetre.\u201d</p><p>No. That was far too accepting for my taste. The Magister might get away with siding with his son\u2014I could understand that, even if I couldn\u2019t contemplate ever making such a decision myself. But for Claude to stand neutral?</p><p>I opened my mouth to give him a piece of my mind, but never got the words out. My brother flinched behind Luc.</p><p>I barely had time to duck in front of the couch when the door burst open and a vampire sprinted in so quickly I registered the door opening after the vampire was nearly on Claude.</p><p>A shot rang out. Claude. He\u2019d pulled and fired so swiftly at the vampire approaching, I hadn\u2019t even seen it.</p><p>The vamp barely slowed. Long knife in hand, he stabbed at Claude. I almost couldn\u2019t wrap my mind around it, even though I knew that a bullet wouldn\u2019t do much damage to a vampire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The vampire hit Claude and they fell into a dance too fast for me to follow. Claude fired again, slowing his opponent a hair. Then the gun flew, through the doorway and into the kitchen beyond. I almost went after it before reality hit. I wouldn\u2019t just have to get through the vampire fighting Claude\u2014not to mention I\u2019d be hopeless at navigating around their fast, brutal fight\u2014but I\u2019d have to get past Luc, too.</p><p>Movement drew my gaze back to the door, where another vampire followed in the first\u2019s wake. Him, I got a good look at. Because he didn\u2019t bother to run in at vampire speed. He sauntered in after the other vamp broke the door off its hinges. And he was carrying a freaking sword.</p><p>Nicolas Chevalier.</p> <p>I vaguely wondered if the neighbors would be calling the police.</p><p>If there were any neighbors. Were we in a city? Out in the middle of nowhere? No way to tell from inside the house.</p><p>Luc watched as Claude wrestled with one vampire, fighting for the knife, and Nic closed in behind them. My heart jumped into my throat at the sight of that knife. Vampires were tough to kill, but not impossible. Take out the heart or the head. And it was a big freaking knife.</p><p>My brother backed up a step, looking unsure. I felt uselessly for my sidearm. What the fuck kind of help could I be without a gun? The vampires seemed to think the same, because their focus was entirely on Claude.</p><p>My answer stared at me in the face. The coffee table.</p> <p>No chance of hitting the vampire Claude fought with; they moved at speeds that hurt my eyes. No chance to get past all of them to Claude\u2019s nearly useless gun. But Nicolas. Arrogant, prodigal son, he was watching his lackey fight Claude\u2014weakening him for the kill.</p><p>A kill that Nicolas\u2019s gleeful expression left little doubt that he\u2019d participate in. I had faith that Claude could take out the vampire he wrestled with. And Luc and my brother might stay out of the fight\u2014until things looked bad for them, anyway.</p><p>Hell. My brother. No wonder he\u2019d been watching the door so nervously. He\u2019d known they were coming. He\u2019d betrayed me\u2014us\u2014to Nicolas. The man who\u2019d almost killed him. What had Nicolas said or done to bring him around. Offered him money?</p><p>My chest hurt at the thought. Shit. Sure, he hadn\u2019t always made the right choices in his life. But to betray me to someone he had to know intended to kill me? I couldn\u2019t accept that.</p><p>I pushed up from the ground and grabbed the coffee table. Cheap and light, parts of the wood covering had rubbed or ripped away to reveal the particleboard beneath. It practically screamed Ikea. But it was a simple model. Helpful if you didn\u2019t have super strength.</p><p>I used my whole body when I threw it at Nicolas. I knew it wouldn\u2019t hurt him, but for Claude to survive, I needed to keep his attention. Claude was my only hope.</p> <p>And I was his.</p><p>Nicolas reacted immediately to my attack. The vampire flew at me, and I didn\u2019t even see him move until he was on top of me. The idea of a vampire other than Claude biting me sickened me. Between us, it was personal. It was about trust. It was intimate. A show of love.</p><p>But Nicolas didn\u2019t bite me. He threw me.</p><p>I hit the wall and for a moment I felt like I was in a vision. Sound disappeared. I couldn\u2019t move. Shock halted my thoughts.</p><p>Then it all came rushing back. I sucked in a breath of air and sharp pain spiked from the back of my ribs where I\u2019d hit the wall. I slid down the surface of the wood paneling to the floor.</p><p>Across the room, Claude stood facing me, facing Nicolas. The Magister\u2019s son seemed to have decided I was no longer a threat, because he turned his back to me and faced off with Claude.</p><p>The vampire Claude had been wrestling with was crumpled into an unmoving pile at Claude\u2019s feet. Claude held the vampire\u2019s bloody knife. There was so much blood. On the vampire. On the floor. On Claude\u2019s hands.</p><p>But others were there now. Two more vampires had come in at some point and, based on their proximity to Nicolas, I didn\u2019t think they were there to help us.</p> <p>Like a light snuffed, the bit of hope I\u2019d nursed that we\u2019d make it out of this died at the sight of them. There were too many.</p><p>Luc was shouting something but, like in my visions, I couldn\u2019t seem to grasp what he said. His expression had turned dark, his eyes narrowed in worry, and he gestured at Nic and Claude.</p><p>I struggled to my feet, fighting against the pain spiking from my back. Something was wrong with my left shoulder, and my arm didn\u2019t want to move. But my right arm worked just fine, and I would be damned if I didn\u2019t at least go out fighting.</p><p>The two vampires who\u2019d entered while I was on the floor circled Claude, and he kept them at bay with the knife and a fearsomely calm expression. Nicolas stood watching, his back to me. I\u2019d been right. The man didn\u2019t like to risk himself when he wasn\u2019t certain of the result. That was okay. I really wanted to hit him, anyway.</p><p>The lamp fell off the end table when I grabbed the leg. I swung it like a club, hitting Nicolas. It didn\u2019t break under the strength of only one of my arms swinging it so haphazardly, but bounced off his back, instead.</p><p>But it got his attention.</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d I yelled when he turned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cProbably. But you\u2019re still an ass.\u201d</p><p>Then I was hitting the wall again, but this time the vampire was attached to my throat. In the distance, I could see Claude cry out to me and, seeing an opening, the vampires circling him attacked.</p><p>Pain arched through my body from my throat, and I batted at Nicolas with my working arm. He pressed so hard against my neck that I couldn\u2019t breathe right. Then everything slowed down, and an almost pleasant fuzzy haze covered the scene before me.</p><p>Nicolas lifted his head and grinned, my blood covering his mouth and chin.</p><p>\u201cMessy eater,\u201d I muttered, or tried to. The words came out garbled.</p><p>Nicolas turned to shout over his shoulder. \u201cYou should have minded your own business, Claude. This is your fault. You got her killed!\u201d</p><p>Claude screamed back something nonsensical and one of the vampires on top of him flew out the bay window.</p><p>Nicolas turned back to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with, shall we? I do like to play with my food, but you\u2019re a little bland.\u201d</p><p>He started toward my neck again, then fell back a couple of steps. I fell to the ground, right on my butt. My legs didn\u2019t seem to work. And for a moment, I thought I\u2019d passed out and gone to dreamland.</p><p>My brother stood between Nicolas and me.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t do anything to you. Leave her be,\u201d he said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a resounding defense, but the fact he stood between us was enough. More than I would have expected. Maybe not enough to forgive everything, but it got him closer.</p><p>Nicolas looked like he might acquiesce for a moment, his gaze flashing between me and Eddie. Then he grinned, and struck.</p><p>My brother hit the wall next to me, and slid into a puddle beside me. Knocked out or dead? I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>My neck was wet and I was starting to get cold. And at any moment, Nicolas would be on me, finishing his goal of bleeding me dry.</p><p>But Nicolas never hit me. Instead, I watched him turn to his father.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d Nicolas asked.</p><p>\u201cI said leave the woman alone.\u201d Luc\u2019s graying pallor and the almost crazy look in his eyes made me hope that Nicolas had finally pushed his father too far. \u201cThis has gone far enough, my son.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see Nicolas\u2019s expression, but I could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re right, father. This has gone far enough, and for long enough. The pieces are all in place. And here you are, all alone.\u201d</p><p>Nicolas was blocking my view of Claude. Was he hurt? Dead? God, I had to see. Limbs screaming and head spinning, I tried to force myself up into a standing position. When a wave of blackness stole seconds from me I decided, instead, to crawl but I shuffled on my knees because I only had one good arm.</p><p>Nicolas jumped at his father, and I could see the other vampire Claude had been fighting jump Luc as well. But I didn\u2019t care about them. I had to see if Claude was okay. I had to see if my brother was okay.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I shuffled a couple of feet to look at Eddie. His face was bleeding, his nose broken. Maybe his jaw. But it took more than that to kill a vampire. Even with blood seeping out of the back of his head, right? I knew that young ones were easier to kill, but surely not head-injury easy. I hoped.</p><p>I touched the side of his face, as if touching him would make him being here real, and my hand slid down to his shirt. That\u2019s when I saw it.</p><p>His shirt had opened just enough\u2014courtesy of a broken button\u2014for the brand on his chest to be visible.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Nic and Luc continued to fight, and a piece of the couch hit the drywall above my head. I ducked and closed my eyes, but it landed a foot behind me. I turned back to my brother.</p><p>Did Nic have a hold on him, too? Is that why he\u2019d told the vampire we\u2019d be here with Luc? What the fuck did the brand do? Not torture people, that was for sure. If that had been the case, then the giant wouldn\u2019t have given that up.</p><p>But controlling someone from a distance would fit. If I were the giant, I would\u2019ve tried to keep the lie as close to the truth as possible. That way he could feign ignorance if Claude caught on.</p><p>What could Nic possibly gain from branding someone like my brother and a selkie leader? They had nothing in common.</p><p>Unless...unless Nic used the brand to control them somehow. That would fit. A selkie prince would be useful\u2014not on his own, but if Nic was making a big move to take over. Hell, was it possible he controlled people using the brand as a link?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know, and I wasn\u2019t entirely sure it mattered. Right now, we had to survive.</p><p>I only made it a couple of feet, just far enough to see Claude on the floor, unmoving. Pain the likes of which I never thought I could feel clawed at my insides, and I finally gave up on my fight to move. I curled up on the floor. I couldn\u2019t cry. I couldn\u2019t scream. I couldn\u2019t allow the darkness I so craved to pull me under.</p><p>Because I was stronger than that. And Claude would expect more of me. I reached out and grabbed a chunk of wood that was next to me on the floor. From the coffee table, maybe. And I held it in my hands, waiting for Nicolas to attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, I knew that Nicolas would win. Luc hadn\u2019t been able to bring his son to heel for more than a century, and taking his son\u2019s life would be a far greater step than that. But Luc\u2019s sense of honor wouldn\u2019t allow him to watch his friend die without at least attempting to stop it either. Luc didn\u2019t plan on surviving.</p><p>I closed my eyes, still clinging to my bit of wood. The scuffle continued, far more quietly than I would have guessed. Not much yelling. No cursing or one-liners. No insults. Just the sound of flesh hitting flesh, of knives clattering to the floor. The occasional boom of someone hitting a wall. Amazingly, nothing hit me.</p><p>The room was so cold, and I was so fucking tired. Blood loss, part of my brain insisted. A short nap, a little rest, maybe then I could get up.</p> <p>No.</p><p>I forced my eyes open. The hell I was going to let some asshole vampire kill me while I lay unconscious. I struggled to my knees, using my right hand to prop myself up, my small wannabe stake between my hand and the ground. I couldn\u2019t let it go, even though I knew if I tried to use it, I\u2019d face-plant into the ground the second I lifted my hand from where it propped me up.</p><p>Blinking at the scene before me, I tried to take it in. Nicolas stood in front of his father, their profiles to me. Pieces of what could only be the other vampires were on the ground. They were both covered in blood and beat the hell up. But when Luc\u2019s gaze slid to me, he moved just enough so I could see his chest. And the long sword that stuck out from where his heart should\u2019ve been.</p><p>He mouthed something to me. It might have been, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Then Nic turned around.</p> <p>Nothing sane dwelt in him\u2014not really. I\u2019d have sworn to it at that moment, staring into those eyes so full of hate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn now. No one to order me around. No one to try to make me live within the bounds of human law.\u201d His expression twisted into a snarl so fierce he looked inhuman. \u201cWe\u2019re better than you! Why did he always try to protect you?\u201d</p><p>He lunged toward me, and I couldn\u2019t help but cry out when he bent to take my neck again. He paused for a moment, lips so close to the skin on my neck that I could feel the rush from his mouth when he laughed. I cringed, then with my last bit of strength, I plunged my wannabe stake into his stomach.</p><p>He laughed louder and pulled back, wheezing as he chortled. He plucked the wood from his stomach and tossed it. He leaned in again, and I silently prayed that Claude might still be alive. That he might get away. That Eddie might get away with him.</p><p>But before Nicolas\u2019s teeth could break my skin, his body stiffened. Something hit my chest\u2014cooler than my skin but warmer than the air around us. A full second passed before I registered the knifepoint sticking out from his chest. And that what had hit me was his blood.</p><p>Claude knocked Nicolas to the side, moving him away from me.</p> <p>Hope surged through me. If Nicolas was dead, we were saved. I was so fucking cold, and Claude was torn up\u2014covered in blood and his body nearly broken by the vampires he\u2019d fought. But if there was no one left to fight, we had a chance.</p><p>I blinked against the darkness that crept into the edges of my vision, and movement caught my eye. Nicolas was moving. Slowly, but moving. Headed for the door.</p><p>Had Claude missed the heart?</p><p>\u201cGet him,\u201d I muttered, but Claude didn\u2019t move from my side. I wasn\u2019t sure it mattered. I wasn\u2019t so cold anymore, but I was so fucking tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve...fought so...long.\u201d Words didn\u2019t seem to want to form in my mouth, and I wondered if one of the vampire hits had knocked my jaw out of whack. But it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Claude didn\u2019t even glance at Nic, who had struggled to his feet. \u201cI need you to make a choice, mon chou. Will you stay with me?\u201d</p><p>His question seemed to have deeper meaning than I could grasp in that moment. But the idea of being with him\u2014trusting him not to hurt me\u2014didn\u2019t scare me anymore. He loved me. I loved him. It all seemed so damned simple now. There was no need to deny it anymore.</p> <p>\u201cLove...you,\u201d I managed.</p><p>Claude was cursing then, and I realized he\u2019d been talking and I missed it. He shoved something against my mouth and I fought him instinctually. But even in his beaten state, the vampire was a good deal stronger than I.</p><p>Sweet coppery heat filled my mouth. I gagged and coughed into his arm, but he didn\u2019t move. I managed to swallow, but the liquid kept coming. I thought I passed out for a second, but the blood flow never seemed to stop. My stomach felt horrible, like I desperately needed to vomit. If I could just move. But I couldn\u2019t move. Claude was yelling at me, telling me to drink. Telling me not to die. Not yet.</p><p>If he was desperately trying to fill my body with his blood, then I had to be dying. Because vampires weren\u2019t made without human death.</p><p>Heat rolled through my stomach and spread to the rest of me. It was painful compared to the cold I\u2019d been feeling, and awakened all the pain from my injuries. I tried to cry out, but I couldn\u2019t put a voice to the agony. I couldn\u2019t find a release for the heat building. Every part of my body throbbed.</p><p>Over Claude\u2019s arm, something moved. Luc came into view, his eyes on us and his expression unreadable. With one quick jerk, he pulled the sword from his chest.</p><p>The world went blessedly dark.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The fishy smell of the ocean filled my lungs. Waves rolled, hitting the beach in front of me, then sliding back out. To my ears, it sounded like the roar of a helicopter\u2014close and likely to hit me if I didn\u2019t duck. That part was supposed to get better.</p><p>My stomach twisted, and I was hit by a sudden hunger. One that I didn\u2019t have to feed, not yet, but which I craved more than just about anything I could remember. That part was supposed to get better, too, but it would never go away.</p><p>Such was the price I had paid.</p><p>And I had paid with my gift. Psychometry wasn\u2019t a talent vampires possessed. I had lost my visions. My ability to witness murders after the fact. My occasional ability to glimpse the future. That was something that would have killed me a week ago, would have made me feel entirely worthless. But now, the idea made me almost giddy, if a touch sad, when I let myself dwell on the loss.</p><p>\u201cGetting melancholy on me, out here staring at the waves?\u201d</p><p>I smiled but didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cJust enjoying the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not missing the Midwest winter are you? Because I have a cabin in North Dakota that would provide the seclusion we need for you to adjust. It\u2019s not Chicago, but it\u2019ll do if you\u2019d prefer the cold we left behind.\u201d</p><p>I shivered. Just the thought of the freezing Chicago wind was enough to make me never want to leave this small island. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly where we were\u2014I hadn\u2019t asked\u2014but it was warm here, humid. The beaches were beautiful. And we were the only people on the island.</p><p>That was good enough for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare threaten me with cold, mister.\u201d I turned and poked Claude in the chest. \u201cThem\u2019s fightin\u2019 words. And they\u2019ll get you bit.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pulled me close for a quick kiss, but worry flashed in his eyes. I didn\u2019t bother calling him on it. He\u2019d eventually figure out that I wasn\u2019t going to slip into a great depression because he\u2019d been forced to choose between watching me die or turning me into a so-called creature of the night.</p><p>I was glad he\u2019d chosen the way he had. And someday he\u2019d believe it, too. We had plenty of time. It had only been a week, after all.</p><p>\u201cGot a call from Lieutenant Vasquez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour supervisor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He wasn\u2019t too happy with me leaving him and the rest of the unit with the cleanup. That many dead vampires\u2014well, there\u2019s a lot of paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d I\u2019d been unconscious for the day after the events had unfolded in my brother\u2019s rural home. And I\u2019d been practically a zombie for days after that\u2014nearly a literal one. Thinking much beyond the hunger for blood had been impossible. And the heat that had roiled through me from Claude\u2019s blood hadn\u2019t faded for several days\u2014after I\u2019d died from my injuries, to be reborn as a vampire.</p><p>I tried not to think about that part too closely.</p><p>My memories were sketchy, but Claude had filled in the details. He\u2019d let Nic go to save me\u2014I remembered that much. But Luc, after making sure I would live, had found Nic on the front steps. He\u2019d been nearly dead from the blow to his heart that Claude had inflicted with the sword, but Luc had cut off his head, just to be sure.</p><p>It seemed that the father had finally run out of patience with his son.</p><p>Before the police and paramedics had arrived, Luc and Eddie had left. I hoped that meant my brother still lived. And that somewhere, Luc was looking out for him.</p><p>\u201cI might have to fly back to Chicago for a few days, but I told him we needed some time here. OWEA is stepping in to help close out the case. But without Nic\u2014or Luc\u2014burying things, evidence is piling up. Vasquez is willing to interview you over the phone until you\u2019re up to meeting with him.\u201d</p><p>I could do that much. Things were getting easier to deal with than they had been, and with each passing day my strange new world was starting to feel more normal, more natural. Surely I could manage a phone call. In fact, I could manage a few. I needed to call my parents and talk to them personally, instead of through Claude.</p><p>\u201cEvidence,\u201d I muttered. It was strange. Words felt different coming out of my mouth as a vampire. As if everything had a taste. I turned back to the ocean. \u201cI will get used to this, right?\u201d</p><p>He pulled me close, his hard chest against my back, and his arms cradling me. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the evidence saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to talk about this now?\u201d he murmured, mouth close to my ear, his face pressed against my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still an investigator. Or I will be, once I get a handle on this new B.S.\u201d Like my new overwhelming desire for blood. Shit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. I couldn\u2019t get freaked out.

But it didn\u2019t allow for torture, it was to control them. Get them to do things at key times. Others he had blackmail material on, and I\u2019m sure he had a couple of otherworlder leaders he was going to bribe. He had planned to take over his father\u2019s territory. And given Nic\u2019s narcissism and his stash of power, I\u2019m sure that was just the first step.\u201d</p><p>It was as I\u2019d thought, as I\u2019d lain there on the floor, waiting to die. \u201cI wonder why he marked my brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeveral of the vamps were marked. Just enough to ensure that Nic had some loyal to him when the coup came. Crazy though. The amount of power he would have had to harness to be able to control that many people would have been tremendous. I don\u2019t know if he planned on only activating the brand on one or two at a time when he needed them, or if he planned something really horrible to drum up enough power to be able to control more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything on the shaman who helped him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet. But with the resources the OWEA and Chicago PD are putting behind this, they\u2019ll find him.\u201d He took a haggard breath. \u201cI\u2019m still shocked that Luc knew\u2014really knew. That he was sending me away as much as he could to try to bring Nic to heel. But all he did was give Nic more opportunity to build his resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved his son.\u201d And the whole family was off their rockers. But I didn\u2019t say that. Out of respect for Claude. And out of a weird understanding for Luc. Even given everything he\u2019d done\u2014and perhaps more important, the things he hadn\u2019t\u2014the man hadn\u2019t wanted to see people hurt.</p><p>\u201cHe was desperate. And selfish,\u201d Claude said.</p> <p>Truth. Not the whole of it, but it was true enough.</p><p>Claude nuzzled my neck. \u201cLet\u2019s talk of more pleasant things.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling again. I was doing a lot of that lately\u2014smiling. Far too much for a person who had been near death a week ago, and who was still nursing wounds from the experience. But maybe that was the trick. The threat of everything being taken away gave me a new appreciation for it all.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. That was fine by me. There was an \u201cus\u201d now. And it was something we could have for a very long time. Forever.</p>  </body></html>"]
