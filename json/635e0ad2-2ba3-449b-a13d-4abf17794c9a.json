A girl who can\u2019t be more than nine or ten and who is even now cradling her cheek with her hand.</p><p>I look around, but there are no adults in the vicinity, and Heather knows it. Her leer gets even wider as she leans down into the younger girl\u2019s face, intent on doing even more damage than a handprint on a cheek.</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes to send me rocketing up from my towel and down the beach toward them, my heels flipping sand in the air as I run. I reach them just in time to see Heather snatch some money from the girl\u2019s small hand.</p><p>A tear slips down the girl\u2019s cheek, which causes Heather to grin. \u201cGo cry to your mommy, little girl,\u201d she sneers, in the ugly way only a middle-school bully can.</p><p>The sheer sight of it makes me see red and I forget all logic as I rush toward the pair. I forget that Heather has tormented me every day of every summer and I forget that I can\u2019t be any older than the skinny girl in the red swimsuit.</p> <p>In this moment, it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Heather?\u201d I demand as I skid to a stop in front of them. The other girl, the skinny one, sucks in her breath at my bad language. It\u2019s a groundable offense, but my Gran is all the way down the beach, sitting in the shade. \u201cGive her the money back.\u201d</p><p>Heather stares down at me and sweat glistens on her plump chin. \u201cOr what, shrimp? What will you do if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I lift my chin and look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell everyone, including your friends, what you were doing with Jamie Rawlins under the pier a while back. I saw you. I saw what you did. And if you don\u2019t give her the money back, I\u2019ll tell everyone.\u201d</p><p>Heather\u2019s eyes widen, then narrow. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I nod, calmer now than I probably should be. \u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>Heather looks out over the lake and thinks about it for a minute before she tosses the crumpled up bills at my feet.</p><p>\u201cI hope it was worth it,\u201d she tells me hotly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m going to make your life hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I sniff, trying to appear unconcerned. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t try already.\u201d</p><p>Heather glares at me and walks off, and I bend to pick up the money, handing it to the skinny girl. I smile at her.</p><p>\u201cHere you go. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s so mean. I think someone pees in her cornflakes every day.\u201d</p><p>The girl seems speechless and she stares at me for a minute with wide blue eyes before shyly handing me a white shell.</p><p>\u201cThank you for getting my ice cream money back,\u201d she says so softly that I have to strain to hear her. \u201cI collect these. The big nice ones are hard to find in the lake.\u201d</p> <p>I smile again. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s hard to find them. Thank you! I\u2019m going to swim out to the buoy line. Wanna come?\u201d</p><p>The girl stares out at the battered line of buoys that bob up and down in the current a hundred yards out. She looks a little uncertain, a little scared.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she finally answers. \u201cMy mom would kill me. The current\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>I nod as if I understand what it\u2019s like to have a mother that cares. My own doesn\u2019t even know that I can swim.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I tell the girl. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>She watches me as I jog back and drop the shell on my towel before I dive into the current, swimming over and under the frigid waves like a seal. When I finally reach the buoys, I grab onto one, clinging tightly as it bobs, while I push my hair out of my face with cold fingers.</p><p>Glancing back toward the beach, I hunt for the girl in the red swimsuit, but I don\u2019t see her anywhere. She\u2019s gone, and I realize something.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even ask her name.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Dominic</p><p>Now</p><p>I like to watch.</p><p>I know that I shouldn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t really give a shit. I like the flash of skin, the sweaty limbs, the sex smells, the fucking...</p><p>Watching makes me feel something. It\u2019s one of the only things that does.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change, Dominic,\u201d Kira murmurs as her hand splays across my open shirt, her long brown hair moving in the breeze, tickling my chest as she watches with me. \u201cYou\u2019re just the same... a freak. I love that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer because she\u2019s right. I\u2019m a fucking freak. She knows it and I know it, and neither of us care. If anything, Kira likes it. She must, because she\u2019s stuck by me for a long time. She knows me better than anyone... and she definitely knows what I like.</p><p>Even though she\u2019s beautiful and familiar, I ignore her fingers as they trace across my skin, graze the tips of my nipples, and trail down to my crotch. My dick is resistant to her touch tonight and remains soft inside my pants. Not because she\u2019s not hot or sexy, because she is.</p><p>But because familiar and normal don\u2019t stir my blood. I\u2019ve seen pretty much everything once and have done it twice. Normal doesn\u2019t do it for me anymore.</p><p>Forbidden things are what lift my dick. Dark things, bad things.</p><p>I stare down from the balcony, looking past the shimmering pool below, past the rippling water that sheds blue light on everything around it, at the images that waver in the night. The images of two people fucking.</p><p>Knowing that I shouldn\u2019t watch is what excites me about it, and so I don\u2019t take my eyes from the couple having sex next to my brother\u2019s pool.</p><p>I take another drink of whiskey, letting the fiery liquid sit in my mouth before I swallow it, letting it curl its fingers around my stomach, warming my gut.</p><p>Watching the couple, I lean against the railing, half-hidden by the shadows, enveloped by the night. It\u2019s just how I like it.</p><p>In front of me, the scene turns rough.</p><p>And my dick turns hard.</p><p>The girl\u2019s teeth sink into the guy\u2019s neck, then she whispers something unintelligible into his ear, words that hiss as she drags her teeth across his skin. Hard, aggressive, rough. I can see the red trail of pain she leaves behind from here.</p><p>\u201cDid she just bite him?\u201d Kira asks in amusement, her hand frozen at my waistband.</p><p>I nod. She did. And it made me hard as a rock. I love watching pain. It distracts me from my own.</p><p>The guy smiles, liking it too. He lifts her legs onto his shoulders as he thrusts into her. Hard. Then he frees one hand to grab her neck. Hard. His fingers dig into the delicate skin there, cutting into the flesh, leaving red marks that just might turn purple by morning.</p><p>But she likes it.</p><p>I can tell by the way she scratches his back and moans for more. I can tell by the way she draws him even further into herself, bucking her hips to take him even deeper. I can tell by the way she doesn\u2019t even try to take his hand away from her throat.</p><p>It always fascinates me when I see women that like getting debased, the ones who like it rough, the ones who want to be dominated or humiliated.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t make any sense, but I see it all the time, more and more, especially here at my brother\u2019s place at one of his endless parties. Around his pool, in his hot tub, on his lawn. People seem to lose their inhibitions when they pass through these gates, which doesn\u2019t make any sense, either. Most of them don\u2019t know him, not really. But it doesn\u2019t stop them from making themselves very at home here.</p><p>Suffice it to say I\u2019m always entertained when I come to visit.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know we\u2019re watching?\u201d Kira leans up on her tiptoes, murmuring with hot breath into my ear as she strokes my balls.</p><p>I glance back down at the couple, watching the guy\u2019s face contort and twist, and watching the girl moan and writhe beneath him. They have no clue we\u2019re here, but I have a feeling they wouldn\u2019t care even if they did.</p><p>\u201cI think that girl served me champagne earlier!\u201d Kira exclaims, leaning closer to look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I answer, staring at the girl\u2019s skimpy server\u2019s uniform. I briefly wonder where her boss thinks she is. Surely he has no idea that she\u2019s fucking a party guest next to the pool.</p><p>But that\u2019s not my problem.</p><p>The bulge between my legs is my problem now. It\u2019s grown thicker and heavier and I shift, easing the pressure of my jeans away from my dick. I brush my hand against the denim covering my crotch, stroking myself. Just a little. Quickly and efficiently.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to get off right out here in the open. Because of how I make my living, I\u2019ve learned not to do anything out in the open. The press would have a fucking field day if pictures of me jacking off leaked out.</p><p>Kira takes care of the situation for me, just as she always does when I\u2019m in town. She pushes me backward into the shadows, where she steps out of her shorts in front of me. She\u2019s not wearing underwear.</p><p>She\u2019s right. Some things never change.</p><p>\u201cFuck me with your hand while you watch them,\u201d she instructs me softly, her green eyes gleaming. \u201cDo it, Dom. And then I\u2019ll let you come on my face, the way you like to.\u201d</p><p>I reach for her. She stands limply in front of me, her head resting on my shoulder as I slide two of my fingers in and out of her. I know exactly where to touch her. She sucks in a breath and I have to smile. I know every inch of her. There are some things to be said for familiarity.</p><p>She\u2019s soaking wet, as though she\u2019s been waiting for this since I\u2019d seen her last. She hasn\u2019t, of course. Kira and I have an arrangement of convenience. It\u2019s convenient because we know each other, we trust each other. And there are no feelings involved. She and I are the same in that way.</p><p>I can hear the girl by the pool moaning loudly and it makes my fingers move faster, working Kira harder, in time to the guy\u2019s sweaty thrusts. Kira moans with the girl by the pool and I close my eyes, listening to the fucking sounds. With my hand buried in Kira\u2019s crotch, the sounds are all I need now.</p><p>If I were decent, I\u2019d back away from the balcony and give the couple some privacy and I\u2019d give Kira more coverage from the shadows... just in case someone happens upon us.</p><p>But fuck that. I\u2019m not decent. Not anymore.</p><p>After a few more minutes of rough fucking, the guy pulls out of the waitress and grasps her hard, yanking her off the chaise and forcing her down in front of him, onto her knees. I can see her skin graze the bricks, just as I can read his lips.</p><p>Suck me.</p><p>I pause as the girl shakes her head, trying to scramble away, but he holds her fast by her hair, making her take him into her mouth. Making her suck her own taste off of him.</p><p>She\u2019s definitely not into it now. She swings her arms at him frantically, but he holds her hair tightly, wrapping it around his hands, refusing to let her go.</p><p>I watch the fear wash over her face and my gut tightens in reaction.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Kira lifts her head as my hand stills. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are glazed as she stares at me. I nod toward the pool, at the struggle going on down there, at the girl trying desperately to get away from the asshole\u2019s grip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d Kira sighs. \u201cIgnore it, Dom. It\u2019s not your problem. We\u2019re not done here.\u201d</p><p>I sigh too, because I know I can\u2019t ignore it.</p><p>This has been happening way too much. People come here and get wasted and out of control. It\u2019s not worth the trouble, but Sin keeps having the parties anyway. He says it keeps him relevant, whatever the fuck that means. I don\u2019t seem to have a problem with being relevant, and I don\u2019t host a single party.</p><p>I shake Kira\u2019s grip off of my wrist, gulp down the rest of my drink, and head down the stairs, ignoring her calls of protest.</p> <p>It takes a minute to weave discreetly through the masses of people scattered through the house and to make my way across the lawn and onto the stones leading to the pool. But I reach the couple within two minutes, and without even pausing I grab the guy from behind, ripping him backward. He hisses as the girl\u2019s teeth scrape his dick.</p><p>It serves him right. The fucker interrupted me.</p><p>He yelps and I toss him on the ground, watching in satisfaction as he scrapes his face on the stone bricks before he rolls into the lawn.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d I snap at him. \u201cNo one gets forced against their will here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bitch wanted it,\u201d he protests as he climbs to his feet. \u201cShe was asking for it.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cThe last time I checked, no means no. It\u2019s not a new way of asking for it. Get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>The guy looks at me again, recognizes who I am, and then stalks away without another word. I grab a pool towel and wrap it around the girl\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Her skimpy uniform, which was barely there in the first place, is hanging around her waist now, apparently ripped in their scuffle. She seems self-conscious, but honestly, I barely notice. She\u2019s young and has perky tits, but so do thousands of other women. She doesn\u2019t do much for me. Mostly because I know she\u2019d offer herself on a platter if I wanted her to. I briefly consider inviting her to join Kira and me, but don\u2019t. She\u2019s drunk, and even if she\u2019s too drunk to remember it, she\u2019s just been almost violated.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask gruffly. She nods, sniveling, just as another girl, a gorgeous blonde in a matching uniform, rushes up.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Kaylie. What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>The blonde is obviously alarmed, concerned, and while Kaylie explains about the asshole, I turn to disappear back into the shadows. Regardless of my profession, I try to stay out of the spotlight when the cameras aren\u2019t rolling. Unfortunately, I only make it partway before Kaylie grabs my arm, then wraps herself around my waist.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she tells me shakily, her arms like thin bands, not giving me room to even squirm. I stare down at her, looking past her tear-smeared eyeliner to look into her panicky eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. But you need to stay out of situations like that. There won\u2019t always be someone to step in and save you.\u201d</p><p>From her shocked expression, I decide that I might\u2019ve been a little too hard on her. But shit. Women have to be more careful. She can\u2019t parade around in barely any clothes, have rough sex with a stranger, and just expect him to be a gentleman. Men, by and large, aren\u2019t gentlemen. We\u2019re assholes.</p><p>Kaylie stares at me, too drunk or high to even respond. But her friend isn\u2019t so silent.</p><p>Big brown eyes snap at me angrily. \u201cWhy are you lecturing her? She was just assaulted, in case you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you call it? She was having rough sex with that asshole right out in the open. When she was supposed to be working, I might add. It looked to me like it was an incident that just got out of control. I stopped it for her. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Gorgeous Blonde stares at me dumbfounded. \u201cAre you trying to insinuate that she\u2019s not a victim, that it was her fault this happened?\u201d</p> <p>I sigh. \u201cOf course not. I\u2019m saying that she shouldn\u2019t have been encouraging a drunk stranger to be rough with her in the first place. Good night.\u201d</p><p>I start to walk away, but apparently she\u2019s not done.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck do you think you are?\u201d she demands. \u201cYou might not have heard, but you really shouldn\u2019t blame the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blaming\u2014\u201d I begin, but I\u2019m interrupted by her gasp as I step fully into the light and she sees my face.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d She breathes. \u201cYou\u2019re Dominic fucking Kinkaide.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile, just a little, just enough to pull the corners of my mouth up. \u201cDominic will do. I tend to drop the \u2018fucking.\u2019 Unless of course, I\u2019m actually fucking.\u201d</p><p>She smiles a breathtaking smile that should affect me. The girl is stacked, has legs that go on for miles, and she\u2019s wearing next to nothing. She should affect me. But she doesn\u2019t. Because nothing affects me anymore. I\u2019m jaded as fuck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re trouble,\u201d she announces matter-of-factly, eyeing me up and down with a slow gaze and fire in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky, because I happen to like trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you do,\u201d I answer back, trying to ignore the way she\u2019s acting now that she knows who I am. They all act like this. Every one of them. It gets monotonous. Just once, can\u2019t someone surprise me? \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and walk back toward the house, but she takes two steps and grabs my arm. I pause.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d she says hesitantly, a bit unsure now. \u201cYou didn\u2019t meet me. My name\u2019s Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cYour name doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>I keep walking, ignoring the way she sucks her breath in, the way she calls after me in agitation, the way she gives up and stops in defeat.</p><p>I might be an asshole, but I don\u2019t lie.</p><p>Her name doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Not to me.</p><p>I leave the entire situation behind, out of my sight and out of my mind. Within a few minutes, I\u2019m standing in front of Kira again.</p><p>\u201cAll taken care of?\u201d she purrs, reaching for me. I nod, burying my face between her heavy, naked tits as she unbuckles my belt. \u201cBind my hands with this, and come on my face.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to ask me twice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dirty girl,\u201d I whisper in her ear as I push her onto the couch and bind her hands above her head, just tight enough for the leather to bite into her flesh. Just the way she likes it.</p><p>And then I grasp my dick in my hand and fuck my fist, just the way I like it.</p><p>For just a second, for some strange reason, the blonde chick\u2019s face pops into my mind, her eyes wide and brown. I have no idea why, but I shake my head to clear it. I focus instead on the matter at hand.</p><p>Within another two minutes, I come on Kira\u2019s face, spurting in a cream-colored arc that spatters onto her tanned skin. She licks a drop from her lips and grins at me.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d I shake my head as I pull my jeans back on and collapse next to her. She rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s what we are. You always come back to me, Dom. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I unbind the belt wordlessly, tossing it onto the floor. I might always come back to her whenever I come home, but I don\u2019t fuck her. Not really. I haven\u2019t actually fucked someone in years.</p><p>\u201cLover would indicate that I bury my dick in your sweet pussy.\u201d I glance at her, then reach out to run my finger over the swell of one of her tits, then trail it downward to her crotch. She arches toward my touch. \u201cAnd you know I won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand away abruptly and Kira scowls. \u201cYeah, I know that. What I don\u2019t know is why. Dominic, you\u2019ve got needs too. Watching other people fuck or jacking off and coming on my face can\u2019t be enough. Sex isn\u2019t just sex, Dom. You need all the good stuff that comes along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, do I?\u201d I ask, amused now. \u201cLike what? Like having women get attached and hoping that I\u2019ll marry them? Or worrying that I\u2019ll get some fucking disease or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop.\u201d Kira interrupts me with a glare. \u201cI know you, Dom. I know why you do what you do. You don\u2019t want to get close to someone again. You don\u2019t want to give anyone that kind of power over you. But Dom... it\u2019s time. It\u2019s time for you to finally get over her and come back to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, don\u2019t talk about her.\u201d I instruct Kira icily, staring at her hard. \u201cYou know better than that. And two, are you insinuating that I\u2019m not living?\u201d</p><p>Kira sighs as she pulls her shirt on, forgoing her bra. She stuffs it into her purse and glances up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well what I\u2019m insinuating. You\u2019ve been a shell for six years, Dom. Six fucking years. That\u2019s a long time. I\u2019ve been patient. I\u2019ve done everything you needed. But there comes a time when a girl needs to be fucked. I\u2019ve got needs, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>I have to chuckle now at the idea that I\u2019m the only one Kira\u2019s depending on for her \u201cneeds.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. Because you don\u2019t have anyone else to fulfill your needs when I\u2019m not here?\u201d</p><p>She glares at me. \u201cYou\u2019re a dick sometimes. I\u2019ve got to work early in the morning, so I\u2019ve gotta go. Call me tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod even though I know I won\u2019t. I bury my face into the couch cushions, realizing I\u2019m suddenly exhausted and just want to sleep. I don\u2019t even hear Kira leave. But I do hear when someone else comes in a few minutes later, right when I\u2019m ready to slip into sleep.</p><p>\u201cDom, what the fuck? You were supposed to pull me out of the game so that I didn\u2019t lose my shirt.\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly open one eye to stare at my brother and find that he actually lost his shirt. He\u2019s standing in front of me bare-chested. My eyes dip down and I cringe.</p><p>He lost his pants, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Sin? Put some fucking clothes on.\u201d</p><p>My brother grins\u2014that cocky, rakish grin that his fans love so much\u2014as he plops himself down onto the sofa next to me, buck-ass naked, crossing his feet at the ankle on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it if you\u2019d pulled me out of the poker game like I asked you to.\u201d He shrugs, picking up my glass of whiskey and drinking it all. \u201cThose drunk chicks know how to play poker. Or I just wanted to take my clothes off. One or the other.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bail you out because I was taking care of a situation for you. Fuck, man. You\u2019ve got to stop having these parties. Someone\u2019s gonna get raped or killed and they\u2019re going to sue the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>Sin only grins, unconcerned. \u201cIf they\u2019re dead, they can\u2019t sue me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t argue with that logic. Instead, I tell him what he missed, not that it bothers him much. He sees it all the time.</p><p>\u201cThanks for fixing it,\u201d he tells me casually, as though near-rapes are normal. I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Now can you get some fucking clothes on?\u201d</p><p>He waggles his dark eyebrows. \u201cSure. If it makes you insecure to look at my package. Not only am I older, but I\u2019m also bigger, and that\u2019s what counts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s also ridiculous. He\u2019s not a centimeter bigger than I am, but I don\u2019t waste my breath telling him that.</p><p>He yanks one of my shirts out of my suitcase and pulls it over his head. Then a pair of my pants. He forgoes underwear, which means I\u2019ll have to burn those jeans.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to ask how long you\u2019re staying,\u201d he asks as he settles back into the seat, unconcerned that he just ruined my favorite jeans. \u201cLong enough to catch a show, I hope. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard about for months from Duncan... how you don\u2019t even come watch your poor little brothers play.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cPoor little brothers? I think both of you are doing just fine.\u201d</p> <p>Sin snorts. \u201cOnly as well as you, big bro. But whatever. We have a show coming up in Chicago next month. If you want to fly back in, we\u2019ll get you backstage passes.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ll try. Filming starts in a couple of weeks. But I\u2019ll see what I can do. I don\u2019t want to upset baby Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>My youngest brother saunters into my room, dropping onto the sofa next to Sin. Neither of them have any personal space issues, that\u2019s for sure, because now we\u2019re all three crammed onto the one sofa. And we\u2019re too big for that shit.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I assure Duncan. \u201cI just said I didn\u2019t want to offend your ovaries by not coming to your next show. I\u2019ll try like hell to be there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the furthest thing from my mind right now,\u201d Duncan announces, cracking open the can of beer in his hand. \u201cYou can see me bang on the drums any time. What I\u2019d like to bang tonight are the half-naked women beyond these very doors. I fucking love your house, man,\u201d he tells Sin. \u201cOh, and there\u2019s a chick asking for you. Said she wants to make sure you know that your brother rescued her. Or some shit.\u201d</p><p>Sin rolls his eyes, but I elbow him. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the girl from the pool. You\u2019d better talk to her and autograph her tits or something. You need to keep her happy so that she doesn\u2019t think to call the police. You don\u2019t want that kind of press, dude. Not after Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>The mere mention of how the tabloids had ripped Sin\u2019s band up over a wild party in Amsterdam a month ago is enough to sober the two of them up. There had been some underage girls there, groupies who had lied about their age, and if it weren\u2019t for the more lax laws in Europe, my brothers would\u2019ve been screwed.</p><p>Sin nods now.</p><p>\u201cFine. Take me to her,\u201d he tells Duncan. To me, he hands the bottle of whiskey and says, \u201cDo you ever get tired of being right? Jesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I tell him as I gulp down a few swigs, then slide down into the sofa again, closing my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a burden though.\u201d</p> <p>My brothers chuckle as they walk out and I relax, enjoying the way the whiskey has loosened my muscles, the way the warmth has spread to every bit of me. It helps me stay numb... and numbness is a welcome fucking thing.</p><p>When I\u2019m numb, I feel safe enough to slip my hand into my pocket. Not for my dick, although that\u2019s normal for me, too. No, I wrap my fingers around the cool stone of the pendant that is always there, encased in a white shell and resting against my leg.</p><p>The last thing that fills my mind before I sleep is a color.</p><p>Aquamarine.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>When I open my eyes, almost two hours have passed. I know this by the fuzzy green light of the clock. I\u2019m a little disoriented as I sit up and look around at furnishings that aren\u2019t mine, until I remember that I\u2019m not home. I\u2019m at my brother\u2019s house for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sunshine.\u201d A soft voice startles me.</p><p>Snapping my head around, I find the gorgeous blonde with the strange name from the pool.</p> <p>Jacey</p><p>She\u2019s sitting in the darkness now, scrolling through her phone. Has she been watching me sleep? Or was she just too polite to wake me up?</p><p>Either way, I fight back a growl that my privacy has been invaded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s perched on the side of the bed, watching me. She\u2019s even hotter than I remember her being: long legs, full tits, tiny waist. I usually prefer taller women, but this girl is perfectly proportioned... and there\u2019s something excruciatingly sexy about her. Something about her just screams fuck me.</p><p>She shrugs now, unconcerned with my agitation, her long blond hair falling over the side of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYour brother sent me up. My friend Kaylie is going to be staying the night here, apparently. With him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>Is this supposed to shock me? This shit happens all the time with Sin. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about sloppy seconds. He says that\u2019s what condoms were made for. Fucking rock stars. They\u2019ll fuck anything that isn\u2019t nailed down.</p><p>Jacey stares at me, unabashed and definitely not intimidated, her eyes flashing in the dark.</p><p>\u201cAnd she was my ride. Your brother said you\u2019d be happy to drive me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he did, did he?\u201d Annoyance wells up in me and I glance at the clock. Two fucking A.M.</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah. He said that he lets you take up garage space here to store your car, so the least you could do is drive it for him once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you to say that, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods again. \u201cYeah. He said he would rather you take me than call me a cab. He doesn\u2019t want some random cabbie tweeting about the party.\u201d</p><p>As much as I hate to admit it, that\u2019s pretty smart. Everyone around here loves to hear news about Sin Kinkaide, and he tries hard to keep his parties secret. Or, at least, the nature of his parties. I sigh. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I tell her tiredly. \u201cI\u2019ll take you. Give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d she tells me graciously, leaning back against the silk bed cushions. I can\u2019t help but appreciate her tiny uniform. It\u2019s barely more than a swimsuit, and her tits peek out of the top. I look away, not letting her see that I appreciate her tight body.</p><p>Girls like her... they can sense the slightest bit of interest and they latch on like piranhas. I\u2019ve seen it a hundred times before. Never mind the fact that she\u2019s trying to act uninterested now, unimpressed with who I am. She\u2019s just pissed that I shut her down earlier.</p><p>I walk into the bathroom, splashing my face with cold water before I head back out and grab my keys from the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She follows me down through the thumping music and the people, the ones dancing and the ones fucking in dark corners. Seriously. Sin\u2019s parties get out of control. I\u2019m eternally glad that I don\u2019t live his life, with people flooding my house day and night.</p><p>The entire world might know my face, but I\u2019m actually a very private person. Every time I come here, I\u2019m always ready to go home by the end of the weekend. It might be entertaining, but trying to avoid all the people who want to interact with me is exhausting.</p><p>I lead her past the seven stalls in his garage, to where my charcoal-gray 911 takes up one of the slots. It\u2019s my Chicago car. I keep it here so that I have something to drive whenever I come home, something I can take out on the track and race when I get bored. I have one just like it at my house in California, because what\u2019s better than one Porsche? Two.</p><p>Jacey takes in the car, her dark eyes widening in appreciation, but she doesn\u2019t say a word. She simply slides inside, and as she does, I notice that she\u2019s definitely wearing panties. I see a glimpse of red satin through the cuff of her short shorts as she crosses her legs. I smirk, because she doesn\u2019t know it, but I fucking love red satin on a woman.</p><p>She fastens her seatbelt, curling up in the seat like she was born there, oblivious to my approval of her underwear choice.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d I ask instead as the boxer engine roars to life in the way only a Porsche\u2019s can.</p><p>\u201cDown by Eighty-Seventh Street,\u201d she answers, staring out the window as we roll down my brother\u2019s driveway past the manicured lawns.</p><p>\u201cCalumet Heights?\u201d I ask, picturing the older Chicago neighborhood in my head. She nods.</p><p>\u201cWow, you still remember your hometown. Impressive.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, not sure if she\u2019s being sarcastic or not. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget where I came from.\u201d</p><p>The car\u2019s engine purrs as we make our way toward the gates, and casually I glance to the side, expecting to see the green lawns, trees, and shadows of my brother\u2019s estate. But something else is there, and I freeze, my hands tightening on the wheel as I slam on the brakes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Jacey sputters in confusion as her body jerks forward. But I\u2019m already out of the car and striding toward the two people sitting on the bench to our left.</p><p>My sister Fiona and my one-time best friend, Cris fucking Evans, look up at me in surprise from the dark. Her arms are wrapped around his neck. His tongue was down her throat thirty seconds ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Cris manages to say before I yank him off the bench and throw him to the ground. \u201cWhat the fuck, Dominic?\u201d he barks out, scrambling to get to his feet and balance on his lanky-ass legs, poised to lunge at me if he has to.</p><p>I smile grimly and glance at Fiona. \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Fi? Tell me it\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>My sister sighs and calmly stands up, approaching me carefully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably what it looks like. Cris and I are dating, Dom. I wanted to tell you, but with things the way they are between you... well, I was scared about how you would react.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the ice water that seems to pump through my heart.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d I answer calmly. \u201cOf course you are. Because obviously you wanted to find the biggest douche on the planet and date him. If that\u2019s the case, you did a stellar job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDom.\u201d Fiona sighs again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did to you, but six years is a long fucking time to carry a grudge. You need to get over it and move on. I love him, and you\u2019re going to have to live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... what?\u201d The words feel like wood on my tongue, dry and heavy. I can\u2019t even believe what I just heard.</p><p>Fiona stares at me, her green eyes assessing me carefully. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>I hear Cris breathing in front of me and see Jacey standing on the perimeter, but everything fades instantly away but this: Cris and Fiona. Together.</p><p>The idea that my baby sister would stab me in the heart like this is unfathomable.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do this?\u201d I demand of her. \u201cYou know how I feel about him, Fiona. Does the phrase \u2018blood is thicker than water\u2019 mean anything to you? You\u2019re way better than he is, and he doesn\u2019t deserve you. He\u2019s too fucking old for you anyway. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a brief pause while Fiona slides her hands to her hips, then she erupts.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d my baby sister snaps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get over yourself. He was your best friend, Dom. Someone who I grew up with too. And for all these years, you\u2019ve expected all of us to just take your word for it that he\u2019s some sort of monster without telling us why. If you want us to have your back, you have to trust us with a good reason. If what he did to you was so fucking bad, then you need to tell me what the fuck he did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallow hard, because the only way I can effectively warn her away from Cris is to tell her the truth. And I can\u2019t do that. The wound is that fucking deep, open, and raw. It\u2019s years old and it still stings as much as it ever did. I can barely even think about it, much less talk about it.</p><p>I take a deep breath, then another. As I do, I notice that Jacey has walked up and is hovering in the shadows, watching us uncertainly. I look away from her and back to my sister.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just trust me?\u201d I finally ask slowly. \u201cAs your big brother, can\u2019t you just fucking trust me?\u201d</p><p>Cris starts to say something, but I snarl at him. My sister holds out a hand toward him in caution before she looks back to me. She knows me well enough to know that talking to Cris is only going to set me off.</p> <p>\u201cDominic, I love you even though you\u2019re bullheaded. I do trust you. But we grew up with Cris, and I trust him too. I know this somehow must involve Emma. But Dom, she\u2019s gone. Whatever happened, it\u2019s not relevant anymore.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. The mere mention of Emma\u2019s name is a sucker punch to my gut and I want to bend over so that I can breathe. I also want to toss my sister over my shoulder and carry her away... far, far away from Cris.</p><p>Not relevant? Untrue. It will be relevant until the day I die.</p><p>Fiona stares at me, waiting for me to say something. But the words won\u2019t come.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell her all of the things that she ought to know. I can\u2019t force the ugly words out of my chest where they\u2019ve been hidden for so long. It\u2019s best to leave them buried. That\u2019s definitely one thing I\u2019ve learned in life.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Cris what he did?\u201d I ask bluntly, staring a hole into my ex-best friend\u2019s fucking forehead. \u201cJust ask. See if he\u2019ll tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>Cris opens his mouth, but Fiona shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this here, Dominic. We\u2019ll discuss it when we\u2019re calmer. And don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve asked before? He said if you want to talk about it, you will.\u201d</p><p>What a fucker.</p><p>Cris clears his throat and I stare at him, looking at him closely. He\u2019s been gone for years, away at college and then building up a business. But he looks the same as he ever did. Longish blond hair, blue eyes, lanky form. The years haven\u2019t hardened him like they\u2019ve hardened me, something else that pisses me off about him. He speaks now, hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cDom, we\u2019ve got to stop this. It\u2019s been years, years of blaming me for something that wasn\u2019t my fault. It\u2019s time to let it go.\u201d He drops his big, lanky-ass hands and stares at me, waiting for a reaction, and all I can do is stare at him incredulously.</p> <p>For a minute, I don\u2019t see the man in front of me, I don\u2019t even see the boy I grew up with... the boy I played little league with, made forts with, caught frogs with. I see a name.</p><p>His name.</p><p>Spoken from my dying girlfriend\u2019s lips. I wince as I remember how pale she was, how she was shaking and cold, how she could barely speak, but she still managed to say his name.</p><p>I glare at him, trying like hell to not wrap my hands around his pathetic neck and squeeze.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault? Really? Because the last thing she said was your name. Your. Name. Not mine. Not her mom\u2019s or her dad\u2019s. Yours. We both know why your name was the last thing on her lips. And you honestly have the balls to stand there and tell me that I have no right to be mad at you?\u201d</p><p>Cris looks at me, his expression pained, his eyes guarded. I hear Fiona gasp, but her hand clamps over her mouth and she doesn\u2019t make another sound. I\u2019m sure this is the first she\u2019s heard of any of this... of Emma\u2019s last words.</p><p>Cris steps toward me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. I said it wasn\u2019t my fault. I didn\u2019t say you didn\u2019t have a right to be mad. You do. You have the right to be pissed at the whole fucking situation. But it was a long time ago. And you don\u2019t know everything that happened. You wouldn\u2019t talk to me before I left and you\u2019ve never picked up the phone, so I can explain\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to start now,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about anything you have to say. And I don\u2019t give a fuck that it was a long time ago. It happened and I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dating Fiona,\u201d Cris says bluntly. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to try.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cFuck you. That\u2019s Fiona\u2019s choice, not mine. If there\u2019s one thing you should know about me, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t do anything that I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>I turn to leave, and he says, \u201cAnd you wonder why Emma did what she did?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I see red.</p><p>It billows in from the corners of my eyes like red fog filling my vision, and I lunge at Cris with a roar. I can\u2019t hear, I can\u2019t think. All I can do is move. Everything is just a blur of fists, swearing, and grunts.</p><p>I feel his hair in my fist and then my knuckles connect with his face, over and over; his jaw, his cheekbone, his eye. The next thing I\u2019m aware of is Jacey thrusting herself in the middle of us, catching me mid-punch. The side of my fist grazes her cheek and her hand flies to her face, cupping it. But she still struggles to get us apart.</p><p>Fiona rushes up to Cris, her fingers dabbing at his bleeding lip, her arms hugging him close.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Dom?\u201d she shrieks, her arm wrapped around Cris\u2019s shoulder as if she\u2019s shielding him from me. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking lunatic. Get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>I try to ignore the pain of the... the idea that not only would my sister date my worst enemy, but that she had the balls to bring him here, where she had to know I\u2019d be.</p><p>It\u2019s definitely a betrayal and it\u2019s something I would never do to her. I take a breath, ragged and raw, and stare at her, not wanting to say anything that I\u2019ll regret.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying here while I\u2019m in town, Fiona. You get the fuck out of here. And take that waste of space with you.\u201d</p><p>Fiona stares at me in hurt and rage and disbelief as she leads Cris away. Before we can get back to our car, red and blue lights burst to life around us. They flash against our faces, lighting us up against the night.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, someone called the cops.\u201d</p><p>Jacey inhales sharply and stares at me, one hand limp on my arm, the other holding her cheek. She\u2019s covered in blood now, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s mine or Cris\u2019s. Or maybe even her own. But I don\u2019t have time to find out.</p><p>Two cops are approaching us, and what comes next happens in a blur, both because of all the whiskey I\u2019ve been drinking and the fact that Cris clocked me hard in the temple.</p><p>How much have you been drinking?</p><p>Who started this fight?</p><p>Can I search your car?</p><p>Son, are these your drugs?</p><p>I glance up blearily now, to see one of them holding up a bag of weed. He blurs into three cops, then back into one as my vision comes in and out of focus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your son,\u201d I mumble. Jacey gasps and I hear her swearing that the drugs aren\u2019t hers, either, and that I\u2019m probably not thinking clearly right now, that I\u2019m not myself. I want to glare at her for making excuses for me, but I can\u2019t seem to control my facial muscles. I see her swat at a policeman when he grabs at her wrists, but it\u2019s the last thing I see. My chin drops to my chest and my gaze fixes on the ground.</p><p>Dew is forming on the grass. That\u2019s something I notice as they handcuff me and stuff me into the back of a cop car. I hear my sister\u2019s voice, frantic and pissed, but I can\u2019t understand her words. It\u2019s a bit too hard to stay conscious now, and I let my head fall back onto the seat of the cop car.</p><p>Flashes and bits of what just happened run through my head. Jacey\u2019s startled eyes, the way she jumped into the fray and tried to help... the way I clocked her in the face and she didn\u2019t back away.</p><p>He\u2019s not himself, she told the cop. I almost smile. Is that what she thinks?</p><p>I feel the blood from my knuckles drip onto the handcuffs and down my back and I think about Cris\u2019s words.</p><p>And you wonder why Emma did what she did?</p><p>Jesus. My stomach balls up into a knot, and I will my throat to stay open and my fucking lungs to keep working.</p><p>Emma.</p><p>The mere thought of her brings a million emotions\u2014that I can\u2019t name and can\u2019t process\u2014to the surface of my skin, where they crawl along, and then dig their claws into my heart. They stab it over and over until I can\u2019t feel anything at all.</p><p>This is what happened to me. This is why I\u2019m so empty.</p><p>So unable to feel jack shit.</p><p>Emma.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut, trying not to picture her, trying not to see her lips smiling at me back then or imagine what she must look like now... buried in the ground, rotting away into nothing.</p><p>Fuuuck. I can feel my airway close, tighter and tighter, and I lean my head back, taking slow breaths.</p><p>I don\u2019t wonder why Emma did what she did. I know why. It involves a whole lot of fucked-up ugliness that I can\u2019t think about without breaking out in a cold sweat. It\u2019s fucked up, but it\u2019s just the way I am.</p><p>Whether I like it or not, I am the way I am because of her. Because I loved her and because she did what she did.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Jacey</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>I close my eyes against the catcalls and lewd comments, although what the hell did I expect? I\u2019m sitting in a freaking jail cell dressed in nothing but a bowtie, a bustier, and boy-shorts. My ass cheeks are hanging out, for god\u2019s sake. And I\u2019m sitting right smack in the middle of a group of prostitutes.</p><p>Fun fact: they\u2019re all wearing more clothing than me.</p><p>Another fun fact: I\u2019m the only one here whose face is swollen and whose clothes are covered in blood. To them, I probably look like my dealer (or my pimp!) beat the shit out of me.</p><p>Resting my head against the cool wall behind me, I pretend that I\u2019m anywhere but here. I\u2019m at the beach, I\u2019m shopping on Michigan Avenue, I\u2019m getting a manicure.</p><p>But I\u2019m not. The cold concrete bench pressing into my thighs and the musty smell of this cell remind me of exactly where I am.</p><p>\u201cJacey Vincent! Time for your phone call!\u201d</p><p>Thank god.</p><p>A cop unlocks the door and I rush for it, thankful for a chance to get out of this cell.</p><p>He leads me back to the booking desk, where I\u2019d been fingerprinted earlier, back when the phone had been in use by someone else.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got two minutes,\u201d he tells me brusquely. His eyes skim over me and I can see what he thinks... that I\u2019m just another used-up whore like the girls in the cell.</p><p>It makes me want to throw up in my mouth. But I don\u2019t. Instead, with shaking fingers, I dial the only number I can think of. The first name that comes to mind when I need help nowadays.</p><p>Brand.</p><p>My childhood friend. My brother\u2019s best friend and business partner.</p><p>Since my brother Gabe married my best friend Maddy and they moved to Connecticut a couple of months ago, I don\u2019t have anyone else to call. But that\u2019s for the best. Both Gabe and Maddy would kick my ass for this anyway, although I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure that Brand won\u2019t either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Regardless, he\u2019s the only one I can trust to come get me out of this godforsaken shit-hole. Just like he was the only one I could trust to come pick me up off the freeway when I\u2019d had a flat tire a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>He answers groggily on the third ring. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrand?\u201d my voice quavers. I steel myself and swallow hard. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace?\u201d Brand\u2019s at attention now, his voice sharp. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>I glance around at the police station, at the yellowed walls, the stern cops, the criminals waiting to be booked. I squeeze my eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cYeah. No. Maybe. I was arrested. Can you come get me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a brief, loaded pause.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at the police station?\u201d Brand finally asks, and I have to give him credit. His voice is calm and even. \u201cWhat were you arrested for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossession of marijuana and assaulting a police officer.\u201d</p> <p>Brand\u2019s not calm now. He erupts into a storm of profanity.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d he finally demands. But before I can answer, the cop next to me taps my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got twenty seconds.\u201d</p><p>My heart speeds up. What if Brand won\u2019t come?</p><p>\u201cBrand, I\u2019ve only got twenty seconds. Can you please come get me? I don\u2019t have anyone else to call. They weren\u2019t my drugs. I\u2019ll explain when you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime,\u201d the cop says firmly, taking the phone from me and replacing it in the cradle. I stare at it, aghast.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming,\u201d I tell the cop limply.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a personal problem,\u201d he answers, gripping my elbow and guiding me back to the cell. Every fiber in my being fights against stepping back through the bars, but I\u2019ve got no choice.</p><p>The cop shoves me in and locks the door behind me.</p><p>I stand alone and dejected, and the women all erupt into howls and catcalls, and for a confused moment I think it\u2019s because of me, because I got thrown right back in here and they think that\u2019s funny.</p><p>But then I notice that they\u2019re all rushing to the bars, pressing their faces against the metal to get a good look at something.</p><p>I take the opportunity to grab a seat on one of the empty benches, but I do strain my neck to see what the hell has them crowing like banshees.</p><p>I quickly see that it\u2019s a who, not a what.</p><p>Specifically, it\u2019s Dominic fucking Kinkaide.</p> <p>Dominic will do. I tend to drop the \u201cfucking.\u201d Unless of course, I\u2019m actually fucking.</p><p>The memory of his husky voice causes my breath to speed up a little as I watch him being escorted down the hall through the cells.</p><p>Even with his face scraped up, he\u2019s sexy. His hands dangle freely at his sides, no handcuffs, so he\u2019s been bailed out. He pauses in front of my cell, standing in front of the bars, ignoring the frenzied women who are reaching out to him.</p><p>Dominic, will you sign my arm?</p><p>Dominic, can I kiss you?</p><p>Dominic, touch me, touch me.</p><p>\u201cJust a second,\u201d Dominic tells the cops. One nods and the other barks at the women, \u201cGet back!\u201d</p><p>Dominic steps to the bars, staring at me. Unbidden and unconsciously, I get to my feet.</p><p>His gaze is locked with mine, the arrogant green gaze that he\u2019s famous for.</p><p>He\u2019s going to help me. He\u2019s going to tell them that it\u2019s all a big misunderstanding, that the drugs were his after all, and he\u2019s going to get me out of here.</p><p>I smile in relief as I approach him.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t say anything. He just stares at my face, at the bruise that is forming on my cheek. He reaches through the bars and touches it lightly, his thumb just barely touching my skin.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d one of the cops says. \u201cNo touching.\u201d</p><p>Dominic pulls his hand back, letting it fall limply to the side.</p><p>The look on his face turns my stomach into knots... so vulnerable. So tired. So weary. World-weary.</p><p>Everything about him is striking, though. Those cut fucking cheekbones... god, in spite of everything, I want to reach out my finger and trace the edges of them. His chiseled jaw covered with the sexiest of stubble, the dark hair tousled in an I-don\u2019t-give-a-shit way. Unlike other wannabes, it actually seems like Dominic doesn\u2019t give a shit. About anything.</p><p>But most striking of all are those fucking green eyes, dark, dark, dark, but still somehow rimmed in golden hazel with interesting gold flecks in them. As his gaze stays locked with mine, it\u2019s like he\u2019s burning me, like I\u2019m on fire. And he\u2019s the only thing that can put me out.</p><p>I know it\u2019s stupid to say. But his gaze is that intense. It\u2019s like he can see inside of me, deep into my most private thoughts, into where my secrets lie. But then his shoulders drop and his face turns expressionless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says simply.</p><p>He looks away, like a camera lens shuttering closed. Like I don\u2019t even exist to him, like I\u2019m beneath him and not worth a second glance. The fire has been extinguished.</p><p>He nods at his escorts and they continue on, walking toward freedom while I\u2019m still stuck in here.</p><p>Because of him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I call out after them. \u201cJust a second. I don\u2019t belong here!\u201d But they ignore me and keep walking, and I shut the hell up because I\u2019m not going to beg.</p><p>Dominic fucking Kinkaide got us both arrested and then he gets bailed out within half an hour, just because he\u2019s a freaking celebrity. And he left me here to fucking rot.</p><p>I roll my eyes at his arrogance, at this situation, at my horrible luck. Life sucks so hard sometimes, and it gets suckier by the minute.</p><p>As I slump against the cement wall again, I ponder my rotten luck. And my poor decisions which lead to my rotten luck. That, of course, brings me to thoughts of something else, my poorest decision of them all.</p><p>My ex-boyfriend. Jared.</p><p>He\u2019d killed someone because of me and is currently in prison for vehicular manslaughter. I can\u2019t help but marvel at the irony that we\u2019re both cooped up in jail cells at this very moment.</p><p>I swallow hard at the thought. I\u2019m seriously in the same position as that little psychotic fuck. Oh. My. God.</p><p>After everything I\u2019ve done throughout the last couple of months to put him behind me... I\u2019ve gotten counseling, I make conscious decisions every day to not be reckless or wild (both things are fundamental building blocks of my nature), and yet here I am... in the same situation as he is.</p><p>Locked away.</p><p>I gulp. Maybe it\u2019s poetic justice. After all the trouble that he wreaked on my family and friends, maybe I deserve this. Maybe I\u2019ll never get away from it no matter how hard I try. I sigh and watch the clock on the wall outside of the bars ticking down the minutes.</p><p>Sixty worst-of-my-life minutes later, I finally hear the words I\u2019ve been waiting for, called loudly through the cells.</p><p>\u201cJacey Vincent. Your ride\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief, and I realize that I\u2019d honestly been worried that for the first time ever, maybe Brand wasn\u2019t going to come to my rescue. That maybe he\u2019d called Gabriel, and my brother had told him to let me stew for a while, to think about what I\u2019d done or some bullshit.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Thank god.</p><p>Once I see his face, though, after I\u2019ve walked past all the hookers and drunks, down the long tiled corridor flanked by jail cells, I\u2019m not sure that I should be thanking god for Brand\u2019s rescue. I should probably be praying for my soul, because Brand\u2019s furious, and from the look on his face it\u2019s a real possibility that he might kill me.</p><p>His enormous frame practically fills up the lobby where he\u2019s waiting, and I\u2019ve never seen him look quite as angry as he does right now. He\u2019s got to be at least 6\u20195\u201d and he\u2019s built like a brick house, with not an ounce of fat on him, and that makes him a very intimidating presence, particularly when he\u2019s pissed.</p><p>He served in the Army Rangers with my brother and he looks like he just stepped out of uniform, even though it\u2019s been almost two years now. He\u2019s let his blond hair grow, so now it\u2019s fashionably shaggy and grazes his collar line. If he didn\u2019t seem like a brother to me, I\u2019d say he was hot. The women in the reception area seem to agree. Every female eye in the place is glued on him. But his are glued on me.</p><p>His blue eyes are hard and glittering as he watches me approach.</p><p>He\u2019s pissed.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I tell him preemptively when I reach him. \u201cThey weren\u2019t my drugs.\u201d</p><p>His gaze is fixed on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks harshly. I nod, my fingers brushing across my cheek self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine... I tried to break up a fight, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brand cuts me off by grabbing my arm and dragging me toward the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I think? So I didn\u2019t just get called to the police station at four A.M. to bail your ass out? Then I get here and your face is swollen and you\u2019re dressed like a fucking prostitute. At the moment, I almost don\u2019t give a fuck what you did or didn\u2019t do, Jacey. You were supposed to quit Saffron. Gabriel\u2019s going to shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him,\u201d I plead as he holds the door open. And even though Brand\u2019s pissed, I can\u2019t help but notice that he\u2019s shielding my body with his, hiding me from the people in the lobby. As if that can somehow take away my shame for being here. Even still, it\u2019s a sweet gesture, especially since he\u2019s so mad.</p><p>Brand stares at me icily. \u201cYour brother\u2019s gonna know about this,\u201d he tells me firmly. \u201cJesus, Jacey. After everything that happened with Jared, and the therapy that you\u2019ve gone through already... We were starting to think that you were actually going to get your shit together. But now you\u2019re assaulting police officers. Christ. If that Kinkaide kid hadn\u2019t pulled some sort of strings, you\u2019d still be rotting in jail. They don\u2019t let people out who assault cops.\u201d</p><p>This stops me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cDominic got the charges dropped?\u201d I ask in shock. Why didn\u2019t he say anything when he stood there staring at me? All he said was... I\u2019m sorry. And what the fuck was he sorry for? Smacking me in the face? Getting me arrested? Leaving me to rot in jail?</p><p>Brand leads me to his truck and opens the door, purposely looking away from my ass as I climb in.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know how he did it, all I know is what they told me when I arrived. You\u2019re only facing possession of marijuana charges now. You\u2019re lucky. Well, lucky until Gabe hears about this. He\u2019s going to kick your ass. You\u2019re dressed like a hooker, you make tips by flirting with Saffron customers... you might as well be a stripper, for god\u2019s sake. Gabe\u2019s done everything he can think of to help you, Jacey. We don\u2019t even know what to do with you anymore.\u201d</p><p>He slams my door and I do feel guilty.</p><p>After everything went down in flames with Jared, Gabe paid for therapy for me. He and Maddy let me cry on their shoulders for hours and hours. They held my hand as I was taking baby steps to stand on my own two feet.</p><p>And since I lost my job working for Maddy when she sold her restaurant, they put down the deposit for my apartment in Chicago, with the understanding that I would find another part-time job to pay my bills while I finished school. Saffron wasn\u2019t exactly what they had in mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Brand swings into the truck, I turn to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that I\u2019m still at Saffron,\u201d I snap defensively. \u201cI tried to get a normal waitressing job. But I can\u2019t make enough money to pay my bills doing that while I\u2019m in school. Working at Saffron is no different than working at Hooters or someplace. All I have to do is flirt and serve champagne to rich people at private parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, rich men at private parties.\u201d Brand scowls as he jams his keys into the ignition. \u201cYou\u2019re only one step above a stripper, Jacey, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only got one class left,\u201d I tell him quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m taking it online. I\u2019ll have my business degree in just a few weeks. I\u2019m working on it, Brand. I\u2019m working on everything. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d As I turn to face Brand even more squarely, the smell of his aftershave floods over me. That familiar scent, symbolizing something warm and safe, someone warm and safe, makes me realize that I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m no longer in a Chicago jail.</p> <p>I\u2019m safe.</p><p>I\u2019m safe with Brand.</p><p>He\u2019s rather die than let anything hurt me.</p><p>Then why can\u2019t I stop the waterworks that suddenly overwhelm me?</p><p>There\u2019s no reason to cry now, but no matter how much I try to stop the tears, I can\u2019t. My sobs well up into a wail that erupts into a shoulder-shaking crying jag.</p> <p>As I cry inconsolably, I know that with every sob and every quaking breath I take, I\u2019m Brand\u2019s worst nightmare.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Jacey</p><p>Brand stares at me in horror.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Jace. Calm down. You\u2019re fine. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d He tries to soothe me as he awkwardly pats my back, his large hands thumping too hard on my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know you\u2019re trying. And you\u2019ve been doing a good job. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He keeps repeating himself, because he doesn\u2019t know what to say. A woman crying is his kryptonite. He has no idea how to handle it.</p> <p>I launch myself into his arms, burying my face into his shirt. I know I\u2019m getting snot on him, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just so happy to be here right now, in this truck with Brand. But more importantly, I\u2019m so happy to be out of jail. I hadn\u2019t realized until this very minute how scared I\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bailing me out.\u201d I sniff. \u201cI didn\u2019t really assault a police officer. It was a reflex... he went to grab me and I pushed his hand away. I didn\u2019t mean to. And the drugs weren\u2019t mine. They were in Dominic\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>Brand looks at me with sympathy as he steers us through the parking lot and out onto the dark street.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he instructs. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>So I do. I tell him all of it. How Kaylie almost got forced into a blow job, how Dominic Kinkaide, the fucking actor, had stopped it, but then he\u2019d turned right around and gotten into a fight which ended in both of us being arrested.</p><p>\u201cHe fucking flipped out on this guy,\u201d I tell Brand. \u201cAnd the other guy clocked him hard in the temple, so I don\u2019t know how he stayed standing up, but he still managed to kick the shit out of the dude. I jumped in to try and break it up and one of them accidentally smacked me.\u201d</p><p>One of them. It was Dominic. But I don\u2019t want to tell Brand that.</p><p>\u201cAnd then the cops came and they found pot in his car. He said it wasn\u2019t his and I know it wasn\u2019t mine, so they decided to arrest us both. The other guy, Cris, told the cops that he didn\u2019t want to press assault charges, so all Dominic had to do was admit the pot was his and they\u2019d probably have let us go. But he was an asshole about it. God.\u201d</p> <p>My head drops into my hands and Brand glances at me. \u201cHow do you know for sure it was his? Just because it wasn\u2019t yours doesn\u2019t mean it was his, you know.\u201d</p><p>I think about that for a second. I guess I hadn\u2019t actually seen Dominic with drugs. The cops had just found it on his back floorboard. But still.</p><p>\u201cIt was his car,\u201d I finally insist. \u201cIt had to be his. But whatever. All I know for sure is that it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have a chance to speak up about that when you appear for court,\u201d Brand tells me with a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>I nod and lean my head against the window.</p><p>We\u2019re quiet for a while before Brand speaks again.</p><p>\u201cSo you were actually in Sin Kinkaide\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>Even in the midst of all my drama, I can\u2019t help but smile at the reverence in Brand\u2019s voice. I happen to know that Devil\u2019s Own is one of his favorite bands. He plays them all the time when he\u2019s working out.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd Sin Kinkaide is pretty fucking awesome. He was so nice in person... way nicer than you\u2019d expect him to be.\u201d</p><p>Brand raises an eyebrow. \u201cUnlike Dominic?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, picturing Dominic\u2019s brooding stare and the way he flipped out on his old friend. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Celebrities aren\u2019t the same as us... they play by different rules. But he did save Kaylie\u2019s ass, so he can\u2019t be all bad.\u201d</p><p>Mentioning Kaylie reminds Brand of the matter at hand and he gets stern again.</p><p>\u201cNeither of you should be working there. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s good money. Maybe you could come work for Gabe and me as our assistant. We need another one since our last one quit. Working at Saffron puts you into bad situations. Look at you tonight! Jumping into a fight, Jacey? I can\u2019t even kick the shit out of someone for hurting you... because you did this to yourself. You know better than to get in the middle of a fight.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the floor, trying not to cry again. He\u2019s probably right. I\u2019m too gullible. I\u2019ve fallen for the wrong guys a hundred times and I\u2019m surprised by it every time. I\u2019m a horrible judge of character. I get myself into the worst situations because of my bad judgment. But all of these things are issues that I\u2019m working on. Because I think I\u2019m already doing the best I can, I don\u2019t even know what to say. Brand just doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d Brand demands grumpily.</p><p>I nod wearily. Being up all night, getting arrested, and listening to this endless lecture is taking its toll, and I can feel my shoulders droop more and more by the minute.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to work for you and Gabe,\u201d I tell him limply. \u201cI need to stand on my own. That\u2019s part of what I learned in therapy. Thank you for the offer, but I\u2019ve got to make my own way.\u201d</p><p>I steel myself for another lecture, but thankfully, the end is in sight. Brand pulls up to the curb in front of my house and sits there for a second, staring first at his big hands, then at me.</p><p>\u201cIt scared the fuck out of me, Jacey,\u201d he admits quietly. \u201cWhen you called and said you needed help, I mean. A hundred things went through my mind before you were able to tell me what was going on. Don\u2019t do that shit. When Gabe moved to Hartford, I promised him I would watch out for you, but you\u2019re making it difficult.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and I swallow hard, hating that I caused him worry. He levels another gaze at me, his blond eyebrows knitted together in consternation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he continues. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying, but try harder. You\u2019ve got to make smarter decisions. Please. Your brother, me, Madison... we\u2019ve all had enough drama to last us for a couple of lifetimes, okay?\u201d</p><p>The look on his face, serious and tired, makes my throat close up.</p><p>He has had enough drama to last for two lifetimes. He and Gabe both, back when they were still in the Rangers. They\u2019re fucking heroes and they don\u2019t deserve to worry even a minute about me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper as I scoot over and kiss him on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not being good enough. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t seem to pull things together. Thank you for coming to get me, Brand. And thank you for always being someone I can count on.\u201d</p><p>I get choked up now, because honestly, there are very few people I can actually count on. My dad\u2019s worthless, and my mom\u2019s a flake. Brand is a pillar of strength and he always has been.</p><p>I slip from the seat before I cry on his broad shoulder again as I remember how he\u2019s always been there for me. When I turn to close the door, Brand is looking at me, his blue eyes soft.</p><p>There\u2019s something there, something gentle, something different from the way he usually looks at me. It suddenly seems not-so-brotherly, and my stomach wavers. But then he covers it up.</p><p>\u201cJacey, you are good enough. That wasn\u2019t what I meant. All I meant was that you\u2019ve got to try harder to make better decisions. And you can always count on me. You know that. Call me when you get your court date. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>I nod and slam the door closed, watching his taillights until they disappear.</p><p>The look I\u2019d just seen in Brand\u2019s eyes bothers me. A lot. It\u2019s the same look I see in the eyes of every other man on the planet, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never seen in his before. Until now.</p><p>My heart sinks a little. I can\u2019t have Brand thinking about me in any other way other than sisterly.</p><p>I need him.</p><p>I need him to be the person that he is to me, the person he\u2019s always been, a brotherly figure. Someone I can count on. Because so few people in life have ever been that to me. And if anything changes with Brand and me, everything will change, and I can\u2019t deal with that on top of the rest of this mess.</p><p>With a sigh, I head up to my little bungalow, kicking off my shoes along the way.</p><p>I unlock the door to my tiny one-bedroom place and jump into the shower to wash away the feeling of the jail. I can\u2019t help but feel gross, like the feeling of the jail cell has burned into my skin and there\u2019s only one way to get it off. To scrub until my skin is bright pink and almost raw.</p><p>When I finally feel clean enough to towel off, I pull some underwear and a T-shirt on and collapse into bed to get a few hours of sleep.</p><p>The problem is, sleep doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>I was arrested tonight, for god\u2019s sake. Not only that, but I was arrested with one of the most famous actors on the planet. Dominic\u2019s smoldering green eyes refuse to stay out of my head, his expression taunting me.</p><p>It\u2019s like he saw me. He saw that someone died because of me. He saw that there\u2019s something so fundamentally wrong with me that my own parents don\u2019t want anything to do with me. That I\u2019m flawed.</p><p>He saw all of that. He looked into my eyes and saw it. And then he turned away and left me to rot in the jail cell alone.</p><p>He\u2019s a fucking asshole.</p><p>I might be a horrible judge of character, but even I can see that.</p><p>I toss and turn in my Egyptian cotton sheets. I\u2019m horrible with money, and I always seem to spend it on things I shouldn\u2019t. One of my splurges is always good sheets. But even they don\u2019t help me sleep tonight. Or this morning, I mean. I glance at the clock. Five thirty A.M.</p><p>I know Gabe\u2019s up. He usually gets up and goes for a run at five. Because he\u2019s just that into self-torture. I sigh and grab my phone, punching in his number. I might as well tell him and get it over with. It\u2019ll be better if he hears it from me instead of Brand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he answers quickly, only slightly out of breath and without bothering to say hello. He knows something\u2019s wrong if I\u2019m calling this early.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill me, okay?\u201d I ask. I hear him sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo promises,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>It all spills out and by the end, there\u2019s a long pause.</p> <p>\u201cJace, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re there and I\u2019m here,\u201d he finally says. \u201cOr I might kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sigh. \u201cBut seriously, Gabe. The drugs weren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d he tells me tiredly. \u201cYou\u2019re still at Saffron, and you always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. You\u2019ve got to pull your shit together. I don\u2019t know what else I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Brand said.\u201d I shake my head, even though Gabe can\u2019t see it. \u201cI\u2019m trying, Gabe. It seems like I take two steps forward and then one step back all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to keep moving forward.\u201d He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s quiet for a second. \u201cI can\u2019t come out there, not right now. Maddy\u2019s due in a couple months, work is insanely busy, and I\u2019m trying to get a lot done so I can take off for a bit when the baby\u2019s born. You\u2019re going to have to handle this on your own. I\u2019ll call around and get you a lawyer, but you\u2019re going to have to go see him on your own. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>I try not to get pissed. Of course I can handle it. I\u2019m not an imbecile.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cSurely it won\u2019t be that big a deal. It\u2019s my first offense. I\u2019ll get my own lawyer and everything will be fine because I didn\u2019t do it. It wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to the judge,\u201d Gabe mutters as he hangs up.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what I do six days later as I stand in front of a judge in a dingy Chicago courtroom for the first time in my life.</p><p>As Dominic Kinkaide sits behind me flanked by four lawyers compared to my one, I tell the judge everything, how I\u2019m certainly not guilty and how the pot wasn\u2019t mine. How I\u2019m floundering a bit, but I\u2019m definitely trying to pull my life together.</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t matter. I can see that in the judge\u2019s steely eyes as I try to plead my case. Nothing I say is gonna matter.</p><p>I\u2019m screwed.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Dominic</p><p>Well, this is new. I\u2019ve never been in a courtroom before.</p><p>That\u2019s not exactly true. I did sit in a seat like this when I was in the movie Annihilated. I played a sadistic serial killer/rapist, so I\u2019ve seen the inside of a courtroom. Just never in real life. I\u2019ve never sat and waited to be judged, waited for my fate to be decided by someone else.</p><p>Not for real.</p><p>It turns out, real life is fucking frustrating.</p> <p>I sigh heavily and turn to the lawyer closest to me. Like the three sitting around him, he\u2019s buttoned up in a white shirt and dark suit, wearing a shrewd, businesslike expression. My manager hired them, a whole team of legal sharks. If these guys can\u2019t get me out of this, no one can.</p><p>\u201cHow long is this going to take?\u201d I ask the head lawyer. Tom, I think his name is. He glances at me.</p><p>\u201cHowever long the judge wants it to take,\u201d he answers wryly. \u201cJust sit back and relax. You\u2019re going to be fine. You\u2019re lucky that Mr. Evans is refusing to press charges against you, or you\u2019d be here for assault as well as drug charges.\u201d</p><p>I slump into my chair, impatient, and kill time by watching the blond chick standing in front of me. Jacey.</p><p>The girl who may or may not have gotten me arrested for drugs.</p><p>I watch her tear-streaked face and the way she so sincerely pleads her case with the judge. I almost think that the drugs really weren\u2019t hers. But if they weren\u2019t hers, I don\u2019t know whose they were. They sure as fuck weren\u2019t mine.</p><p>She turns away from me once again, and my eyes sweep over her from top to bottom.</p><p>She\u2019s got a tight ass, I\u2019ll give her that, barely concealed in a short skirt. My brother would say that she\u2019s got an ass like an onion, hot enough to make him cry. As for me, I can just imagine burying my dick in it, pressing my face to her shoulder blades, reaching around her and...</p><p>I stop myself, shaking the random fantasy out of my head.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the time or the place. I turn back to my lawyer. \u201cDid you get those assault charges dropped for her?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cYeah. I pulled a couple of strings. She\u2019s only being charged with possession of marijuana now, like you. I don\u2019t know why you care though. It\u2019s probably her pot to begin with.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I care, either. Other than the fact that she didn\u2019t even know me, but she jumped in the middle of a brawl and tried to stop it. And afterward, she had stood with her little body in front of mine, almost as if she was shielding me from Cris... even though I\u2019d accidentally clocked her in the face.</p><p>Why had she done that?</p><p>I don\u2019t fucking know. But I feel a little responsible that she was even there. Even if it was her pot, she wouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place if it hadn\u2019t been for me. And I can\u2019t help but think back to the look on her face when I walked past her in her jail cell as she sat there covered in my blood.</p><p>She looked utterly vulnerable in a jail cell full of hookers. That\u2019s when I called my attorney and had him get her assault charges dropped. If I hadn\u2019t done that, she\u2019d have been there all night.</p><p>Oblivious to my musings about her, she stands in front of the judge now, giving him a sob story about how she\u2019s trying to pull her life together or some shit. But the judge doesn\u2019t even blink, he just stares down at her sternly from his perch above.</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, you do need to grow up. And I know that some judges like to give pretty little things like you a break. But I\u2019m not in the business of being an enabler. So, you should learn right here and now that this kind of thing isn\u2019t a trivial matter.\u201d The judge pauses to stare down at her sternly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finding you guilty of possession of marijuana. I\u2019m sentencing you to ninety days\u2019 community service at a local youth center and six months of probation. Learn from this, young lady. I don\u2019t want to see you here again. If you perform every bit of your community service as ordered, I will think about expunging this from your record. My bailiff will give you the details.\u201d</p><p>Jacey turns around with tear-streaked cheeks, and I suck in a breath over her sentence. My lawyer shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. She must\u2019ve rubbed him wrong. You\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019s got a second-rate attorney who can\u2019t argue shit. You\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, as I stand in front of the judge a few minutes later, I can see that having four attorneys isn\u2019t going to do me any good. In fact, it might just have the opposite effect. The judge\u2019s eyes glitter as he stares at my legal team.</p><p>\u201cSo, son. You think you can come to Chicago and do illegal drugs, then just hire a team of lawyers to get away with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir\u2014\u201d I start to argue, but he doesn\u2019t give me the chance. He holds up his hand.</p><p>\u201cUh, uh. I don\u2019t want to hear it. I find you guilty of marijuana possession and I sentence you to ninety days of community service and six months of probation. I realize that you live in California, but you will remain here in Chicago until your community service has been served.\u201d</p><p>Before I can even say a word, my attorney sputters.</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d he protests. \u201cMy client has obligations in California. He has a new film hitting production next week. In order to work and support himself, he must return to California. Can\u2019t he serve his community service there?\u201d</p><p>The judge looks at us drolly. \u201cAre you telling me that your client is on the verge of destitution if he can\u2019t return to California? I find that hard to believe, and if that is the case, I of course would need to see some verification of that.\u201d</p><p>My attorney backpedals. \u201cOf course that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. What I\u2019m saying is that that this is his first offense and he deserves some leniency. If he\u2019s not allowed to return home, it will drastically affect the production schedule of his next film, which will have negative ramifications for my client.\u201d</p><p>The judge smiles now, a humorless grin. \u201cThat, counselor, is not my problem. It should serve to teach your client a lesson. The sentence stands. The crime was committed here, the sentence will be served here. If he serves it out in complete compliance, it will be expunged from his record. The bailiff will have the details.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned as I sit staring at my hands. Did that really just happen? I\u2019m stuck in Chicago for three months? And I have a criminal record now? Holy shit. I glare at my high-priced lawyer.</p><p>\u201cSo, apparently, you\u2019re a second-rate attorney who can\u2019t argue shit, either.\u201d</p><p>I ignore his protests and push away from the table, following the bailiff to learn the details of my sentence. Before the bailiff ducks into a room, he waves me toward Jacey, who is sitting on a bench in the hall. I join her, and together we sit and wait. She\u2019s not crying anymore, but she seems just as distraught.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d she moans as she drops her head into her hands. \u201cOh my god. This is crazy. If you would just tell them the pot was yours, this would all go away. You\u2019re the freaking movie star. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re quite accustomed to making things disappear.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her mulishly. \u201cYeah, things like your assault charges?\u201d</p><p>Bright red flashes across Jacey\u2019s cheeks and she looks away.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she finally answers reluctantly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you did that, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>As she speaks, something crosses her face and she turns to me sharply.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. You got those charges dropped because you felt bad about framing me for this, didn\u2019t you? You can\u2019t have this kind of publicity, so you made it look like the drugs were mine. But you\u2019re not totally soulless, so you made my assault charges go away to make up for it. Oh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me with her ridiculous thoughts swimming in her eyes, and I shake my head in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d I snap. \u201cThe drugs weren\u2019t mine. Period. I got your charges dropped because I felt like it.\u201d</p><p>I look away from her pointedly, dismissing her. Instead, I concentrate on the bustling people in the hall, including a hulking blond guy hovering nearby. Jacey\u2019s boyfriend, probably. He\u2019s exactly the kind of guy I would picture her with: a meathead who mindlessly follows her around like a puppy. It makes total sense. She definitely seems like the kind of girl who wants someone who will just bow to her wishes. I sniff in disdain, then close my eyes.</p><p>I get two minutes of peace until my phone rings and my manager\u2019s name pops up. I know he\u2019s been anxiously waiting to hear what happened here, probably tapping his expensive Italian leather loafer against his marble office floor.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019s just that ostentatious. Ridiculously so. In addition, he drives a Ferrari, bright yellow for maximum impact. I always tell him his dick must be microscopic for him to need that much attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I answer the phone now with a sigh, not relishing this conversation. \u201cHey, Tally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d Tally doesn\u2019t even bother with a greeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck in Chicago for three months,\u201d I tell him. \u201cCommunity service. Then six months probation. If I\u2019m a good boy, my record will be wiped clean.\u201d</p><p>Tally erupts into a string of swear words that would make any sailor or truck driver cringe. I hold the phone away from my ear until he\u2019s finished.</p> <p>Finally, he takes a deep breath, calming himself somewhat.</p><p>\u201cFuck. This is bullshit, Dominic. The studio is going to be furious. Not only is this going to fuck with the schedule, they hired you in part based on your reputation. You aren\u2019t a troublemaker. You\u2019re a mysterious, sexy star. You keep things private, which keeps people guessing about you. This... this fucks with that. Everyone is going to assume that you\u2019re an addict now, and that\u2019s not the image that we\u2019re trying to convey. I\u2019ve got your publicists already on it, trying to spin it for you. But be prepared. News of this has already hit the web.</p><p>\u201cAlso, you\u2019ve got to see if you can at least come home on the weekends. Maybe they can work in some scenes then. Find out if that\u2019s a possibility and then call me back. I\u2019ll hold off calling the studio until I hear from you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother pointing out that the studio won\u2019t be happy about going over budget by working the crew on weekend hours. He knows that. He hangs up without another word, and I let my head fall against the wall behind me as I stare at the ceiling.</p><p>I can feel Jacey looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cWill you get fired?\u201d she asks hesitantly. I sigh.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve worried about that before you brought pot into my car.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, hard, and she doesn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t mine,\u201d she answers coldly, then she turns her face away and doesn\u2019t say another word. I almost believe her. To be fair, it\u2019s hard to know who might\u2019ve gotten into my car. With all of the people in and out of Sin\u2019s house, it could\u2019ve been anyone.</p><p>The bailiff emerges finally and approaches us with a handful of papers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll both be serving your community service at Joe\u2019s Gladiators, a youth center here in the city. Joe Hudson will be your supervisor. He\u2019s the owner of the place. Every week, he has to sign one of these for you.\u201d</p> <p>The bailiff hands us each a bright yellow paper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a report card. Joe will fill it out and sign it. If you fail to appear for work, if you do a bad job, if you don\u2019t do what is asked of you... in fact, if you sneeze wrong, Joe can refuse to sign it. It\u2019s in your best interest to keep him happy. Judge Kumarowski doesn\u2019t fool around, and if you have to reappear, he won\u2019t be lenient. On the other hand, if you do exceptionally well, he\u2019ll reward you for your good behavior by expunging this charge from your permanent record and removing your six months\u2019 probation period.\u201d</p><p>The bailiff stares at us both firmly. \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>Jacey shakes her head, but I hold up a finger. \u201cWill it be possible for me to go home on the weekends to work?\u201d</p><p>The bailiff scribbles something on his paper. \u201cI\u2019ll check with the judge and get back to you. It\u2019ll probably be fine. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Jacey and I shake our heads.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re free to go. You should both report to Joe\u2019s by ten A.M. on Monday.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I have an instant steel manacle snapped to my ankle. Someone to check in with, report to, and, most important, someone to keep me in Chicago.</p> <p>Fuck.</p><p>The hulking blond guy descends upon Jacey, patting her shoulder, and I push away from the wall and head down the hall. I can feel Jacey\u2019s stare beating into my shoulder blades, but I ignore it. She should be paying attention to her boyfriend, not me. But like every other woman out there, she\u2019s attracted to me because of who I am.</p><p>God, I hate that shit. For a brief moment, I remember the way she\u2019d looked at me from her jail cell... so soft and trusting and open. Like she was oblivious to my name and it was just her and me standing there.</p><p>But that was a lie. She knows full well who I am, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s attracted to. She\u2019s no different from anyone else.</p><p>With a sigh I make my way down the dingy stairs, and as I glance outside I see the reporters waiting. I stand still for a second, dreading this, but there\u2019s no way around it.</p><p>I pull up the hood of my sweatshirt and duck outside.</p><p>They descend like vultures, with their microphones shoved in my face, their flashbulbs popping, and their cameras rolling.</p><p>Is it true that you\u2019ve got a drug problem, Dominic?</p><p>Are you going to rehab?</p><p>Who\u2019s the blond girl, Dominic? Is she your girlfriend?</p><p>How will this affect your upcoming film?</p><p>I ignore them all, shoving through the crowd, and for a minute I regret not bringing security with me. What the hell was I thinking?</p><p>My security detail is back home in Hollywood, but Sin had offered me his... and I\u2019d turned him down. I just wanted to get in and out of here today with as little fuss as possible. It\u2019s why I told Sin and Duncan not to come. It\u2019s bad enough if one of us goes somewhere. But if we go together, the circus around us is ridiculous.</p><p>I duck into the crowded sidewalk and lose myself in the people, jogging down the street until I can no longer hear the snaps of the cameras and the chattering reporters. It takes a while, but finally I find myself alone in the quiet solitude of a Chicago alleyway.</p><p>I slump against the grimy wall, staring around at the trash, the graffiti, the grayness of the city. Even in the midst of spring, downtown Chicago seems dismal and gray. It might be home, but quite honestly, I would rather be anywhere but here.</p><p>I take a deep breath of city smells and then release it.</p><p>I\u2019m here now. I\u2019ll be here for the next three months. I can\u2019t control that so there\u2019s only one thing to do.</p><p>Suck it up.</p><p>As I lay sprawled in a chair in Sin\u2019s theater room, I make a gun out of my fingers and point it at my head as my mother lectures into my ear. It had taken exactly two hours for her to see the courthouse footage online. Why didn\u2019t you wear a tie? Why must you wear those horrible hoodies?</p><p>From across the room, Sin laughs as he flips through channels on the behemoth TV hanging in front of us. He\u2019s dressed only in a pair of tattered jeans that look like he slept in them. Once again, he\u2019s not wearing a shirt.</p><p>\u201cDominic James Kinkaide.\u201d My mother sighs into my ear. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you have a criminal record. I honestly can\u2019t. Your father is going to be so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad is going to be upset?\u201d I ask, my lip twitching. \u201cNot you at all, right? It\u2019s all Dad?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a joke in our family. My mother always blames everything on my father. Things worry him sick, he loses sleep over us, etc. It\u2019s all him, not her. It\u2019s funny, because he\u2019s the most laid-back person I know. Dad has been a producer in the music industry since before I was born. He\u2019s got nerves of steel. To blame all the worry on him is asinine, but none of us kids ever call her on it.</p><p>Mom sighs. \u201cWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t stay with Sin. The two of you will just get into even more trouble. You\u2019d better come home. I\u2019ll get your room ready for you here.\u201d</p><p>I think of my childhood home, Castle Kinkaide, a large replica of a Scottish castle perched in the middle of ten acres right outside of Chicago. It\u2019s quirky and original, just like my family. And while I love my childhood home and my family, having my mom in my business or listening to Fiona lecture me about Cris for the next ninety days isn\u2019t gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer, Mom. But I\u2019m good here. I might even rent my own condo if Sin doesn\u2019t start wearing clothes. We\u2019ll see. But everything will be fine. Don\u2019t worry. And tell Dad not to worry.\u201d</p><p>Sin snorts. \u201cIs Dad worried sick?\u201d He cracks up and my mom sighs.</p><p>\u201cSinclair Alec Kinkaide,\u201d she snaps, even though my brother can\u2019t hear her. \u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you.\u201d</p><p>I waggle my eyebrows at Sin, before I return my attention to mom.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mom. I\u2019ll come out and see you soon.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and sink glumly into the leather cushions of the chair.</p><p>\u201cCheer up,\u201d Sin chirps. \u201cI\u2019ll put one of your movies on to make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes because he knows I hate to watch my own movies. \u201cYou\u2019re way too happy about my current set of circumstances.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to not be the only Kinkaide with a record. Thanks for that. Mom can split her lectures between the two of us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to be of help,\u201d I mutter. \u201cAnd at least I kept my crime spree on US soil. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re banned from the Netherlands.\u201d</p><p>Sin rolls his eyes, but then his expression suddenly changes.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Fiona?\u201d he asks, somewhat hesitantly. \u201cOr just Mom?\u201d</p><p>I clench my jaw. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t fucking talk to Fiona. It\u2019s bullshit that she\u2019s dating Cris. And I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t tell me about it. You let me fucking find out on my own.\u201d</p><p>Sin shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dom. I didn\u2019t realize that they were coming to the party or I would\u2019ve told you. They didn\u2019t know you were in town. But dude, Cris has changed. I don\u2019t know what he did to piss you off so fucking much, but the guy\u2019s changed a lot since you graduated high school. You should at least talk to him. Six years is a long time, bro. A lot can happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I arch an eyebrow. \u201cPeople don\u2019t change. Not really. They can pretend, they can move on, they can do lots of shit, but to actually reach down into their soul and change the person they are? That\u2019s impossible. And Cris has a black fucking soul. Fiona shouldn\u2019t be with him.\u201d</p><p>I tap my phone against my leg in agitation, staring at Sin. He stares back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, dude. You can\u2019t control her, she\u2019s as stubborn as you are. But that trait comes in handy now that she\u2019s working for the band. She\u2019ll be the best manager we ever had.\u201d</p><p>I scowl. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t do me one bit of good. Unless, as her boss, you can send her to LA or something while I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Sin shakes his head with a grin. \u201cSorry, dude. I need her here. She\u2019s working with Tally to put together our next tour. Besides, with her here and you here, maybe you can hash all of this out once and for all. Plus, as an added bonus, you\u2019ll get to hear all of the details from Duncan\u2019s love life. Trust me, it\u2019s not boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t come back all that often. It\u2019s always like a fucking soap opera in this family.\u201d</p><p>Sin shakes his head, turning his head back to the television.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, bro.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I stick my hand out from under the covers and flip off the sun. Actually, I\u2019m flipping off the entire day. Nothing good ever comes from a Monday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a groan, I roll over and stare bleary-eyed at the clock. Eight A.M. I open my mouth to yawn, only to find my dry tongue stuck to the top of my even drier mouth.</p><p>Jesus. Last night is a blur of too much whiskey, padded handcuffs, and Kira\u2019s sex-starved moans.</p><p>Come on, Dominic. Just fuck me. You know you want to.</p><p>She had pleaded, like always. But like always, my answer was the same. Although that didn\u2019t stop us from doing several other things that were probably illegal in twenty states. My ass still stings from the belt Kira used, and I briefly wonder if it left marks before I decide that I don\u2019t give a shit.</p> <p>The sheets still smell like Kira\u2019s perfume, even though she left hours ago, and I feel the sudden urge to wash it off of me. Something about the light of day and all that. What happens in the dark should stay in the dark.</p><p>If two consenting adults do deviant things to each other in the dark, did the deviant things actually happen? There\u2019s a question for the ages.</p><p>Rolling out of bed, I take a quick shower and head down to Sin\u2019s kitchen to scrounge up some caffeine. Not remembering the last time I took the time to eat, I grab a cup of coffee and a slice of cold pizza from the fridge and head out to a lounger by the pool.</p><p>I wolf the pizza down in four bites, lick my fingers, then close my eyes. The light is just too damned bright. And four hours of sleep just isn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Before long though, giggling invades my solitude and I can feel eyes on my skin. Why the hell is someone always around this place? It\u2019s impossible to ever be alone. Reluctantly, I open my eyes to see who\u2019s watching me.</p> <p>Across the pool, in one of the two large cabanas, two girls are doing a not very good job of pretending not to stare at me.</p><p>They\u2019re scantily dressed in tiny shorts and halter tops, probably eighteen or nineteen, and they have the smeared makeup of women who have been awake all night. Awake and used all night. I can see the sex-glazed looks in their eyes from here.</p><p>Sin, the guy who put that look in their eyes, is nowhere to be found, so it\u2019s hard to tell what they\u2019re up to now. Either way, they\u2019re not my guests and not my problem. I don\u2019t close my eyes fast enough though, and accidentally make eye contact with one of them.</p><p>Fuck. They know I\u2019m awake.</p><p>They make a beeline for my side, sitting on the lounger beside me, still giggling with their smeared makeup and last night\u2019s clothes. I fight the urge to roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Dominic Kinkaide, right?\u201d the tall brunette asks, purposely sitting in a way that pushes her tits together.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cUsually.\u201d</p><p>They giggle again while the little blonde edges forward. \u201cSin told us that you were staying here for a while,\u201d she says proudly, excited to be \u201cin the know.\u201d</p><p>I do roll my eyes now. I can\u2019t help it. Jesus. These girls are always the fucking same. It\u2019s mind-boggling. They\u2019re perfectly willing to hang around and be used, simply so they can say that they were with Sin Kinkaide. Or me. Or even Duncan, and he\u2019s just a fucking drummer.</p><p>\u201cHe told you that, did he?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd where is my brother?\u201d</p><p>Brunette gestures toward the house. \u201cHe\u2019s still in bed. We\u2019re supposed to be finding him coffee. He has practice this morning.\u201d</p><p>I cock an eyebrow. \u201cYou mean \u2018rehearsal\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She blushes prettily. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes again. \u201cWell, the coffee isn\u2019t usually by the pool. It\u2019s in the kitchen. If you head that way, someone can help you.\u201d</p> <p>More giggles, then silence, although I can still feel their presence. I hear a whisper, then a hand sliding on my arm.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you haven\u2019t had breakfast yet, why don\u2019t you join us?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes at Blondie\u2019s suggestive tone, to find her face sultry and expectant. It\u2019s blatantly clear that she\u2019s not talking about food.</p><p>Oddly enough, the face that I found to be tired and smeared a moment ago suddenly seems almost tempting, or at least doable. My sexual proclivities are rearing their ugly heads. Two girls willing to do anything to please me? The opportunities are endless.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d I ask, my interest piqued.</p><p>The brunette pipes up. \u201cWe could be your breakfast. If you want,\u201d she adds, almost shyly.</p><p>Her friend nods in agreement. \u201cI hope you have a big appetite.\u201d</p><p>I smile wolfishly, definitely interested now.</p><p>\u201cWell, have you ever heard the phrase \u2018my eyes are bigger than my stomach\u2019?\u201d</p><p>One girl smiles and the other nods. I nod back and lean forward, speaking quietly as if sharing a secret.</p><p>\u201cI like to watch,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>Brunette immediately stands up, gently pushing my shoulders backward until I\u2019m reclining again.</p><p>\u201cThen watch this,\u201d she tells me confidently. She grabs Blondie and pulls her onto the lounger next to me. \u201cI\u2019m Erika,\u201d she announces, as she pushes Blondie onto her back. \u201cAnd this is Meghan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>But they don\u2019t hear me. Brunette is sliding Blondie\u2019s shorts off, pulling them down over her hips and then licking each place that her fingers touched. As she moves to the girl\u2019s tits, taking off her shirt and then pulling one of those lush little nipples into her mouth, my dick gets hard and I pull it out of my pants.</p><p>There is something wrong with me.</p><p>I get off on watching other people\u2019s pleasure. Or I get off when pain is involved. Or I get off when something is far, far over the line of normal. I don\u2019t get off by my own participation. That\u2019s fucked up in a million different ways, but I\u2019m not going to analyze it now.</p><p>For now, I\u2019m going to watch the girls\u2019 tight little bodies sliding together, because that does it for me.</p><p>Watching their tongues tangle, their tits press together... that does it for me, too.</p><p>And when Brunette\u2019s mouth burrows between Blondie\u2019s legs and then Blondie comes into Brunette\u2019s mouth... I\u2019m a goner. I stroke myself, not caring that any number of the staff inside the house could glance out and see me getting off on the lounge chair.</p><p>Before long, Brunette shoves my hand away, replacing it with her mouth. Blondie kneels over my balls, licking them like an ice cream cone.</p><p>\u201cPull on my balls,\u201d I instruct Blondie. She grins devilishly and does as I ask. \u201cHarder,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>Pain shoots through me as she complies, and she pulls ever harder on my ball sack. I like the pain. It blocks out reality.</p><p>I smile and take a sip of coffee, as they bob and dip and pull and suck in front of me.</p><p>Turns out, this Monday isn\u2019t so bad after all.</p><p>Jacey</p><p>I glance at the clock in the dingy, hot office. Ten thirty-seven A.M. We were supposed to be here at Joe\u2019s Gladiators thirty-seven minutes ago.</p><p>I actually showed up early, not wanting to get on Joe\u2019s bad side right off the bat. The bailiff had said that any little thing could give Joe grounds to not sign my card. Dominic Kinkaide, however, apparently doesn\u2019t worry about such things. He\u2019s late.</p><p>Very late.</p><p>To distract myself, I pick up my phone and call my best friend. Who better to commiserate with, right?</p><p>Maddy answers on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cHey girl,\u201d she chirps cheerfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I scowl. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell her grumpily. \u201cI know that Gabe told you everything. I suck. It\u2019s common knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Maddy pauses. \u201cYou sometimes suck,\u201d she agrees. \u201cBut not most of the time. You messed up. Big deal. You\u2019re fixing it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right,\u201d I agree, staring around Joe\u2019s cluttered office. \u201cI\u2019m at the gym waiting to start my community service. It\u2019s disgusting here. And those boys out there. Oh my god. They\u2019re so intimidating. They look like they might shiv someone in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Maddy chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re not intimidated by anyone. That\u2019s one of the things I love about you. Suck it up and do your time, Jace. Then you can get your ass out here for a visit. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I reply. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to come out while you\u2019re still pregnant. It\u2019ll be the only time that I get to see you fat.\u201d</p><p>Maddy laughs at that, and I laugh too, because I\u2019m sure that even now, my best friend isn\u2019t fat. She\u2019s gorgeous, like always. But before we can say more, Joe lumbers back into the office, having only been gone for ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cGotta go, Mad,\u201d I mutter quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>I hang up quickly and stare at my new boss. He\u2019s a huge man, gray hair, gray whiskers, square jaw, wide shoulders. He actually looks like he could be found on a fisherman\u2019s wharf or something. He\u2019s maybe sixty or so and he has no tact. As in, none.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell does that kid think he is?\u201d he grumbles to me. Or maybe to himself, because he doesn\u2019t even look up at me as he drops heavily into his office chair. \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying rat\u2019s ass if he\u2019s famous. I\u2019m only going through your orientation one time. If he\u2019s not here in five minutes, we\u2019ll start without him and he can just go someplace else to do his time.\u201d</p><p>Joe looks at me sternly now, his steely blue eyes firm. \u201cI don\u2019t put up with laziness or tardiness, Ms. Vincent. You should know that right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I stammer. For some reason, he just seems like a person I should address as sir. He smiles though, for the first time since I met him. It crinkles the corners of his eyes and spreads to the rest of his face, lighting up his wrinkles.</p><p>\u201cSir. Ha! That\u2019s a good one. Sir was my father. Or my drill sergeant back when I was in the Army. I\u2019m just Joe, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Finally. Something to break the ice with him. Relief washes over me.</p><p>\u201cYou were in the Army?\u201d I grab at that straw quickly, before he changes the subject and the topic gets away from me. I don\u2019t want to go back to staring at the clock, waiting for Dominic in uncomfortable silence. \u201cMy brother was, too. He was a Ranger. He just got a Medal of Honor, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>Joe stares at me now, sufficiently impressed and curious.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say? That\u2019s impressive. It takes a lot to get one of those. What did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Humvee got bombed in Afghanistan, and according to the president, he acted with extreme valor in the face of peril, above and beyond the call of duty. Basically, he risked his own ass to save someone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get more salt of the earth than that, missy,\u201d Joe drawls sincerely, nodding. \u201cYou should take some pointers from your brother. What does he think about you being here?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slump at the mere thought of what Gabe thinks about it, and Joe laughs.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>I smile and he smiles back. Thank god. The ice has definitely been broken.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he tells me, his tone softening just a bit. \u201cMy bark is worse than my bite, as long as you stay on the straight and narrow and do your job. These kids here...\u201d</p><p>He pauses, staring out the window of his door at the teenagers punching at bags out in the sweaty gym. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have much, see? If they don\u2019t come here, they would get into trouble on the streets. And I don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s our job to keep them on the straight and narrow. To do that, you\u2019ve got to be there, too. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>I nod quickly. \u201cJoe, seriously, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever been in trouble. That pot wasn\u2019t even mine...\u201d But Joe holds up his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my business,\u201d he tells me. \u201cMy business is just making sure that you don\u2019t get into trouble again. You hear?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s stern again, and I know I\u2019m back at an arm\u2019s length with him. He\u2019s going to be a tough nut to crack, and I\u2019m going to have to earn his respect, but I just get the feeling that deep down he\u2019s a good guy. A nice guy. I saw a glimpse of warmth in those eyes a minute ago. Plus, he dedicates his life to helping troubled teens. That\u2019s got to mean something.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>The voice comes from behind me, freezing me in my chair.</p><p>Dominic.</p><p>I would know that voice anywhere now. Husky and low. Arrogant and dark. I don\u2019t know why I think a voice can be dark, all I know is his just is. His voice hints at dark things.</p><p>I turn in my chair to find him lingering in the door, looking like he just stepped from the big screen into this tiny office. He\u2019s bigger than life, even here. He doesn\u2019t look at me; instead his gaze is fixed on Joe.</p> <p>He\u2019s got an arrogant, sexy attitude that completely fills up whatever room he\u2019s in. And even though he\u2019s saying he\u2019s sorry, he doesn\u2019t look one bit apologetic. He doesn\u2019t offer even one tiny explanation for his tardiness, either.</p><p>Joe stares at him.</p><p>\u201cThe next time you\u2019re late, don\u2019t bother coming in at all,\u201d Joes tells him gruffly. \u201cHave as much respect for me and my boys here as you do for yourself and we\u2019ll all get along nicely. If you can\u2019t do that, get the hell out the same way you came in.\u201d</p><p>Dominic looks at him calmly. \u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>Joe stares at him, his blue eyes meeting Dominic\u2019s green. Neither looks away for a minute, until Joe breaks the gaze and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s got balls,\u201d he tells me, nodding. \u201cJust wait til I break \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>I giggle and Dominic stares at me in disdain.</p><p>His gaze doesn\u2019t stray to my cheek where I have a bruise, and it doesn\u2019t meet my eyes. He also doesn\u2019t bother himself to comment. That\u2019s one thing that\u2019s clear about Dominic Kinkaide. He isn\u2019t going to go out of his way for much.</p><p>\u201cListen up,\u201d Joe tells us, snapping me out of thinking about Dominic. \u201cI don\u2019t have much to say, other than what happens here with the kids stays here. These kids have rough home lives, and they don\u2019t need you spreading talk about them outside of this gym. You\u2019re here to help them in any way you can. Be a mentor. Show them that there is life outside of trouble. Think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple here. Don\u2019t be late. Don\u2019t mess up. Don\u2019t make their lives harder than they already are. Do some good. What you put out into the world, it comes back to you. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I nod again, but Dominic sits silent and still.</p><p>Joe turns to him. \u201cAll right, since you were late, your job today will be to empty all the spit cans from around the boxing rings. Take them into the locker room, dump them out, rinse the cans, and put them back.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stares at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, but he\u2019s serious. There\u2019s not a hint of a smile on Joe\u2019s face now.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fucking serious. Don\u2019t be late again, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr don\u2019t bother showing up,\u201d Dominic interrupts, as he heads for the door. \u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d He walks out without another word and Joe looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYour friend might not last long here.\u201d</p><p>I stare after Dominic, at his wide shoulders striding away from us. He\u2019s tall and lean, drop-dead gorgeous and proud as hell. \u201cHe\u2019s not my friend,\u201d I finally answer softly. \u201cI barely know him.\u201d</p><p>But I have the feeling that\u2019s about to change. What I don\u2019t know... is how I feel about that.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Dominic</p><p>After I dump the disgusting cans of old spit down the even more disgusting bathroom sinks, I take them back out to the gym, pausing for a minute as I stare at Jacey. As much as I hate to give her attention, it\u2019s hard not to notice her here, especially when she\u2019s thrust herself in the middle of a group of at-risk kids and her face is pressed into a punching bag as one of the boys punches at it.</p><p>Especially when I walk past her and she smells like apples, crisp and clean.</p><p>She\u2019s as out of place in this dirty sweatbox as anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>She\u2019s got that girl-next-door quality that is so underrated among women. They all want to be glamorous bombshells, overly made-up and too sexed out. But even though Jacey is wearing makeup and short workout shorts, she\u2019s the classic girl next door, even if that\u2019s not her goal.</p><p>I bend and replace a spit can next to one of her toned legs, and she glances down at me, her eyes warm and sparkling.</p><p>For a minute, there\u2019s something in her expression, something mischievous, but she doesn\u2019t say anything. Instead, she just braces for another punch from the gigantic kid pummeling the bag she\u2019s holding. It\u2019s taking all of her weight to hold it still, but she\u2019s doing it. I can\u2019t help but be impressed.</p><p>Mainly because not only is she holding it, but she\u2019s not intimidated by him, either. She\u2019s half his size, but she just marched right out here and jumped in, just like she jumped in between Cris and me. Completely unafraid.</p><p>The kid she\u2019s with looks like he could eat her for breakfast, and every time he punches, it practically knocks her into the wall. But she still holds on.</p><p>She\u2019s stubborn, I\u2019ll give her that much. And fearless.</p><p>Why I\u2019m thinking about her at all, though, I don\u2019t fucking know. Annoyed with myself, I turn around and head to the other side of the room.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear the commotion.</p><p>Snapping around, I turn just in time to see the kid grab at Jacey\u2019s chest, his tape-wrapped fingers twisting her T-shirt and yanking her toward him. For a split second, my heart hammers as I watch the juvenile delinquent manhandling her. The kid is giant, and Jacey is extremely small.</p><p>But there\u2019s no time for me or anyone else to react before Jacey spins out of his grasp in one deft move, swinging her leg around in a surprisingly powerful roundhouse kick to his chest, knocking him onto his back.</p><p>I\u2019m utterly stunned and so is she. I can see it on her face as she stands over him, her hands clenched and shaking at her sides as she balances one tennis shoe lightly on his neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me like that again!\u201d she snaps at him. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to grope me.\u201d</p><p>By now, activity in the gym has halted, and every eye is on Jacey and the kid on the floor. You can hear a pin drop in this place.</p><p>The kid is still and silent as he looks up at her, and unconsciously I start to move toward Jacey. Even though I don\u2019t want to be involved with her or anything else, I can\u2019t leave her there by herself. I\u2019m not completely heartless.</p><p>But then the kid smiles, even though Jacey\u2019s foot is still on his neck.</p><p>\u201cIf you let me up, I\u2019ll behave,\u201d he promises. Jacey stares down at him uncertainly, but after a second, she lifts her foot. The kid climbs to his feet, holding his hand out to Jacey.</p><p>She eyes him hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the kid tells her, smiling again. \u201cMy name\u2019s Jake. There\u2019s no hard feelings, right? I was just messin\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at him and I stop a few steps away.</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d she finally answers. \u201cNo hard feelings. Just don\u2019t do that again. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah, you can,\u201d the kid agrees. \u201cWhere did you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>Jacey shrugs, relaxing slightly even though she still keeps an eye on the boy.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s an Army Ranger. He taught me a lot of things. One of those things is how to shoot, and I have a 9mm in my bed stand. It might be pink, but it shoots just as straight as a regular one.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle now, at both the thought of this tiny chick with a pink gun by her bed and at the look on Jake\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d he tells her quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t have any plans to break into your house. No need to threaten me with your pink gun.\u201d</p><p>I hear chuckling around me from the kids, and Jacey relaxes.</p><p>\u201cGood. I just thought I\u2019d let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d Joe\u2019s voice booms through the gym, and I glance over to find him standing in his office doorway, a pissed look on his face. \u201cGet in here.\u201d</p><p>Jake turns slowly and Joe looks at Jacey.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he calls to her.</p><p>She nods and so does he. \u201cGood. And nice rotation on that kick, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Jacey smiles now, a real smile that spreads to her eyes. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Jake disappears reluctantly into Joe\u2019s office, his shoulders slumped, and the door closes behind them. Jacey stands limply for a minute, probably trying to decide what to do now... now that she\u2019s shown the entire gym that she\u2019s an unlikely badass. Noise resumes around us as everyone goes back to their business.</p><p>I look at her.</p><p>\u201cThat was impressive,\u201d I admit quietly, because it\u2019s the truth. \u201cYou looked like a stuntwoman. Or a ninja.\u201d</p><p>Jacey laughs a warm laugh, real and husky, as she walks toward me, closing the three-foot gap between us.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI guess those endless self-defense classes with my brother paid off. I used to think that he just wanted to inflict pain on me, but maybe there was rhyme to his reason.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s unflustered now, once again sure of herself. She tucks a stray lock of her blond hair behind her ear, and I can\u2019t help but notice her plump lips. They\u2019re just the right size to nip at. The tip of her tongue pokes out, licking her lips, and I swallow.</p><p>Must distract myself.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s really a Ranger?\u201d I ask, refocusing myself. \u201cBecause that\u2019s badass shit. If he trained you, it\u2019s no wonder you can take down a guy twice your size.\u201d</p><p>Jacey smiles, hovering near my elbow. Close enough to touch, but I don\u2019t. Close enough to inhale, so I do, filling my lungs with the scent of apples.</p><p>She\u2019s a breath of fresh air, whether I want to admit it or not.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is. Or he was until a year or so ago. He is pretty badass.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m getting ready to reply when a group of guys headed for the locker room stop off beside us.</p><p>\u201cDude, are you really Dominic Kinkaide?\u201d one of them asks, his face dubious. I smile what I hope is a patient smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me,\u201d I answer. I can feel Jacey watching the exchange with interest, but she remains silent. The kid grins.</p><p>\u201cDude. I loved Annihilated. That was some crazy shit! Did you do your own stunts?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod, and the kids start chattering eagerly, asking me questions about leaping from a helicopter and how I\u2019d managed to flip my jet ski over backward. One of them runs to Joe\u2019s office to get paper for autographs, and the group grows from three guys to fifteen.</p><p>The kid runs back and hands me a stack of scratch paper, and I start scrawling my name, handing an autograph to each boy surrounding me. As I do, I see Jacey slip away from the ruckus. A part of me is disappointed by that. I\u2019m fascinated by the Jacey that just laid Jake out flat on his back.</p><p>I want to know more about her, because she seems different from the Jacey who works at Saffron.</p><p>After five minutes or so, Joe sticks his head out of his office and barks at the boys.</p> <p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re not here to get autographs. Let the man do his job and you guys get back to work!\u201d</p><p>The kids sheepishly disperse, going back to their punching bags or to the locker room, and I head to the weight room to wipe down the seats. When I get there, I find Jacey already crouched by a machine, cleaning it. When I walk in, she glances up at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s your life?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMost of the time. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t go out much. It\u2019s just part of it.\u201d</p><p>I grab a rag and help her, cleaning the other side of the machine she\u2019s working on.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s awesome,\u201d she answers. \u201cEveryone loves you. That must be an amazing feeling.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cYeah. Everyone loves me. Jacey, no one knows me. Not really. They know my face. They know the roles that I play. But they don\u2019t know me. That\u2019s okay, though. It\u2019s how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Jacey shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s depressingly lonely, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I mutter, bending next to her to grab the bottle of sanitizer. As I do, she wrinkles up her nose.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You smell like sex. Did you come straight from a whorehouse?\u201d</p><p>I feel myself flush, just a bit, because she caught me dead to rights.</p> <p>Visions of the girl-on-girl action I was a part of just before I came here flash through my head. I hadn\u2019t taken the time for a shower because I was late enough already.</p><p>Busted.</p><p>Jacey shakes her head in... what? Disappointment? Disgust?</p><p>Before I can figure out her reaction, she walks away, breaking whatever moment we\u2019d been having and leaving me staring after her in astonishment as she exits the room. No one ever walks away from me like that.</p><p>But she just did.</p><p>Not only that, but she\u2019s not looking back, either. She\u2019s not so impressed with who I am that she\u2019ll overlook any fault that I might have. Interesting... and unusual.</p><p>As I stare at her shoulder blades, I realize it\u2019s possible that there might be more to this girl than I thought.</p><p>Yeah... no, there\u2019s probably not.</p> <p>I decide this a few hours later as I walk into the parking lot at the end of my shift, after scrubbing toilets, refilling ice packs, and wiping graffiti off the wall.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s exactly like I thought she was.</p><p>Kaylie, the girl from the party the other night, is dressed in her tiny server\u2019s uniform, and she tosses a bag at Jacey as Jacey piles into Kaylie\u2019s little convertible.</p><p>Then, right in the parking lot, Jacey hunches down in the seat and changes her clothes.</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>I can\u2019t see anything, but I know what she\u2019s doing. And so would the boys in the gym, if any of them happened to look outside. What the fuck is she thinking? One leg extends high into the air, her toes pointed to the sky, as Jacey slips her workout shorts off and her tiny uniform shorts on. The flimsy material sliding over her long legs leaves little to the imagination.</p><p>Does she want to invite trouble? A boy\u2019s imagination is as good as the real thing, often times better. So to give them a glimpse like this is only going to make them want to see more.</p><p>But maybe that\u2019s what she wants. And maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s exactly the kind of girl I thought she was. An attention-whore and a tease, which makes total sense given her job.</p><p>I stop for a second and watch.</p><p>Because that\u2019s what I like to do.</p><p>Her shirt comes off, and I get a hint of a slender shoulder, the top of her bra, the curve of her arm. Then she\u2019s busy fastening the hooks of her skimpy corset, which pushes her tits upward and together, before she adjusts her yellow bow tie.</p><p>Something about the situation... the fact that Jacey is undressing in a very public place, the fact that I like to watch... and the fact that Jacey has a smoking-hot body incites a reaction from my dick and it hardens against my leg.</p><p>I hate that I react at all, physical or otherwise, because I wouldn\u2019t touch this girl with Sin\u2019s dick, let alone mine. There\u2019s trouble in the way she so clearly needs so much attention. I mean, she works a job where she is half-dressed for the pleasure of men, for god\u2019s sake. I want nothing to do with her, or anyone like her. Yet here I am with a stiff dick.</p><p>It\u2019s at this moment that she turns and tosses her bag into the tiny backseat and her eyes meet mine. She pauses, and I can almost hear the breath as it rushes over her lips with surprise. I can almost see the question in her dark eyes as they widen. Did he just see me undress?</p><p>But just as quickly as her eyes widen at seeing me, they narrow into a slant and fill with one thing as the car speeds out of the parking lot, the radio blasting.</p><p>Disdain.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or be annoyed. She\u2019s the one undressing in the parking lot of a youth center in front of testosterone-fueled boys and heading off to a job where she gets paid to flirt with men... not me. Her disdain should be for herself.</p><p>I feel like an old man as I tiredly crawl into my Porsche, letting my head rest against the seat for a second, absorbing the spring sun and the fresh breeze before I fire up the engine. As I do, my phone rings and Sin\u2019s name flashes on my screen.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I answer as I back out of my parking spot.</p><p>\u201cDude, I just found out that Amy Ashby is coming to my party tonight. Aren\u2019t you costarring with her in your next gig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I have to admit, I\u2019m surprised. Amy Ashby, super-starlet, hardly ever ventures out of California. She doesn\u2019t see the need. To her, all intelligent life ends at the California\u2013Nevada border.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sin answers. \u201cShe\u2019s dating a Blackhawk now, apparently, which is a shame because I\u2019d like to motorboat those tits of hers. Are they real? I know you know. You had a sex scene with her in Visceral Need. I know you tapped that ass. You must\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>For just a second, I think about that film, the one that shot both me and Amy to superstardom. And of course, I think about that sex scene. It was my first on-screen sex scene and hers too. We joked that we were popping each other\u2019s cherry. Her tits aren\u2019t real, but I don\u2019t tell Sin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d I tell him instead. \u201cAnd fuck, man. How many parties do you need to have a week?\u201d</p><p>Sin chuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t hate. But hey, I just thought of something. Is this going to cause a problem? Because Kira is coming tonight too. I know that Amy likes to have your undivided attention\u2014whether she has a boyfriend or not.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cAmy is definitely high maintenance. But that shouldn\u2019t cause a problem with Kira, because she knows where she and I stand. We\u2019re convenient. That\u2019s it. But knowing it and knowing it are two different things, and she\u2019ll probably get jealous and throw some sort of fit. Why\u2019d you invite her, anyway? I don\u2019t want to babysit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wanted me to call her for my next party,\u201d Sin replies, and I can almost hear him shrugging. It\u2019s not his problem, so he\u2019s not concerned. \u201cAnd when the fuck did having a fuck-buddy turn into babysitting? Whatever, dude. We\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p><p>An idea occurs to me and I grin.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019ll work. I\u2019ll go home tonight for dinner. Mom\u2019s been wanting to feed me, anyway. Have fun at the party.\u201d</p><p>Sin starts to protest, but I hang up on him and turn the car around, heading the opposite direction toward Palos Park, the Chicago suburb that I grew up in.</p><p>The Chicago streets turn into the highway, which eventually runs through Palos Park. The quiet streets that I ran on when I was a kid surround me and I take in the quiet scenery as I drive through town to the country. Castle Kinkaide sits on ten acres outside of town and I can see the spire of the tower a mile away.</p><p>Honestly, I can\u2019t help but smile. For the most part, I had an awesome childhood and I have great memories of growing up out here in the middle of nowhere, in a house that everyone around considers a gigantic novelty.</p><p>As I pull onto the long drive, surrounded on both sides by flowering trees, I take a deep breath of country air and exhale it. I always forget how good it smells here, but once I\u2019m back, it brings back instant memories. Summer nights chasing lightning bugs, camping out with my dad and brothers, and swinging from a rope swing out by the stream.</p><p>It was a surprisingly rural upbringing in a town only a few miles from Chicago. As I climb out of my car, I hear Fiona and my mother... their voices drift toward me on the breeze, and I turn to find them walking from the garage into the house. Fuck.</p><p>How had I forgotten that Fiona is staying with my parents while her new condo downtown is being renovated? Mother fuck.</p><p>Fiona looks up and sees me first, and for the briefest of moments her eyes light up the way they usually do when she sees me. I\u2019ve always been her favorite.</p><p>But not now. Now her expression immediately hardens and she pointedly looks in the other direction, a not-so-subtle way of reminding me that I\u2019m on her shit list.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>She\u2019s on my shit list. She can ignore me as long as she wants. I can guarantee that I\u2019ve got more patience than she does.</p><p>As they walk up the steps into the house, Mom turns her head and drops the sack she\u2019s carrying as soon as she sees me. She runs toward me like she hasn\u2019t seen me in a year. It\u2019s only been a few months, but you\u2019d think it was an eternity by the way she barrels into me and clutches me tight. Her head barely reaches my sternum, but she buries it there, her hands clasped behind me.</p><p>\u201cDominic James Kinkaide,\u201d she scolds. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away too long this time. You\u2019re getting too thin. You\u2019re not eating.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me, her blue eyes snapping. \u201cYou get yourself inside and wash up. Dinner\u2019s in thirty minutes, and you\u2019re going to eat everything I put on your plate.\u201d</p><p>She marches ahead of me, trying to pretend that she\u2019s angry and not happy to see me. But her eyes betray her, because when she stops to let me open the door for her, they\u2019re warm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you came home,\u201d she tells me as she walks past. \u201cGo see your father. He\u2019s in the library.\u201d</p><p>Fiona ignores me so I ignore her, walking past her into the long hall that leads to the library that serves as my dad\u2019s study. When I round the doorway, I find him staring out the window, a glass of scotch in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d I greet him quietly. \u201cCan I get one of those?\u201d</p><p>My father turns his head and smiles at me, his temples a little grayer than the last time I was home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Dom. Sure, help yourself. It\u2019ll put hair on your chest.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle because it\u2019s the same thing he always says and help myself to a glass. The fiery liquid burns a trail down into my gut and I down the entire thing, then pour another.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened the other night?\u201d Dad asks without preamble. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around assaulting people. I don\u2019t care how pissed you are.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI just found out that Fiona\u2019s dating Cris. I don\u2019t appreciate it and I told her so.\u201d</p> <p>Dad raises an eyebrow. \u201cAnd then you showed Cris with your fists? I always told you, Dom... I don\u2019t want you to start things. You can always finish them, but don\u2019t start them.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and set my glass down. \u201cCris started this long ago, Dad. And there\u2019s going to come a point where I need to finish it. For real.\u201d</p><p>My father levels his green gaze at me. \u201cYou ever going to tell us what the hell happened with you two? He spent almost as much time here growing up as you did. If there\u2019s something I need to know, I\u2019d appreciate knowing it.\u201d</p><p>My gut tightens.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to tell them. It\u2019s that I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t fucking talk about it. Every time I try, the words freeze in my chest and they won\u2019t pass my tongue. They\u2019re just too fucking ugly to say.</p> <p>My father raises an eyebrow. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s between him and me. If Fiona doesn\u2019t want to listen, that\u2019s her problem.\u201d</p><p>Dad rolls his eyes and downs his whiskey. \u201cI thought you\u2019d say that. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be happy to know that he\u2019s coming tonight. We didn\u2019t know you were or we wouldn\u2019t have invited him.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him dumbly. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. I didn\u2019t even call to tell them I was coming. But still. It\u2019s my fucking home and I shouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe around wondering when and if Cris fucking Evans will be here.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mumble. \u201cIt\u2019s been good seeing you.\u201d I stand up and turn to walk out.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that shit,\u201d my dad warns. \u201cYou should\u2019ve called to tell us you were coming.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s right, so I don\u2019t say anything. Instead, I excuse myself to call Tally.</p><p>\u201cAny news?\u201d I ask him. He sighs into the phone.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not happy, but there\u2019s not much to be done about it. They\u2019ll delay filming and they\u2019ll film as much as they can without you. They\u2019re wanting you to come home on the weekends though, to film. You\u2019re gonna have to make that work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my lawyers on it,\u201d I answer. \u201cI can\u2019t see that would be a problem. I don\u2019t have to be at Joe\u2019s on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like, anyway?\u201d Tally asks curiously. \u201cCommunity service?\u201d</p><p>I think about the dingy gym and roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d I answer sarcastically. \u201cYou should come and help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, I think I\u2019ll just see you when you get your ass back here. Hurry it up. I\u2019ll tell the studio to expect you soon. I know Amy Ashby is pissed. This is going to throw off her schedule for her next film, too. You\u2019re going to have to smooth things over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually at my brother\u2019s tonight,\u201d I tell him grudgingly. \u201cI could\u2019ve seen her, but I\u2019ll do it another time. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never in the mood,\u201d Tally grumbles. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s also true. If Amy had her way, we\u2019d rehearse our sex scenes in my trailer, down to licking each other\u2019s nipples and getting each other off. But I don\u2019t feel the need. And I just don\u2019t fucking want to. She\u2019s another one of those high-maintenance party girls who needs attention all the time. I just can\u2019t deal with that.</p><p>I hang up and head back down the hall, glancing at the framed family pictures as I pass. Pics of me, Sin, Duncan, Kira, Fiona, Cris... and Emma.</p><p>I stop for a second, the air whooshing from my lungs as I stare at Emma\u2019s sparkling blue eyes staring back at me from one particularly painful picture.</p><p>She\u2019s tanned and healthy, and she\u2019s wrapped her arm around my neck a second before my mom snapped the picture of us in our graduation caps. It was the last picture we\u2019d taken together.</p><p>It was the last picture she\u2019d ever take.</p><p>A knot forms in my throat as I stare at the necklace she\u2019s wearing, a gift I had given her. A happy-graduation/I-love-you/can\u2019t-wait-to-go-to-college-with-you gift. A teardrop-shaped aquamarine that perfectly matches the color of her eyes is encased in a white shell that she\u2019d plucked from Lake Michigan. I\u2019d had it made especially for her, and she\u2019d worn it until the day she died.</p><p>I reach into my pocket and wrap my fingers around it, feeling the cool stone.</p><p>Her parents gave it to me afterward, and I\u2019ve carried it in my pocket every day since... because it reminds me.</p><p>Of everything.</p><p>I gulp and yank my hand away from it, like it\u2019s a hot coal that will burn me. My problem is that I\u2019m stuck in limbo... I don\u2019t want to remember and I don\u2019t want to forget. If I remember, it hurts like hell. But if I forget, it might happen again.</p><p>And that\u2019s one thing I know for sure.</p><p>I\u2019ll never let myself get fucked over like that again.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Dominic</p><p>As I head down the main hall to find my mom, I\u2019m startled when Cris steps out of the kitchen doorway. I stop in my tracks for a moment, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cCare to come outside? I\u2019d like to talk to you,\u201d he says gruffly, his voice hesitant and filled with a thousand things I can\u2019t name.</p><p>His eye is swollen, which gives me some satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you,\u201d I answer finally. \u201cSo, no thanks.\u201d</p><p>I start to brush past him, but he grabs my arm in an effort to get me to stay. I look at him sharply, straight in the eye, a get-your-fucking-hand-off-me look, and he loosens his grip. I guess he learned his lesson the other night.</p><p>Fiona pops ups behind him, her face cautious and sullen.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Cris adds. \u201cYou need to hear this, but I don\u2019t think we should talk about it in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I tell him abruptly, pushing past him to the dining room. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dick,\u201d Fiona snaps after me. But I ignore her. I just keep walking until I find my mom and I pause to kiss her on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cI love you, but I won\u2019t come here when he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She protests and grabs at me, but I walk past her, out into the yard and to my car. I ignore the way Fiona yells after me angrily, the way Cris stares at me as I leave, and the disappointed expression on my father\u2019s face. I ignore it all.</p><p>Because I\u2019m Dominic fucking Kinkaide and nothing bothers me. Nothing touches me, because I won\u2019t let it.</p><p>Against my will, my eyes sting and I know they\u2019re red. I rub at them and then fire up the engine. Even though it\u2019s only nine P.M. and Sin\u2019s party will be going full force soon, I head back there... because I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go.</p><p>There\u2019s about a million cars lined up on Sin\u2019s property when I get there, and I almost want to turn around and drive back out. But I don\u2019t. Instead, I park in the garage and make my way into the house, picking my way through the dark.</p><p>I wind through the crowded rooms, making my way around the perimeter toward the staircase. As I reach the bottom step, I feel someone watching and I glance to the side.</p><p>Jacey is standing still in the middle of the room, dressed in her uniform, letting a party guest lick salt off of her forearm for a tequila shot. She\u2019s heavily made up tonight: thick mascara, red lipstick. She smiles up at him with those red lips, a fake smile, and as she does, she catches sight of me.</p><p>She freezes in shock, although, what the fuck? I\u2019m the one living here temporarily. I belong here, she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Suddenly, a guy comes rushing up to me, someone I don\u2019t know. A very drunk someone.</p><p>\u201cDude, can you sign my shirt for my girlfriend? If I take home your autograph, I\u2019ll get laid for a month.\u201d</p><p>He grabs at my arm and I shake him off in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cDude. If you were lucky enough to get invited here, then you should know not to approach anyone for autographs.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not usually so rude to fans. But my mood gets the better of me. The guy stares at me, stunned, and I continue on my way. As I do, I feel Jacey\u2019s gaze.</p><p>She pulls her arm away from the guy, sets down her tray of shots, and makes a beeline for me.</p><p>I turn my back on her, intent on continuing up the stairs without acknowledging her, but she won\u2019t have it. She grabs my arm, forcing me to look at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she demands. \u201cThat was pretty harsh.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at her, into her brown eyes, and find her to be sincerely concerned. I must look seriously rattled if she noticed that something is wrong. She barely knows me. Her fingers are warm on my arm, and for a minute I waver.</p><p>She\u2019s warm and soft and concerned. I know what that might turn into.</p><p>A wild night that will make me feel better.</p><p>Women are all the same: they want to fix what is broken and they\u2019re willing to do anything to accomplish that. I never talk about my past or anything at all about me, but women can still sense that I\u2019m fucked up. What they don\u2019t understand... is that I\u2019m unfixable.</p><p>I stare down at her again, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>But she looks at me again, really looks at me, her brown eyes probing mine. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter to you?\u201d I ask before I can stop myself.</p><p>Because something about her makes me think that it does somehow matter to her, and not just because I\u2019m Dominic Kinkaide. Everything I\u2019ve seen of Jacey is wild and untamed... she works for Saffron, pushes cops around, gets dressed in parking lots, and lets men lick salt off her body for tequila shots.</p><p>Yet at the same time, she seems warm and real. I haven\u2019t forgotten how she shoved her way in between Cris and I and shielded my body with her own. She\u2019s a puzzle.</p><p>Jacey looks confused by my question.</p><p>\u201cIt matters because you\u2019re not some stranger off the street. You look seriously upset. Of course I\u2019m going to ask you if you\u2019re all right. Who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Most of the people I know in Hollywood, I think.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say it. Instead, I turn my back and start up the stairs again. I don\u2019t fucking answer to her or anyone else.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d Jacey\u2019s voice is hesitant behind me. \u201cAn ice pack or anything? That bruise on your cheek looks like it still hurts.\u201d</p><p>I pause, not looking at her. Instead I remember her bare leg, stretching toward the sky while her tiny uniform shorts slide over it. The mere memory of the way she\u2019d undressed right out in the open sets my pulse to racing.</p><p>Yeah, there\u2019s a bunch of things I need, but only one thing that will take my mind off the reason that I need them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I need something.\u201d</p><p>There is a moment of silence between us, then another.</p><p>Finally she asks, \u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>I turn back around slowly, looking her up and down until my eyes freeze upon hers and stay there. Hers are dark and sincere, waiting for me to say something. She has no idea what kind of person I am. She has no idea that I\u2019m just a shell, completely empty inside.</p> <p>If she did, she would run far, far away.</p><p>I stare into her eyes as I move closer, and she doesn\u2019t look away.</p><p>I step back down until we\u2019re on the same step and her back is against the wall. I press against her, close enough that my rigid dick digs into her hip.</p><p>With my mouth mere centimeters from her ear, I say, \u201cYou. Spread-eagled and tied up on my bed. That would do for a start.\u201d</p><p>The mere thought of that, of how I\u2019d shove my dick in her mouth and let her suck me off while her hands were bound, makes me hard.</p> <p>Jacey sucks in a breath, but remains frozen. Her breath comes quickly, and mine is hot against her neck. I know it because I can feel it on my own lips. What I don\u2019t know is why I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>Or why she hasn\u2019t said no yet.</p><p>Disgusted with myself and her, I turn away.</p><p>\u201cForget it. Go home. You don\u2019t want to play with me tonight, little girl. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Jacey</p><p>Oh my god. What an asshole.</p> <p>I don\u2019t watch Dominic walk away. Instead, I make my way back through the main hall, my cheeks flushed scarlet. I\u2019m better than this. After Jared made me look like a weak-ass needy wench, I swore to myself I would have more self-respect.</p><p>I don\u2019t get used. Not anymore.</p><p>That Jacey is long gone, buried in a pile of therapist bills.</p><p>Then why didn\u2019t I say no to Dominic\u2019s ridiculous request?</p><p>Because for a brief second, I envisioned what being tied up on his bed would be like and warmth flooded my panties. Holy shit, I\u2019m only human. And I\u2019m a hot-blooded female.</p><p>And Dominic is Dominic.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen him in enough movies, in enough love scenes, to know that his hands are magic. Even though he was acting, there was always such sensuality in his movement, in his eyes.</p><p>His eyes.</p> <p>That darkness in Dominic\u2019s eyes... it does things to me. It makes me wonder what he\u2019s capable of. Or what I would be capable of with him. I can practically feel his whispers on my neck in the dark, his hands scraping my back, his fingertips scratching into me.</p><p>Oh my god. My cheeks flush even more. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s come over me, but it needs to stop.</p><p>Dominic is trouble. And I don\u2019t need any more trouble in my life. I\u2019m turning over a new leaf and I\u2019m making good choices. Dominic Kinkaide is a bad, bad choice.</p><p>Because Dominic Kinkaide does bad, bad things. I can see it in his eyes.</p><p>On a whim, I turn and glance behind me, searching for him in the crowd. He isn\u2019t hard to find.</p><p>He\u2019s standing at the top of the stairs overlooking the main floor like it\u2019s his kingdom, his arm wrapped around a slender brunette. In the ten seconds since I left him on the stairs, he\u2019s already found another woman to fuck with.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s eyes meet mine and the green in his seems to smolder as he very slowly, very purposefully grabs the girl\u2019s ass and grips it hard, pulling her into him, grinding her hips into his crotch.</p><p>The girl wraps her arms around his neck, burying her face there, inhaling him, and for a minute I wonder what that must be like. To be so close to someone so... dark. Someone who commands a room so totally and completely.</p><p>Dominic still hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off mine, and I know that he\u2019s doing this for my benefit. He\u2019s showing me what I could\u2019ve had tonight, if I\u2019d just said yes.</p><p>His eyes burn me.</p><p>So I do the only thing I can do to retain any little bit of self-respect.</p><p>I walk away.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Jacey</p><p>The sunshine is bright as I collapse into the seat of my car with my coffee and my purse. How the hell did morning come so fast? God. Is there anything worse than mornings?</p><p>I turn the key and realize that, yes, something is worse.</p><p>A morning when your car doesn\u2019t start and you\u2019re supposed to be on time for Joe\u2019s Gladiators or \u201cyou can forget about coming back in\u201d is worse.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of shit.\u201d I berate my car as I turn the key again and again. But there\u2019s nothing. Only a depressing click that announces in its mechanical way that my engine is not only dead, it\u2019s really fucking dead.</p><p>Poor Brand. Because I do the only thing I ever know to do nowadays. I reach for my phone and call him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he groans sleepily, forgoing a hello.</p><p>I quickly explain my predicament, and true to form, like a knight in a big-ass shining F-150, he rides to my rescue with a droll expression and bed-head.</p><p>I smile sheepishly as I climb into the truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to bother you,\u201d I tell him truthfully. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what to do. I have no idea what\u2019s wrong with my car and I could take the El, but I\u2019m not sure where the closest stop is to the gym, and if I\u2019m late, I\u2019m done. Joe doesn\u2019t put up with that.\u201d</p><p>Brand shakes his head as he pulls back out into traffic. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019d rather you not get into trouble again. Who needs sleep anyway?\u201d His voice is husky and rough and if I had any doubts that I\u2019d woken him up, I\u2019d be over them now as I listen to his sleepy voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell him again. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for your coffee this morning. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Brand grins at me good-naturedly. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window, watching the Chicago bustle as it passes by. So far, there\u2019s no sign of the odd look that I\u2019d seen in Brand\u2019s eyes the other night, and for that I\u2019m thankful. I really, really just need for us to be normal. Unfortunately for Brand, normal always entails saving me from something.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever get tired of bailing me out?\u201d I muse aloud. \u201cI know Gabe used to lecture me all the time. You never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m a saint,\u201d Brand announces as he turns onto a side street and heads his big truck toward the gym. \u201cYou can ask anyone.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cI don\u2019t have to ask anyone. You put up with me, so you should definitely be canonized. I\u2019m gonna have to talk to the pope about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Catholic,\u201d Brand points out as he turns into Joe\u2019s parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answer. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to turn on my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d Brand shakes his head. \u201cNo need to give the man a heart attack. I\u2019ll be back to pick you up tonight. Call a tow truck to come get your car.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m kissing his cheek when I hear the roar of a car pull up next to us. The sound of that engine, powerful and loud, is unmistakable, and I know before I even look that it\u2019s Dom.</p><p>I murmur good-bye to Brand and glance at Dom as I climb from the truck. I can feel Brand staring after me, but I ignore it. I can\u2019t think about Brand at all, because frankly, whenever Dominic is near, he owns the vicinity.</p><p>He\u2019s dressed in black today: dark washed jeans and a tight black T-shirt that skims his chest just right. His green eyes somehow even look black as he stares at me, waiting for me to walk past. He takes in everything... the way I kissed Brand, the way I move from the truck, the way I try not to look at him.</p><p>His lip twitches, and once again I get the feeling that he knows me. Everything about me. It\u2019s disconcerting.</p><p>I walk past him and he follows. I can feel every step he takes, his presence behind me a tangible thing, like a force field of sexiness and arrogance. I do my best to ignore it.</p><p>When we reach the door, I pause, and he reaches around to grab it, opening it for me. As he does, I catch a whiff of his scent, something unique to him. Musky yet spicy, totally male. I inhale deeply as I walk in, never once looking back at him, even when I mutter thank you for holding the door.</p><p>I\u2019m not falling for his sexier-than-thou attitude. Spread-eagled on his bed, my ass. He can kiss my ass right now.</p><p>I think I hear him chuckle as I lift my nose in the air, but I\u2019m not sure. And I don\u2019t care. I make a beeline for Joe\u2019s office to find out what he wants me to do. Dominic follows me at a respectable distance, and together we get our marching orders from Joe, who seems especially crusty today.</p><p>\u201cI want you to clean out the locker room,\u201d he tells Dominic tiredly before he looks at me. \u201cAnd Jacey, you can help weigh the boys. We\u2019ve got to get their weights logged so that they\u2019re official for the week. The clipboard is over there and the scale is in the locker room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask him hesitantly as I reach for the clipboard. \u201cYou seem... tired.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, his steely eyes cloudy. \u201cDo I also seem like I have ovaries? If I want to chat like a girl, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Burn.</p><p>My cheeks explode at the put-down, and I can practically feel Dominic smirking at me. I know Joe\u2019s bark is worse than his bite... but god. His bark is pretty bad.</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d I answer quietly as I head for the locker room.</p><p>Dominic follows me silently.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mention Joe\u2019s bad mood, and I don\u2019t either. I\u2019m grateful for his silence because I feel a little humiliated at the moment. There\u2019s nothing worse than putting yourself out there, only to get stomped on.</p><p>We set to work, Dominic cleaning the walls and metal lockers, and me weighing giant, sweaty boys.</p><p>The entire time, I know exactly where Dominic is in the locker room, even if I\u2019m not looking at him. I feel him. I feel his presence in relation to mine. I hear his breath, his movements. I smell his cologne. I\u2019m aware of him. Regardless of how determined I am to ignore him, there\u2019s electricity between us, and I can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not there.</p><p>I know he feels it too, because every time I do glance at him, he seems to be looking at me, his dark, dark eyes holding something in them that I can\u2019t describe.</p><p>I gulp and scribble down a weight, then motion the next boy to step up.</p><p>Jake grins at me as he pretends to shield himself, his big boyish hands splayed in front of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna kick me today, are ya?\u201d He laughs as he steps onto the scale. I move the counterbalance to get his accurate weight and roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cTwo-eighteen. And no, not unless you try to grope me again.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and steps off. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to grope you. That was just me saying hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d I sniff as I log his weight. \u201cTry saying it with your mouth next time, instead of your hands.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles again. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, Jacey. For a chick.\u201d</p><p>I sniff again, but I smile at him this time. Joe did say that I just needed to show them who\u2019s boss. The other boys seemed to have learned from Jake\u2019s mistake, because they\u2019re all friendly to me now, and maybe even a little nervous. I smile at that thought and motion another boy up.</p><p>Time passes quickly, and before I know it, Joe comes in.</p><p>\u201cYou two.\u201d He motions toward Dom and me. \u201cCome with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We glance at each other, but follow Joe\u2019s lumbering steps as he leads us into the gym\u2019s kitchen. It\u2019s a large, older room with crudded-up corners and yellowed counter tops.</p><p>\u201cThe kids out there, they don\u2019t usually have enough to eat,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI try to make sure that they get something here, an after-school snack, I call it. But really, it\u2019s a meal. The walk-in needs to be cleaned up and the food needs to be organized. Throw anything bad out, but only if it\u2019s bad. I\u2019m not made of money, and we need to be judicious with supplies. Got it?\u201d</p><p>We both nod, and I\u2019m impressed once again with Joe\u2019s heart, even if he did snap my head off.</p><p>He leaves us and Dom and I look around.</p> <p>\u201cWell, fuck.\u201d Dom sighs, glancing at the dented-in cooler door. \u201cThis is going to take a while.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOh, well. I\u2019d rather be busy than sitting around counting down the minutes till we go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay then. After you, Princess.\u201d Dom gestures with a shrug, holding open the heavy metal door, allowing me to go first. \u201cDon\u2019t trip on the rust. Jesus. I think these appliances were made in 1940.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. The cooler is a relic, old and creaky. I don\u2019t even like to be near it, much less in it.</p><p>As we step inside, I automatically shiver, running my hands over my goose-bump-covered arms as I look around at the haphazardly stacked shelves of food. It smells like stale food, standing water, and armpits in here.</p> <p>\u201cGod. I don\u2019t think this place has been cleaned since 1940, either.\u201d</p><p>I poke at the food, some of it outdated and some of it fresh, and Dom sighs. \u201cWell, this is gonna take a while. I can see that. We forgot the bucket and sponges. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He turns back toward the dented door, but when he pushes down the handle, nothing happens.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he mutters. He wiggles it harder, then puts his weight into it. I stare at him, dumbfounded, watching him struggle to open the door. Finally, he turns around and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re locked in here.\u201d</p><p>I try not to freak out as I shrug and stare at the locked door.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Joe will come hunting for us before he leaves. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>But Joe doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And it\u2019s not okay.</p><p>It\u2019s freaking cold. It\u2019s small. It smells like a swamp. And we\u2019re trapped.</p><p>We straighten the food on the shelves in an effort to move around so that we don\u2019t get too cold as we wait, but eventually we run out of things to do. And I\u2019ve got goose bumps on every plane of my body, and still Joe doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>I bang on the door, the cold metal stinging my hands, but no one hears. I shout. But no one hears. I even kick the door. No one hears and no one comes. Finally, I slide to the floor dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cCan we freeze to death in here?\u201d I look up at Dominic, who is leaning against the wall, apparently calm.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNah. It\u2019s a cooler, not a freezer. It won\u2019t be comfortable, but we won\u2019t die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen do you think someone will find us?\u201d My voice is small and Dominic glances at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t know if Joe walks around and does a final check before he goes home at night, or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I sigh, letting my head fall backward against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Dominic tell me as he slides down to sit next to me, letting his head rest against the wall, too.</p><p>\u201cFuuuck.\u201d I draw the word out for maximum impact. But it doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. For a second, the walls close in around me until something occurs to me.</p><p>\u201cMy cell phone!\u201d I blurt, suddenly remembering that we\u2019re in the twenty-first century. I pull it out of my pocket, but am dejected yet again to find that I don\u2019t have a signal.</p><p>I look over to find Dominic shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have a signal either. These walls on this cooler are thick and metal. Nothing\u2019s getting through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the universe might be throwing us together,\u201d I finally answer, putting my cell back in my pocket.</p><p>I\u2019m kidding, but Dominic smirks again, his trademark smirk... the one that made him famous. Even now he seems cool and calm, which is exactly the opposite of how I feel.</p><p>\u201cLike fate?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in it. And if there is a Fate, she\u2019s a cruel bitch.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him because there\u2019s something in his face now, something vulnerable, just for a second. Something hurt. But then he covers it up and once again, he\u2019s a closed book. I can\u2019t help but be intrigued by these glimpses. There\u2019s so much more to Dominic Kinkaide than anyone knows. I can feel it.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re stuck in here together. We might as well get to know each other,\u201d I tell him, in large part because of that look in his eye. \u201cBecause god only knows how long we\u2019ll be here, and the silence is killing me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic is already shaking his head. \u201cNo, thanks. I don\u2019t care to see the details of my life splashed across the tabloids tomorrow. But thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms over his chest and settles down, closing his eyes.</p><p>I shake my head, feeling a little sad at his outlook on life. \u201cIt must suck to be you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cTo always think the worst of people. You should know, not everyone is out to use you. Or exploit you. Just FYI.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes, raising an eyebrow. \u201cReally? It\u2019s been my experience that generally, someone wants something from me. I\u2019m a big one to learn from past experiences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you are,\u201d I answer wryly. \u201cToo bad it seems like not many of them were good.\u201d</p><p>Dominic scowls as he tries to get more comfortable on the floor next to me, his long legs crossing at the ankles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me. You only know what my publicist manufactures for the public. Everything you know about me is engineered, perfectly placed, perfectly timed. It\u2019s all a game, Princess. The masses just don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>The masses. As if the rest of the world is completely separate from him. Apparently, I\u2019m part of the masses, along with everyone else, while Dominic is alone. In his mind, it\u2019s Dominic against the world.</p><p>Suddenly, I really do feel sorry for him. He might be rich, and he might be gorgeous, but he wears the utter weariness of his life on his face. It\u2019s clearly way too much for someone his age. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a hundred years old and he\u2019s just tired of it all.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you don\u2019t like your life, you can change it,\u201d I tell him, my lip shivering with the cold. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the world on a string. You can do anything you want. You realize that, right?\u201d</p><p>Dominic stares at me, his green eyes gleaming in a dangerous way. \u201cWe work together for a couple days and you think you know me now?\u201d</p><p>I ignore his sharp tone. \u201cNo. Of course not. But I know of you. And I can see a lot on your face. More than you\u2019d probably like for me to.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, his gaze unreadable. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, appraising him. \u201cYou\u2019re jaded. And dark. And something has hurt you badly, something in your past. You think you\u2019re all alone and you\u2019re tired of everything.\u201d</p><p>Dominic breathes sharply, not taking his eyes off of mine. \u201cYou think you can see all that?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, not breaking our gaze. \u201cI know that I can. Want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Dominic chuckles now, a humorless laugh. \u201cHell, no. Like I said, I don\u2019t need to see shit about myself in the tabloids. They publish enough lies about me. I don\u2019t need to give them truths to work with. Nice try, though.\u201d</p><p>I can feel heat from his body emanating from him and I scoot a bit closer.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him when he glances at me. \u201cI\u2019m freaking cold. And you\u2019re warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he answers, lifting his arm to wrap it around my shoulders. \u201cBut no pictures. I don\u2019t want this on any form of social media. Trust me, you don\u2019t either. They\u2019ll hound you for weeks.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI know that might be what you\u2019re used to, but taking a picture with you is the last thing on my mind at this point. All I can care about is not losing my fingers and toes to hypothermia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone told ever you that you\u2019re a bit melodramatic?\u201d Dominic asks dryly, although his arm does tighten a bit around my shoulders.</p><p>I chuckle, but don\u2019t reply. I enjoy sitting with him for several minutes before the silence starts to gnaw at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay. This quiet is killing me. You might not want to talk,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to distract myself. Let\u2019s play Twenty Questions.\u201d</p><p>Dominic rolls his eyes, then closes them. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good childhood?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>I chew on my lip. \u201cOkay. Have you ever had a crush on a costar?\u201d</p><p>I look at him, but he still doesn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he answers again.</p><p>I hesitate, dying to ask him something, but terrified to do it. But in typical Jacey Vincent fashion, I barge ahead and do it anyway. \u201cThat girl you were with at the party... was that Emma?\u201d</p><p>He completely tenses up, I can see every muscle freeze as he opens his eyes and stares at me. \u201cHow do you know about Emma?\u201d</p><p>The look on his face is almost frightening in its intensity. \u201cYour sister mentioned her the night we met,\u201d I answer slowly. \u201cYou were smacked in the head, so you probably don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>I watch a myriad of things cross his face\u2014confusion, sadness, pain, and something else dark that I can\u2019t identify\u2014before he finally shakes his head. \u201cNo. And I have no other fucking comment.\u201d</p><p>The mood around us has turned as dark as Dominic\u2019s expression, and I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. His reaction is fascinating, but I\u2019m sure not going to press him for more, not if the mere mention of the girl turns his mood so black. So instead I change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like being Sin Kinkaide\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me drolly now, the ugliness gone from his eyes. \u201cYou should ask him what it\u2019s like to be my brother.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, amused by his arrogance. \u201cI would, but I\u2019m trapped in here with you, not him. And you\u2019re not cooperating in this game.\u201d</p><p>Dominic smiles slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re very astute, Princess. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to play. Unless I get to ask you the questions. That would be more fun.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cFine. Shoot. You ask me, I\u2019ll answer.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cAre you high maintenance?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThat\u2019s an easy one. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you dream in color?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not even trying now. I think everyone dreams in color. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone dreaming in black and white. In fact, I had the weirdest dream the other night, and it was in full color. I dreamed that it was raining, but that the raindrops turned into pink rose petals. And then when I looked at the ground, it was covered in a foot of petals, just like snow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dominic raises an eyebrow. \u201cSo, you romanticize precipitation. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI romanticize everything. That\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019ll probably get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cI think I already told you. It\u2019s my nature to like trouble. I\u2019m trying not to, but it goes against my grain. Next question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you get between me and Cris? You could\u2019ve been seriously hurt... even more than you were.\u201d</p><p>Dominic is staring at me now with interest, genuine curiosity in his eyes. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a human being,\u201d I answer. \u201cI think anyone would step in and try to keep two people from killing each other. It\u2019s the decent thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you decent?\u201d Dominic\u2019s lip twitches.</p><p>I smile. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you and your last boyfriend break up? Was he trouble?\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. His abrupt change of direction sends a knife through my gut, because the answer to that question is ugly.</p><p>Jared was definitely trouble and he killed someone I love.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say that. Instead, I murmur, \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>Dominic rolls his eyes. \u201cThen this game isn\u2019t so fun. Why don\u2019t you just tell me about your childhood or some shit?\u201d</p><p>So I do. Anything to get what Jared did out of my head... To not think of those images. The crumpled truck, the blood spatters, the screams when Maddy came to the accident scene.</p> <p>I talk myself blue in the face to get that shit out of my head.</p><p>I tell Dom about my childhood and what it was like growing up with Gabe and my suck-ass parents. I tell him about Brand and how he\u2019s always been like my brother. I tell him how I used to work in the summers for my best friend, Maddy, but then she married my brother and moved to Connecticut. When I pause to take a breath, Dom has his eyes open again, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cThat big blond guy is like your brother?\u201d he asks doubtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange sibling relationship.\u201d</p><p>His tone is weird and I narrow my eyes. \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNothing. I just sense some incest there, is all.\u201d</p><p>I literally shudder. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking gross. Brand taught me to ride a bike.\u201d</p><p>Dom just looks at me. \u201cAll I know is that the way that guy looks at you is far from brotherly. I know what I know.\u201d</p><p>A weird feeling passes through me, because I have been ignoring that new look in Brand\u2019s eye. I keep hoping that I\u2019ll never see it again, but deep down, I know that I will. And deep down, I know that Dom is right.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice of you to notice,\u201d I tell him snippily. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. And you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rarely wrong,\u201d he answers arrogantly. I can see that he really believes that.</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone around you always tell you what you want to hear?\u201d I demand. \u201cDo they tell you that you\u2019re a genius, that you\u2019re perfect, and that you\u2019re never wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>Because he already knows. I gag a little and roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHave they ever told you that you\u2019re arrogant?\u201d</p><p>He nods, the corner of his mouth twitching a bit. \u201cThat might have been mentioned,\u201d he admits. I can tell that he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>I settle more fully into the crook of his arm, enjoying the way his woodsy scent envelops me, even in the cold air.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to film a movie?\u201d I ask conversationally, changing the subject.</p><p>I have to talk about something or I\u2019ll go out of my mind. I could swear the cooler has gotten smaller since we\u2019ve been trapped in here. Dominic closes his eyes again and his fingers rest against my side. I don\u2019t think he even notices, but I certainly do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a people person, but even though millions of people see me onscreen, it doesn\u2019t seem like that when we\u2019re filming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re an introvert?\u201d I ask with interest.</p><p>He nods without opening his eyes. \u201cMost definitely. My brothers got the extrovert genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The badass rockers. They definitely seem to love the limelight. Is that it... two brothers and one sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he nods. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAll I have is Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s the only one who counts because your parents are worthless?\u201d Dominic asks with interest, repeating my words from earlier. It\u2019s the first time he actually seems interested.</p><p>\u201cSo you were listening!\u201d I nudge him. And he smiles. A real smile, the first time I\u2019ve seen it on him. I decide that it\u2019s well worth the wait. His smile almost warms the room up all by itself, like the heavens opened up and the light shone down on us through the clouds.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but listen,\u201d he tells me, his eyes almost warm. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to shut up and I can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I giggle and he smiles, and for a second we seem like friends.</p><p>\u201cWhy exactly are your parents worthless?\u201d he asks after a minute. I\u2019m surprised that he would go out of his way to ask, so even though it makes me uncomfortable, I answer.</p><p>\u201cMy mom never really wanted to be a mom and she\u2019s not good at it. When she and my dad got divorced, she took it as an opportunity to do whatever she wants to do. She has a new boyfriend every week. I rarely hear from my dad. He always thought it was enough to just send my mom a child-support check.\u201d</p><p>A stab of pain slices through me as I admit it out loud. It\u2019s like announcing to the world, Hey, there\u2019s something so wrong with me that my parents don\u2019t care if I\u2019m alive. But Dominic doesn\u2019t seem to see it that way.</p><p>\u201cTheir loss,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what I tell myself whenever I hear a bad review or someone totally disses me. It\u2019s their loss. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really believe that, then I admire you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve got thinner skin than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s your first mistake,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to grow some thick skin. Or some balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got balls,\u201d I announce. \u201cThey\u2019re made of steel.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughs. \u201cReally? This I\u2019ve got to see.\u201d</p><p>In a flurry of sudden movement, his arm snakes around my waist, finding its way to my crotch. With one hand on my back holding me in place, he strokes me with the other, just for a second. The heat from his palm melds with the heat between my legs, and a million needles shoot down into my legs, weakening my knees.</p><p>I gasp and my eyes meet his, and I\u2019m frozen as my heart pounds and my fingers shake.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that you don\u2019t, in fact, have balls,\u201d he tells me quietly, without removing his hand from my crotch.</p><p>\u201cIt was a figure of speech,\u201d I croak needlessly, although of course he knows that. \u201cYou can move your hand now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, can I?\u201d His voice is velvet, smooth as butter.</p><p>Instead of moving it away, his fingers move against me and my nerve endings burst into flame, spreading a fire from my crotch to my thighs to my chest.</p><p>Why aren\u2019t I moving away from him?</p><p>The simple answer is: I don\u2019t want to. I should want to... Dominic Kinkaide is an asshole most of the time. But holy shit, he\u2019s a sexy asshole. And to be quite honest, I don\u2019t think I could move to save my life. It\u2019s like I\u2019m suspended here, dangling from the tips of his fingers.</p><p>He lowers his head and his lips graze my ear.</p><p>\u201cStill want me to move? Because I know an excellent way to keep warm.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitches again, at the intimacy in his tone, at the warmth of his lips, at the way my heart has taken off in my chest. I open my mouth to say something and nothing comes out.</p><p>Dominic moves his fingers again, rubbing me on the outside of my pants, urging me toward a precipice that I\u2019m not sure I want to climb toward. Not with him. Yet I can\u2019t move away. I gulp.</p><p>\u201cYou want to,\u201d he says knowingly. \u201cYou\u2019re wet. I can feel it through your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Very purposefully, just like he does everything else, he holds his fingers up like a trophy, his eyes glued to mine. As I watch in astonishment, he raises them to his nose and inhales them.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling warm yet?\u201d</p><p>I watch his lips as he speaks the words, husky and low. His lips are full yet manly, and suddenly I ache to lean over and press mine to his, to touch them in any way that I can.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>Because I\u2019m not a girl who gets used. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><p>But Dominic takes that as a challenge. He\u2019s not used to hearing the word no and he\u2019s not about to start now. I see that in his dark eyes a scant moment before he dips his head and consumes my mouth.</p><p>I say consume instead of kiss, because that\u2019s what he does.</p><p>He consumes me.</p><p>His lips are fiery and hot and he kisses me with a fierceness that touches a secret part of me, moist, hot, firm, sexy. I want to inhale him, to suck him down. I vaguely feel his hands on my back, his warmth emanating through my clothes, his hardness pushing into my softness.</p><p>I\u2019m breathless when he pulls away.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d</p><p>For the life of me, I\u2019m afraid to answer that. Instead I pull away, just a bit, just enough that there is some space between us, but I can still absorb his warmth. As my teeth chatter, both from the cold and from the sudden absence of his lips, I answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, a husky, low, naughty sound.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, I\u2019m drawn back in... in toward his sexy smile, his arrogant gaze, and his knowing smirk. He\u2019s bad for me. Very bad for me. I\u2019ve got to remember that.</p><p>He will decimate you, I tell myself.</p><p>But my problem is, every time I look into his dark eyes and see the mysterious things that lurk there, I forget that. I forget everything that is supposed to matter.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Dominic</p><p>Burying my hand in Jacey\u2019s crotch makes my balls swell and my dick harden.</p><p>It\u2019s true.</p><p>The idea that she\u2019s good turns my thoughts to a place I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about. It makes me want to find out how good she actually is.</p><p>Jacey stares at me in fascination, and for some reason I want to bask in that look, to lay in it for hours, to soak it in. Mainly because she\u2019s not looking at me that way because of who I am; she\u2019s looking at me because of how I\u2019m making her feel. Her eyes are wide and innocent and soft.</p><p>I like that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get warm, Jacey,\u201d I suggest, my meaning very clear as my hand slides to her thigh, where my fingers dig into her leg, kneading it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she stammers. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the cooler door opens, bringing with it a rush of warm air. The humidity of it hits me in the face and I raise my head (and my hand) in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Joe barks, his harsh voice a sharp interruption as he sticks his gray head in and glares at us, as if we chose to be stuck in here. \u201cGet out of there. We\u2019ve been hunting for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacey\u2019s startled brown eyes meet mine, then she looks at Joe.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Joe,\u201d she tells him as she scrambles to her feet. \u201cWe got locked in. Thank you for rescuing us.\u201d</p><p>He stares at her, then at me. \u201cThere better not be any funny business going on under this roof,\u201d he finally says. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for that\u2014and it\u2019s not here and now.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s cheeks flush bright red, and for a split second I think about what would have happened if Joe had shown up a few minutes earlier and found me with my hand buried between Jacey\u2019s legs.</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure he would\u2019ve considered that \u201cfunny business,\u201d although it was far from funny. Far from funny. Somehow, being locked in that tiny room with her made me lower my guard. I forgot, for a minute, who she is and who I am. Who we are in relation to each other\u2014and the answer to that is nothing. We\u2019re nothing to each other.</p><p>We follow Joe out and I keep my eyes glued to his plaid-covered back, my resolve returning. I can feel Jacey staring at me, but I don\u2019t return the look. She almost sucked me in back there, with her soft eyes and her laugh that seems genuine.</p><p>That\u2019s not gonna happen, though. Fuck that. I steel myself against it, against her, pissed at myself for my moment of weakness. I don\u2019t get involved with people. Jesus.</p><p>\u201cYour ride\u2019s here,\u201d Joe tells Jacey, turning a bit to look at her. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that big dude coming in to look for you, you\u2019d have been stuck in here all night. You\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>Lucky. As we follow him through the gym and then say good-bye and head out to the parking lot, I don\u2019t know if lucky is what I feel, even if I am pissed with myself for momentarily lowering my guard.</p> <p>As I watch Jacey approach that big-ass truck of her \u201calmost-brother\u2019s,\u201d I can\u2019t help but marvel at how different she is from everyone else I know.</p><p>Yet at the same time, she\u2019s the same. Because she greets the blond hulk with a kiss on the cheek, and as she turns her head and I look into her eyes, I see that I was right. The guy is seriously into her, and she knows it.</p><p>And still she lets him haul her around, using him for what he can give her.</p><p>Typical woman.</p><p>I sigh and open my car door, and for the briefest of seconds I know that something isn\u2019t right. There\u2019s a shadow in my car, something in the dark that shouldn\u2019t be... but I don\u2019t have time to really register that before Kira materializes in front of me as the streetlight overhead shines on her face.</p><p>Startled, I take a quick step back, my heart pounding. Kira\u2019s perched in my driver\u2019s seat, her legs curled under her as she grins widely up at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I manage to get out as I stare down at her in the dark, calming myself and pretending that she didn\u2019t just startle the shit out of me. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a thigh-length trench coat, cinched at the middle. Her cleavage is spilling from the top. From the mischievous look in her eyes, I have a feeling the coat might be the only thing she\u2019s wearing. As she unfolds herself from the car, the belt comes loose, and I get a glimpse of tan skin and nothing else.</p><p>I was right.</p><p>She leaps from the seat and presses herself against me, wrapping her arms around my neck, her skin smelling like coconut and perfume.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d she whines. \u201cI was dying of boredom out here. I wanted to surprise you, but damn. I was running out of patience. You know I don\u2019t have much in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Her curvy body folds into me and my body reacts, hardening again. The girl is wearing almost nothing, after all, and I\u2019m only human. Skin is skin and tits are tits, no matter who is wearing them. But as I look over Kira\u2019s shoulder, I find Jacey staring at us through her passenger window, and her expression is indefinable.</p><p>Hurt? Anger? Disgust? Annoyance?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I also don\u2019t know why I care.</p> <p>But I must, in some way or form, because my dick softens and I\u2019m staring after the truck as it drives away with Jacey inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kira asks suddenly, pulling away, noticing the change down below. She grabs at me, cupping my balls, kneading them, but I\u2019m not into it and my dick stays limp.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just tired. Not in the mood, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She raises a perfectly waxed eyebrow. \u201cSince when are you not in the mood to be groped in a public parking lot? I\u2019m naked under this jacket, you know. This is all for you, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>I know. For a minute, that knowledge, the knowledge that I can have Kira any time I want, weighs on me. It takes the excitement out of what might\u2019ve been a fun situation. Now, if it\u2019d been Jacey here in my car... I quickly put that out of my mind and shrug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kira. I\u2019m tired and not in the mood. I\u2019ll take a rain check.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I get into my car, leaving Kira standing alone. I roll my window down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get going,\u201d I advise her, ignoring her surprised (and pissed) expression. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>I roll the window back up, stifling her sputtering indignation. I watch her climb into her car and wait for her to start it up before I drive from the parking lot, immune to her irritation. There\u2019s one thing about me. I don\u2019t lie and I don\u2019t pussyfoot around. I\u2019m not in the mood for Kira and I\u2019m not going to lie about it.</p><p>I rev the engine, enjoying the way it vibrates my foot through the accelerator pedal. The vibration hums in my leg and the Porsche makes short work of the roads leading to Sin\u2019s house. For once, his massive house is quiet. I\u2019m relieved as I slip through the halls, thinking that for the first time ever, I\u2019m the only one here aside from the staff. However, as I walk past the main living room, I hear giggling and I pause in the darkened doorway.</p><p>Of course I\u2019m not alone. What was I thinking?</p><p>Sin raises his head from where he\u2019s lounging with two women in a mess of tangled arms and legs and bare skin. One is somehow dangling around his shoulders, and the other has her head in his lap. The room smells like sex, but for some reason he\u2019s still got his pants on. For that, I\u2019m thankful.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro,\u201d he greets me, his hair standing up in spikes. \u201cLook. Two girls\u2014one for each of us.\u201d He waves his hand as if he\u2019s bestowing the greatest gift on me, then examines the two girls. He nods at the brunette draped over his shoulders. \u201cYou can go with him.\u201d</p><p>Her face brightens at the prospect, but before she can answer, I shake my head quickly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m tired. But thanks anyway.\u201d</p><p>Before I walk away, I see Sin\u2019s index finger, the one with the thick silver ring on it, the one with the horns, disappear into the depths of the brunette\u2019s pussy. She throws her head back and moans and I can see that she has already forgotten about the idea of being with me.</p><p>Good. I turn my back on the whole thing without a backward glance. Normally, I enjoy watching. But not while my fucking brother is involved.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>I seriously might have to get my place. I don\u2019t know if I can take ninety days here.</p><p>I pad upstairs and down the hall, where I collapse onto my bed and stare at the ceiling. Try as I might to clear my mind, all I can do is think about one thing.</p><p>Jacey.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what it is about her that fascinates me so much, whether it\u2019s the fact that she doesn\u2019t give a shit who I am or whether it\u2019s the fact that she doesn\u2019t try to hide who she is. She\u2019s an open book.</p><p>You ask, I\u2019ll answer, she\u2019d said. Yet I know that there\u2019s a lot to her that I don\u2019t even know to ask about. Plus, she\u2019s not so self-involved that she demands that you listen to her talk about herself. And she doesn\u2019t care if you take her or leave her.</p><p>I flip on the stereo and turn it up to drown out my thoughts. Hard rock screams at me, thumping and loud. But it doesn\u2019t really help.</p><p>Instead, I just picture Jacey\u2019s tight ass wrapping itself around a stripper\u2019s pole to the music. No, she would probably never do such a thing in real life. But this is why a man\u2019s fantasies are so good. In my head, she\u2019ll do whatever I want her to do. And my imagination is vivid.</p><p>After a minute, there\u2019s loud banging on my door. \u201cTurn that fucking shit off! You know I hate Jagged Edge. You know they fucked with me last year at Lollapalooza.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cGo fuck something, Sin,\u201d I call back.</p><p>He bangs one more time on my door, then he\u2019s gone, and all there is the bass thumping the walls, leaving me free to think about Jacey again.</p><p>I slip my hand into my pants as I think about the way her pussy smelled, the way she folded around me, warm and soft, as I fingered her through her clothes. I picture the astonished and embarrassed look on her face when Joe barged in and I can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>Maybe one of the things I like about her is that she seems innocent at the same time as she seems wild and unrestrained. She has an almost childlike gullibility that seems so different from the people I\u2019m used to.</p><p>But one thing is for sure. If she is distracting me this much, I\u2019ve got to stop thinking about her, because I\u2019m never going to get close to anyone again. Fuck that. I\u2019ll never give anyone that kind of power over me.</p><p>Never.</p><p>Again.</p><p>I pull my hand out of my pants and roll over, closing my eyes, letting the music surround me as I get lost in the raging beat.</p><p>I think one last conscious thought before I slip away into the oblivion of sleep.</p><p>Fuck you, Emma.</p><p>Days pass at the gym and I slip into a routine, one day running into the next as I try to serve out my fucking sentence and get the hell out of this place.</p><p>Each day, I stay a respectable distance from Jacey. I\u2019m civil, but not friendly. I\u2019m detached, but I still watch her from a distance. I never acknowledge what happened in the cooler... our conversation or the intimate way I\u2019d touched her... and the way she\u2019d let me.</p><p>She fascinates the hell out of me because I can\u2019t help but want to figure her out. She\u2019s contradictory, and something about that pulls me to her. But I can\u2019t let her know that.</p><p>She seems hurt at first when I ignore her, but then she cools toward me. She makes a point of not looking at me, and whenever she can help it she avoids being in the same room with me. That\u2019s the way it ought to be.</p><p>Today, I head toward Joe\u2019s office and stop outside the door when I hear him on the phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what I owe. It\u2019s my accountant\u2019s fault. He told me what to pay and I paid it. I don\u2019t do my own taxes. What kind of fool does that?\u201d There\u2019s a pause and a sigh. \u201cYeah, I understand. One way or the other, you\u2019ll have it by the first.\u201d</p><p>The phone slams onto his desk and I\u2019m still for a moment.</p><p>No wonder Joe has been crabby lately. He\u2019s having tax trouble. I file that away in my head and round the corner, entering his office like I didn\u2019t just hear his conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demands, swirling in his chair to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to get the clipboard for the weights,\u201d I tell him, grabbing it from its hook and heading toward the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKinkaide!\u201d he barks and I pause. \u201cYou going back to California over the weekend?\u201d he demands.</p><p>I nod. \u201cJust for the weekend. My lawyers finally got it arranged. I\u2019ve got to get some filming in so the studio doesn\u2019t fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my problem,\u201d Joe answers. \u201cJust make sure you\u2019re not late to work on Monday.\u201d</p><p>So much for being nice. I nod wordlessly and head back toward the locker-room scales.</p> <p>Jacey looks up from where she\u2019s talking to a couple of the boys, Jake and Tig. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s made eye contact with me in a couple of days, and even though at first her expression is cool, her brow furrows at she stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou look pissed.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I answer, just as cool.</p><p>Jacey stares at me for a minute longer before she returns her attention to the boys, turning her body away from me.</p> <p>As she moves, I can\u2019t help but notice her slender shoulders and her tight-ass top, stretched tautly across her tits. It\u2019s impossible not to notice, and Tig can\u2019t restrain himself. I notice him continually glancing down before he yanks his gaze back up to her face. His cheeks flush red, even though no one but me notices.</p><p>When Jacey walks away a few minutes later, I follow her.</p><p>\u201cYou might not want to wear that shit here,\u201d I mention to her. I know my tone isn\u2019t friendly, but I can\u2019t help it. She\u2019s being ridiculous dressing like that in a gym for troubled teen boys.</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat shit?\u201d</p><p>I motion toward her with my hand. \u201cTight tops, short shorts. Look around you and remember where you\u2019re at. You\u2019re surrounded by teenage boys who get a hard-on in a stiff breeze. Surely you don\u2019t need attention so badly that you need to use these kids to get it.\u201d</p><p>Heat flares into her cheeks and they turn bright red as she glares at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d she demands. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot and cold. You haven\u2019t bothered to talk to me for days, and now, even though I haven\u2019t done shit to you, you don\u2019t hesitate to snap my head off for no reason. Why the hell do you care what I wear?\u201d</p><p>I feel a small twinge of guilt. She\u2019s right. It\u2019s not my business. But somewhere, in a deep down place that I don\u2019t want to acknowledge, I hate the fact that these kids are ogling her. I know what they\u2019re doing in their beds at night while they\u2019re thinking about her.</p><p>I hate that thought. I hate that in my head, she\u2019s mine to play with, mine to discard, mine to balance in the palm of my hand... just like I did in the cooler last week. In my head, she\u2019s an option... an option I can choose at any moment, but an option I\u2019d be smart to ignore.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jacey stares at me. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I shrug. \u201cI just don\u2019t want any of them to say something inappropriate to you and then get into trouble. You\u2019re inviting the wrong kind of attention, Jacey. It\u2019s not fair to them.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes. \u201cOh, it\u2019s all about them for you now, right? I can tell that by the way you never talk to any of them. You think they\u2019re beneath you\u2014just like your view on the rest of the world. You need to get over yourself.\u201d</p><p>She stomps off and I stare at her tight ass as she does.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a temper,\u201d Jake observes from where he\u2019s changing his shirt nearby. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him, a hard and level gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. You\u2019re jailbait for her.\u201d</p><p>The kid rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta lighten up, man. I was just making an observation. Jacey\u2019s badass.\u201d</p><p>He grabs his bag and ducks out of the room, and I notice something. Jacey\u2019s cell phone is lying on the bench where she was sitting as she was talking to Jake. I know it\u2019s hers by the pink flowered case.</p><p>I walk over and grab it, sliding it into my pocket. Something about it makes me smile. Pink flowers. Like her pink gun. Jake was right. Jacey\u2019s pretty badass. Yet she has a softer side. And she\u2019s all woman, sexy as hell.</p><p>She\u2019s a puzzle... and one I get more fascinated with every day. The more I think about it, the more I know what I have to do.</p><p>I just need to get to know her. If I give her a chance, she\u2019ll disappoint me, like everyone else. And then my fascination will be over and I can go about life as normal, as the jaded asshole that I am.</p><p>But a little while later, after I\u2019ve finished weighing the rest of the boys and set off to find her, I discover that she\u2019s already gone.</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend already picked her up,\u201d Joe tells me when I ask. \u201cYou\u2019re outta luck.\u201d</p><p>Her boyfriend/surrogate brother. I roll my eyes and feel oddly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI have her phone,\u201d I explain to Joe. \u201cShe left it in the locker room. I don\u2019t suppose you have her address, do you? I know she lives in Calumet Heights somewhere. I could drop it by her house on my way home. I doubt she\u2019ll want to be without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can get it for you. You should let her worry about it, in my opinion. Then she\u2019d be more careful with her stuff. But if you want to...\u201d</p><p>His voice trails off as he hunts for her file, then scribbles the address on a sticky note.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t share that with the boys,\u201d he says needlessly.</p><p>As if I would. I nod and leave, and within a few minutes the nose of my car is turned in the direction of Calumet Heights.</p><p>It\u2019s time to exercise my option.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I pull up in front of a tiny little house, encased on either side by identical tiny houses.</p><p>The handkerchief-sized front lawn is encircled by a short metal fence, and daffodils line the front sidewalk. There\u2019s a pair of beat-up running shoes beside the door, well used and dirty, and a black-an-white decorative sign is hanging next to the door topped with a pink bow.</p><p>No Soliciting! My soul doesn\u2019t need saving, I hate magazines, and I already have a vacuum (I just don\u2019t use it much). Unless you\u2019re selling Thin Mints, I\u2019m not interested.</p><p>It makes me smile because it\u2019s so Jacey, blunt and to the point.</p><p>I rap on the door and she appears, her face in total shock at seeing me on her porch. She\u2019s dressed in her tiny Saffron outfit already, although I know there\u2019s no way she\u2019s been home for long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any Thin Mints, but I thought you might be interested anyway.\u201d I smile my most charming grin, but she stares back at me straight-faced, not cracking a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Dominic?\u201d She sighs. She doesn\u2019t even bother asking me how I got her address.</p><p>\u201cI was in the neighborhood. And thought I\u2019d bring you back your phone.\u201d</p><p>I slide it out of my pocket and offer it to her. She\u2019s clearly puzzled as she takes it, her fingers colliding with mine for a minute before she yanks them away.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says uncertainly. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t in your neighborhood. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I answer casually. \u201cI thought you might want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I left it,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt hardly ever leaves my side, because I can\u2019t afford to lose my stuff. Thank you for bringing it. I\u2019m running late for work, or I would invite you in.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me pointedly now, and I glance at her up and down, at the sexy bustier that positions her tits just right, to her barely-there boy shorts, to the yellow bowtie. She stares at me expectantly, waiting for me to leave, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I do what I do next.</p><p>\u201cCall in sick,\u201d I suggest. \u201cI\u2019m bored. Let\u2019s go do something.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words are out, I regret them. I\u2019m shocked by them. I want to rush to take them back, but I\u2019m too collected for that. Instead, I want her to turn me down, yet at the same time, I\u2019m eager for her answer.</p><p>Deep down, I want to spend more time with her.</p><p>Even though I don\u2019t want to want to.</p><p>She narrows her eyes again. \u201cWhat about your girlfriend? I think she\u2019d have something to say about us doing something together.\u201d</p><p>My girlfriend? I\u2019m confused, but then I remember Kira. Jacey\u2019s seen me with her a couple of times... in fact, she thought Kira was Emma. I swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend,\u201d I answer, although I don\u2019t offer an explanation about who Kira is to me. That\u2019s my business.</p><p>Jacey stares at me wordlessly, probably trying to decide if she believes me or not.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I urge her. \u201cLet\u2019s blow this place.\u201d</p><p>Jacey sighs. \u201cWhy should I? You\u2019re an asshole, Dominic. I never know what\u2019s going to set you off or when you\u2019re going to snap my head off. It\u2019s not a game I like playing. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, being around you isn\u2019t really a treat. I thought we were getting along, and then all of a sudden, you act like I don\u2019t exist. I don\u2019t get you. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I feel guilty again, just a little, because I know she\u2019s right. I am an asshole. And most of the time, I don\u2019t care.</p><p>But there\u2019s hurt in her eyes, real hurt, and that\u2019s something I haven\u2019t seen in a while. Most people I\u2019m around have thicker skin and they\u2019re almost as jaded as I am. Sometimes I forget that Hollywood is practically in a different dimension from the rest of the world... and those of us who live there are pretty much alien creatures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019m an asshole without meaning to be. Sometimes, I do mean to be. It\u2019s true. But I\u2019m sorry that I was an asshole to you. I could explain, but it would bore you. Let me make it up to you. Let\u2019s go do something fun and touristy. I promise to be nice.\u201d</p><p>She pauses and I smile, flashing her my trademark grin, the one that chicks eat up. It\u2019s not her fault that I\u2019m an asshole. And even though she\u2019s all swagger and talk, I can see that she\u2019s easily wounded. She just hides it. Like the rest of us, she puts on a front.</p><p>She wears a mask.</p><p>With another grin, and before I can think the better of it, I decide to take that mask off of her. To see what lies behind it. To see if she\u2019s really as different as she seems to be.</p><p>It will be an experiment of sorts. I\u2019m not getting sucked in, I\u2019m not getting involved. It\u2019s just an experiment for scientific purposes... to see if there can possibly be one decent human being left in the world. And I\u2019m guessing my dick is going to enjoy this experiment.</p><p>Jacey rolls her eyes at my expression.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try it,\u201d she warns. \u201cI can see through you. Don\u2019t try to charm me.\u201d</p><p>I grin again and I can see her give in.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut only because I\u2019m tired and I really don\u2019t want to work anyway. I was going in today to cover for someone else. I\u2019ve been picking up too many extra shifts. It\u2019s wearing me out. I need a break.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not the reason though. I can see it on her face. She\u2019s as intrigued by me as I am by her. The difference is... she\u2019s not as good at hiding it or keeping her distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she gestures. \u201cI\u2019ll call and then change my clothes.

We can find pretty much anything to do there. And we can get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019K,\u201d she answers, showing me to her tiny but neat living room while she punches a number into her phone. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>As she talks to her boss, I look around. The space, like many Chicago houses and condos, is small. It\u2019s neat, though, and she\u2019s got it furnished with chic, eclectic furnishings. I\u2019m guessing she saved up her paychecks for them because they\u2019re quality pieces.</p> <p>She hangs up the phone, staring at me cautiously. \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing this, but I\u2019ve called off. I\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201d</p><p>She disappears into her bedroom and I wait for exactly one minute, then follow.</p><p>Why? I don\u2019t know. But I walk quietly into her doorway and stand there, watching as she bends in front of me.</p><p>Her slender back is bare as she bends to slide off her work shorts. Even though she isn\u2019t very tall, she\u2019s got the grace of a ballerina. Her thighs are long and slim, her calves perfectly shaped. Her skin is golden and smooth, and all of a sudden I just want to run my hands up the length of them, grip her ass hard enough to leave marks and...</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jacey\u2019s voice snaps me out of my fantasy.</p> <p>I grin as she turns around, at her outraged expression as her hands cover her tits. I can still see them though, full and lush, as they spill around her hands, her pink nipples poking through her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d be ready in a minute. And by that, I meant to wait in the living room.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s standing in front of me now, confident and sassy, her bare chest pushed out and her eyes snapping.</p><p>\u201cSettle down,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI was just taking a tour of your house.\u201d I scan the little bedroom with its black-and-white d\u00e9cor, then focus again on her. \u201cI like your bedroom. It\u2019s got nice scenery.\u201d</p><p>And by nice scenery, I, of course, mean her tits.</p><p>She grits her teeth. \u201cGet out of here. I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh and she glares at me, tucking her hands even more firmly around her chest, and I duck back out, dropping onto her sofa to wait. I entertain myself with my memory of her bare body until she comes out a few minutes later, dressed in short cutoffs and a tight white T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cOne question,\u201d I request with a smirk.</p><p>She raises her eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing panties now?\u201d</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t before. An image of her bare ass bent over in front of me flashes through my head and sends the blood rushing to my dick.</p><p>Her cheeks explode into color, effectively answering my question, and she glares at me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat prompted this?\u201d she demands, ignoring my very valid question as she sits to strap on some weird strappy sandals that lace around her calves. \u201cWhy are you really here? This doesn\u2019t seem like you. Except for the invading my bedroom part. That totally seems like you. But I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come all the way over here just to catch a glimpse of my ass.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ve got a pretty nice ass.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, unfazed, and I grin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, if you want the truth. I\u2019m bored. I don\u2019t want to hang out with Sin or Duncan and I like talking to you. You treat me like a normal person. And unlike my brother, you usually wear clothes. Although, if you feel taking your clothes off, I won\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>She ignores that part. \u201cYou are a normal person. My grandpa told me once that no one is better than me, that everyone is the same\u2014some just have more important jobs. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t intimidate me... because you\u2019re not better than me. And for the record, I kind of like talking to you, too. When you\u2019re not snapping my head off, anyway. I like that you don\u2019t bother blowing smoke up my ass about anything. You just tell me like it is.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it, \u201cshe answers approvingly. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p><p>Which is ironic, since that\u2019s exactly how I think of her.</p><p>Refreshing.</p><p>We walk outside and I open the passenger door of the Porsche for her and she slides in, her legs spreading before she tucks them into the car. I get a shot of her crotch up the leg of one of her shorts. That\u2019s how short her shorts are, and it answers my earlier question.</p><p>She\u2019s not wearing panties.</p><p>It sends my pulse racing, which annoys me.</p><p>This girl doesn\u2019t affect me. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m bored and have nothing better to do. I\u2019m killing time while I\u2019m stuck in Chicago. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>As I grip the steering wheel and stare at the road, I decide that it\u2019s a bad fucking thing when you have to try and convince yourself of something.</p><p>We find a parking spot in one of the garages and I pull a ball cap on, just as a precaution. I\u2019m not as likely to get spotted here as I am in California, because no one is expecting to see me here. People are on celebrity high alert in Hollywood. But it doesn\u2019t hurt to be careful.</p><p>We quickly lose ourselves in the crush of people on the pier, and as I push through them, I realize that I\u2019ve lost Jacey. Looking back, I find that she\u2019s just a few steps behind me.</p><p>The breeze from the lake, brisk and cool, has blown her hair away from her face, and to be honest, she looks like a runway model.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do first?\u201d I ask politely. \u201cWhen was the last time you were here?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cForever ago. I was a teenager. I hate fighting the crowds.\u201d</p><p>I stare around us. \u201cLet\u2019s do a boat ride. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeedboat or cruise tour?\u201d she asks, wrinkling up her nose.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely speedboat,\u201d I answer, staring at the sign that advertises \u201cThrill Ride Speedboat\u201d tours. \u201cThe faster, the better. Just like I like my women.\u201d</p><p>Jacey rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSpeedboat it is,\u201d she agrees, ignoring what I said about fast women. I laugh as I head to the ticket booth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take all the tickets for your next boat ride,\u201d I tell the girl quickly. She stares at me dumbly.</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d she repeats slowly. Then she looks at me more closely, and I can see the recognition on her face. \u201cHoly cow. Are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I interrupt her. \u201cBut that\u2019s our secret, all right?\u201d</p><p>She nods, wonderstruck, and I sigh.</p><p>\u201cCan I buy out the tour?\u201d I prompt her. She shakes her head, bringing herself back to the matter at hand, then clicks on a computer. \u201cI\u2019ve already sold a few, but I can rearrange them to a later tour,\u201d she tells me shyly.</p><p>I wink at her. \u201cThank you. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>She blushes. \u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d</p><p>I hear Jacey tittering behind me, because clearly she doesn\u2019t feel my autograph is a valuable commodity. I ignore her and sign the paper that the cashier shoves toward me, then I hand her my credit card and purchase the tickets. When I\u2019m done, I turn to Jacey.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d she asks mockingly, grinning from ear to ear. I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see any paper... so I\u2019d happily sign your tits.\u201d</p><p>Once again, her cheeks burst into flame, and I decide that I like making her blush. \u201cDo you have a marker?\u201d I add mischievously. \u201cI can sign them right now, if you want. I know you\u2019re not shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we just go get a drink while we wait for our tour,\u201d Jacey suggests, her cheeks still pink. \u201cI could use a drink to deal with you, and we\u2019ve got half an hour to kill.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s not as fun as autographing your body parts, but as you wish.\u201d</p><p>We grab a drink at a nearby bar, sitting in a dark corner, out of the fray. As I hand Jacey her frozen margarita, she stares at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you always do things like buy out tours?\u201d she asks politely, taking a sip of her drink. I watch her lips form a vacuum around the straw before I answer.</p><p>\u201cIf I can. I prefer not to have to interact with the public much. And yeah, before you lecture me, I know I am where I am because of them. But you don\u2019t understand. Women actually faint sometimes when they meet me. You don\u2019t, but I\u2019m not lying. Some do. I\u2019d rather not deal with that.\u201d</p><p>Jacey fiddles with her straw. \u201cWell, in their defense, I\u2019ll just tell you that you\u2019re an intimidating person. It\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by who you are and forget that you\u2019re a real person, not just a name. But if you don\u2019t like what you do, with all the attention and everything, then why do you do it?\u201d she asks curiously. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like something you should\u2019ve gotten into if you don\u2019t like attention.\u201d</p><p>She has a valid point, and, of course, it\u2019s one I\u2019ve thought of many times over the last few years. But honestly, I do what I do because it\u2019s fantastic money. So I tell her that.</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t everything,\u201d she announces sagely.</p><p>\u201cSays the waitress,\u201d I sigh. \u201cNo offense, but it\u2019s easy to say that money isn\u2019t everything if you don\u2019t have it. Unfortunately, my tastes have evolved over the years and I need money to support them.\u201d</p><p>Jacey crosses her legs and I stare at her ankle, then her calf, then her thigh. I follow the slender length of it all the way up to where it junctures into her crotch. That\u2019s when I look away, before I start thinking about the fact that she\u2019s not wearing panties.</p><p>When I look up, Jacey\u2019s staring at me, watching me check her out.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are your tastes now?\u201d she asks hesitantly, her eyes probing mine. I smile what I imagine to be a wolfish smile.</p><p>Leaning toward her, I answer.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to find out?\u201d</p><p>I think back to the cooler incident, when my hand was buried between her legs, and I can see on her face that she\u2019s thinking of it too. She sputters, leans back, then grabs her drink. Sucking on the straw, she regains her composure.</p><p>\u201cHow did you even get into acting?\u201d she asks conversationally, ignoring my previous question and my wandering eyes.</p><p>\u201cI went to the University of Chicago,\u201d I tell her as I settle back into my seat. \u201cWhile I was there, a talent scout liked my look, and he was searching for an unknown to work on Visceral Need. The rest is history.\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrow. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t even trying to be an actor?\u201d she asks incredulously. \u201cDo you know how many starving waiters are out there, just trying to get a break in the acting world?\u201d</p><p>Yes, I do. But that\u2019s not my problem.</p><p>I push my chair back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go,\u201d I tell her instead. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agrees, standing up. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the other passengers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snorts and I lead the way, and once we\u2019re out in the sun again, Jacey turns to me.</p><p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d she says sassily, \u201cI might have let you sign my boobs back then... back before you became cocky... when you were an \u2018unknown\u2019 normal person. It\u2019s okay to be \u2018normal,\u2019 you know.\u201d And with that, she flounces down the gangway and onto the bright yellow boat. I stare after her and she looks back over her shoulder with a grin.</p><p>\u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, when I come, you\u2019ll know,\u201d I spout back. She grins and I grin back, like we\u2019re both normal people with dirty senses of humor, and I follow her onto the boat.</p> <p>When we sit down, she slips her hand into mine, her fingers small and slender. I startle for a minute at the familiar and intimate gesture, but then the boat engine starts up and we rip across the bay with the wind in our faces. All of a sudden, it feels perfectly normal to sit with her like this, with her hand in my lap.</p><p>It\u2019s a thought that scares the shit out of me, like literally scares me. My pulse beats faster, it\u2019s hard to swallow, and my palms get clammy.</p><p>When I can, I pull my hand away and tuck it into my pocket instead.</p><p>I\u2019m not normal, so there\u2019s no way in hell I should pretend to be.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p> <p>Jacey</p><p>I fight not to roll my eyes at Dominic as we glide over the top of the lake in the speedboat. He yanks his hand away from mine so fast you\u2019d have thought my palm was burning him. I was just being friendly. Jesus. And seriously. He\u2019s the one who showed up at my house out of the blue. I didn\u2019t ask him to come, and I certainly didn\u2019t ask him to invite me here on this... date? Is this a date?</p><p>I don\u2019t know what the hell this is, to be honest.</p><p>The tour guide speaks into his mic excitedly, probably just happy to have Dominic on his boat. He stands at the front while we lounge in the back. Since there are at least twenty empty seats in front of us, I feel kind of silly.</p><p>The driver of the boat races through the bay and out onto open water, spinning in huge circles and causing a spray of water to drench me.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that I\u2019m glad you wore that T-shirt?\u201d Dominic asks with a grin. My T-shirt is white. And wet. And perfectly transparent at this point. I sigh.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sort of a dog, you know that?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>I\u2019m just getting ready to ask about the girl he was with in the parking lot the other night, when suddenly the tour guide points toward another tour boat. Dominic and I turn to look and find it speeding up to get closer to us. All of the passengers are standing, craning their necks to see in our boat, cameras in hand.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been spotted,\u201d our tour guide says apologetically.</p><p>I look immediately at Dominic and his face has tightened. He looks pissed as he nods curtly.</p><p>\u201cCan you take us back to the pier? If we don\u2019t head back, they\u2019ll chase us around the lake. We can get off this boat a lot faster than they can all get off theirs.\u201d</p><p>The captain nods and whips the boat around, speeding once again toward the shore. I look over my shoulder to find the other boat chasing us. My stomach does a somersault. To me, it\u2019s a little exhilarating because this isn\u2019t something that happens to me all the time. They\u2019re right on our tail and excitement snaps in the air around us.</p><p>I mean, someone is chasing us. Oh my god.</p><p>But as I look at Dominic, I can see that excitement is the very last thing he\u2019s feeling. His chiseled features are twisted into a scowl and he just looks... tired. Beautiful, sexy... and tired. I swallow and feel guilty for being excited because this must be frustrating for him. It must happen everywhere he goes.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we dock, we\u2019re going to have to run, okay?\u201d Dominic tells me quietly, his dark eyes stormy and focused on my face. \u201cSeriously. Just follow me.\u201d</p><p>I nod, fascinated by this entire situation... by the novelty of it, by the annoyance Dominic feels, by the rush of wind over my face as our boats race toward the shore. We\u2019re going so fast that we slam into the water as we crest each wave, jarring my teeth. But we\u2019re back at the pier within a minute.</p><p>The large boat nudges the bumpers against the dock, and almost before it stops moving, Dom has leapt from the boat, grabbing my hand and helping me climb out. And then we run.</p><p>Ducking through the crowds, we weave in and out of people until we\u2019ve made our way to the iconic Ferris wheel that stands proudly against the Navy Pier horizon. Dom glances at it, then heads straight for it. Throwing some money at the guy manning the line, Dominic utters, \u201cTell them we went the other direction.\u201d</p><p>The guy stares at Dominic in surprise, but then recognition and understanding quickly flood his face and he nods, ushering us through the little gate, and we drop onto the seat of a gondola.</p><p>As the large covered gondola lifts into the air, I peer over the edge, my face pressed against the glass. I can see a couple of passengers from the tour boat running around, looking about, but the gondola operator comes through for us. He points in the other direction and the fans take off, hunting for any sign of Dominic.</p><p>It seems that we made our escape. I settle into the seat and stare at Dominic.</p><p>\u201cAnd I really wanted to take that tour, too.\u201d I smirk, but he grimaces.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he tells me seriously. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry that you had to run in those shoes.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my feet. Honestly, it hadn\u2019t bothered me. I\u2019m a chick who wears five-inch heels all of the time. I can run in flat sandals.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fine with ditching the boat. No biggie. I\u2019m sorry for you\u2014I know you were looking forward to your fast boat ride.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, then grins. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve still got a shot with a fast woman.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, shaking my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think about me, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve got it wrong. I\u2019m not a slut. Do I like sex? Yeah. Of course I do. Do I fuck everyone I come into contact with? Of course not.\u201d</p><p>He slides around the seats of the gondola until he\u2019s sitting next to me. Even though the gondola is large, having all of our weight balanced on one side tips the car a little and I grab the edge, panicked.</p><p>Dominic laughs. \u201cAfraid of heights?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, staring over the edge again. \u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid of falling to an early death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t let anything hurt you,\u201d he says smoothly and slides his arm around my shoulders. For a minute, the mood changes and I believe him. I can feel the muscle of his arm pulled taut against my back, and I know that if he wanted, he could protect me from all harm.</p><p>But it\u2019s hard to say what Dominic wants... his mood changes with the wind.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come to my house?\u201d I ask him curiously, staring up at him, still nestled in the crook of his arm. He\u2019s mere inches away, which makes it hard to concentrate. His thigh is pressed firmly against mine, sexiness exuding from every pore. I try seriously hard not to be impressed with him, but shit. He\u2019s Dominic fucking Kinkaide. And he\u2019s here with me.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>If I think about it, it\u2019s daunting. So I try not to think about it.</p><p>He stares at me, laughter in his green eyes. \u201cWhy? Can\u2019t I be spontaneous every once in a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d I sniff. \u201cBut you don\u2019t even like me. You think that I got you into trouble with that pot and I\u2019m the whole reason that you\u2019re stuck in Chicago. I didn\u2019t, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter anymore what happened,\u201d he answers easily. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been Sin, for all I know. All that matters is that I\u2019m stuck here. And since I am, I felt like making the most of it this afternoon. I was in the mood to have a little fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has your mood changed?\u201d I ask curiously. Getting chased by a boatful of rabid fans could understandably do that to a person.</p><p>He levels a gaze at me, one full of dark and naughty things, and I take a quick breath.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With that, he reaches his other arm around me, his fingers playing with the hem of my frayed denim shorts, his skin on mine. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do this since you bent over in front of me in your bedroom,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYour ass was bare and tight and I just wanted to plunge my dick into it.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes and I inhale sharply as I stare into his eyes. Did he really just say that?</p><p>\u201cInto my ass?\u201d I ask breathlessly.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou\u2019d like it,\u201d he answers knowingly, reaching around to slide his fingers under my leg, cupping my ass as he pulls me closer to him.</p><p>His fingers are strong, and long and for a minute I think about the naughtiness of what he\u2019s suggesting. Why I\u2019m not moving away from him, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m planted firmly in this seat and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere.</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cI\u2019ve... um, never done that.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, a velvety sound. \u201cBabe, I could show you a bunch of things you\u2019ve never done. And I guarantee you\u2019d like every one of them.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I have no doubt of that. It\u2019s an exciting thought.</p><p>He bends his head and nips at my neck, then soothes the bite with a soft suck. His lips, so soft and smooth, ease the pain of the bite away. His nearness is intoxicating, and everything about him screams that he is capable of so many things... things that would please me... things that would embarrass me in the light of day.</p><p>But still, I don\u2019t move. I stay right with him, my gaze frozen on his.</p><p>Keeping his eyes on mine, he slowly dips his head and plunges his tongue into my mouth, completely plundering it, consuming me yet again. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t kiss me without devastating all of my senses at once, annihilating my thoughts and causing my blood to throb as it all races toward one destination... the V between my legs.</p><p>Right where I ache for him.</p><p>He\u2019s like a drug... and one taste just isn\u2019t enough.</p><p>I open up my mouth and breathe around his lips, sucking in air, grasping at his back and pulling him closer. He reaches back and grabs my hands, holding them together at my wrists and pinning them over my head against the Plexiglas gondola cage. I\u2019m trapped here with him, yet there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be.</p><p>The energy around us now is primal and raw... and it\u2019s exhilarating too, because we\u2019re out in public. Every time the gondola swoops along the ground before it begins its upward ascent, anyone could look in and see what we\u2019re doing. They could see Dominic pinning me against the wall, and his other hand buried in my crotch, if only they looked closely.</p><p>Honestly, I think he might like that idea.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I finally manage to whisper, pulling away just ever so slightly.</p><p>His eyes are a little unfocused, his pupils dilated. \u201cWhat would you like for me to do, Jacey?\u201d</p><p>He knows. Oh, god, he knows. He knows exactly what I\u2019d like for him to do. I can see it in his eyes. I can feel it in his hands as he releases my wrists and slides both of his hands down, over every curve and plane of my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He takes his time, sliding his palms down, down, down... everywhere at once, slow and leisurely. He palms my curves, savoring them. He\u2019s firm, slow, and purposeful... someone who knows what he\u2019s doing and what he wants.</p><p>I twitch when he passes over my nipples. They\u2019re hypersensitive in my cold, wet shirt. He barely brushes them before he trails further down, down my sides, over the swell of my hips. I want to buck against him when his hands cup my breasts as he pulls me toward him.</p><p>I don\u2019t need to, though. He slips his fingers under my shorts because he knows I\u2019m not wearing underwear. He slips those long fingers in, all the way in, into me.</p><p>Into where I\u2019m waiting for him.</p> <p>I moan long and low. He\u2019s feeding the fire he slowly built inside of me and I don\u2019t ever want him to stop.</p><p>I glance up and everything around is a blur. We swoop past the ride operator on the ground, past the crowds, past the food smells and the sunshine, past the sidewalks and the shops. All of it is a blur and none of it matters.</p><p>The only thing that matters is what shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Him.</p><p>He shoves up my shirt and pulls one cup of my bra down, licking at my nipple, teasing it until it\u2019s standing up at full attention, as erect as his dick is. I can feel him, hard and rigid, pushing into my leg. But he doesn\u2019t rub against me. He doesn\u2019t act feverish, like me; he acts calm and controlled, slow and easy. He\u2019s not asking for anything in return, he just plays with me with his mouth.</p> <p>His tongue is wet against my skin, against my nipple, against me. It\u2019s hot and moist, and just when I\u2019m ready to beg him to fuck me in this very public place\u2014suspended 150 feet in the air\u2014he stops.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he says quietly, his arms collapsing casually back into his lap. Like we\u2019re just sitting here, taking a normal ride on the Ferris wheel.</p><p>I yank my head up and realize that we\u2019re coming to a stop on the ground. The ride is over. I pull my shirt down and stare at him, trying to focus my blurry eyes.</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>He\u2019s unaffected as he climbs from the gondola and holds his hand out to me, waiting for me to let him help me from the car. I pointedly ignore his hand, choosing to dismount all on my own with my rubbery legs that feel like jelly.</p> <p>Oh my god, I\u2019ve never felt so humiliated, because I\u2019m so affected and he\u2019s so... not. It\u2019s so easy for him to turn it on and off, to stay so fucking detached. My cheeks burn as I follow him down the sidewalks of the pier, as I focus on his broad shoulders swaying through the crowd, at the back of his neck, at his hips.</p><p>Everything about him is unfazed.</p><p>And I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>I totally just let him play with me. In public. And for what purpose? So that he\u2019d have a fun distraction from the people that were chasing us in the streets?</p><p>Fuck that. I\u2019m no one\u2019s distraction and I should\u2019ve known better.</p><p>We get into the car without speaking and we drive silently down the streets of Chicago. Several minutes pass before he even glances at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks innocently, as if he doesn\u2019t know.</p><p>I glare at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that about?\u201d I demand, although I\u2019m madder at myself than him. I let him do that. I let him fuck with me. After all of the lectures I\u2019ve given myself over the past few months about having more self-respect, I let him finger-fuck me on a Ferris wheel. I\u2019m pathetic.</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d he asks, staring sideways at me. \u201cIt was just... having a good time. You seemed to enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>I glance at his crotch, remembering the way his hardness had strained into me just moments before.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to, as well,\u201d I remind him. \u201cBut why? I don\u2019t understand you at all. The entire world isn\u2019t your plaything, Dominic. I\u2019m not your plaything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were,\u201d he answers easily as he turns onto my street. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say no. If you didn\u2019t want to participate, all you had to do was say the word.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s what pisses me off. I didn\u2019t say the word. I didn\u2019t say the word because I wanted him.</p><p>I want him still.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m so pissed. I want a man who couldn\u2019t care less if he\u2019s with me or not. He couldn\u2019t care less how I react, how I feel. It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that I always do, and it always gets me into trouble.</p><p>I\u2019ve. Got. To. Stop.</p><p>I grit my teeth and open my car door.</p><p>\u201cWant me to come in?\u201d Dominic asks, raising an eyebrow. He looks so relaxed behind the wheel, stretched out and casual. Not hot and bothered like me. I don\u2019t affect him in the same way, and that pisses me off.</p><p>And crushes me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I answer curtly. Leaning into the car, I pause for just a minute. \u201cThank you for an interesting day.\u201d</p><p>I slam the car door and take joy out of his startled expression.</p><p>Apparently, no one slams doors into Dominic\u2019s face, because he looks absolutely stunned.</p><p>This makes me smile as I unlock my door and head into the house. I toss my purse down and head into kitchen, where I immediately pop the cork on a bottle of red and drink several gulps straight from the bottle.</p><p>When my fingers have stopped shaking, I pour myself a glass and head to the bathroom, where I run a bubble bath and soak away my agitation.</p><p>The smells of lavender and vanilla assail my senses, soothing away my stress. Or so I hope. But try as I might, I can\u2019t get Dominic\u2019s face out of my head. I can\u2019t forget the way his hands felt, the way his fingers slipped so easily inside of me. The astonished expression on his face when I stalked away from his car.</p><p>There\u2019s something to be said for surprising someone and putting them in their place. And Dominic needed to be taken down a few notches. He\u2019s too arrogant by half.</p><p>I\u2019m toweling off, still smiling about that, when the doorbell rings. Puzzled, I pull on my robe and pad down the hall to answer it.</p><p>Dominic stands in front of me, casual and sexy and bigger than life, a bottle of wine dangling from his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take no for an answer very well,\u201d he says with a slow grin. His trademark sexy grin. The one that drops panties. The one that turns my knees weak even though I\u2019m pissed at him, even though I want to tell him that my no means no. That I don\u2019t want him here.</p><p>But that isn\u2019t true. I do want him here. And when it comes to him, my no doesn\u2019t mean anything at all.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I\u2019m a hostage of my hormones. Or of my fucking fascination with this girl. And why? She\u2019s just a girl. Blond, big-busted chicks are a dime a dozen in Hollywood. What\u2019s so fucking special about this one?</p><p>But as I stare at her... I don\u2019t see a blond, big-busted chick. I don\u2019t see a Hollywood chick. I see a girl, na\u00efve and feisty, who is standing in her doorway in a pink fuzzy robe with an innocent expression, her pink lips slightly parted. Her brown eyes are wide, and there\u2019s something in them that says, I want to trust you. Don\u2019t make me regret it.</p><p>And I want to tell her not to fucking trust me, not ever, because I will fucking hurt her. After everything she\u2019s revealed to me about herself, I know that I\u2019m the last thing she needs. She needs someone who is everything I\u2019m not.</p><p>But of course I don\u2019t say that. I can\u2019t... because something in me pulls me to her, and I\u2019m too selfish to resist it. So instead, I hold out the bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cJust a glass of wine. That\u2019s it. I promise to keep my hands to myself, unless you ask me not to.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me. \u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes with a sigh. \u201cTrust me. I\u2019m not going to do anything you don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d she answers softly. I\u2019m startled, staring at her, but she opens the door wide and gestures me in.</p><p>She leads me to the kitchen where I see an open bottle of wine already on the counter, but she ignores it. Instead, she grabs a corkscrew, and when she turns back around she finds that I have trapped her in the corner. We\u2019re both in the small space, so close I can practically hear her heart beat. I can definitely feel the heat emanating from her body. She takes a breath, and I take a step back, holding up my hands.</p><p>\u201cSee? I come in peace.\u201d</p><p>She grins and grabs the bottle from me, popping the cork and pouring a couple of glasses. I watch the red liquid sloshing against the sides of the crystal glass as I carry mine to the living room. We both drop onto the sofa, and Jacey turns toward me, curling her legs beneath her.</p><p>\u201cSo. Is this your M.O. with all the girls? You pretend to hate them, then you seduce them into the sack?\u201d She smiles and takes a sip of her wine, but I can see in her eyes that it wasn\u2019t completely a joke. She\u2019s as confused by my behavior as I am.</p><p>I laugh it off. \u201cYeah, it usually works like a charm. How\u2019s it working for you?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, not gracing that with an answer, instead giving me a direct look and following the look with a very direct question.</p><p>\u201cWho was that girl, Dominic? The one at the party. She was the same one in the parking lot. She means something to you and you definitely mean something to her.\u201d She pauses and swallows, then looks back at me. \u201cI like spending time with you\u2014when you\u2019re not biting my head off\u2014but not if you belong to someone else.\u201d</p><p>I scoff at that. I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong to anyone,\u201d I answer wryly. \u201cAnd trust me, few people \u2018mean something to me.\u2019 That girl... her name\u2019s Kira, and I grew up with her. She\u2019s been a friend for a really long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you make out with all your friends?\u201d Jacey answers dubiously. She stretches her leg out, and I can\u2019t help but watch as her robe falls slightly open and I can see even more of her thigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell her, reluctantly pulling my eyes up to her face. \u201cNot generally.\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge at the thought of Kira. Not because I\u2019m cheating on anyone, because I\u2019m not. But because Kira has called about ten times this week and I haven\u2019t returned her calls. Whenever I\u2019m in town, she puts her life on hold, always making sure that she makes herself available to me.</p><p>My thoughts are dangerously close to guilt, which annoys me, so I shove them aside. I don\u2019t deserve to feel guilty. Booty calls with me are a choice Kira makes. I don\u2019t force her, by any means.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not dating her?\u201d Jacey confirms slowly, her eyes still doubtful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dating her,\u201d I promise. Because I\u2019m not. Fucking her up the ass, yes. Tying her up and coming on her face? Yes. Whipping her? Teasing her? Sucking on her? Biting her? Yes to all. But dating her? No. And I\u2019m not above using semantics to get around a question.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean what you said... few people mean anything to you?\u201d Jacey asks hesitantly, her hand wrapped tightly around her glass. \u201cBecause that\u2019s really sad, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her harshly. \u201cDon\u2019t judge me, Jacey. You have no idea what it\u2019s like to be me. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened in my life, you don\u2019t know how people try to use me. Trust me, it\u2019s just easier to not give people the chance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sniffs. \u201cWhatever. I get that you\u2019re on a different plane from the rest of us mortals, but still. People are people. And everyone needs other people. And everyone gets hurt in life and everyone gets used. We have to get it over it and move on. If you let people who have hurt you or used you or pissed you off influence your actions, you\u2019re letting them win, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, at the way her jaw is set and her face is determined. \u201cSays a person with experience,\u201d I answer with interest. \u201cWhat happened to you, Jacey?\u201d</p><p>She blushes now, something that only makes me want to know more. With a quick flip of her hand, she downs the rest of her wine, then pours herself another glass. I notice that her hand is shaking and I raise my eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I ask again, softly this time.</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just a dumbass who always picks the wrong guy. Over and over. It\u2019s a pattern.\u201d</p><p>Yet her hand is still shaking as she takes a large gulp of her drink. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh, that\u2019s not bad enough to put that look on your face. Something else happened.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure that I care so much as I\u2019m curious. But either way, I want to know. Jacey sighs and stares out the window, not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough because it\u2019s a pattern, Dominic. I\u2019ve got some issues. I\u2019ll just tell you that right now. And because of those issues, I usually fall for the wrong guys.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m intrigued as I stare at her. \u201cBut that time it was worse somehow. What happened to make it worse?\u201d</p><p>Jacey sighs, looking away from me.</p><p>\u201cI fell for the devil himself. My friends, my brother... they all tried to help me keep away from him, but eventually, like the dumbass I am, I went back to him because I fell for his line of shit. And one day, he did something terrible. Really, really terrible, and it fucked up everyone around me. Is that bad enough for you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what he did, but clearly it wasn\u2019t pretty. Jacey\u2019s face is pale and grave and sad and I don\u2019t push her anymore. Instead, I simply nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad enough.\u201d</p><p>A tear runs down Jacey\u2019s cheek and she wipes it away quickly, burying her face into her wineglass, refusing to look at me.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I made a pact with myself. No more choosing the wrong guy. I\u2019m working on myself and I\u2019m not going to settle for anyone less than the perfect person for me. Someone who values me and won\u2019t push me around. That includes you.\u201d</p><p>I reach out and turn her chin toward me, forcing her to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember offering to be with you,\u201d I remind her gently. \u201cJacey, I\u2019m not a good person for you. Not in the long run, not for real. What I\u2019m interested in is someone to hang out with while I\u2019m here, someone to have fun with and someone to keep me company. What I\u2019m really interested in is seeing if you\u2019re as decent of a person as you seem... because I\u2019m at the point where I doubt that anyone actually is. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m very, very capable of hurting you... but not if you don\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with watery eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not decent, Dominic. I can tell you that right now. A decent person wouldn\u2019t have let Jared get anywhere near me or my family, much less dated him. But you can bet your ass that I won\u2019t let you hurt me. I won\u2019t get attached to you. I\u2019ve already promised myself that.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSo let\u2019s see if you can keep that promise. You want to see if you can hang out with me and not get attached to the wrong kind of guy yet again, and I want to see if there is one decent person in the world. It\u2019s a win-win situation. I can make you feel good and you can do the same for me. It sounds like we both need it.\u201d I pause, staring at her.</p><p>She stares back.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a no strings attached, you like me, I like you, win-win situation. I won\u2019t fall for you, Dominic.\u201d Her voice is calm and even.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to,\u201d I tell her just as evenly. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. Come on. Take the challenge. Let\u2019s see if you can do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s show you that there really are decent people in the world,\u201d she answers stubbornly. \u201cBecause there are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it. You\u2019ll just have to show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d She nods. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward a little, staring into Jacey\u2019s dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo... now that that\u2019s settled, do you want me to make you feel good?\u201d</p><p>My words are loaded, my meaning quite clear. I emphasize it by gripping her thigh, hard, with my fingers. When I take away my hand, there is a white mark on her leg.</p><p>She\u2019s fascinated by that. She looks at the mark, then looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need to hear,\u201d I tell her quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite word.\u201d</p><p>Her back arches as I pull her into me and she molds into my body. Hers is soft and small, her arms thin bands that close around my back. I flip her around so that she\u2019s back on the couch, her spine pushed into the cushions. With my eyes locked on hers, I part her legs with my knee.</p><p>She opens them hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet for me, Jacey? Could you possibly be wet for me already?\u201d I ask, raising an eyebrow as I trail one finger down her chest, opening her robe with it.</p><p>She\u2019s displayed now, in the sunlight, her tits pointing to the ceiling, her hips bucked upward. I trail my finger downward and around her nipple and she moans. But I don\u2019t stop there. I continue down, over her hip, across her flat belly, and down to her pussy.</p><p>I trail that one finger over the tiny nub of her clit.</p><p>She twitches into me, but I still just keep that one finger there, rubbing that little swollen bump.</p><p>\u201cYou are wet,\u201d I point out. \u201cFor me. What would you like to do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise me,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>I chuckle lightly, slipping that one finger into the folds of her pussy, into her body where I move it... in, out, slow. She throws her head back and I add a finger.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer,\u201d I tell her softly, leaning over to kiss and suck her neck. I\u2019m being gentle with her now, easy. The hard stuff will come later. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glaze over as I rub her, as I stroke her, as she grows even wetter. She swallows hard, I can hear it.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she says simply. \u201cMake me feel good.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle again, even though my groin tightens at her words.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wait for that, Princess.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She pauses her movement, her hips suspended against me.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s the way I work. I don\u2019t jump into the sack with just anyone.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t jump into the sack with anyone. At all. But of course I don\u2019t say that. She\u2019ll soon learn that \u2018fucking\u2019 me has a very different definition than what she probably assumes.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll still make you feel good,\u201d I add.</p><p>I get to my feet and pick her up, scooping her easily into my arms. She wraps her arms around my neck, but we don\u2019t go far. I carry her into her bedroom and drop her onto the bed, where she bounces, then rolls over.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want me?\u201d she purrs. \u201cSpread-eagled?\u201d</p><p>I smile, remembering when I\u2019d told her that earlier, a couple weeks ago. \u201cYes. On your back. Do you have any scarves?</p><p>She looks puzzled but gestures to her top dresser drawer, where I find a heap of silk scarves. She looks hesitant when I climb over her on the bed and straddle her, lifting her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>She looks unsure. \u201cI barely know you.\u201d</p><p>I stare into her eyes. \u201cBut do you think I\u2019d physically harm you?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hesitate, she just shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I would never. Not unless you ask me to. If you ever say the word no, it\u2019s all over. I\u2019ll immediately stop what I\u2019m doing. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tie your hands and feet to your bedframe. And you\u2019re going to like it. Yes or no?</p><p>She stares at me in confusion. \u201cHow do I know if I\u2019ll like it?\u201d</p><p>I stare back and repeat myself slowly. \u201cI\u2019m going to tie you. And you\u2019re going to like it. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>I ask it with more emphasis this time, more force.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she finally whispers. And I can see on her face that she believes it. I smile as I peel off her robe, then bind her hands, then her feet.</p><p>She\u2019s totally immobile now, spread out on the bed like a gorgeous offering. Her full tits point toward the ceiling, amazingly perky for being natural. Coming from Hollywood, it\u2019s rare for me to find real tits nowadays.</p><p>I crawl up over her, her curves rubbing against my dick, hardening it. I nip at her neck, and whisper into her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to blindfold you. And you\u2019re going to like it. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>Her lips almost tremble as she replies, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I smile again, then bend and tie a black scarf around her head, covering her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me not to hurt you, because I would never physically harm you. Not unless you ask for it. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trailing my fingers along her torso now, over her ribs, along her sides. I watch the goose bumps form as she whispers softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I smile, then kiss her hard. I feel my teeth against her lips, her tongue automatically plunging into my mouth. Her lips open for me, sucking me down. She wants more. She shows it with every movement.</p><p>I bend my head, trailing my lips along the silkiness of her skin, sliding it along her nipple before I pull that pink tip into my mouth, sucking it soft, then harder. She pushes up toward me as far as her restraints will allow.</p><p>\u201cYou like that. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moans. In answer, I suck harder.</p><p>She moans louder.</p><p>I kiss every inch of her belly now, taking care to trace the hollow that her hipbone makes. It\u2019s my favorite part of the female body, although I don\u2019t know why. There\u2019s something very feminine about it. I stand for a quick minute, peeling off my clothes so that I can feel her warm skin pressed to mine.</p><p>I press my rigid cock against her hip, enjoying the way her hipbone cuts into it, crushes it. It\u2019s a good pain.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, pain is good. I\u2019m going to fuck you with my mouth today, not my cock. You\u2019re going to ache for me to fuck you, so much that it might hurt, but you\u2019re going to have to wait. I\u2019m going to make you come with my mouth though\u2014right now. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She begs me softly, bucking her hips against my fingers. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d I repeat insistently.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers breathlessly.</p><p>That\u2019s all I needed to hear. I drop onto my hands and knees and bury my head between her legs. The smell of her, clean and musky, invades my senses and makes me crazy. I slip my tongue in, licking her slowly, then burying it in her. I rub her with my fingers, with my tongue, with my lips, until she is thrashing beneath me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou love this. Yes or no?\u201d I ask raggedly. Because watching her powerless beneath me, blindfolded and restrained and unable to do anything but orgasm, turns me on. I\u2019m rock hard now and I stroke myself with my left hand, even as I finger her with my right.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she ekes out. \u201cFuck me, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer firmly. \u201cNot yet. Some pain is good, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to feel you fuck me,\u201d she murmurs, arching upward, trying to touch me as best as she can. In answer, I turn both of my hands on her, fucking her with several fingers with one hand and rubbing her clit with the other until finally, she screams my name, then falls limply against the sheets.</p> <p>She breathes quickly and shallowly, her delicate body curved into the bed. I stand, pull my clothes on, then untie her hands and feet. I leave her blindfold on.</p><p>\u201cYou loved that. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says quickly, remaining motionless on the bed, even though she\u2019s no longer restrained. With one hand, she reaches over and finds my rock hard cock. \u201cYou loved it, too. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say with a smile, before I stand up again. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d And I walk from the room and I don\u2019t look back.</p><p>This is what I do.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get attached.</p><p>I don\u2019t get involved.</p><p>But I think about the look on her face when she was coming, the open and innocent expression, and I smile.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize it until I\u2019m in my car and I glance into my rearview mirror and find that my lips are curved up ever so slightly. It\u2019s such a foreign expression that it startles me.</p><p>And then it shames me.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be happy about anything concerning Jacey. Because once I\u2019m through with her, there won\u2019t be anything left to smile about.</p> <p>There never is.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Jacey</p><p>My phone buzzes in my pocket, and from the way Dominic is looking at me from across the gym, I know it\u2019s a text from him. My stomach flutters, and I take a break from stacking clean towels so I can pull out my phone.</p><p>You want to fuck me. Yes or No?</p><p>A thrill runs through me and I smile. I can\u2019t help it. I glance up at him and find him staring at me with that look, the dark look that makes my heart pound. The one that makes me want him even when I\u2019ve sworn to myself that I don\u2019t.</p><p>I shake my head at him, even though it\u2019s a lie. And he knows it\u2019s a lie because he laughs, sliding his phone back into his pocket as he turns back to holding a bag for Tig.</p><p>I sigh, picking back up the towels.</p> <p>It\u2019s been two days since Dominic tied me to my bed.</p><p>When he walked out, I\u2019d been astounded for two minutes, then all I could do was laugh. His penchant for being detached is becoming a pattern, and it\u2019s something I have to get used to if I want to continue with this... whatever this is.</p><p>But definitely whatever this is, it\u2019s fascinating.</p><p>It\u2019s exciting.</p><p>Dominic fucking Kinkaide was in my bed. We didn\u2019t exactly have sex, but it was just as intimate, at least to me.</p><p>Out of curiosity, I did a search for him online, to find out if he does this often... if he leaves behind a string of crushed hearts. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find much.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t date a lot, although he\u2019s been linked to a couple of starlets, including Amy Ashby. He doesn\u2019t have any scandal around him... he\u2019s kept his nose clean. And there\u2019s not one thing mentioned about Emma, whoever she is.</p><p>His publicity team must be very good.</p><p>Or he\u2019s actually as detached and distant as he pretends to be.</p><p>After these last two days of flirting and texting, two days of not progressing into anything else, I\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s the case. He\u2019s actually that detached. He does things that pleasure him, but he doesn\u2019t get involved.</p><p>It\u2019s like... he flips a switch when he starts thinking that he\u2019s getting too personal, and then he shuts down. I don\u2019t get why he does it, but it seems more and more to be the case. And if I want to continue our \u201crelationship,\u201d I\u2019ve got to accept it.</p><p>Because honestly, even though he\u2019s got some drawbacks, he\u2019s got a lot of pluses too...</p><p>I like his intensity.</p><p>I like his sexiness.</p><p>I like him. I can\u2019t help it. There\u2019s more to him than he wants me to know... than he wants anyone to know. It fascinates me. Every once in a while, there\u2019s something in his eyes... something that says he\u2019s vulnerable. He covers it up, but it makes me want to get close to him. To know him.</p><p>But I know he doesn\u2019t want that. He doesn\u2019t want to get close to anyone. There\u2019s very few people I actually care about.</p><p>There\u2019s a pang in my heart as I stack another row of towels and remember his words.</p><p>I know myself well enough to know that if I were in this for real, for a real relationship, someone like Dominic would never be good for me. Because of my own issues, I need more than he can offer. I need someone who would be an active participant in my life, someone who would make me feel important, like a priority.</p><p>But I\u2019m not in this to get close to him, I remind myself. This isn\u2019t a real relationship. I\u2019m in this because it\u2019s fun. I\u2019m not getting used. I\u2019m just entertaining myself. Soon, he\u2019ll go back to Hollywood and I won\u2019t see him again... unless it\u2019s on the movie screen. But it\u2019ll be fun for now. It\u2019ll be a cool story someday.</p><p>I turn back around and meet Dominic\u2019s gaze. He\u2019s got his phone in his hand again and a dark look in his eye. He\u2019s tall, slim, and cool in the middle of all of the surrounding sweat and heat and grime.</p><p>My phone buzzes.</p><p>Don\u2019t you need to put those extra towels somewhere?</p><p>My eyes meet his again. He knows that I do. And he knows where.</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>Go.</p><p>He stands watching me, confident that I\u2019ll run to the supply closet and wait for him. But I don\u2019t. Maintaining eye contact, I slowly and purposefully stack the leftover towels on the floor next to the rack. I look back up at him and his lip twitches.</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>I glance at my phone.</p><p>You get three chances. This is your second. Go.</p><p>I square my shoulders and stare at him. Who the hell does he think he is? He thinks he can just tell me to go and I\u2019ll run? Whatever. I\u2019m only controlled when I want to be, like when I let him tie my hands in the bedroom. That was different.</p><p>I saunter away, pointedly ignoring him as I wind my way around the gym and into the locker room to toss dirty towels into the washer.</p><p>I\u2019m not there for two minutes before my hips are pressed against the cool metal of the machine. There is warm breath against my ear and a warm body pressed against my back.</p><p>\u201cYou know you want to,\u201d Dominic whispers, his hand gripping my ass. Hard. \u201cJust go. That\u2019s all you have to do.\u201d</p><p>I glance to the side, to make sure no one else is here with us before I slip from his grip and flip around, staring into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know you want me to,\u201d I answer. As I do, I reach out my hand and cup his crotch, the first time I\u2019ve actually done so. I stroke the denim for a second before I grip him through it. He swallows hard. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me dangerously, his eyes darkening as his crotch hardens. He doesn\u2019t say anything, so I grip him harder.</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t flinch, even though my grip must hurt now. He stays hard, but that shouldn\u2019t be surprising. He did say that a little pain is good.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he finally answers, shocking me. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d admit it.</p><p>I smile, a slow smile that spreads across my face. \u201cSo go,\u201d I instruct him.</p><p>The dangerous light glints in his eyes and I can see that he likes my commanding tone. He turns on his heel and walks away. I watch his broad shoulders disappear from the room, excitement building in my stomach. I wait just a minute before I follow him, making my way to the supply closet.</p><p>I open the door, but am surprised to find it empty. He\u2019s not here.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...\u201d</p><p>But then he\u2019s in the doorway, filling up the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou thought you\u2019d get to tell me what to do?\u201d he asks softly, walking me backward until my back is pressed to the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this works, princess. Although I admire your balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we already established that I don\u2019t have balls?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. He laughs, a husky, low sound.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should double check.\u201d</p><p>I was expecting his hand.</p><p>But his hand isn\u2019t what I get.</p><p>Dominic drops to his knees, and as he does, he pulls my shorts down. Since they have an elastic band, they\u2019re easy to peel off, and he takes full advantage of that. He slides them down until they drop around my ankles.</p><p>Without preamble, he thrusts his tongue into me, wet and hot. The room is immediately filled with his energy, with his dark, dark energy. It\u2019s a primal thing... like Dominic is taking full control of the situation. It\u2019s delicious. My head immediately falls back on its own accord and I grip the shelves behind me.</p><p>\u201cAnyone could come in here,\u201d I manage to gasp as I struggle to breathe deeply, trying like hell to catch my breath. Dominic pulls away.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he acknowledges, pausing. \u201cBut they won\u2019t. Only you and I come in here. And you are going to come right now.\u201d</p><p>He thrusts his tongue into me again, over and over, until I am panting and clinging limply to his back.</p><p>And then I do come.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>I come and come, the muscles of my uterus contracting, my thighs trembling.</p><p>Dominic immediately stands up, grinning like a Cheshire cat. He bends, pulls my shorts up, and then dips his head to my ear.</p><p>\u201cI love the taste of you.\u201d</p><p>And then he walks out. Like this never happened. Like he always does.</p><p>I grip the wall behind me, catching my breath and waiting until my knees stop shaking. It happened. I was just licked to orgasm in a supply closet... by Dominic Kinkaide. Holy shit.</p><p>When I can manage, I slip back out into the gym nonchalantly, as casually as I can. Dominic is holding a bag for a boy I haven\u2019t met yet, and he catches my eye as I walk past.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, Jacey?\u201d he asks innocently, as if he doesn\u2019t know that my legs are jelly. Or why.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I answer back, every bit as innocently as he does. He winks, then runs his tongue across his lips.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replies.</p><p>And just like that, my heart takes off like helicopter blades again. The man can barely look at me and I\u2019m a goner. Like, I seriously just want him to carry me off to bed, where we can hole up for a weekend and not do anything but stare into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Fuck. That can\u2019t be good. Because he doesn\u2019t want to stare into my eyes. He wants to render me helpless with his sexcapades. I square my shoulders and turn away.</p><p>I try and ignore Dominic for the rest of our shift, and instead of talking to him, I focus on other things. The moistness in my underwear reminds me from time to time, though, as does his mischievous grin whenever I accidentally meet his gaze. But I stubbornly avoid him anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why?</p><p>Because he\u2019s dangerous to me.</p><p>Because even though this is supposed to be fun, temporary, and lighthearted, I can feel myself getting pulled in. I feel myself getting attached and I can\u2019t do that. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be part of this.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember offering to be with you. That\u2019s what he said. He doesn\u2019t want me like that, not for something real. He runs cold and hot and he\u2019s always, always detached. If I make the mistake of wanting something real from him, then I\u2019m going to be crushed, just like always, because I\u2019m making yet another bad decision.</p> <p>My heart twinges as I remind myself of that. But it\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t shirk from the truth.</p><p>I do hide from it sometimes, though. Like when Dominic turns to me in the parking lot after work and says, \u201cHey, I have to go to California on Friday night so I can shoot this weekend. Would you like to come?\u201d</p><p>One word instantly comes from my mouth before I can even think about it, before I can remind myself yet again that I\u2019m not going to get sucked in.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dominic</p> <p>I slide my hands up Jacey\u2019s dress, pulling her to me, her hips grinding into mine.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she whispers into my ear, her fingernails cutting a trail down my back. The pain of it turns me on, but her scent turns me on even more. I lift her up and bite her lip, thrusting my tongue into her mouth before I unbuckle my belt and pull off my pants.</p><p>I hover over her for just a minute before I plunge deep inside of her. She moans and writhes beneath me, her fingers twisting into the sheets.</p><p>\u201cDominic,\u201d she whispers. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>I pause and look at her in confusion, because I\u2019m rock hard right now. \u201cI am up, babe,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s for you.\u201d I thrust into her again and she smiles.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d she answers again, chuckling. But her voice is deeper now, manly. Not her normal sexy voice.</p> <p>I\u2019m confused for just a minute more until I realize that I\u2019m dreaming. But now I\u2019m awake and I\u2019m not with Jacey at all. In fact, Sin is standing next to my bed, cackling like a rooster.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Dom?\u201d he laughs. \u201cWhat the hell are you dreaming about? Or I guess I should say, who. You were moaning like a son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I grab a pillow and thrust it onto my face, breathing in the goose-down smell, trying like hell to get rid of my boner. Margaret Thatcher. Naked. On a cold day.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d I growl at him. \u201cWhat the hell, Sin?\u201d</p><p>He cackles some more before he thrusts my phone into my hand. \u201cYou left this in the kitchen, and Tally has called four times already. You might want to call him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I ask groggily, but it\u2019s too late. I can hear the door closing as Sin leaves. I lie still for a few minutes longer and then I throw the pillow against the wall.</p><p>What the hell? I\u2019m pissed at myself for a bunch of things, but most importantly, for dreaming about fucking Jacey. What. The. Fuck? I\u2019ve turned myself into a fucking celibate monk (or my version of one) for good reasons. And there\u2019s no good reason that I should be dreaming of fucking anyone, Jacey included.</p><p>I glance at the clock. Nine fucking thirty. I guess it\u2019s a good thing Sin woke me up, or I\u2019d have been late for the gym... and I believe what Joe says. If I\u2019m late one more time, I shouldn\u2019t bother coming back. Jesus.</p> <p>I pull some clothes on, spray on cologne, and head out the door, calling Tally from the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask when he answers. \u201cWhat was so important you needed to call four times?\u201d</p><p>Tally sighs into the phone. \u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re going to be on the plane tonight. I\u2019ve got it arranged... And I told Amy Ashby that she could share the flight. She\u2019s in Chicago visiting her boyfriend. She\u2019ll ride back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have someone with me,\u201d I tell him as I turn out into traffic. \u201cI need you to add her to the passenger list. Jacey Vincent.\u201d</p><p>Tally sighs again. \u201cOh, that\u2019s gonna make Amy happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking care,\u201d I tell him honestly. \u201cIt\u2019s my plane. She\u2019s coming back from visiting her boyfriend, anyway. She shouldn\u2019t care, either.\u201d</p><p>But he and I both know that she will. Because Amy Ashby is bitchy like that. She thinks that everything and everyone is hers. Jacey is feisty, though, and I know she can handle it. A quick memory of her roundhouse kick to Jake\u2019s chest flits through my head and I smile. Yeah, she can handle herself in any situation, whether it is with a Hollywood mean girl or a juvenile delinquent.</p><p>\u201cSince when are you hauling around a woman?\u201d Tally demands after he has me spell her name for the flight manifest. I roll my eyes.</p><p>Since a woman has wormed her way into my head and I started having erotic dreams of fucking her. But of course I don\u2019t say that. I growl and hang up instead.</p><p>I spend the rest of the drive to the gym in silence, staring at the road. I stare at my hands, at the sky, at the traffic. But it doesn\u2019t distract me from what Tally said. When did I start hauling a woman around?</p><p>It\u2019s a good fucking question.</p><p>And the only answer I can come up with is: since I became fascinated with one. It\u2019s the first time in a long, long time, and even though it\u2019s not smart, I\u2019m not ready to pull the plug on it yet. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>That\u2019s puzzling to me, as well. I\u2019m just as curious about my own feelings regarding her as I am about Jacey herself. I do not like getting close to people. I do not like giving them the opportunity to hurt me, use me, or exploit me.</p><p>But she hasn\u2019t given me a reason to believe that she\u2019d do any of those things, I remind myself. That\u2019s the point of this whole thing. I\u2019m giving someone a chance, for the first time in a long time, to prove to me that she\u2019s not like everyone else. But the second she does... it\u2019s over.</p><p>The second that I think she\u2019s not the genuine and open person that she seems to be, we\u2019re done.</p><p>When I get to the gym, Jacey\u2019s friend Brand is dropping her off yet again, and I have to fight back a scowl. I don\u2019t like the familiar way he handles her. I don\u2019t like the way she lets him.</p><p>She\u2019s says that he\u2019s like a brother to her. That there\u2019s no way he thinks of her as anything but a brother. But there\u2019s no way she can\u2019t see the same things I do.</p><p>I stare at the guy as he watches Jacey walk to the door. He\u2019s most definitely not watching her as a brother would. His eyes sweep from her ass to her shoulders, back to her hips. It\u2019s a gaze of appreciation.</p><p>And then, abruptly, he looks at me as I hold the gym door open for her.</p><p>I see a million things in his eyes, a myriad of emotions. Jealousy, resentment, frustration. But most importantly, a threat.</p><p>Stay away from her. It\u2019s unspoken, but the meaning is clear. I return the gaze calmly, not backing away, and he finally breaks the stare and drives away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I snap at Jacey. \u201cAren\u2019t you ever going to get your car fixed?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me sharply, surprised by my annoyance. I\u2019m surprised by it too, but I can\u2019t help it. There\u2019s no fucking way she can\u2019t see how into her Brand is. And because there\u2019s no way she\u2019s that oblivious, it means that she\u2019s not as decent as I\u2019d so like to believe, because she\u2019s still leading him on.</p><p>Which means she\u2019s let me down. Even though I expected it, I\u2019m surprised by how disappointed I am.</p><p>\u201cNot all of us are made of money,\u201d she snaps, bringing me back to the matter at hand. \u201cI\u2019ll fix my car when I can.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and follow her inside. Could it be that she really just needs his help and she\u2019s not purposely using him? It\u2019s a notion I\u2019d love to believe, but I\u2019m having a really hard time swallowing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving straight from here,\u201d I tell her just as sharply. \u201cDid you bring a bag?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah. If you\u2019re in a better mood this afternoon, then I\u2019ll actually go with you.\u201d</p><p>With that, she flounces off. I watch her go... her nose in the air, her shoulders back and her ass tight in her short shorts. I have to smile at her attitude. I think it\u2019s one of the things I like best about her. She\u2019s spunky. That\u2019s for sure.</p><p>But I freeze as I realize what I just did.</p><p>I just admitted that I like Jacey.</p><p>Fuck. That can\u2019t be good.</p><p>That means it\u2019s time to end it. Now. That, in combination with this whole Brand thing, is enough to just pull the fucking plug and get it over with.</p><p>I yank my phone out of my pocket with full intention of acting like I just got a call from Tally to tell me that shooting had been canceled when I glance over at Jacey.</p><p>She\u2019s kneeling on the ground, looking up at Jake as she tries like hell to unknot his shoes for him. His laces are muddy and gross, but she doesn\u2019t seem to mind as she tries to help. Her smile is genuine as she laughs at him, and when she looks over at me, she smiles too.</p><p>With a deep sigh, I slide my phone back in my pocket. I can\u2019t do it yet... not because I\u2019m scared of my own feelings for her or because of my suspicions about Brand. Those aren\u2019t good enough reasons.</p><p>The point of this whole thing is to see if I can get past my misgivings about humanity and give her a chance.</p><p>And besides, I\u2019m not done with her yet.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Jacey</p><p>I\u2019ve never been in a chartered plane hangar before, but I try not to act like it. I try to restrain myself from gazing around like an idiot... at the shiny jet, the staff who is waiting to meet us, and the carpet that is rolled out for us to walk on.</p><p>Holy crap. Is this seriously how famous people live?</p><p>Nonchalantly, I follow Dominic up the steps and onto the plane, trying my best to seem blas\u00e9. But as Dominic turns to ask me which leather sofa I\u2019d like to sit on, I can see his eyes twinkling, and he knows. He knows that I\u2019m way over my head. But I still don\u2019t give him the satisfaction of admitting it.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere,\u201d I shrug. \u201cThey all look the same.\u201d As in, they\u2019re all expensive, soft-as-butter Italian leather. Dominic grins.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he shrugs back. \u201cWe\u2019ll take that one. Amy can have the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy?\u201d I raise my eyebrow. Dominic looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cDid I forget to tell you? Amy Ashby is in Chicago right now. She\u2019s sharing this jet with us.\u201d</p><p>I feel a monster-sized weight form on my chest and I swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I guess you did forget to mention that part.\u201d I\u2019m going to be riding with one of the biggest actresses on the planet, and not only that, but she\u2019s notoriously bitchy. Super.</p><p>Dominic stares at me curiously as he sits, pulling me down next to him. \u201cIs that a problem? I\u2019m sorry that I forgot to tell you. I just found out myself last night.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, of course it\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not good. My legs are shaking again, and that pisses me off. No one is better than you, I remind myself. She\u2019s famous, not better. I\u2019m practically muttering to myself as I settle in beside Dominic, automatically resenting that he\u2019s so calm and cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he\u2019s used to this. He\u2019s used to fancy planes and Hollywood stars and people being at his beck and call. I take a deep breath. I might not be used to it, but I\u2019ve got this. I can do this. I turn to him.</p><p>\u201cSo, how much will you have to shoot this weekend? I\u2019ve heard horror stories about how sometimes shooting can go on all day and night.\u201d</p><p>Dominic chuckles. \u201cIt all depends. But right now, we\u2019re doing bits and pieces, the smaller scenes. We won\u2019t get into the meat of the movie until I\u2019m back in LA for good. I\u2019m a character actor, so it\u2019s hard for me to bury myself in my role when I have to keep flying back and forth between Chicago and LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your studio is okay with that?\u201d I ask dubiously.</p> <p>He starts to answer, but is interrupted by a female voice.</p><p>\u201cThey might be, but I\u2019m not,\u201d Amy Ashby snaps as she hauls herself onto the plane with a little yappy dog in her arms. She\u2019s spindly skinny with giant boobs that must be fake. \u201cThis is bullshit, Dom. Serious bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Dominic turns to me, rolls his eyes, then turns back to Amy with a sigh. \u201cHey, Amy. So good to see you.\u201d</p><p>I want to giggle at his resigned tone and the outraged look on her heavily made-up face, but I don\u2019t. Something tells me that wouldn\u2019t be the best first impression.</p><p>She stares at me with narrowed eyes, extremely interested all of a sudden. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy friend Jacey,\u201d Dominic answers easily, sitting back in the seat with his arm looped loosely behind me. I enjoy the sense of security that brings me, the warmth from his arm. It\u2019s like an anchor in a sea of unfamiliar shit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I tell her politely. \u201cI love your work.\u201d</p><p>She sniffs, looking down her nose at me before she deposits her tiny dog on the seat and turns to the flight attendant. \u201cI need some water for Pichachu. He only drinks Acqua Panna. If you don\u2019t have any, you\u2019re going to need to find some before we take off.\u201d She turns away without waiting for the attendant to reply, and I can\u2019t help but chuckle because her dog\u2019s name sounds like a sneeze.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you coming?\u201d she asks me bluntly as she settles the dog on her lap, stroking its puffy hair. \u201cThe set will be closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d Dominic asked her sharply. \u201cI didn\u2019t request that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Amy stares at him. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to. I don\u2019t need your little girlfriend watching our sex scenes.\u201d She levels a brilliant blue gaze at me, and I\u2019m astounded at her hostility when I haven\u2019t even done anything to her.</p> <p>Jesus. What a bitch. She\u2019s an even bigger nightmare than I thought she\u2019d be. Dominic chuckles humorlessly as Amy crosses her skinny legs and stares at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we actually have sex, Amy, on or off set. But whatever. Do what you need to do.\u201d Amy\u2019s cheeks flush and she turns away, lifting her nose in the air.</p><p>Dominic turns to me. \u201cYou can either hang out in my trailer or you can stay at my house by the pool. Either way, you\u2019ll have a good time. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand on my leg now, possessively, and he stares back at Amy. She can\u2019t help but stare back at him, and I\u2019m not sure exactly what he\u2019s trying to convey, but whatever it is, it\u2019s effective. She\u2019s effectively pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Dom. You know that\u2019s not true. You and I both know it.\u201d</p><p>Her words are icy and laced with venom. Dominic won\u2019t show you a good time. That\u2019s what she means.</p><p>But Dominic ignores her. He stares at me instead, angling his body so that he\u2019s blocking her completely out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some things planned,\u201d he tells me conversationally. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like them.\u201d I hear Amy sniff, but she doesn\u2019t remark.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will, too,\u201d I answer. I take note that his hand is still on my thigh, his fingers lightly gripping me. \u201cCan I have a hint?\u201d</p><p>Dominic smiles, leaning down to whisper into my ear. \u201cWhat did you pack to wear?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, but before I can answer, he continues, \u201cBecause you won\u2019t be needing it.\u201d</p><p>I gulp, then smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He smiles knowingly. \u201cOh, we\u2019ll see.\u201d He chuckles again, and the dangerous glint is back in his eyes. The one that I love. It means I\u2019m going to like whatever comes next.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d he tells me quietly. \u201cIt\u2019ll help pass the time on the flight.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cSomething tells me it\u2019s not a crossword puzzle.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughs, his teeth gleaming white. \u201cUh, no. It\u2019s a million times better.\u201d He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a little nondescript box. Leaning forward, he whispers into my ear again, his breath warm on my cheek. \u201cI like kinky things. Dirty things. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>I suck my breath in. Kinky things? Regardless of my trepidation, I smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try anything once,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>He grins the grin of the devil. \u201cGood. Go to the bathroom. Put this in.\u201d</p><p>In?</p><p>I stare at him again, half in shock, half eager to see. I hold out my hand, a thrill shooting through me as he hands it to me.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he whispers with a wink.</p><p>Oh yeah, right. Trust him. For some reason, I can practically see Lucifer himself saying the same thing with the same expression on his face. In all honesty, Lucifer might be safer than Dominic.</p><p>Regardless, I make my way to the bathroom in the back of the plane and lock the door behind me so I can open the box in peace.</p><p>As I slide the lid off, I suck in a breath. Lying in the white tissue paper, there\u2019s a silver bullet\u2013looking thing, shining in the dim light of the bathroom. I pick it up and it\u2019s heavy and cool in my fingers. There aren\u2019t any instructions, but I instinctively know where it\u2019s supposed to go.</p><p>Where it\u2019s supposed to go in.</p><p>Good Lord. I feel a moment of panic, but then calm myself. He might be Dominic fucking Kinkaide, but I\u2019m Jacey fucking Vincent and I\u2019m not scared of anything. I\u2019ve got this. I\u2019ve so got this.</p><p>I like new things, damn it.</p><p>With trembling fingers, I pull down my shorts and my panties and insert the silver bullet, nestling it up to where it needs to be. Inside of me. I suck in another breath as the cold metal slides in.</p><p>I stand back up and straighten my clothes.</p><p>It\u2019s not so bad. It\u2019s like a metal tampon. I hardly even know it\u2019s there. I drop the box into the trash and head back out to Dominic.</p><p>\u201cEverything go ok?\u201d he asks innocently, watching as I buckle up next to him.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I tell him. \u201cChild\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes now. \u201cNooo,\u201d he drawls. \u201cIt won\u2019t even be close to child\u2019s play. I promise.\u201d</p><p>And there is a promise in his voice, a dark and sexy promise. I stare into his eyes and find myself lost there for a minute, inside the glimmering green depths.</p><p>I shake my head, shaking away my trembly feelings, and stare out the window as the plane taxies down the runway and takes off. After we\u2019ve leveled off in the air, I settle into the seat, into Dominic\u2019s arm. Flying always unnerves me a little, but I always relax after takeoff.</p><p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d he asks softly. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think I might take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think not,\u201d he murmurs. And with his words, the bullet inside of me starts to buzz urgently, enough to snap my head back. As the vibrations spread through my body and threaten to overwhelm me, I notice that Dominic\u2019s holding something in his left hand.</p><p>A tiny remote control.</p><p>My eyes fly to meet his, and that look is there, lurking in his. That dangerous, sexy look.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I want to throw my head back into the sofa cushions, to embrace the vibrations that are cresting me toward an orgasm, but I can\u2019t. Amy is across from me. Her nose is buried in a magazine, but any minute she could look up and notice me writhing in my seat.</p><p>So I sit rigidly, my knees clamped together, my jaw clenched.</p><p>And Dominic smiles.</p><p>As he does, the vibrations stop. His finger falls away from the button and he stares at me with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like the ride so far?\u201d he asks innocently. I take a deep breath and gather myself, willing my tongue to form coherent words.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d I tell him finally. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a private plane before. It\u2019s different than I expected.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles now, a genuine laugh. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he grins. He moves his hand and I flinch, preparing for another onslaught of vibration, but he reaches for a glass of water instead. He grins at my reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jumpy,\u201d he observes. \u201cYou should calm down. The ride should be very smooth. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He raises an eyebrow, and I jump as the vibrations flood my nether regions again, and I find that my palms are actually sweating. \u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>Amy glances at us over her magazine, but as soon as I meet her eye, she looks away. She pointedly doesn\u2019t want to interact with me, and at the moment, that\u2019s very fine with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine now,\u201d I manage to say in a very normal and casual voice. \u201cVery fine.\u201d</p><p>Dominic chuckles, and for a moment I cuss him out silently. But at the same time, the pulsing bullet is spreading warmth through me, building orgasmic waves that I want to float on forever. Something about the vibrator itself, combined with the fact that I\u2019m in public\u2014in front of one of the biggest actresses in the world and a team of flight attendants\u2014makes this whole thing exhilarating.</p><p>Apparently, I\u2019m a freak.</p><p>Just like Dominic. I can see on his face that he\u2019s getting off on this. He loves thinking about me coming in front of all of these people while they\u2019re all blissfully unaware. I can see it in his eyes.</p><p>I grit my teeth as an attendant bends in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a pillow, dear?\u201d She smiles, and sweat breaks out on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d I stutter, then gulp. The vibrations kick up a notch to a faster speed. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I finally manage to say. She looks at me in concern.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth again. \u201cYes,\u201d I eke out. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me again with concern, but smiles. \u201cOkay. Just let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>I nod, unable to speak now, my entire body melting into the sofa. I couldn\u2019t stand up right now if the plane was on fire and I needed to run for my life. I\u2019d be totally screwed.</p><p>I reach over and grip Dominic\u2019s right hand, hard. My fingers curl around his, my fingernails cutting into him as he ramps up the speed of the vibrator even more.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I breathe. He grins a beatific smile. I close my eyes and breathe deeply, in then out. And then I hold my breath, because I know that I\u2019m going to come. Right here in front of god and everyone on this plane, I\u2019m going to fucking come. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It happens and I feel like climbing the inside wall of the plane as the sensations rock my entire body, hard. My leg twitches and I\u2019m pretty sure that my eyes bug out. And still Dominic smiles. I grip his hand even tighter, my fingers damp, until he releases the button and the sensations stop.</p><p>I let go of his hand and fall back into the sofa, my head on the seat.</p><p>\u201cFeel better now?\u201d Dominic smirks, curling his long arm around my shoulders.</p><p>I nod. \u201cVery much. I feel like I need a cigarette.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic raises a brow. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you smoked.\u201d</p><p>I smile, closing my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, but I know I\u2019m not going to last long now. I\u2019m completely spent... from the orgasm and from trying to hide the orgasm. It took a lot of energy. I don\u2019t know how long it takes, but it\u2019s not long before I\u2019m asleep. The last conscious thought I have is of Dominic\u2019s scent filling my nose... musky, manly... so uniquely him.</p><p>Being on a private plane, his private plane, is leaps and bounds better than flying commercially. What\u2019s that old airline slogan? \u201cFly the friendly skies\u201d? Yeah, Dominic should totally make up his own slogan.</p><p>Come and fly with me.</p> <p>As in, fly with me and I\u2019ll make you fucking come.</p><p>Suddenly though, the thought of Dominic doing this with anyone else sends a hundred-pound weight slamming into my stomach. I\u2019m shaken as I realize that I don\u2019t want him to be with anyone else.</p><p>Only me.</p><p>I gulp, because that\u2019s a dangerous thought when we\u2019re talking about someone like Dominic.</p><p>Someone who, for all intents and purposes, cannot commit, cannot get close, cannot be intimate. I know I\u2019m supposed to be proving that I can casually be with someone without falling for him, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s me. I\u2019m not the kind of girl who can do that.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to face the facts, and they\u2019re not just about me. They\u2019re about Dominic too.</p> <p>He isn\u2019t the \u201cfriend with benefits\u201d kind of guy.</p><p>He\u2019s the kind of guy who gets fallen for, hard.</p><p>True to Dominic\u2019s word, the flight is smooth. I don\u2019t open my eyes again until after the wheels have touched down and he shakes my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to use the restroom or anything?\u201d he asks me. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nicer on here than it is in the airport.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s no lie. I nod and climb out of the sofa, only to realize that Amy is following me to the back. When we get there, I pause.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go first?\u201d I ask her hesitantly, because she\u2019s looking at me so oddly. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just wanted to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. Here it comes.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>She smirks. \u201cDominic will never fuck you. So I know you\u2019re walking around thinking you\u2019re god\u2019s gift right now, but just know that he\u2019ll never fuck you. He\u2019s probably secretly gay or something.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cOr he just didn\u2019t want to fuck you,\u201d I suggest firmly. \u201cYou think just because someone doesn\u2019t want to fuck you, it means they\u2019re gay? Jesus.\u201d</p><p>I turn away, but she grabs my arm with talon-like fingers. \u201cDominic likes to play games. He\u2019ll string you along until he\u2019s done with you. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d She smirks again. I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, out of the goodness of your heart, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Amy stares at me, her eyes as hard as glass. \u201cHe\u2019ll get you to do more perverted things than you ever thought possible,\u201d she says icily. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do them all because you\u2019ll want to please him. Because you think that you\u2019re proving yourself to him. But in the end, it won\u2019t be worth it. Because he\u2019ll never be anything more than a perverted asshole.\u201d</p><p>I close the bathroom door in her face and sink onto the toilet, trying to collect myself. What the fuck was that? Why would she tell me such a thing? I mean, she\u2019s a catty bitch, but seriously. If Dominic didn\u2019t want to sleep with her, then he simply didn\u2019t want to sleep with her.</p><p>The only thing is... the only thing that gives me pause is... that he hasn\u2019t slept with me yet either. I\u2019ve flat-out asked him to and he said not yet.</p><p>That begs the question: What the hell is going on with him?</p><p>He\u2019s not gay. I know that. I can feel it in the way he looks at me. There\u2019s also nothing physically wrong with him. He can definitely get it up. I\u2019ve felt his erection pressed against me too many times to count.</p><p>Why then doesn\u2019t he want to actually use those perfectly good erections?</p><p>Or maybe he does. Maybe Amy\u2019s right and he just wants to use them to do perverted things. This whole making me come in front of Amy thing was pretty kinky. Finger-fucking me on the Ferris wheel was kinky. Going down on me in the supply closet was kinky.</p><p>He is perverted.</p><p>There\u2019s no question about that. The only question is how perverted? And why? Something seems to scream out to me that there\u2019s something really, really wrong with him.</p><p>Which is exactly what Amy is trying to imply.</p><p>It\u2019s either that, or he just enjoys playing fucked-up games.</p><p>She\u2019s implying that, too.</p><p>I take out the bullet, stick it in my pocket, and wash my hands, and when I go back out Amy\u2019s already gone, deplaned with her stupid little yappy dog. I have to admit, that\u2019s a relief. I don\u2019t want to deal with her again. I know a million fans would love to be around her right now, but that\u2019s because they don\u2019t know exactly how much of a bitch she really is. It\u2019s unfathomable unless you witness it firsthand.</p><p>Since we don\u2019t have to traipse through the airport like normal people, we are out and into a car within a few minutes, sitting in the back of a limo while it drives us toward Dominic\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been in California,\u201d I mention absently, trying to be casual, trying to hide the unsettled things that I\u2019m thinking about Dominic now as I stare out the tinted windows at the suburban landscape rolling past. It seems to be dry here, with only a few specks of green. Dominic glances up from his phone.</p><p>\u201cReally? How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible. I\u2019ve never had a reason to come out here before.\u201d</p><p>Dominic shakes his head but doesn\u2019t comment. I stare at the back of the driver\u2019s head for a while and ponder telling Dom what Amy had said, but decide not to. What\u2019s the point in it? I know him well enough to know that he\u2019s not going to give me a straight answer, and he doesn\u2019t seem the least bit bothered by her or her implications anyway.</p><p>The ride to Hollywood Hills doesn\u2019t take long, and I have to admit that driving into the exclusive community sends my tummy rolling. I watch out the window, wondering who I might see stepping out of a mansion. And then reality hits me, and I remember that I\u2019m sitting in a limo with one of the most famous actors on the planet.</p><p>Reality check.</p><p>I stare at him for a minute, at the way he\u2019s so casually graceful in the dark of the limo, his legs sprawled in front of him.</p><p>\u201cCool trick with the vibrator,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cHow is that even possible? You work for Saffron and you don\u2019t know what a bullet is?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m a waitress, not an escort, dickhead.\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Are you still wearing it?\u201d</p><p>I take it out of my pocket and hand it to him. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t trust you not to use it again.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughs. \u201cSmart,\u201d he nods. \u201cVery smart.\u201d He slips it into his pocket and stares out the window. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d he tells me, gesturing toward a house at the end of the street, nestled onto the side of a huge hill.</p><p>I almost gasp when I see the house.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. Your house is even bigger than Sin\u2019s,\u201d I exclaim, pressing my nose to the window. And it is. It\u2019s enormous and sophisticated and modern. Everything I should\u2019ve known it would be.</p><p>Dominic grins, satisfied with my answer. \u201cRegardless of what Sin says, everything about me is bigger than his,\u201d he announces. I burst out laughing as I get out of the limo.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I answer, still giggling, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had no complaints.\u201d</p><p>That was me fishing... trying to get him to say something, anything about women he might have slept with before. But he doesn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>With a sigh, I stare upward at the house looming above us.</p><p>It\u2019s majestic. And overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cDo you have staff here, or do you somehow take care of this whole thing by yourself?\u201d</p><p>Dom shakes his head. \u201cI have housekeepers that come in once a week or so, but that\u2019s it. I like my privacy. I do have a security detail, but they don\u2019t live here. They only come with me when I go out. This is a gated community, so I don\u2019t need them when I\u2019m at home.\u201d</p><p>I exhale slowly as we walk in the door, my heels clicking loudly on the stone floor of the foyer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you have such a huge house all for yourself,\u201d I marvel as we wind our way up the curved staircase. He leads me to a bedroom and opens the door.</p><p>I pause in the doorway. \u201cI get my own room?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d I was expecting to sleep in his bed.</p><p>He stares at me, his gaze hiding a million things. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s considerate of you,\u201d I murmur as I walk past him and into my lush quarters. I can\u2019t complain. It\u2019s gorgeous... from the sunken marble tub to the fantastic view of the surrounding hills.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, just ask,\u201d Dominic tells me graciously. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you for a bit to freshen up while I take a shower. Want to meet on the veranda in an hour for dinner? The sun will be going down and you\u2019ll want to see that.\u201d</p><p>I nod and he leaves as I drop onto the bed in a heap. All of a sudden, everything here is overwhelming. This mansion, Amy\u2019s bitchy attitude and her ugly implications... all of it. Including Dominic and his games.</p><p>His games.</p><p>Is he playing a game?</p><p>If he is, it\u2019s clear that I don\u2019t know the rules.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Jacey</p><p>\u201cWhy are you acting so weird?\u201d I demand as Dominic sticks a bite of cheese in his mouth. He stares at me.</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to swallow without chewing?\u201d He raises an eyebrow and I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>I gesture around me with my arm, at the fancy picnic Dominic had delivered from a catering service, at the romantic setup with the candles and the twinkling overhead lights, at the wine... at the way Dominic is all the way across the veranda from me. Earlier, when I had gotten up and sat next to him, he had waited a few minutes, then moved away again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Dominic?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me bemused. \u201cWhat were you expecting, Jacey?\u201d</p><p>The way he says my name annoys me, it\u2019s so fluid and smooth and detached. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m upset, if I\u2019m annoyed\u2014or actually, it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t care about anything at all. It frustrates me, because more and more I know that I need him to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know what I was expecting.\u201d I snap. \u201cYou\u2019re confusing, and I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re doing it on purpose as part of some fucked-up game. You wanted me out here with you, and you even brought a sex toy onto the plane to make me squirm, but now that we\u2019re here, in the privacy of your home, you don\u2019t want anything to do with me. I\u2019m in a separate room, you\u2019re sitting across the veranda from me... I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about?\u201d Again, he raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re upset because I\u2019ve brought you out here and haven\u2019t fucked you yet? I don\u2019t fuck just anyone, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are hard now, dark.</p><p>\u201cOr are you upset because you don\u2019t understand me? Because if that\u2019s it, trust me, nobody does, so you\u2019re not in the minority.\u201d</p> <p>I stare back at him, not sure what to address first. \u201cDo you understand you? Do you even know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, unconcerned. \u201cNot really. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing here with you, if you want me to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAmy told me some ugly things on the plane. She said that you\u2019re a pervert who likes playing games. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s green eyes darken. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t throw this back on me. Is it true?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs now, trying to seem unconcerned, but something tells me that he\u2019s more bothered than he cares to admit. \u201cIt\u2019s all relative, I suppose,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cAmy\u2019s a bitch. I didn\u2019t play fucked-up games with her. She knew from the beginning what I wanted, and she only got pissed when I wouldn\u2019t give her what she wanted. As far as being a pervert, I\u2019m more perverted than some, less than others.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cIs that why I\u2019m here? Because you want to do kinky things to me?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his eyes darkening even more. \u201cJacey, I\u2019ve wanted to do kinky things to you from the beginning, but that\u2019s not the point. I want you here against my better judgment. But now that you\u2019re here, I\u2019m not sure what to do with you.\u201d</p><p>That instantly annoys me. The way he said it was so condescending. I\u2019m not sure what to do with you. Like I\u2019m a thing. Or a toy. Something he has complete control over. \u201cOh, so you beckoned to me and I came?\u201d I stand up, annoyed, throwing my napkin onto the large ottoman in front of me. \u201cFuck you. You don\u2019t crook your finger at me and I come running. I\u2019m here because I like you. Period. But you don\u2019t get to play games with me, Dominic. After what I told you about the kinds of guys I\u2019ve struggled with, it pisses me off that you would even try. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>I stalk away past the shimmering pool, back through the glass doors of his house, but when I reach the doorway, he has caught up to me and he grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he urges me quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not trying to play games. I\u2019m trying to be honest with you. It\u2019s a new concept for me, and I\u2019m probably fucking it up. But I do want you to stay.\u201d</p> <p>I look up at him, staring into his eyes, and I find sincerity there. He wasn\u2019t trying to upset me or control me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I murmur. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let Amy get under my skin.\u201d</p><p>The planes of his face are angled, and the moonlight reflects off of them, and suddenly I just want to run my fingers along his cheekbone. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>But I do it anyway.</p><p>I trace the outline of his cheek, trailing my fingers along his jaw. I feel his jaw flex as he stares down at me, his eyes thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d I finally whisper.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut does it matter? Do you still want to be here?\u201d</p><p>I do. I shouldn\u2019t want to, but I do.</p> <p>I let him lead me back to the veranda, back to the cushioned chaises and ottomans, where he sits down next to me and watches me, thoughtful now. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen this side of him... this introspective side. I tell him that, and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cWould you believe me if I told you that I don\u2019t hang around with people much?\u201d he asks, picking up a cracker and smearing p\u00e2t\u00e9 on it before handing it to me. \u201cI don\u2019t like gatherings, unless it\u2019s with my family. And now... well, with Cris dating Fiona, I won\u2019t be going to many of them any time soon.\u201d</p><p>I take the cracker and settle back into my seat, watching him as I eat.</p><p>He\u2019s so graceful and sophisticated, even though he\u2019s not much older than I am. I know those things, his statistics, because I looked them up online. He\u2019s twenty-four. He\u2019s 6\u20192\u201d. He\u2019s right-handed. Dark hair, green eyes. But those are just things, facts. I don\u2019t know what he thinks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so upset about your sister dating Cris?\u201d I ask hesitantly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t really want to talk about it, but I\u2019d like to know. I hate seeing how much it bothers you. You love your family. It must be something huge to make you stay away from them.\u201d</p><p>Dominic tenses now, his leg crossed tighter than it was, and he looks away, out over the valley.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I really don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he finally answers slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you do, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s something that happened a long time ago and I honestly just can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>His face is filled with pain and vulnerability, a unique combination that I haven\u2019t seen there before. I reach up and brush the hair away from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I murmur. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I just... it makes me sad to see you upset. I\u2019d like to try and help you figure it out, if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he answers sharply. But then he softens his tone and actually picks up my hand. It makes me want to hold my breath, because he\u2019s made it obvious he doesn\u2019t like intimate contact. Yet here he is, holding my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just... you need to know that if you\u2019re going to be around me, there\u2019s a bunch of shit about me that you can\u2019t fix. So I don\u2019t want you to try. Don\u2019t get invested in me, all right?\u201d</p><p>I suck in my breath at his acidic tone and stare at him as I unconsciously pull my hand away.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I whisper limply, stunned by his bluntness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t help asking about your family, because it\u2019s something that I\u2019m curious about... it\u2019s something that I can see hurts you. I like you. I like you more and more each day. And as your friend, I don\u2019t like that anything hurts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you my friend?\u201d he asks suddenly, turning toward me.</p><p>I can\u2019t explain why, but the expression on his face hurts my heart. It\u2019s open. For the first time since I\u2019ve known him, his face is completely open to me. I know that he doesn\u2019t do this often... he doesn\u2019t show his vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer slowly. \u201cI\u2019m your friend.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and I honestly don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here. \u201cAnd you like me more and more each day?\u201d</p><p>I nod in confusion.</p><p>\u201cDominic,\u201d I whisper, not sure of what to say. He looks up at me rakishly, the breeze tousling his hair, and he\u2019s utterly beautiful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t love me,\u201d he says simply. \u201cOr I\u2019ll break you. I won\u2019t want to, but it will happen.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned at the utter bleakness of his words, of his voice, of the heart-wrenching expression on his face. I don\u2019t know what happened to him to put it there. But before I can say a word, before I can react, he reaches for me.</p><p>I know that for whatever reason, he needs me right now, and god help me, I want to save him from himself. From whatever pain he\u2019s feeling. From whatever it was that hurt him.</p><p>I fold into him and inhale his mouth, his tongue sweet and hot against mine. His lips are soft and plunder my own, his hands sliding everywhere. He\u2019s got an urgency now that I can\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from, or why he\u2019s in an even darker mood than usual.</p><p>Whatever else he is, I can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s sexy. Everything about him is sexy and everything in me wants him. Right now.</p><p>He kisses me until I\u2019m breathless, leaning me back until my head barely grazes the chaise behind me. He pulls at my shirt until he\u2019s able to run his thumbs over my nipples, rubbing them into hard nubs.</p><p>\u201cStill like me?\u201d he whispers, his eyes boring into mine. I swallow hard and don\u2019t answer. \u201cYes or no?\u201d he asks, dipping his head and running his tongue in circles around each point.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper limply.</p><p>He stands up and unfastens his pants, dropping them to the ground. Crawling over me, his rubs his bare penis against my wet opening, the friction of it creating a firestorm in me, causing me to cling to his strong shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d he rasps into my ear. He\u2019s as breathless as I am, I realize.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmur, trying to pull him closer, to pull him inside of me. But he pulls away, standing back up and then pausing in front of me, gripping my legs.</p><p>Without another word, he bends down, shoving up my skirt and burying his head between my legs.</p><p>As feverish as I am, his tongue brings me to a climax within a minute. The wetness of it rakes over me as his hands ravage the rest of me, sliding, kneading, pulling.</p><p>I close my eyes, blocking out the moonlight, the veranda, the lights from the valley. I revel in the feel of being close to him, as close as I\u2019ve been yet. He might not have exposed much to me, but I could see that he wanted to. He\u2019s just afraid. And knowing that makes me feel as though he let me in somehow... just a little.</p><p>But now he wants to annihilate me. I can see that in his eyes, as he makes me come over and over again with his mouth. His dark eyes gleam, and they are all I can see of his face as he stares intently at me from between my legs. I try to pull him up, to get him to crawl over me, to kiss me, to plunge into me, but he won\u2019t. He stays down... making me come yet again.</p><p>I arch into the air, reaching for him, but he won\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cI want to feel you inside of me,\u201d I tell him urgently. Because I do. I want him to fill me up. To give me, for just a minute, what he\u2019s not willing to give me otherwise.</p><p>Himself.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>Not bits of him, not pieces of him, but all of him.</p><p>He pauses, staring at me, and I can literally see it as his eyes shutter closed. He\u2019s closed to me now, and whatever progress we made tonight is gone.</p><p>He smiles his normal smile, the rakish one, the one that millions of fans have seen and loved.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Princess,\u201d he tells me as he climbs to his feet. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Dominic</p><p>What.</p><p>The.</p><p>Fuck?</p><p>I let the cold shower water run over my body, over my head and my shoulders, down my hips and down to where I really need it.</p><p>What the fuck was I thinking? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was this close to spilling my guts to Jacey. This close to inviting her into my life, telling her my secrets, letting her in.</p><p>I blame it on the look in her eyes. The sweet, genuine, I\u2019m-so-concerned-about-you look... and I know that she is. She genuinely cares that something has hurt me. But the problem is... she thinks she can fix it and she can\u2019t.</p><p>No one can.</p><p>That\u2019s the bitch of it.</p> <p>I grab a towel and step out of the walk-in shower, before I head to my bed naked.</p><p>And alone.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Jacey</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to think.</p> <p>Even though something felt like it changed last night, like our paradigm shifted, Dominic is back to being cool and aloof. He popped his head into my room early this morning to tell me that he was going to the studio, that he\u2019d be back later... and to relax around the pool.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself at home!\u201d he\u2019d called over his shoulder in a very polite way as he walked out.</p><p>He didn\u2019t kiss me good-bye, he didn\u2019t touch me at all. He stayed in the doorway where he stood, beautiful and graceful but so very distant.</p><p>It\u2019s gorgeous here, and the infinity pool that seems to slip right over the edge of the valley is picture perfect. But there\u2019s only so much time I can spend lounging by the pool. I\u2019m alone and I\u2019m restless.</p><p>So I go exploring.</p><p>I spent quite a bit of time in his library, rifling through his shelves and shelves of books. He\u2019s got everything from the classics to Tom Clancy. None of the books show any signs of wear, so I have no clue if he actually reads them or if they just line the walls.</p> <p>His large desk is sleek and modern, made from glass and ebony wood. No pictures adorn it, nothing personal at all. The middle drawer is locked, but I\u2019m guessing it just contains checkbooks and such anyway.</p><p>The art on the walls, the many paintings and original photos, fascinate me.</p><p>I can tell the masculine abstract paintings are original, but the signatures aren\u2019t anyone I recognize. I\u2019m guessing that they\u2019re local artists... that perhaps Dominic just picked out pieces that he liked because he didn\u2019t feel the need to buy originals painted by the masters.</p><p>The kitchen is nice, but boring. Granite, steel, marble floor. It\u2019s sterile because it\u2019s never used. I can see that. To me, kitchens should be the hub of the house, the heart, where everyone congregates. But that\u2019s not so here.</p><p>There are too many guest bedrooms to count, all of them lavishly decorated, just like the one I slept in last night. After he\u2019d left me on the veranda.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to think about him. He\u2019s a complete mystery, totally hot and cold. It must say something about me that I want to figure him out, that I\u2019m not running in the opposite direction. I probably don\u2019t want to know what it says about me, actually.</p><p>I\u2019m needy.</p><p>I\u2019m fucked up.</p> <p>I know these things, so I push them out of my mind. I already know me. What I want to know now is him.</p><p>I stand hesitantly outside of his bedroom door. Maybe I can find some answers within, answers that he\u2019d never tell me. Something, anything, that would make his behavior make sense.</p><p>If he doesn\u2019t want you to know, my conscience argues, then you should respect that.</p><p>But... fuck you, the devil side of my brain answers. And that\u2019s the side I listen to. I turn the doorknob, and before I can even think about it, I\u2019m in his room and it\u2019s done. I\u2019ve officially invaded his privacy.</p><p>His room is dark and quiet and decorated in masculine colors... grays and creams and blacks. His bed is enormous, and there isn\u2019t anything odd in here, like I think I was expecting. No sex swings or whips or chains. It\u2019s uncluttered. In fact, it\u2019s incredibly clean. It almost seems as devoid of personal effects as a hotel room.</p><p>I feel a little guilty as I open his drawers, but I only find neatly folded clothes. The drawers all smell like cedar, like him. I take a deep breath, inhaling the scent, as I eye his closet, and before I can talk myself out of it, I get to my feet and open the doors.</p><p>It\u2019s enormous and contains a dressing room inside. A wall of shoes, loafers, and sneakers, and neatly hung slacks, jeans, shirts, and suits. It\u2019s a closet worthy of a king. I\u2019ve never actually seen such a thing before. I sit on a cushioned bench for a minute, just to take it all in.</p><p>Like the bedroom, his closet is neat to the point of sterility. There\u2019s nothing here to indicate what he\u2019s actually like. Not one thing... except for the clear fact that he has a lot of shoes and clothes.</p><p>But as I stand up, I notice the bench I\u2019m sitting on has hinges. They\u2019re cleverly concealed, but they\u2019re there. Hesitantly, I open the lid and I find myself staring at a shallow black velvet box. The rest of the bench is empty.</p><p>Breathing quickly, I lift the box out and stare at it. It\u2019s very light so it can\u2019t contain much. I don\u2019t waste time pondering it. I take the top off.</p><p>Inside, there\u2019s a stack of cards and letters, banded together with a rubber band. There\u2019s a little jewelry box, which I quickly discover is empty, and an unopened envelope with Dominic\u2019s name on the front. It was clearly written by a woman and says simply, Dom.</p><p>The ink has begun to fade and there\u2019s something hard inside, like cardboard or plastic.</p><p>I\u2019m utterly frozen as I stare at it, because I can sense the significance of what must be inside. It was written by someone who knows him well, someone who calls him Dom.</p><p>But whatever it is, Dominic doesn\u2019t want to hear it. He doesn\u2019t want to see it. So he closed it away in this bench, away from the light, away from the world, away from him. But even still, even though he can\u2019t force himself to read it, he also can\u2019t force himself to throw it away.</p><p>I\u2019d been wrong to come in here. Because I know that whatever I\u2019m holding in my hands is so very intimate. It\u2019s personal and private. And it\u2019s not my business. But also, he\u2019s even more of an enigma now than he was before. I don\u2019t have any answers... I just have even more questions.</p><p>With a sigh, I stare at the stack of cards and letters wrapped with the rubber band. They\u2019re all opened. I can see the frayed tops of them, sliced through with an opener. Surely it won\u2019t matter if I just take a peek. Right?</p><p>I slip the rubber band off, and it\u2019s old enough that the rubber is tacky and has lost some of its elasticity. I can tell that Dom hasn\u2019t looked at these letters in quite a while, maybe even since he first opened them. But yet, just as the other letter, he can\u2019t throw them away. I look at the top card. There\u2019s a cross with sunshine pouring onto it.</p><p>With Sympathy for Your Loss.</p><p>I open it, skimming past the canned Hallmark words, skipping to the handwritten note at the bottom.</p><p>Dominic, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. The world has lost a light in Emma. I know this is unbearable for you now, but I\u2019ll be praying a prayer of peace for you. I know that even without her, you\u2019ll be able to go on and do great things. With love and deepest condolences, Jada Milnay</p><p>My breath freezes in my throat, and a brick seems to settle on my chest as I stare at the words. A realization dawns on me, cold and heavy.</p><p>Emma died.</p><p>I have to assume that she was Dominic\u2019s girlfriend... and she died.</p><p>My fingers fly as I shuffle the rest of the cards and skim through them.</p><p>My condolences.</p><p>Heaven has gotten another angel.</p><p>My prayers are with you.</p><p>She\u2019s in a better place.</p><p>Trite words, although what can people really say? There are no words when something tragic like that strikes.</p><p>I can hardly breathe as I get to the last card, as I stare at what lies beneath the cards, hidden at the bottom of the stack. Letters.</p><p>From Emma.</p><p>Girlish, curly handwriting fills notebook papers, with flowers and hearts doodled in the margins. My fingers shake as I read the first one.</p><p>Dom,</p><p>Thank you so much for taking me to the beach yesterday. It was the perfect day! You laughed at me so much for trying to find the perfect shells, so I enclosed a few for you. I want you to remember the day just like I remember it being: perfect.</p><p>-Em</p><p>This letter makes sense, because beneath the stack of envelopes, a smattering of tiny shells line the bottom of the box. They\u2019re clearly old, clearly fragile, and now they make perfect sense. They were a memento of a perfect day.</p><p>My breath comes quickly as I read the next one.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m looking in on the lives of two lovers.</p><p>Because I am.</p><p>Dom,</p><p>Last night was amazing. I woke up this morning and you were the first thing I thought of... and you were the last thing I thought of last night before I went to sleep. I always knew you would be my first\u2014and it was amazing. I\u2019m so glad that we shared that together, that we can say that we were each other\u2019s first.</p><p>I love you,</p><p>Em</p><p>My heart hurts. He took her virginity and she died.</p><p>I fly through the rest of the letters... but nothing in them gives me any clue as to what happened to her. Just random notes about high school, their mutual friends, their dates, and how much she loves Dominic. There are at least twenty of them, and they seem to span most of high school.</p><p>I know what she looked like now. Because in the last one, her senior picture is enclosed. She\u2019s slender and blond, with shining, friendly blue eyes that smile at the camera. She was a gorgeous girl, and it\u2019s clear that she loved life. I can see it in her eyes.</p><p>Knowing that she\u2019s dead now makes me feel like I\u2019m surrounded by a ghost. It gives me chills, and I quickly gather all of the letters back together, looping them with the cards within the aged rubber band. There\u2019s only one letter left... the letter that Dominic hasn\u2019t even opened.</p><p>As I stare at it, I notice something. The handwriting on the envelope is the same.</p><p>Emma had written the unopened letter... the one simply addressed to Dom.</p><p>And Dominic can\u2019t bring himself to read it.</p><p>For some reason, because I\u2019m sentimental, because I\u2019m soft hearted, or maybe just because I\u2019m human, that sends a railroad spike through my heart, and the pain that I sometimes see in his eyes makes sense.</p><p>Of course it crushed him. Obviously he and Emma had been together for several years. They lost their virginity together. They loved each other. And then she died.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure that a piece of Dominic died with her.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, he\u2019d told me. But I\u2019m fucked up.</p><p>Of course he is. At least that part makes sense now. The why of it, anyway. The how is still a mystery, but I\u2019m not sure that it matters. Emma is dead and there\u2019s no bringing her back. But some other things are still unanswered... like why Dominic blames Cris.</p><p>I hear a noise downstairs, a noise like a door closing, and I leap to my feet, making sure that I put everything back exactly as I found it before I rush out the door, closing it quietly behind me. I rush downstairs toward the veranda.</p><p>After dying to know more about Dominic, I\u2019m completely conflicted now and I regret snooping through his things. Something about that black velvet box made me intensely sad and melancholy.</p><p>Emma died.</p><p>She was a huge part of his life and she died. And not only that, but he refuses to talk about her or anything remotely concerning her. I know in my heart that whatever is wrong with Dominic, whatever is broken inside of him, is because of Emma. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as sure as I know that, I know that the secrets I found today will have to stay hidden until Dominic is ready to talk about them. If that day ever comes.</p><p>With each day that passes, I grow more and more afraid that it never will.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Dominic</p> <p>I find Jacey exactly where I figured she\u2019d be. Soaking in the sun by the pool.</p><p>I stand in the doorway, watching her for a minute before I go out and wake her up. She\u2019s got a magnificent body, stretched out like a cat, basking in the warmth. I have to smile about that, and as I do, she opens her eyes and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she greets me sleepily. \u201cHow was your day? I didn\u2019t figure you\u2019d be home until late.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. It fucking sucked. Amy Ashby was being her normal bitchy, entitled self, and I\u2019d counted the minutes until the day was over. I went so far as to call Tally on the way home and tear him a new ass, telling him that I\u2019d never work with Amy again. And he\u2019d calmly reminded me that the public loves seeing us together... that it makes me money.</p><p>And it does, so I shut up and finished driving home in silence. But I did have a revelation.</p> <p>As I crested the hill to my drive I realized that I\u2019d been looking forward to seeing Jacey. That the anticipation of seeing her was the reason that my day dragged by so slowly.</p><p>It was a startling thought, but now that I\u2019m here, staring down at her, it doesn\u2019t seem so startling. Being with her feels right.</p><p>And that\u2019s a startling thought.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a day,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHow was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was good. I snooped through all your stuff and swam all day. So it was just a day, too.\u201d She stares at me and there is something in her eyes, something I can\u2019t name, but then it\u2019s gone and she grins.</p><p>I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much for you to snoop through,\u201d I tell her, rolling my eyes. \u201cI hate knickknack shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right,\u201d she tells me with a yawn, sitting up to stretch. \u201cThis house seems almost like a hotel. There\u2019s nothing interesting here, except for the art on the walls. But thank you for having lunch sent over to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I answer, pulling her to her feet. Her hand is warm and moist in mine, her touch electric. I drop her fingers as soon as she\u2019s standing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hang around the house tonight. Are you up for a surprise?\u201d</p><p>She nods immediately. \u201cI love surprises. What should I wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShorts and a T-shirt are fine,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd comfortable shoes. We\u2019re going to be gone for hours, so I hope you had a nice nap.\u201d I smirk, but she doesn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d She grins as she dashes inside. \u201cI was bored.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the veranda, staring at the water, pleasantly surprised by her reaction. Most women would\u2019ve wheedled and moaned, wanting to know where we were going. But not Jacey. She likes the thrill of a surprise, I guess. And she must trust me.</p><p>The idea of that slams into my gut and I push the guilty feelings away.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t trust me with real-life stuff. She trusts me in a vague way, like she trusts that I\u2019m not a psychopath who would take her somewhere and rape her or leave her for dead. That\u2019s a big difference from trusting me in general.</p><p>That\u2019s what I tell myself, anyway. But by the time the chartered helicopter lands on the front lawn and we board, Jacey\u2019s eyes are excited and amused... and they tell me more about her than I really want to know. She does trust me... with more than I\u2019m comfortable with.</p><p>I ignore it because that\u2019s the only thing I can do. Instead, I focus on buckling up and signing the flight agreement for the pilot. When I turn back to Jacey, we\u2019re taking off, and she is practically bouncing up and down like a child.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a helicopter before,\u201d she tells me radiantly. \u201cThis is amazing. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d I tell her with a grin. \u201cYou said you liked surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I do.\u201d She nods.</p><p>The helicopter shudders a bit, then wobbles as the pilot gains control of the weight balance on board. Jacey\u2019s eyes light up and she stares downward as we fly higher and higher, lifting up and away from Los Angeles.</p><p>She chats for a while, but I can barely hold my eyes open. I\u2019m tired from getting up so early to be on set, and comfortable in the afternoon sun that\u2019s shining in on my seat.</p><p>Before I know it, Jacey is shaking me and squealing like a kid.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. It\u2019s the Grand Canyon. I can\u2019t believe you brought me here.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to find that I\u2019ve been asleep for over two hours and that the Grand Canyon is spread beneath us, majestic and dry and red.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been here?\u201d I ask Jacey as I stretch, but I already know the answer to that. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I actually haven\u2019t been many places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the Grand Canyon was a staple on family vacation lists,\u201d I mention as I stare out the window. Jacey sighs.</p><p>\u201cProbably. But my family wasn\u2019t normal. And I didn\u2019t go on very many family vacations. I didn\u2019t go on any after my parents got divorced.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Like the asshole I am, I\u2019d forgotten about her shitty childhood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her quickly. \u201cI forgot about that. Well, I\u2019m glad that I get to be the first to show you this place. I know I\u2019m weird... it\u2019s dry and desolate, but to me, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful things in the world.\u201d</p><p>Jacey presses her face to the glass, staring down as we fly across the cavernous gap of the canyon.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing me,\u201d she tells me, and she sounds almost shy. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she exclaims as the helicopter starts its descent. \u201cAre we landing in the canyon?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle at the wonder in her voice. \u201cI thought you might be hungry,\u201d I explain. \u201cThe pilot is going to drop us off for a couple of hours so we can have a picnic and explore a bit, then he\u2019ll be back to pick us up at sundown. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Jacey shakes her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that was possible. Of course it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>She reaches over and grabs my hand, holding it as the pilot settles the big bird on a flat plane of the canyon. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s nervous because of the landing, but just in case, I don\u2019t pull away. It shudders, then comes to a stop. The pilot gets out, then helps us out, cautioning us to duck our heads. I let Jacey hold my hand until I have to shake the pilot\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you in a couple of hours,\u201d I tell him. He nods, climbs back inside, and Jacey and I are alone with a picnic basket and a blanket.</p><p>As he flies away, the wind blows our hair away from our faces, stirring the dust around us. Jacey spins in a circle, trying to see everywhere at once.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how gorgeous this place is,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s so... desolate, like you said, but it\u2019s so vibrant and beautiful. It\u2019s like... it\u2019s so tough, yet such beautiful things still grow from it. It\u2019s like a metaphor for life. There\u2019s beauty even in the roughest parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I raise an eyebrow as I set our stuff down, staring at the few dots of green that grace the red and dusty horizon. \u201cAre you always so deep?\u201d</p><p>Jacey looks at me, thoughtful and quiet, with a strange expression. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just what this place brings to mind. It reminds me almost of the human spirit. We\u2019re too tough to be kept down, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re scaring me,\u201d I tell her, and I shoot her a dubious look. \u201cYou\u2019re getting really deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo deeper than you were last night,\u201d she tosses back as she spreads the blanket and opens the basket. \u201cAnd this place sort of demands it, you know? It makes me feel so small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are small, in the scheme of things,\u201d I answer as I settle next to her. She sifts through the basket, pulling out tiny sandwiches, gourmet olives, and wine, and then she looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cNow this is a picnic,\u201d she announces, pulling out the wine and glasses. \u201cWhen you do something, you do it right, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s true. I do. But I don\u2019t answer. Instead, I pop the cork on the wine, pouring us each a glass.</p><p>She hands me a turkey sandwich and takes a drink of wine.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you arrange this?\u201d she asks curiously as she takes a bite. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome, but it\u2019s so out of the blue. What made you do it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t fucking know.</p><p>I chew my sandwich, swallow, then take another bite.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I actually admit, surprising myself. \u201cI thought you might like it. And we\u2019re supposed to be hanging out. We didn\u2019t say that all of our \u2018hanging out\u2019 had to be sexual. We just said we want to have fun. And this is fun for me.\u201d</p><p>Jacey smiles, satisfied with my answer. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me, too.\u201d</p><p>We finish our meal in silence, but words aren\u2019t really necessary. We\u2019re surrounded by one of the Seven Wonders of the World. A conversation would mar the experience.</p><p>As we\u2019re putting our trash back into the basket, Jacey\u2019s fingers brush mine and she turns to me.</p><p>\u201cI see you, you know,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI know you\u2019re different than what you want people to think.\u201d</p><p>I pause, staring into her dark eyes. \u201cOh, really? And you gathered that from a trip to the Grand Canyon?\u201d</p><p>I try to sound sarcastic, to sound flippant, but the sharpness dies on my tongue, because there\u2019s something in her eyes that tells me that she does see into me.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. Not from this trip. But from a lot of little things that you don\u2019t want me to see. You know what Jake told me before I left yesterday? That someone miraculously paid Joe\u2019s back taxes. He has no idea who, but the amount was huge... thousands of dollars. And there\u2019s only one person I know who has that kind of money and might help Joe out.\u201d</p><p>I freeze, refusing to look away from her. \u201cOh, really? That was nice of someone.\u201d</p><p>Jacey rolls her eyes. \u201cYeah, it was nice of someone. Why do you pretend to be such an asshole, Dominic? When I know that you aren\u2019t, not really. You just like to pretend that you are. You\u2019re good at pretending.\u201d</p><p>I grab her hand, intent on squashing her delusion about me right now... and on getting that soft look out of her eyes once and for all. Every time I see it, every time I see how soft she gets when she thinks she sees something good in me, it twists my guts up and spits them out. Because she\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cJacey, I\u2019m not good. I\u2019m the opposite of good. Have you ever wondered if people are monsters inside, down where no one can see? Because I don\u2019t have to wonder. I know that I am. Did I pay Joe\u2019s taxes? Yeah, I did. I\u2019ve already got a bunch of time invested in community service with him and I don\u2019t want to have to go somewhere else. Period. I\u2019m not a good guy, Jacey. I\u2019m not the person that you\u2019d like to believe. Please know that. Don\u2019t make the mistake of romanticizing me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks at me doubtfully. \u201cSo you paid thousands of dollars of his taxes so that you wouldn\u2019t have to get used to another supervisor? Whatever, Dominic. You can say what you want, but I don\u2019t believe you. You helped him because you wanted to. Because you can see that he\u2019s a decent person and you wanted to help him out. Why can\u2019t you admit that? Why do insist on acting like such an ass?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cBecause I am an ass. You need to get used to the idea, Jacey. I\u2019m not going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she says dismissively, getting to her feet. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it. But I\u2019m tired of talking about it.\u201d</p><p>She stomps off and I sit for a second, trying to decide whether to go after her or not, when she comes stomping back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd another thing,\u201d she says before she stops, her eyes widening. She freezes in place, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask in confusion. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d she says quietly, looking at something past my shoulder as she takes a tentative step toward me. \u201cDon\u2019t move a muscle, Dom.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear it. An unmistakable rustle of something big behind me. The hairs lift up on the back of my neck and I stare calmly at Jacey.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Bear?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head and the color drains from her face. \u201cMountain lion. I think. It\u2019s a huge tan cat with really big teeth. It\u2019s just sitting there staring at me, about five feet behind you. What do we do?\u201d</p><p>I try to think, while at the same time I mentally distance myself from the situation so that I can stay calm. \u201cI don\u2019t think we play dead. That\u2019s for a bear. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re supposed to act intimidating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do we do that?\u201d Jacey hisses, her eyes frozen on the animal behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty intimidating itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first, we can\u2019t run,\u201d I tell her as I calmly pivot and slowly look behind me. But when I see the cat, the first thing I want to do is run.</p><p>To say it\u2019s intimidating is the biggest understatement I\u2019ve heard in a while.</p><p>The massive cat must weigh as much as I do, and its fangs glisten in the dying sunlight. It stares back at me with golden eyes and it looks almost bored. But then it growls, ever so slightly, enough to let me know that it\u2019s far from bored, enough to send shivers down my spine. It\u2019s very interested in us, even though it remains motionless.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t run, or it will think we\u2019re prey,\u201d I tell Jacey quietly. I take a slow step back, and it growls louder, its golden eyes watching my every movement, tracking me.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mutter under my breath. \u201cJacey, go. Walk away slowly and I\u2019ll stay right here. I\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Jacey answers snappishly. She waves her arms. \u201cGet out of here, you fucking animal! Go!\u201d Her shouts only seem to amuse the cat and it stares at her with even more interest, its long tail flicking in the air. It moves one large paw, planting it in the red dirt. I suck in a breath.</p><p>\u201cJacey, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s helping,\u201d I point out. \u201cIt thinks you\u2019re an appetizer.\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding by this point, because honestly, for the first time in as long as I remember, I don\u2019t know what to do. All I know is I don\u2019t want to meet my end at the end of those pointy teeth.</p><p>Jacey shouts louder, and the cat growls menacingly as she bends to pick up a large round rock, a foot in diameter. The cat opens its mouth and roars, a shrill and hoarse sound like a scream. Jacey freezes, and what happens next happens so fast that it\u2019s a blur.</p><p>The cat roars again, standing up on its hind legs and batting at the air with its paw before it lunges toward me.</p><p>Jacey shrieks and jumps in front of me, hurling the rock at the giant animal, hitting it squarely in the face. But as she throws it, she trips and sprawls in the red dust directly in front of the giant cat.</p> <p>She\u2019s entirely at its mercy.</p><p>For a second, my heart stops. I move to shield Jacey from an attack, but the cat turns, shaking its head, as if to clear it from the impact of the rock. It stumbles for a second, then to my surprise, it spins around and retreats, loping off into the distance.</p><p>I\u2019m frozen for a moment before I scramble to get to Jacey.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I demand. \u201cYou could\u2019ve been killed. You don\u2019t go rushing at a wild animal like that!\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares up at me, her eyes wide and filled with pain. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I tripped. But either way, it worked. The fucking thing is gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask her quickly. Her eyes are watering and she\u2019s gripping her ankle like she\u2019s never letting go.</p><p>\u201cMy foot,\u201d she says through gritted teeth. \u201cI twisted it. How clich\u00e9 is that?\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline is coursing through me and I swallow the acidic taste.</p><p>\u201cJacey, you could\u2019ve died. The chopper isn\u2019t coming back for us for another hour. If that thing would\u2019ve attacked you, we might not have made it to a hospital in time. Why the fuck did you do that?\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes and shrugs, determined to make it seem like a small deal. \u201cBecause it was going to jump on you. It was the only plan I could think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour plan sucked,\u201d I growl as I grab her up and haul her onto my lap, lifting her foot to examine it. As carefully as I can, I pull her sneaker off. Her foot is already swollen, and it\u2019s turning purple fast.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s broken,\u201d I tell her quietly. \u201cIt might be. Or it could just be bruised. Either way, it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to?\u201d she grimaces, gritting her teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can walk on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can\u2019t.\u201d I eye it. \u201cThere\u2019s no way. We\u2019ll just stay right here until our ride comes back. You\u2019ll have to see the Grand Canyon from here. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d she answers, nestling back into my arms, molding herself to my chest. \u201cI just hope he doesn\u2019t come back. Oh my god. He sounded like a woman screaming, didn\u2019t he? Holy shit. I\u2019ll never forget that sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d I admit, looking around. \u201cI don\u2019t see any more lurking around. You scared the shit out of that one. I doubt he\u2019ll be back.\u201d I glance down at her swollen foot and wince. \u201cI wish I\u2019d thought to bring some ibuprofen or something. I\u2019m sorry. God. This is the second time you\u2019ve been hurt because of me.\u201d</p><p>Something akin to guilt wells up in me, but she shrugs, curling up on my lap. It\u2019s been awhile since someone has lain there for a reason other than sucking my dick. I try not to think about that as I wrap my arms around her and keep her close.</p><p>She just risked her life for me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know anyone, other than my parents or Sin or maybe Duncan, who would do that for me. It\u2019s mind-blowing, actually.</p><p>When the helicopter arrives an hour later, I realize something else startling. I\u2019ve been holding her hand this entire time and I didn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Jacey</p><p>My foot throbs like bloody hell as I curl up once again on Dominic\u2019s veranda and soak in the moonlight. Since I can\u2019t move from my seat, I make sure to enjoy the scenery, which consists of Dominic\u2019s perfect ass and chiseled abs. I\u2019ve been staring at both things off and on for the last hour.</p><p>\u201cThank you for having a doctor come by,\u201d I tell him once again. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know doctors made house calls anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople will do anything if you pay them enough,\u201d Dominic answers tiredly, bringing a tray of food through the glass doors. \u201cHe\u2019s the doctor we use on set. I\u2019m just glad your ankle isn\u2019t broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I reply as cheerfully as I can. \u201cJust bruised. I\u2019ll be good as new in a week or so.\u201d</p><p>Dominic rolls his eyes. \u201cAre you always this cheerful?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHell no. Try waking me up before nine A.M. and you\u2019ll see a whole new level of ugly.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, settling back into the cushions. \u201cDo you want to go to bed? You must be tired.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThe pain meds your guy gave me are making me a little sleepy, but I\u2019m sort of too amped up to rest. Can we just talk for a while?\u201d</p><p>Dominic looks pained. \u201cOh yeah. My favorite thing to do.\u201d</p><p>The way he says it makes me laugh and Dominic smiles. \u201cSo glad to be a source of amusement to you.\u201d</p><p>I smile again as the warm breeze lifts the hair away from my face. \u201cCan you help me into the pool? It was so hot and dry out in the canyon that I\u2019d like to get wet.\u201d</p><p>I left myself wide open for a sexual jab by Dominic, but he ignores it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cThe doctor said you should rest your foot.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHe also said it wasn\u2019t broken. Trust me, I\u2019ve got enough pain meds in me to put out a small horse. I\u2019m feeling no pain.\u201d To prove my point, I stand up awkwardly, swaying a bit before I catch my balance. I strip off my shirt, then sit back down to take off my shorts.</p><p>Dominic doesn\u2019t say anything... he just sits back and watches me, his eyes darkening as I strip off my bra. There\u2019s a million things hidden in his eyes right now, but he doesn\u2019t voice any of them. Instead, he just stands up and gently grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I nod, expecting him to help me hobble into the water, but that\u2019s not what he does. Instead, he scoops me up and carries me directly into the pool, pausing only for a second to kick his shoes off at the edge.</p><p>Other than that, he\u2019s fully clothed.</p><p>He carries me straight into the water, completely soaking his clothes. I stare at him in shock. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you undress?\u201d</p><p>He stares down at me, his dark gaze meeting mine. \u201cJacey, you jumped in front of a cougar for me today. If you say you want to swim, I\u2019m going to drop what I\u2019m doing and carry you into the water.\u201d</p><p>A weird feeling ripples through me, warm and tingly.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s all I had to do to impress you? I just had to jump in front of a hungry wild animal? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I would\u2019ve done it a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He throws his head back and laughs, a genuine laugh and his teeth gleam in the dark. He tightens his grip on me for a second, then he lowers me carefully into the water, holding me up as I gingerly set my foot down, then pick it back up and tread water.</p><p>\u201cWho says you impressed me?\u201d he asks mockingly, treading water in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m only admitting that I owe you. I pay my debts.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes now. \u201cWhatever. I know you\u2019re impressed. And what\u2019s more, you like me. You just don\u2019t want to admit it. You don\u2019t want to admit that I\u2019m a decent person... because you think that the world is only made up of assholes. To admit that I\u2019m not horrible would mess up your deep-seated belief system. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>Dom cocks his head, studying me in the night. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t decent?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrug, my fingers slicing through the cool water. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am. But compared to your opinion of humanity, I think I do okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not decent, then who is?\u201d Dominic demands, swimming toward me. \u201cBecause I\u2019d like to meet that person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best friend Maddy,\u201d I answer immediately. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty amazing. But she moved to Connecticut, so you probably won\u2019t ever meet her. That\u2019s good though. She\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous, and my brother would kick your ass if he caught you drooling over her, so it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I would drool over her if you were in the room?\u201d Dominic asks softly, treading water very close to me. The moonlight makes him look pensive, thoughtful. And I stare at him.</p> <p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I answer finally. \u201cEveryone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Dominic replies firmly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have any need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me today?\u201d I demand quickly. \u201cFirst a picnic in the Grand Canyon, then you ordered a private midnight snack on your veranda, and now you\u2019re giving me compliments. You\u2019re freaking me out, Dom. Knock it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even begun to get nice yet,\u201d he tells me, his voice growing as dark as his eyes. He pushes me through the water until we reach the side of the pool, where he rests his hands on either side of my hips. \u201cWant me to start right now?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t give me a chance to reply. Instead, he kisses me, suddenly and thoroughly. His mouth covers mine, his lips cold and wet. I wrap my arms around his neck and hold on, melting into him, absorbing his heat, enjoying the way his wet body feels against mine.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d he whispers into my ear. \u201cWhy did you risk yourself like that for me?\u201d</p><p>He nips at my ear and trails his lips down the length of my neck until he reaches my collarbone. \u201cTell me,\u201d he demands. \u201cI need to know. I don\u2019t see what you gained from it.\u201d</p><p>I force myself to pull away from him, just for a minute. \u201cI didn\u2019t gain anything from it,\u201d I answer sharply. \u201cJust the knowledge and satisfaction of knowing that you didn\u2019t get eaten. That was enough.\u201d</p><p>He pulls away too, just for a minute, and stares into my eyes. In the night, his eyes look almost black. Without saying another word, he kisses me again, and again, and again. Hard, soft, brutal, exquisite.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d I urge him. \u201cI want to feel your skin.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, he does. He peels off the wet clothes and flings them onto the stone deck, turning again to pull me to him. His chest is hard, his stomach flat, and his dick hard. Very hard. It wedges between my legs and I shiver a bit, at the mere thought that it\u2019s all for me.</p> <p>He\u2019s hard for me.</p><p>He lifts me up and I wrap my legs around his waist, kissing him yet again. I decide that I could kiss him forever... he\u2019s perfect at it. His tongue slides along my lip and he bites at it, just a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you want more?\u201d he whispers. \u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to that?\u201d I answer softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell what I want?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me. \u201cI just like hearing the word yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d get tired of hearing it all the time,\u201d I reply as he holds me up in the water.</p><p>\u201cNot from you,\u201d he answers. He kisses me again, his lips consuming me. And then he stops, looking at me seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a very good actor,\u201d he tells me matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m good at pretending that I\u2019m someone else. And tonight, I\u2019m going to be someone else. Does that bother you?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised by his sudden turn and by the oh-so-serious expression on his face, but no, I\u2019m not bothered. I tell him that and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cBut who do you want to be?\u201d I add curiously. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cAnyone but me.\u201d</p><p>He pushes me against the side of the pool, thrusting his hips against me, rubbing me. His weight is perfect, hard, rigid, amazing. I suck in a breath when he bends his head and nips at my breast, sucking my nipple into his mouth. I throw my head back as he sucks harder.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I manage to persist, even though he\u2019s trying his best to distract me. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty amazing. Why would you want to be someone else? Are you sure that you just don\u2019t want me to be someone else?\u201d</p><p>Dominic stops what he\u2019s doing and pulls away, looking at me with a hard expression. His green eyes have a dull light in them now, something that happens when he\u2019s annoyed. I stare back, trying to be unabashed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks slowly. \u201cWhy would I want you to be someone else?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, trying to ignore my pounding heart. Why did I choose this moment to bring this up? Why? But I\u2019m not one to back down, so I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just thought maybe you were pretending that I\u2019m Emma.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the name falls from my lips, I know it\u2019s a mistake.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s face immediately closes, his eyes turning into hardened marble. He releases me quickly as though touching me is burning his hands. And then he turns his back on me and walks out of the pool.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I call after him as I follow. \u201cIt was just a question. I was just wondering. About her.\u201d</p><p>Dominic turns, and for a minute his face is filled with pain, but then he conceals it, replacing it with a hardened mask. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any right to be curious about her,\u201d he answers starkly. \u201cPlease don\u2019t bring her up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dominic holds up his hand. \u201cNo buts. She isn\u2019t significant to you. Just leave it alone. Good night.\u201d</p><p>He actually turns around and stalks back into the house, leaving me to stand naked on his terrace alone.</p><p>What the hell was that about? He can\u2019t even hear her name? I think I have every right to ask if he\u2019s imagining that I\u2019m her. But then again, he has no idea that I saw the letters... and her picture. He doesn\u2019t know how much I know of her.</p><p>And how much it tells about him.</p><p>But as I think of it, I realize too that I don\u2019t really know all that much at all. What I do know is that if we\u2019re going to continue whatever it is that we are doing, I need to know.</p><p>I need to know about Emma. I need to know how she broke Dominic.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I lay in the dark, naked and alone, and try to pull myself together.</p><p>Quit being such a pussy.</p><p>But Emma\u2019s name, coming from Jacey\u2019s lips, was such an unexpected shock to the system that it took the wind out of me. Jacey has no idea how much I don\u2019t pretend that she\u2019s Emma. She has no idea how much that name guts me.</p><p>And she won\u2019t ever know, because there\u2019s no way in hell that I\u2019m going to talk about it. Jesus.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d been so close... so close to simply pretending that I was someone else tonight... and fucking Jacey in my pool.</p><p>I almost let my guard down that fucking much.</p><p>It won\u2019t happen again. I flip over onto my back and shove a pillow onto my head so I can sleep.</p><p>The flight home is awkward and quiet. Jacey stares quietly out the window, barely saying anything. I want to say something, but I\u2019m not sure what. I\u2019m not sure what there is to say. She wants more of me than I can give. She wants to know me.</p><p>Well, she thinks she does. If she did get to know me, she\u2019d take back that wish. I can guarantee that.</p><p>I drop her off at her house, and she barely looks at me as she kisses my cheek and gets out of the car.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t talk to me for two days.</p><p>It\u2019s a long fucking two days.</p><p>She ignores me at work, and by the first night, I itch to call her. I go so far as to pull out my phone and start to dial her number before I stare at it and sigh.</p><p>Call her and say what?</p><p>There\u2019s nothing to say. We\u2019re at an impasse. She needs more than I can give.</p><p>The strange thing is that I wish it were different. For the first time ever, I wish that I could be that guy. The guy who can do a relationship. The guy who can do the give-and-take thing. But I know me. And I know that I\u2019m the guy who just takes and takes.</p><p>I don\u2019t have the ability to give.</p><p>I put my phone away.</p><p>On the second day, as I round the corner into the locker room, I hear Jacey\u2019s voice and I freeze, not wanting her to see me.</p><p>\u201cI know, Mad.\u201d She sighs, and I know that she\u2019s on the phone with her best friend. \u201cI know. But he\u2019s not like Jared. I swear to god. He\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause while she listens, and I\u2019d give my left nut to be able to hear what Maddy is saying.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t talk about it,\u201d she continues. \u201cTrust me, I tried. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Maddy must\u2019ve interrupted, because Jacey abruptly stops and listens.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that. I know I can\u2019t control how other people act. I can only control myself. I know.\u201d</p><p>She sighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m falling for him, Mad. I tried not to. But I can\u2019t help it. There\u2019s something more to him. Something deep and hurt. Deep down, he\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s just injured on the inside.\u201d</p><p>Pause.</p><p>And then she protests. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. Mad, it\u2019s like when you met Gabe. You knew he might not be good for you, but your gut told you that there was something really good inside him. And there was, Mad. I think Dom might be the same way.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, during which my tongue feels like a piece of lead.</p><p>She\u2019s falling for me?</p><p>My heart runs away in my chest and I\u2019m utterly frozen to the ground.</p><p>I can\u2019t be the person she wants me to be. I\u2019m not good deep down, not like she thinks. No matter how much I like her or how much I like being around her, I don\u2019t see the sense in continuing this when I know what the end result will be.</p><p>I owe her that much. If she can\u2019t protect herself from me, I\u2019ll do it for her.</p><p>I walk around the corner, and Jacey looks up from where she\u2019s sitting on a locker room bench. Her eyes widen at the sight of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go, Mad. I\u2019ll call you later. Love you too.\u201d</p><p>She stands up and slips her phone in her pocket. As she turns toward me, her eyes so fucking soft and gentle, I have every intention of firmly ending things.</p><p>Very firmly. So firmly that she won\u2019t even try to change my mind.</p><p>But then she speaks, and what she says takes me by surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dominic,\u201d she says simply, staring into my eyes. \u201cAbout the other night, I mean. I shouldn\u2019t have brought up an old girlfriend like that. Whatever happened with you and her... it\u2019s not my business. We\u2019re just having fun... and that was out of line. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked that she would apologize. I\u2019m shocked she would say that we\u2019re just having fun when I\u2019d just heard her tell Maddy that she was falling for me.</p><p>It\u2019s so drastically different from the conversation that I thought I\u2019d be having right now that all I can do is nod.</p><p>I nod, because if she wants to pretend that we\u2019re so fucking casual, if she wants to go on with the status quo and not acknowledge the feelings that might change everything, then I\u2019m not going to stop her. Not yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m too fucking selfish for that.</p><p>So, nodding, I answer, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too.

Did it hurt?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI was thinking the same thing about you. But hey, I\u2019m not going to question a girl who punches cougars in the face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She shoves my arm. \u201cI didn\u2019t punch it in the face. I threw a rock into its face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d I tell her wryly, and with that, the tension between us is lifted.</p><p>Just like that. We\u2019re back to pretending again, our stupid little fantasy where we act like we\u2019re got everything under control, that we\u2019re nothing more than friends with benefits.</p><p>That\u2019s okay with me.</p><p>I\u2019m an actor. I can fucking act.</p> <p>The problem is, this isn\u2019t a movie. Jacey and I are balancing on a very thin line between a fa\u00e7ade and reality. We\u2019re treading on very thin ice. In real life, when people walk on ice for too long, they finally break through.</p><p>And when that happens, someone drowns.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Dominic</p><p>Being the fucking actors that we are, Jacey and I pretend that everything is fine. We talk back and forth for the rest of the day about nonsense things, gossipy things, things that don\u2019t fucking matter.</p><p>When it\u2019s almost time to go home, I\u2019m getting ready to see if she wants to duck out with me and grab dinner when Jake, Tig, and two other boys come walking through the gym with about a million balloons, all of them pink.</p> <p>All of them say HAPPY BIRTHDAY.</p><p>Surprised, I stare at Jacey and find her grinning wildly.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she squeals as she rushes up to hug them.</p><p>\u201cI might\u2019ve said something,\u201d a deep voice rumbles. The balloons part and a guy steps out. Big, dark haired, dark eyed. He\u2019s got Jacey\u2019s eyes and a tattoo on his bicep: DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR.</p><p>\u201cGabe!\u201d she shrieks, running at him in a dead sprint and leaping into his arms. \u201cHow are you... why are you...\u201d</p><p>Her voice dies off and he laughs, holding her easily in his heavily muscled arms. He and Brand were certainly cut from the same cloth.</p><p>\u201cI finally rendered you speechless?\u201d He grins. \u201cWell, that only took twenty-four years. And you think I\u2019d miss your birthday? Really? I called Joe and asked if we could surprise you here. He roped the boys in on it too.\u201d</p><p>Jacey pulls away and looks at him. \u201cBut Maddy\u2019s due soon. You shouldn\u2019t have left her.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe chuckles and sets his sister on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m only here for the evening, just to be on the safe side. I\u2019ll fly back home tonight. But Maddy sends her birthday wishes\u2014she\u2019s going to call you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe actually called me just now. She couldn\u2019t wait. And she didn\u2019t let it slip that you were here. Oh my gosh, I miss you guys so much!\u201d Jacey cries, and her eyes actually do well up. Gabe glares at her mockingly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry on your birthday,\u201d he instructs her with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re so dramatic.\u201d</p><p>She arches an eyebrow. \u201cDramatic? I haven\u2019t seen you in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now,\u201d he pacifies her. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you to eat, and I want to hear everything that\u2019s going on. Brand\u2019s picking us up.\u201d</p><p>They brush past me, and as they do, Jacey pauses, looking at me. \u201cGabe, this is Dominic Kinkaide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe actor,\u201d Gabe points out, his eyebrow raised as he stares at me. I can actually see the thoughts in his eyes. The protective big-brother genes have stepped in, and he wants to know what I am to his sister.</p><p>\u201cGuilty,\u201d I tell him, holding out my hand. Technically, I\u2019m only addressing what he said out loud. But I\u2019m also admitting guilt to the question in his eyes. Yes, I\u2019ve done inappropriate things with his sister. No, I\u2019m not sorry.</p><p>And no, I\u2019m not afraid of him. He probably sees all of that in my eyes, just like I see all of the questions in his.</p><p>\u201cGabe Vincent,\u201d he says politely, shaking my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. Brand\u2019s told me all about you\u2014and how you and Jacey wound up here together.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>But I keep my expression calm. \u201cThat was a messed-up night, and I\u2019m sorry that Jacey was involved in it at all. Thankfully, we\u2019ll be done with our community service soon and we can forget it ever happened.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me, and there\u2019s hurt in her eyes because it sounds like I\u2019m saying that I want to forget about her, too. I feel a twinge of guilt about that, in addition to the fact that I didn\u2019t even know it was her birthday. But I\u2019m saying what her brother wants to hear. Gabe nods.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you.\u201d</p><p>And they disappear through the door. I follow them so I can get to my own car and step outside just in time to hear Jacey squeal again.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Brand is driving up in a little red Honda Civic. He looks like Grape Ape in the thing with his head grazing the ceiling, but the situation is clear.</p><p>Either Brand or Gabe bought Jacey a car for her birthday.</p><p>She\u2019s jumping around like a lunatic, hugging them both and shrieking like a kid.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! I can\u2019t believe you did this!\u201d She\u2019s crying and shrieking and Gabe laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d let you drive that piece-of-shit death trap around forever? Whatever. Happy birthday, sis.\u201d</p><p>She hugs him, then hugs Brand. When she stares up at Brand, with her arms around his neck... the way she looks at him, like he\u2019s a fucking hero or something, causes my stomach to clench.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>His big hands hold her close, and Gabe catches me staring. I can see in his eyes that he sees what I see. Brand\u2019s in love with his sister.</p><p>Whether Jacey is still denying it is unclear.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jace.\u201d Gabe pulls her away from Brand. \u201cLet\u2019s get some dinner. I\u2019ll buy you cupcakes for dessert.\u201d</p><p>They pile into Jacey\u2019s new car and drive away.</p><p>Joe stands behind me, watching them leave. \u201cThose boys got medals for their time in Afghanistan. Jacey comes from good people, son.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother reminding him that I\u2019m not his son. It doesn\u2019t bother me as much this time as it usually does. Not now that Joe actually seems to like me.</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d I agree as I start toward my car. Too bad one of them is in love with her.</p><p>\u201cKinkaide, wait!\u201d Joe calls. I pause, turning back toward him. \u201cI know what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I ask, staring at him in confusion. I\u2019m thinking that he\u2019s figured out that Jacey and I are seeing each other, but no.</p><p>\u201cI know you paid my taxes,\u201d Joe says firmly, staring at me. \u201cDon\u2019t bother denying it. It had to be you. You overheard me on the phone with the IRS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not denying it,\u201d I answer, just as firmly, my hand on my car door. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this place to have to close. I don\u2019t do enough humanitarian things, so it was just as much for me as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a charity case,\u201d Joe tells me proudly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll pay you back every cent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d I tell him quickly. \u201cIt was something I wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do need to,\u201d Joe replies. \u201cAnd I will. And I don\u2019t want you thinking that you get special treatment around here. You\u2019re still going to have to get here on time, and you can\u2019t miss days. I won\u2019t cut you any slack because of this, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I answer wryly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of that.\u201d</p><p>And I wouldn\u2019t have. Joe doesn\u2019t play favorites, and he\u2019s only just starting to like me. I climb into my car, but before I can close my door, Joe says my name again.</p><p>I look up at him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Joe stares at me with faded blue eyes. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I know it was hard for him to say, so I just nod and drive away without making a big deal of it. I\u2019m surprised how good helping him has made me feel, though. I\u2019m buoyed by a sense of moral goodness, and that\u2019s something I rarely get the chance to feel. It\u2019s a novel fucking feeling.</p><p>I aimlessly drive for a while before I pick up a sandwich. I\u2019m restless and I know why. I want to know what\u2019s going on with Brand and Jacey.</p><p>Is it my business?</p><p>Hell no. Because I\u2019m not supposed to care.</p><p>But what the hell are they doing right now?</p><p>I\u2019m being pathetic, like a jealous teenager. At the same time, I feel like an ass because I hadn\u2019t known about her birthday. The girl risked her life for me, for god\u2019s sake. The least I can do is know when her birthday is.</p><p>But better late than never.</p><p>I scroll through my phone for the flower shop nearest to her house and make a call.</p><p>After five minutes, I smile as I speak. \u201cGreat. That\u2019s exactly what I want. Yes, I know it\u2019s an unusual request. Yes, I\u2019m sure people usually like the stems, too.\u201d</p><p>I head to the nearest bar and drink a couple of whiskeys before I drive for Jacey\u2019s house. I haven\u2019t texted her, so I have no idea when she\u2019ll be home. All I know is, when she does come back, I\u2019ll be waiting for her.</p><p>Well, me and a yard full of flower petals.</p><p>I stand at her gate, smiling as I stare at her tiny lawn. It\u2019s completely blanketed by several inches of pink rose petals. I can smell the thick rose smell from here. The wind rustles them, spreading them across the sidewalk, carrying their scent on the breeze. It looks like something out of an abstract painting. Or a dream.</p><p>Her dream.</p><p>I sit on her porch and wait.</p><p>I entertain myself by scrolling through my phone, and it\u2019s almost dusk when I hear her talking. I pick my head up to find Brand walking Jacey along the sidewalk in front of the house.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to follow me home,\u201d Jacey tells him, smiling up at him. My gut clenches yet again over the expression on her face. \u201cI\u2019ve watched my brother fly away a million other times when you guys were still in the Army. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just wanted to make sure,\u201d Brand says quietly. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, Jace. I know you feel all alone here, but you\u2019re not. I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>They stop in the middle of the sidewalk, and neither of them have noticed me yet. Jacey stands on her tiptoes and kisses Brand\u2019s cheek. \u201cI know,\u201d she replies softly. \u201cYou always have been. Thank you for an amazing birthday, Brand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He stares down at her, and the moment suddenly seems painfully intimate. I can\u2019t take it. I clear my throat and they both startle, staring at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cDominic!\u201d Jacey exclaims, stepping away from Brand and peering into the darkness toward me. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see your car. What are you doing here?\u201d And then she notices her yard.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d She breathes, her eyes widening. \u201cOh my god. Did you do this?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t know it was your birthday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stares at me, her eyes still wide. \u201cAnd so you made my dream come true? You\u2019re responsible for the death of a million roses now, but oh my god. It\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, trying to ignore the awe in her eyes. \u201cI came to see if you wanted to hang out for a while. For your birthday. I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d still be tied up.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Brand and back at Jacey. She\u2019s shaking her head. \u201cBrand just followed me home. He was afraid I\u2019d be upset over Gabe leaving. He keeps forgetting that I\u2019m a big girl now.\u201d She laughs, and Brand looks pained.</p><p>I know that he\u2019s actually very aware that she\u2019s a big girl now, but I don\u2019t say that.</p> <p>Instead, I quickly try to think of something that I can do with Jacey, somewhere to invite her that would seem like a date. I want to drive home to Brand that Jacey isn\u2019t his.</p><p>I smile as I get an idea. \u201cI thought I\u2019d take my car out to the track to blow off some steam. Would you like to come?\u201d</p><p>Jacey looks intrigued. \u201cTo a race track? Sure, that might be fun. I\u2019ll try anything once. But only if I can drive too.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cAs if you could handle it.\u201d I\u2019m pretending that Brand isn\u2019t even here, but Jacey turns around to kiss him on the cheek again.</p><p>\u201cThank you again, big bro,\u201d she tells him. I swear to god I can see him flinch at that. I fight back a smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d She turns back to me. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to run to the restroom and then I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p> <p>She darts into the house, leaving me with Brand. He stares at me, his gaze sharp and pointed and I sigh.</p><p>I knew this was going to happen at some point, and it might as well be now. I turn to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem with me?\u201d I ask him. I might as well just get it out there. Brand stares back at me, and Jesus, the guy is enormous. I don\u2019t give a shit though. I\u2019m not intimidated by anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Brand asks, his lip twitching in amusement. I don\u2019t find anything funny.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can tell that you do,\u201d I say calmly. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out why, since Jacey told me that you guys are just friends, that you\u2019re a big brother to her.\u201d</p><p>I hit a nerve there, but I meant to. Something passes over his face, but he doesn\u2019t acknowledge it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve known her for a long time,\u201d he says instead. \u201cAnd I watch her back. Keep that in mind, friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends,\u201d I point out, like the asshole that I am. \u201cWe only just met.\u201d</p><p>Brand nods slowly. \u201cTrue. But we\u2019re not enemies either. Yet. I\u2019d like to keep it that way. How about you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s not a threat in his voice, more like a promise. If I fuck with Jacey, I\u2019ll be his enemy. I feel fairly confident that that isn\u2019t a good thing to be.</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d I nod. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a minute before he walks away. He climbs into his truck and sits there, waiting for us to leave. It occurs to me that he doesn\u2019t like the idea of leaving Jacey and I alone together. It\u2019s a thought that makes me smirk again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jacey asks innocently as she emerges from her house and catches me grinning.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I answer, as we walk to my car and I open her door. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p> <p>She nods, tosses her purse on the floorboard and we drive away. Brand\u2019s truck follows us for a while, and I can feel his eyes burning into the back of my neck, but the next time I look, he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you been racing your car?\u201d Jacey asks curiously.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Years. I like speed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jacey sighs. \u201cFast cars and fast women.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle and rev the engine at the light. When the light turns green, I squeal my tires and take off from the line like a shot. When I glance over at Jacey, she\u2019s relaxed in her seat, staring out the window.</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d I ask her. \u201cNo reaction whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>She giggles.</p><p>\u201cDid you expect me to be terrified? Not gonna happen. I grew up with Gabe and Brand and they did some dumbass things with cars... usually when I was with them. I\u2019m never scared... not if I trust who\u2019s driving.\u201d</p><p>I glance at her quickly before I look back at the road. \u201cAnd you trust me? Silly girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I answer.</p><p>One of Sin\u2019s songs comes on the radio, so I turn it up and we ride the rest of the way with Duncan\u2019s steady drums thumping in our chests and Sin\u2019s voice in our ears. It\u2019s one of his slower songs, a dark love song, and when I glance over at Jacey she\u2019s got her eyes closed and she\u2019s moving her lips with the words.</p><p>My soul is black, black as night, but you love it anyway.</p><p>Your heart is cold, cold as ice, but it\u2019s mine to take.</p><p>I\u2019ll take it and crush it because that\u2019s what I do,</p><p>And you\u2019ll ask for more, because that\u2019s you.</p><p>Something about the way the dark words move her tightens my chest. It\u2019s like she understands what he\u2019s saying because she\u2019s been there. Only unlike the rest of us, she came out of it unscathed, still innocent... and to be honest, I envy her that.</p><p>As we arrive at the track and get out of the car, I mention the song to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked Sin a few times what this fucking song means. He always just shakes his head and tells me that if I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019ll never get it. He sees himself as a complex artist and music is his canvas.\u201d</p><p>I meant it as a joking dig at my brother, but Jacey looks up at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get that song? It\u2019s easy, Dom. It\u2019s about a coldhearted guy who uses people for what he wants\u2014women, usually. He can\u2019t feel anything. I guess I just thought Sin wrote the song about you.\u201d</p><p>I stop in my tracks, staring at her. I can\u2019t help it. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m coldhearted?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I care, but I don\u2019t like the thought.</p><p>But Jacey is already shaking her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But I think you do. And I think that every day, you try to live up to your own idea of yourself. You\u2019re not giving yourself enough credit and you sell yourself short on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes widen and then I get a hold of myself, shaking my head and hiding my thoughts. \u201cWhatever, Dr. Vincent. Maybe you should be a psychiatrist instead of a waitress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d She sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at reading people. But whatever.\u201d She turns around. \u201cWhat do we do now? I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to the Autobahn?\u201d Before my words are even out, Jacey is snorting.</p><p>\u201cDominic, my old car couldn\u2019t even make it to work, let alone around a fancy country club racetrack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThank god you have a new one now. We have to start out by signing in and grabbing a helmet and a tracksuit. Then they\u2019ll look at my car really quick for an inspection and we\u2019ll hit the track. There won\u2019t be anyone else here because I\u2019ve arranged for them to stay open late for us.\u201d</p><p>Jacey nods and we set off for the clubhouse. Within fifteen minutes, we\u2019re suited up and buckled in, waiting for a green flag.</p><p>\u201cYou do this a lot?\u201d Jacey asks, her voice muffled a bit by her helmet.</p><p>I nod. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m in town. It\u2019s a good stress reliever. To just come out here and open up the throttle? I can feel the stress melting away already.\u201d</p><p>The green flag drops and I floor it.</p><p>My engine roars as I double-clutch shift, my foot vibrating with the power beneath it. Jacey is gripping her door, her eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>\u201cHow fast can we go?\u201d she shouts.</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you want to go?\u201d I answer, shifting into third.</p><p>We take off like a shot, weaving in and out of the curves of the road, hugging the asphalt like a second skin. Jacey laughs, her head thrown back against her headrest because of the speed.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she urges.</p><p>I oblige. There\u2019s basically no one else out here, so we\u2019ve got the track to ourselves. That makes it easier to open it up and just go.</p><p>Jacey is utterly unfazed by the speed, by the danger that speed represents... and honestly, that pleases the hell out of me. I don\u2019t even know why. I just like that she\u2019s so able to toss her cares away, enjoy the freedom speed brings... and trust me not to lose control.</p><p>It\u2019s at least one area where her trust is not displaced. I very, very rarely lose control. Of anything.</p><p>She looks over at me, laughing. \u201cI want to drive. Can I?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t give a moment\u2019s thought to the fact that this car costs more than Jacey probably makes in several years as a waitress. I don\u2019t even think about the fact that she\u2019s never driven something so powerful. All I can think about is the fact that she wants to.</p><p>I pull over on the next straightaway. \u201cYou don\u2019t have enough experience to take a curve, but you can drive this straightaway. You can totally open it up, if you want to. Just start to brake by that yellow sign, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods, we switch seats, and the tires are squealing almost before my seatbelt clicks.</p><p>I grin as we fly down the straightaway, because the girl has no fear.</p><p>Jacey shifts gears flawlessly, moving fluidly from one gear to the next like she\u2019s been driving this way her whole life. As we pass the yellow sign, her speed flashes.</p><p>\u201cOne eighty!\u201d she crows as we start to slow down.</p><p>We stop and she takes her helmet off, then tugs at mine.</p><p>She leans over and kisses me hard, the exhilaration of speed turning her on. I kiss her back, hard, because I know how that feels. I feel that way every single time I get behind the wheel here. When she finally pulls away, her eyes are shining.</p><p>\u201cThat was fucking awesome,\u201d she announces. \u201cNow I see what you love about it. Let\u2019s do it again.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle, but open my door. \u201cWe can\u2019t. The club will be closing soon and we need to head back to the front. I\u2019d better drive now, Andretti.\u201d Jacey grumbles, but gives in.</p><p>As we drive back toward the club entrance, I glance over at her.</p><p>\u201cSo... about you and Brand.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me, her face closing up cautiously. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><p>I steer around a curve fluidly before I continue. \u201cYou say that he\u2019s like your brother. But it\u2019s clear to anyone who watches you that he doesn\u2019t feel the same. Not anymore. He probably did once upon a time, but you\u2019ve grown up. And he\u2019s fallen in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Jacey swallows, then stares at the floor. And it\u2019s completely evident that she knows.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d I say simply, and ice floods my heart. I\u2019d been holding out hope that she wasn\u2019t coldhearted. \u201cYou knew and you\u2019ve been using him, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze snaps back up to mine, and her eyes are gleaming.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that. I haven\u2019t wanted to believe that it\u2019s true. But lately, I haven\u2019t been able to ignore it. I know you\u2019re right. But I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I love him like my brother. He\u2019s always been there for me, and I don\u2019t want anything to change. And I don\u2019t use him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Relief washes over me, but I try to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t feel the same way about him?\u201d I ask carefully as I pull the car in front of the clubhouse.</p><p>Jacey sighs, staring into the night sky. \u201cI wish I did. It would make things a lot easier. Brand would never hurt me. Not ever. He\u2019d rather die. And that\u2019s the kind of person that I need. Sometimes I feel like I should just be with him, that maybe I could grow into loving him like that. He\u2019s definitely someone worthy of that kind of love. But then again, because he\u2019s so worthy, he deserves more than I can give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling,\u201d I admit, and I\u2019m startled when I say the words. Jacey stares at me, and her voice is hesitant.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that I find myself liking you... more and more each day. I don\u2019t want to, because I know what happens when you open yourself up to someone. You get hurt. Or you hurt them. The world is full of people hurting each other, Jacey. And I don\u2019t want to do that. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I brought our conversation to this dark and serious place. What happened to acting casual and normal? But truthfully, deep down, I think I just can\u2019t stand the inevitability of it all.</p><p>I can\u2019t stand pretending that everything is fine when I know that one day, very soon, everything is going to implode.</p><p>Right now, even I can hear the emptiness in my voice, and Jacey hears it too.</p> <p>She stares at me. \u201cWho hurt you, Dom?\u201d she asks gently. \u201cWas it Emma?\u201d</p><p>Like always, her name forms a vise around my heart. I close my eyes, refusing to answer.</p><p>\u201cI know Emma hurt you,\u201d Jacey continues, refusing to back down. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. But I know she did. You\u2019ve got to open up about it, Dominic. If you don\u2019t, it will eat at you forever.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and stare at her bleakly. \u201cIt will eat at me forever anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to keep closed off to be safe, then?\u201d Jacey asks, and she sounds sad and distant. \u201cI know that whatever happened with Emma has defined who you are, from your sex life to your career. It\u2019s why you keep to yourself, why you\u2019re so distant. You want to protect yourself by never opening yourself up again. You shouldn\u2019t do that, Dom. It\u2019s not healthy. I know from experience. Do you want to know how I know?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, waiting, so I finally nod.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s my birthday, and neither of my parents bothered to call me. No card, no call, no gift, not even a \u2018Hey, we brought you into the world on this day twenty-four years ago, so have a good day.\u2019 They didn\u2019t contact me at all. That\u2019s why Gabe came here... because he knew they wouldn\u2019t. And just like always, he wanted to protect me from that. But he can\u2019t. Because even though he came and it was awesome, it doesn\u2019t take away the fact that they didn\u2019t even call. But even though they\u2019re horrible parents and they hurt me all the time, I know that I can\u2019t close myself off. That would only end up hurting me, Dom.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad for her, because honestly, I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like to have parents who don\u2019t give a shit. And even though Gabe clearly doesn\u2019t like me much, I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s such a rock for his sister. Even still, I don\u2019t know what parallel Jacey is trying to draw.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201d I ask woodenly. \u201cWhat point are you trying to prove? Are you trying to show me that your parents fucked you up, but you\u2019re trying to get past it? Because good for you.\u201d</p><p>Jacey shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cI want you to see what I learned... because you need to learn it too. It\u2019s taken me a while to learn it, and honestly, I\u2019m still trying to deal with it all. But even though our situations are different and we react to our situations in different ways, we\u2019re dealing with the same kind of pain.\u201d</p><p>She pauses, and I stare at her dubiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Dom. People have hurt us. But the lesson for us both is that people will hurt us in life, and we just have to get over it. We have to keep going and keep opening ourselves up to people. Will we get hurt again? Maybe so. But maybe we won\u2019t. Maybe we\u2019ll end up with something real.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, so Jacey continues.</p> <p>\u201cIf something doesn\u2019t change, you\u2019re going to end up sad and alone, Dominic. I don\u2019t want that for you. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way, you know. There\u2019s something between us... and I know you can feel it too. We have the opportunity for something real, Dom, even though we\u2019re pretending that we don\u2019t. We really do.\u201d</p><p>A sharp rap on the window interrupts her, interrupting the moment at the same time. A worker hands me the clipboard to sign out, and I scrawl my name. I fire my engine back up and drive toward Chicago and try to ignore my pounding heart.</p><p>There can be no more pretending now. Jacey just confronted things head-on.</p><p>We\u2019re quiet now. Awkward. Tense.</p><p>I can feel Jacey staring at me from time to time, waiting for me to react to what she said, but I don\u2019t say anything and she doesn\u2019t either. As I pull up to the curb, I make no motion to get out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her tersely. \u201cI can\u2019t do this right now. I\u2019m tired. Good night, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m once again trying to delay the inevitable.</p><p>She starts to get out, but pauses, looking into my face. With a cool hand, she traces my cheekbone, and I fight the urge to close my eyes and lean into her hand. But I don\u2019t. I remain rigidly in my own seat.</p><p>\u201cDom, if you ever want to talk about it, I\u2019m here,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll never breathe a word to anyone, I\u2019ll just listen.\u201d</p><p>Her face is so sincere, so genuine... it\u2019s all I can do to remember to breathe. She doesn\u2019t ask for anything, she\u2019s just concerned about me.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupts. \u201cBut you\u2019ll pass. Why don\u2019t you come in, Dom? We don\u2019t have to talk. We can just watch a movie or something. I don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother telling her that I\u2019m always alone, even when I\u2019m surrounded by people. Instead, I just shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. I think I\u2019ll just go. Happy birthday, Jacey. I\u2019m glad you got to see your brother.\u201d</p><p>Jacey hesitates, then gets out, closing the car door. She stands there, gorgeous and quiet in the night. As I stare at her, I know what I have to do. I swallow hard. If I don\u2019t do it now, it will be too late and I\u2019ll have crushed her.</p><p>For once in my fucking life, I\u2019m going to do the right thing.</p><p>The decent thing.</p><p>\u201cJacey, I can never give you what you want. You want someone who can open up and discuss feelings, someone who will be an active participant in your life. That\u2019s not me and it never will be. We need to pull the plug on this thing now, because once again, you\u2019re falling for the wrong guy.\u201d</p><p>Jacey sucks in her breath and she\u2019s frozen for a second. But then she leans down, staring in at me, and there\u2019s something pained in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Dominic? Really? What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, long and hard, before I answer.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d I admit.</p><p>And then I drive away.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Jacey</p><p>How is it that I\u2019ve fucked up so badly once again?</p><p>I\u2019ve opened myself up to someone who is emotionally unavailable and has more baggage than he can even keep track of. He\u2019s detached. Distant. Unable to give me what I need, and, what\u2019s worse, has never tried to hide it. He told me all along.</p><p>But still, I fell for him.</p><p>Still my heart breaks because he\u2019s gone from me. Because I honestly thought that he was different. That deep down, he was a good guy and I could save him. Once again, I thought I could save someone who is apparently unsaveable.</p><p>I\u2019ve done this to myself.</p><p>I grab a pair of boxing gloves and start swinging at a bag. I catch the attention of Jake and Tig and they come over to observe. Tig watches while Jake holds the bag.</p><p>My foot is still sore, so I can\u2019t kick, but I take can out my aggression in punches\u2014so that\u2019s what I do, until I\u2019m dripping with sweat and I\u2019ve taken all of my frustration out on the bag. When I\u2019m finally spent, Jake stares at me.</p><p>\u201cAnything wrong, Jacey?\u201d He\u2019s hesitant, and I have to smile.</p><p>\u201cThat apparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d he answers. \u201cI thought you were going to punch the bag off its hook. I\u2019m just glad it was the bag and not me this time.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle, but I don\u2019t answer as I pull off my gloves. There isn\u2019t a women\u2019s locker room, so I have to wait to shower and change until I get home. After I grab my bag, I pass Dom and Joe in the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou heading out to California this weekend?\u201d Joe asks Dom. Dom nods, and my heart breaks again because it\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019re truly separate now.</p><p>Separate lives. Separate people. We\u2019re nothing to each other.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dominic answers. \u201cAnd I know, don\u2019t be late on Monday or don\u2019t bother coming back.\u201d</p><p>Joe chuckles, and part of me is happy that he is finally warming up to Dominic. But the other part of me is crushed because Dom barely looks at me. It\u2019s been two days since my birthday, two days since Dominic broke things off. He\u2019s been virtually silent ever since.</p><p>No texts, no calls, and almost no communication at work.</p><p>He\u2019s like a wall... vast and silent.</p><p>Joe continues into his office, but Dom doesn\u2019t turn around to talk to me.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Surprising myself, I decide I have to let it go. One thing I\u2019ve definitely learned in life is that you can\u2019t make someone love you. Or like you. Or want to be with you. It\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve learned hard and well, but it doesn\u2019t take the sting out of the rejection.</p><p>When Dominic almost reaches his car, I call out to him.</p><p>He turns around. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but he looks directly at me, a question in his famous green eyes.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I tell him stoutly. Because even though I know I have to let it go, it still fucking hurts.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitches, but he doesn\u2019t answer. He just drops into his Porsche and drives away, leaving me standing here alone.</p><p>It seems fitting. It pisses me off even more that I can\u2019t be mad. Dominic told me from the beginning not to get drawn in, not to get attached.</p><p>I\u2019ll crush you without meaning to, he\u2019d said. How he can\u2019t see that Sin wrote that song about him, I\u2019ll never know. He must be fucking clueless.</p><p>I sigh and head home to get ready for Saffron.</p><p>As I drive past a tiny little bar on the way, I glance at it, briefly tempted to stop. Not to get a drink, but to soak in the attention that I know I would receive there.</p><p>Seeing the eyes on me, the guys who would inevitably hit on me... it never fails to bolster my self-confidence and make me feel better.</p><p>But not this time. My hands grip the steering wheel and I force myself to drive past.</p><p>I\u2019m going to break old patterns. I don\u2019t need another guy to make me forget Dominic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t.</p><p>My heart hurts, but I\u2019ve got to do the only thing I can, the healthy thing.

I can stand alone.</p><p>Before I know it, all of this will be a distant memory...</p> <p>Kaylie touches her lipstick up in my mirror and turns to me with her ass cheeks hanging out of her little Saffron shorts. Part of me dies inside, because I know that Gabe and Brand and even Dominic are right. This is no way to make a living. I have to admit that part of the reason I\u2019ve worked at Saffron is to bolster my confidence.</p><p>It\u2019s a fa\u00e7ade. These guys lust after me, and it makes me feel like they really want me. They don\u2019t. They want to fuck me, and there\u2019s the difference.</p><p>I need to find my self-respect again, which means getting another job ASAP.</p><p>Kaylie scrunches up her nose. \u201cSo, let me get this straight. You\u2019ve been hanging out with Dominic Kinkaide for weeks now. And you haven\u2019t fucked him\u2014although he took you to his Hollywood Hills house for an entire weekend? And now it\u2019s all over and you aren\u2019t seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>I nod silently, wishing I hadn\u2019t chosen to vent to her. I love Kaylie, but she\u2019s got a one-track mind, and unfortunately it\u2019s always on sex.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d she decides, handing me the red lipstick. \u201cYou need a touch-up before we go. And hurry up. We\u2019re going to be late. Again.\u201d</p><p>I put the lipstick on as Kaylie stares at me. \u201cIf he\u2019s anything like his brother in the sack, then you missed out. Big time,\u201d she adds, for good measure. \u201cSeriously. In fact, I think I\u2019m going to get a tattoo on my ass. I fucked Sin Kinkaide. Ohhh. Or maybe I\u2019ve Sinned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassy,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI get the point. I\u2019m sorry for bringing it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d Kaylie turns to me, grinning widely, and all of a sudden I just really miss Maddy. Kaylie\u2019s fine, but she\u2019s a superficial friend, someone to have fun with. Maddy\u2019s levelheaded and smart and she knows me better than anyone. I make a mental note to call her tonight on one of my breaks.</p><p>Kaylie and I pile into my new car and we drive to the Saffron office. Our boss, Big Jim, calls to us from behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cHey girls! Your jobs for tonight have changed. Well, not yours, Kaylie. You\u2019re still serving at the Gable bachelor party. But Jacey, your presence has been requested at Sinclair Kinkaide\u2019s house yet again\u2014and he\u2019s paying me twice your normal wage to make sure you\u2019re there. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but it better not be anything illegal.\u201d</p> <p>Big Jim stares at me, but then grins. I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll have to send someone else. Send Kaylie.\u201d</p><p>Big Jim scowls now, his big jowls twisting as he shakes his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s gotta be you. And if you value this job, you need to go. My word is my bond and I already promised that you\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you call him back and say that I\u2019m sick?\u201d I ask as panicky feelings well up in my lungs. \u201cI can\u2019t go there, Big Jim. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d he assures me. \u201cAnd you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Kaylie demands. \u201cDid Sin say anything about me?\u201d</p><p>Big Jim shakes his head. \u201cNot a thing, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I feel sick to my stomach as I stare at Kaylie. \u201cYou might want to hold off on that tattoo.\u201d</p><p>She scowls at me, but I sit down in the chair by the cash register. I don\u2019t think I can do this. I don\u2019t want to face Dominic. Not after he dismissed me the way he did. And then I all but told him that I\u2019d fallen for him. Why the fuck did I do that? Don\u2019t I have one little speck of self-respect left? God.</p> <p>Maybe not, but there\u2019s only one way to fix that: find it. And find it fast.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say aloud to no one in particular. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Big Jim doesn\u2019t even glance at me, because to him it\u2019d already been settled. I slip outside without another word and head my little car in the direction of Sin\u2019s mansion. The closer I get, the heavier my heart feels, but I ignore it.</p><p>I can do this. I can walk in there with my head up and be totally unaffected by Dominic.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>I\u2019m practically chanting that as I walk around the house and go in through the back door, making my way to the kitchen. I already have this routine down pat; I\u2019ve done it several times already. When I step inside the kitchen though, Henrietta, the shift leader, looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to find Mr. Kinkaide the second you get here,\u201d she says to me curiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me as if I can offer her an explanation. I shrug. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t believe me, but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not my problem. I make my way out into the main part of the house, intent on finding Sin but avoiding Dominic.</p><p>It proves to be easy. Dominic is nowhere to be seen, and Sin is lounging in his main living room, in jeans and no shirt. For a minute I smile, remembering how Dominic has complained several times about Sin always walking around half-naked, but the smile dies at the thought of Dominic.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d I ask Sin quietly. He\u2019s looking through a pile of papers and seems deep in thought. He looks up.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. Jacey, right?\u201d</p><p>He knows my name. And he knows that\u2019s exactly who I am.</p><p>Sin Kinkaide knows who I am. It\u2019s mind-boggling. He grins, and I can see Dominic in that grin. It\u2019s cocky, charming, and sexy all at once. \u201cI requested for you to work my party tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him slowly. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my brother\u2019s been happier these last few weeks than he\u2019s been in a very long time,\u201d Sin tells me seriously. He twists a bottle of beer around in his hand as he speaks, and each time he moves, a silver ring with a ram\u2019s head on it clicks against the glass. I must look doubtful because he laughs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he assures me. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult to tell when my brother is happy or when he\u2019s not, but trust me. He\u2019s been happier, which makes my life happier, since he\u2019s been staying here. But he came home in a bitch-ass mood last night, and when I asked why, he almost bit my head off. Logically, I know that can only mean one thing. He fucked things up with you.\u201d</p><p>I start to protest, but Sin holds up a hand.</p><p>\u201cDid he or did he not?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. There wasn\u2019t anything to fuck up. We were just hanging out to have fun. We were never going to be anything serious, so there wasn\u2019t any need to bring me here. Trust me, if Dom was in a bad mood, it wasn\u2019t because of me. It was his idea that we stop hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he told you that yesterday?\u201d Sin raises an eyebrow.</p><p>I see where he\u2019s going with this. \u201cYes, but that was just a coincidence. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Sin shakes his head. \u201cTrust me. I know my brother. But this brings me to my point of having you here. I\u2019d like for you to serve him tonight exclusively. Follow him everywhere. If he goes to his room, you go. Don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>This annoys me, and I glare at Sin. \u201cWhat the hell do you think I am? I\u2019m not a personal servant or a sex slave.\u201d</p><p>Sin stares at me. \u201cI know you\u2019re not. But I think you care about my brother. You must, or you wouldn\u2019t have put up with his shit for this long. Look, my brother has been buried under a rock for way too long. Years. But he came out from under that rock for you. I\u2019d like to see him stay that way. The key to that is you. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to be doing a lot of \u2018trusting you,\u2019 \u201d I point out. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Sin pacifies me. \u201cEveryone knows me.\u201d</p><p>I have to roll my eyes. I can almost hear Dom in his arrogant tone. \u201cEveryone knows of you. They don\u2019t actually know you,\u201d I remind him. \u201cIncluding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, valid point,\u201d he concedes, his face a blank slate but for a smile. \u201cTell me what I can do so you\u2019ll trust me. Sing you a song?\u201d</p><p>I start to laugh, until something occurs to me. \u201cTell me about Emma. And why Dominic blames Cris.\u201d</p><p>Sin sobers up quickly, staring at me. \u201cHmm. Straight for the jugular. So Dominic won\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. All I know is that she was his girlfriend and he blames Cris for something really bad. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Sin sighs and takes a swig of his beer as he settles back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he blames Cris,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe all have our suspicions, but no one knows for sure. Dom won\u2019t talk about it and Cris won\u2019t say. But I can tell you that it fucked him up. Big time. Whatever else happened, Emma died and Dominic blames himself. But that\u2019s all I can tell you. It\u2019s his story and he should be the one telling it. Maybe he\u2019ll get the chance tonight... because you\u2019re going to be his shadow. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s home yet, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll be back soon. He\u2019s going to stay at the party for a while before he flies out to LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to be his shadow?\u201d I ask as cold fingers of dread curl around my stomach. Sin smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou might think you don\u2019t want to, but I think you really do. And from what I\u2019ve seen of you, you don\u2019t do anything that you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, not wanting to say anything, because deep down I know he\u2019s right... on both counts.</p><p>I turn to leave, but hesitate. \u201cDo you really think he\u2019s been happier since he met me?\u201d I ask slowly. Sin nods.</p><p>\u201cI know he has.\u201d</p><p>I walk out quietly, lost in thought. Dominic blames himself for Emma\u2019s death? That\u2019s quite a bit different than just grieving a dead girlfriend. A million different scenarios run through my mind, but I\u2019ll never know the truth unless he tells me.</p><p>I don\u2019t see that happening.</p><p>With a sigh, I turn into the main hall and grab a tray of champagne. Until I see Dominic, I might as well hand out drinks.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take too long. Twenty minutes later, I feel him walk into the room. I feel his stare, buried between my shoulder blades. Sure enough, when I turn around, Dom\u2019s green eyes meet mine, and I can see a strange fire in them.</p><p>I set my tray down and walk straight to him. He doesn\u2019t move, he just leans against the doorframe and waits.</p><p>\u201cJacey,\u201d he greets me, nodding. \u201cTo what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d</p><p>So polite, so civil, so distant.</p><p>My throat tightens up. Maybe Sin was wrong.</p><p>\u201cSin brought me here,\u201d I explain, fighting the urge to run my fingers through his hair, to push back his rakish bangs. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to exclusively serve you tonight.\u201d</p><p>This interests Dominic. I can see that strange light in his eyes glow even more, working into a flame now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks, his eyes on my lips. Self-consciously, I lick them, and he grins wolfishly. \u201cSo you have to only be with me tonight? Exclusively?\u201d He puts emphasis on that last word, and I swallow.</p><p>\u201cYes. My boss made me come, and I need this job for now. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here because your boss made you,\u201d Dom says slowly. \u201cIt has nothing to do with wanting to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does what I want matter?\u201d I demand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to care what I wanted the other night when you ended things. But I\u2019m here now... getting paid to personally serve you drinks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd cater to me,\u201d Dominic adds. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do with all the other men... you shove your tits in their faces and laugh at their jokes. I\u2019ll want the same treatment. I want to get my money\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>His face is dark now, stormy. Dangerous. For a minute, I consider walking out and forgetting about all of this. But I can\u2019t. Until I get a new job, I need this one to pay my rent, which happens to be due next week. But silently, I vow to search the classifieds for a new job as soon as I get home tonight.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer sharply. \u201cI suppose if you want me to hang on your arm, I can do that. And if you really want my tits in your face, I guess I can do that, too.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t read Dominic\u2019s face. I can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s disappointed that I gave in so easily, or if he\u2019s looking forward to the night. Either way, I\u2019m prepared. He\u2019s amusing himself. Nothing more, nothing less. I\u2019ll go through the motions tonight and quit this fucking job as soon as I can.</p><p>Dominic holds out his arm.</p> <p>I stare at him hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Princess,\u201d he urges. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. You should at least know that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot where anyone can see, anyway,\u201d I mutter as I lightly place my fingers on his arm. Dominic raises an eyebrow, but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>He leads me out of the hall, out of the house, and down the stone path to the pool. Once we step out onto the patio, he sits on a bench and motions for me to sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you fall for me?\u201d he asks bluntly, staring at me in the dark.</p><p>I feel like he might as well have bitch-slapped me with such a blunt question. I\u2019m not used to it from him. He usually takes the avoidance tactic. I take a second, take a breath, then shake my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Lie. I fell fucking hard.</p><p>Dominic raises an eyebrow. \u201cNo? Are you lying, princess?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, my breath caught in my throat, and I decide that I don\u2019t want to lie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say simply.</p><p>Dominic startles at my honesty, staring at me hard. I\u2019m quick to continue.</p><p>\u201cI fell for you because I thought there was more to you. I thought that deep inside, there\u2019s something ugly and broken, but that I could fix it. I thought you felt more for me than you did. But I was wrong. I know what you and I are. We\u2019re nothing. Once again, I\u2019ve proven to myself that I can\u2019t trust my own judgment. Once tonight is over, I would appreciate it if you told Sin not to request my presence here again.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I managed to say the words, not with the way he\u2019s looking at me. But I do. I say them and they float between us, hard and ugly.</p><p>Dominic nods slowly, and once again I can\u2019t read his face.</p> <p>\u201cJacey, you try and see the good in everyone. That\u2019s your mistake. You think that if you look hard enough, you\u2019ll find it, that everyone has something in them that deserves you. But that\u2019s so fucking wrong. Very few people deserve you. And that includes me.\u201d</p><p>My heart clenches at his words, at the way he\u2019s trying to validate me, to compliment even my very worst trait. My heart breaks, because I know that not only does Dominic not think he deserves me, he also thinks that he doesn\u2019t deserve anyone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so fucked up,\u201d I manage to whisper. Dominic nods solemnly.</p><p>\u201cMe more than you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Dominic stares at me with those fucking dark eyes, and finally he speaks again.</p><p>\u201cAfter tonight, I don\u2019t want you to come around me, Jacey. I don\u2019t want to hurt you any more than I have already. Tonight is all we have left.\u201d</p><p>I nod curtly, his meaning stark.</p><p>He smiles a glittering, hard smile.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll have to make it count. Know this right now. You don\u2019t have to do anything that you don\u2019t want to. You know me. If you say no, it\u2019s over. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I nod. But Dominic shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYou understand. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cIf you say no, you can walk out at any time and I promise you that Sin won\u2019t contact Saffron and you won\u2019t suffer any consequences with your boss. Tonight will be... a good-bye. A good-bye worthy of you and me. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a fucking masochist, because I see the gleam in Dom\u2019s eyes... the dark, dark gleam that can only mean dark, dark things... and I welcome it. I want it. I want him... even if it\u2019s only for tonight.</p><p>I love him. The knowledge is so, so painful.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Dominic smiles. \u201cGood. You wanted to know about me the other night. You wanted me to share with you, to explain why I am the way I am. You wanted to know if Amy Ashby was right, if I\u2019m perverted. I want to answer that for you now. I could tell you in words all day long, but it wouldn\u2019t even make sense to you until you see exactly who I am. Until you see exactly the kind of things I like. So tonight, I want you to see it. Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in confusion. \u201cSee it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother has a wild life,\u201d Dom explains. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that at every party, there is always a private, secret party going on in the basement. A party that most aren\u2019t invited to. I\u2019m inviting you tonight. Do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds, both in apprehension and in excitement. I have noticed the secret party in the basement. Of course I have. It was always part of the confidentiality agreement that I had to sign in order to work at Sin\u2019s house.</p><p>Never go into the basement.</p><p>But that changes tonight. And with that, I just might get a glimpse of who Dominic really is.</p><p>Answers.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Dominic prompts, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I start to say. But at his look, I amend that. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He holds out his arm and I take it. As I touch him, he looks down at me and for a moment, my heart flutters. Everything about him pulls me in. His smell, his touch, his stare. His excruciatingly sexy personality. I must definitely be a masochist, because I know beyond any shadow of a doubt that tonight will annihilate me.</p><p>Yet I follow him willingly into the house.</p><p>Into hell.</p><p>Or Eden.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Jacey</p><p>Dominic leads me down a back hallway into the exquisitely lavish basement of the house, then through two more hallways until we stop in front of a set of heavy wooden doors. He turns and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYou want to do this. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure. I can hear music thumping on the other side, but I can also hear moaning. Sex sounds. Thumping. Lashing? Moaning. More Moaning. Screaming. Shrieking. Moaning.</p><p>I look at Dominic and my heart is in my throat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, then opens the doors.</p><p>The room before me is a myriad of panting and fucking bodies.</p><p>The first thing I focus on are the women in cages.</p><p>On all four corners in a huge dimly light room, there are round cages with bars. There\u2019s a woman in each cage, each wearing a collar. Their collars are attached to the chains in the cages. They\u2019re naked but for strange leather straps that crisscross around their breasts, then crisscross again above and below their hips. I\u2019m confused for a second, until a man opens the cage door of the girl closest to me and steps inside.</p><p>It\u2019s only then that I see that the leather straps are attached to the roof of the cage. The girl can suspend herself in the air by pulling on the straps. And when she does, they tighten around her breasts and her crotch, so much so that her flesh turns white.</p><p>But she seems to like it. She moans as the man dips his head and sucks on her nipples, suckling at the taut flesh. My gaze flies to Dominic, and he\u2019s staring at me, his expression intense.</p><p>\u201cThey like it,\u201d he assures me. \u201cTrust me, they\u2019re here on their own free will. They like to be tied up, whipped, sucked. They enjoy the pain and I enjoy watching it.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds and warmth spreads to my crotch, moistening my panties. I can\u2019t believe it, but watching it turns me on. All of it. The smells, the sounds, the idea that all of this shit should be happening in the privacy of bedrooms, but instead it\u2019s out here in the open for other consenting adults to watch. It makes my heart pound.</p><p>I stand in the doorway and scan the room.</p><p>It\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>The walls are covered in stone tile and there are round columns here and there, and fountains. It reminds me of ancient Greece. The ceiling is painted like the night sky, with swirling clouds and brilliant stars, and above us, in a circle on a ledge around the ceiling, statues of the Greek gods stare down at us in approval. Of course they approve. They were all fucked-up freaks too.</p><p>There are huge round silk ottomans everywhere, big enough for groups of people to sit on. And groups of people do sit on them, all of them involved in orgies.</p><p>This is an orgy of epic proportions.</p><p>The realization slams into me, and I feel my knees grow weak because I\u2019m even here.</p><p>Everywhere around me, people are fucking, sucking, licking, whipping... I can\u2019t wrap my mind around it. I didn\u2019t know that things like this even existed.</p><p>\u201cIs this even legal?\u201d I ask Dominic stupidly. He leads me into the room and closes the doors behind us, then shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Everyone is here on their own free will. And this is secret. It isn\u2019t spoken of beyond these walls.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I definitely won\u2019t be admitting that I was here. Jesus. My brother would fucking kill me.</p><p>I take a deep breath, inhaling the sex-laden air, and turn to Dominic. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, ever so slightly. \u201cWe\u2019re watching. It\u2019s what I like to do.\u201d</p><p>Pulling me to the side, we sit on a large sofa hidden in the shadows. He pulls me down onto his lap and turns his attention to the room in front of us.</p><p>\u201cDo you come here a lot?\u201d I ask him suddenly. For some reason, even though I\u2019m frustrated with him, and pissed at him, it makes me sad to think that he was spending his time in this room when he and I were still together. He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cOnly sometimes,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhy? Does that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your life,\u201d I tell him flippantly.</p><p>He stares at me dubiously, but I look away, over to a couple that\u2019s fucking against the wall. They\u2019re both completely naked and glistening with sweat. The man has the woman pinned, slowly fucking her with a red and swollen cock as her legs wrap around his waist. His cock is red from her slapping it every time he pulls out. But he loves it. He moans in ecstasy every time she strikes him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you like this?\u201d I ask softly, unable to take my eyes away. Dom smiles, a sardonic smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Probably because I can linger in the shadows. I don\u2019t have to interact with anyone, I can just watch. And if I do interact, it\u2019s not on a deep level. It\u2019s superficial, a mutual pleasuring of two people. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s empty, then,\u201d I say, lifting my eyes finally and looking at him. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to see it that way.\u201d</p> <p>I look at the people around me, at the whipping and the lashing and the red marks.</p><p>\u201cDo you like the pain, too?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs again. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Something twinges inside of me, a realization of sorts.</p><p>\u201cBecause you feel like you deserve it,\u201d I observe. It\u2019s not a question now. I know it in my heart and he doesn\u2019t deny it.</p> <p>\u201cAre there famous people here?\u201d I ask quietly, changing the subject. Dom smiles.</p><p>\u201cAlways. Sin\u2019s parties are famous. People fly in from all over.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t a \u201cparty.\u201d This is an orgy.</p><p>Dom falls silent now, watching a girl in a cage. A second man has joined the first, and while the first man sucks hard on her breasts, the second lashes her with a velvet whip from behind. She moans, \u201cFuck me, fuck me, please.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got lash marks on her back from those velvet tassels, and still she moans. Still she enjoys it. Still she arches her back and comes and comes and comes. As she comes, a second woman steps into the cage and sucks on her other breast. The woman screams even more... because she loves it.</p><p>I feel wetness gush into my panties and I feel like a freak.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I like watching this?\u201d I wonder aloud to Dominic. \u201cI\u2019ve never watched anything like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why you like it,\u201d he whispers to me, his lips close to my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s naughty, it\u2019s forbidden. Forbidden things are exciting, no matter who you are.\u201d</p><p>He wraps his hand around my thigh, squeezing at the soft flesh there. Kneading, pulling, squeezing... causing just the slightest bit amount of pain. And I want more. All of a sudden, I want more. I want him to make me hurt... in a good way.</p><p>He looks at me. \u201cThis room turns you on. Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that it does.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admit limply.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet?\u201d Dominic asks, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cCan I check?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised he asked. But suddenly, I want nothing more.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer.</p><p>His fingers find me, cool and slender. And then they\u2019re inside of me, in and out, slow then fast. My breathing catches and I turn into him, my face pressed against his chest as I grasp at him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rasps, turning my shoulders around. \u201cKeep watching.\u201d</p><p>So I do.</p><p>I watch the couples having sex, the couples whipping each other, the lash marks, the bruises, the scratches. I watch fingers slipping into bodies, glistening skin, thick penises, slick folds. I watch all of it.</p><p>And then I watch Kira enter the room. Dressed in a strapless gown, she walks in like she owns the room, looking around, searching every corner. I know who she\u2019s looking for.</p><p>Her gaze finds him, and in an instant she starts in Dominic\u2019s direction, but then she sees me on his lap. Her eyes narrow and she freezes in her tracks.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s fingers have never stopped moving within me, even with Kira watching.</p><p>I am both embarrassed and pleased by that.</p><p>Dominic watches Kira retreat to a place by the wall, where she stands alone for a few minutes until Duncan comes in. Dominic\u2019s younger brother assesses the room, assesses the situation, his gaze sweeping over me and Dominic, then Kira. And then he heads toward Kira, pulling her toward a padded ottoman to her left.</p><p>At first she shakes her head, but then she follows him, sitting with him on the silk. She watches Dominic for a reaction, and it\u2019s very apparent that she\u2019s waiting for him to protest that she\u2019s with his brother.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, Dominic strokes me, his breath coming harshly. His fingers feel good, incredibly good, but it\u2019s even more amazing because of where I am... surrounded by sex of every nature.</p><p>A naked woman with pale skin and red hair that tumbles to her waist stops in front of us, blocking my view of Kira.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to suck you?\u201d she asks Dominic. He looks down at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want her to?\u201d</p><p>For a minute, I consider it. And then I\u2019m amazed that I consider it at all. The idea of anyone touching Dominic in that way, anyone other than me, shreds me, and I shake my head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He immediately shakes his head at the girl and, unbothered, she continues on to the next couple. I watch in amazement.</p><p>\u201cThis place...\u201d I murmur, my voice trailing off. I look around yet again. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>Dominic chuckles, low and dark. \u201cSin wanted it to be like ancient orgies were rumored to be. In the next room, there\u2019s a Roman bath. Do you want to go in there?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Kira and Duncan. Duncan is kissing her neck, but Kira\u2019s eyes are frozen on Dominic and me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Kira would like that,\u201d I point out, trying to ignore the fact that Dom\u2019s fingers are still inside of me. \u201cShe\u2019s watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes watching me,\u201d Dominic says easily. \u201cShe\u2019s been a friend for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, she\u2019s a good friend of your brother\u2019s, too,\u201d I answer wryly. Dominic ducks his head, nipping at my neck, and I arch against him against my will.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I ask him suddenly. \u201cWhy did you bring me? To further prove your point that I\u2019m like everyone else?\u201d</p><p>Dominic stops moving and looks up at me, his gaze dangerous and dark.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not like everyone else,\u201d he answers. \u201cI know that you\u2019re not. But I needed you to see what I am. Before we go our separate ways and I never see you again, I needed you to see that I\u2019m fucked up. That way, you won\u2019t always wonder if we did the right thing by breaking things off. You can rest easily and know that we did. Because you don\u2019t deserve someone like me.\u201d</p><p>His frankness surprises me, and I stare at him. He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s true. And you need to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you fucked up?\u201d I ask, keeping an eye on Kira. She watches me, her eyes narrowed as her legs wrap around Duncan\u2019s naked hips.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it apparent?\u201d Dominic asks, his eyes gleaming. \u201cI can\u2019t get off on normal things. It takes the dark things, the taboo things. If I can get off at all. I\u2019m fucked up, Jacey. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why are you fucked up?\u201d I ask bluntly. \u201cJust tell me that much. The Dominic that I know is funny and witty and smart. And he is good, deep down where he tries to hide it. The Dominic that I know isn\u2019t fucked up. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stares at me, his face a perfect mask. \u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t know the real Dominic. You\u2019ve sensed him all along. I\u2019ve seen it in your eyes. I\u2019m showing him to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d I whisper, and the words slip through my lips in a hiss. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you. This is who you want to be for some reason. You don\u2019t think that you deserve real things\u2014good things. So you let yourself believe that this is your life. Your life could be more, if you\u2019d just let it be, Dominic. I know it.\u201d</p><p>I pull away from him. \u201cLook around you. This is sad. Yes, it\u2019s a turn-on to watch... but only because it\u2019s so naughty and dark. These people must have such sad lives\u2014especially those women in the cages. They don\u2019t have anything healthy or real, so they come here to get debased. Look at Kira! She\u2019s in love with you, yet she\u2019s having sex with your brother right now. What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Dominic grips my arm, hard. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with these people,\u201d he tells me in a low voice. \u201cThis is just what they like. Most of them are like me. They\u2019re jaded and they\u2019ve seen everything, so the normal doesn\u2019t do it for them anymore. And Kira... she\u2019s not in love with me. She likes this. It\u2019s who she is. She\u2019s fucked up too, like me.\u201d</p><p>I look at her again, just in time to see a tear slip down her cheek before she closes her eyes, and I startle.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crying,\u201d I snap at Dominic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like she likes it anymore.\u201d</p><p>The words are no sooner out of my mouth than Kira jumps up and runs from the room, toward what looks to be a bathroom. Before I can even think about it, I pull away from Dominic and follow her.</p><p>I find her in a heap on a bench in an ornate bathroom. Tears are streaming down her face and her arms are wrapped around her sides. I approach her carefully.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. She just continues to cry, staring at the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I offer quietly.</p><p>She looks up at me. \u201cAre you?\u201d Her words aren\u2019t sharp or ugly, just a blunt question. I nod.</p><p>\u201cI can see that you\u2019re upset. And if I\u2019m at fault, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Kira looks away, wiping at her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not your fault. I\u2019m pissed because I shouldn\u2019t have been with Duncan.\u201d She looks away, her eyes watery. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted him, you know... Dominic. Always. Even before Emma died. And after she died, I stuck by him. I was everything that he needed, all of these years, but it\u2019s never mattered. I\u2019ve never been enough. Don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking that you are, because you won\u2019t be. What he needs is dead. And she\u2019s never coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKira, stop,\u201d Dominic says coldly, and I spin around to find him at the door. He takes two steps toward us and stops again. His face is deadly calm, his voice like ice. \u201cYou need to stop.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cAre you still in love with Emma? Is that what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Because I can\u2019t compete with a dead woman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d he says, turning to me; but Kira laughs, a cold and empty sound.</p><p>\u201cIt is that simple. He\u2019s in love with her. He must be. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him or what he needs. I don\u2019t know if he knows. Don\u2019t waste your time with him. Trust me. I\u2019ve wasted years. He\u2019ll suck you down and you\u2019ll drown with him.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, then him, and my eyes well up with tears at the thought that she might be right. I hadn\u2019t even realized that I wanted to save him, but I do. I want to save him from this... from all of this.</p><p>But maybe Dominic is unsaveable simply because he doesn\u2019t want to be saved. Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t know what actually would save him. Either way, it seems hopeless.</p><p>Dominic looks at Kira and something softens in his gaze. \u201cKira, I\u2019m sorry. I never knew that you wanted more from me. You never said and I never saw it. You\u2019ve been such a good friend to me for so long. And you were a good friend to... her too. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d Kira looks up at him, another tear slipping down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dominic answers firmly. \u201cI promise you. I would never hurt you on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did, anyway,\u201d Kira says softly. \u201cJust like you hurt Emma.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cAnd just like he\u2019ll hurt you, too.\u201d</p><p>A tear escapes from my eye... and I\u2019m crying for everything. For the pain in her voice, for the hopelessness of the situation, for the hurt that I see in Dom\u2019s eyes. And for my heart.</p> <p>Because it\u2019s broken.</p><p>\u201cNow do you see?\u201d Kira asks quietly. She hands me a tissue, and I wipe my eyes. I do see. I see with my own eyes what could happen to me, what Dominic has been trying to tell me all along.</p><p>I fell in love with him and all he can do is obliterate me.</p><p>But only if I let him.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be here. In this moment, I realize something.</p> <p>The difference between normal people and me is that I don\u2019t make smart decisions for myself. I never know when to say when. I never know when to stop fighting for something, when to call it quits in order to protect my own heart.</p><p>That ends today.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I\u2019m going to make a smart decision, no matter how hard it might be.</p><p>I pat Kira on the back, then walk out the door.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Dominic</p> <p>Jacey slips out of the bathroom before I can stop her.</p><p>Quickly, I follow her, winding my way through the crowded room, only to find no sign of her in the long hallway. I almost run through the house, through the people, until I\u2019m standing in the middle of a mass of parked cars. I\u2019m just in time to see Jacey drive away.</p><p>I know I should let her go.</p><p>But I\u2019m too selfish for that.</p><p>I head for my car, and within a minute I\u2019m on the road behind her. My Porsche catches up to her. I motion for her to pull over, but she doesn\u2019t. I can see her crying; I can see the black streaks of mascara running down her cheeks. I motion again, but she refuses. She won\u2019t even look at me.</p><p>Gunning my engine, I pull in front of her, forcing her off the road. We\u2019re in a secluded section of Sin\u2019s neighborhood. She kills her engine and gets out of her car, glaring at me angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing, Dominic? I would have thought you\u2019d figure out that if I left, then it means I\u2019m done. But just in case, this is me saying no. No to you, no to your fucked-up life, no to doing anything else with you tonight. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Her words instill panic in me, and I don\u2019t know why. All I know is that the thought of her driving away from me, leaving me... I can\u2019t take it. Suddenly, the thought of it is crushing.</p> <p>I grab her arm. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t accept that answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jacey demands. It\u2019s raining now. The rain hits her face and gleams under the streetlight. \u201cYou\u2019ve always said that no means no. You don\u2019t have many rules, but at least you have that one. You never wanted me, Dominic. You want a dead woman, and since you can\u2019t have her, you wanted a game. I played it. And now I\u2019m done with it.\u201d</p><p>She pulls away and stomps toward her car, but I grab her again, whirling her around and pulling her to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a game. I meant it when I said I\u2019m fucked up. But I mean it when I say that I don\u2019t want it to be over, too. Whatever it is... you and I... whatever we\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t want it to be over, Jacey. I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me in astonishment, her gorgeous face shocked.</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to hang around until you\u2019re finally ready for it to be over? Until you\u2019re done with me? You want me to end up like Kira... a sniveling wreck on the floor of a bathroom? No thanks, Dom. That\u2019s not me. Not anymore. I\u2019ve been a work in progress for quite a while, and I guess I can finally see that I deserve more than that. I\u2019m worth more than that.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, a thick lump in my throat, and I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s there.</p><p>\u201cKira isn\u2019t my fault,\u201d I tell her wildly. \u201cI\u2019ve told her from the beginning what I can offer her. And she wanted to be with me, anyway. She\u2019s always known. She knows me, Jacey. She\u2019s always known me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I know you, Dom,\u201d Jacey says in resignation. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Kira. This is about me and how I know that you\u2019ll hurt me. I know that even though I don\u2019t want to fall for you, I already have. I can\u2019t make it worse now. I just can\u2019t. I have to be strong enough to walk away. You\u2019ve told me all along that you aren\u2019t good for me. And guess what? You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Her words cause my stomach to tie into a knot. I know I\u2019m not good for her. I\u2019m not good for anyone, but for her, for Jacey, I want to be.</p><p>If I lose her, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do.</p><p>\u201cJacey,\u201d I continue, trying to make my voice steady, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can offer you. But I\u2019ll try to offer you something more than... this. I know you deserve more. Trust me, I know that. You\u2019re different from everyone I know. You\u2019re a breath of fresh air, and I just want to keep breathing you in. That\u2019s a big thing for me, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you can offer me?\u201d she asks slowly, her brown eyes pained as she stares at me. \u201cHow about... yourself? Offer me yourself and I\u2019ll stay. But I want all of you. I want a real relationship. I want you and your problems and the truth and the ugliness. I need to know all of it. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Can I?</p><p>The idea of telling Jacey everything causes my heart to pound, and I see horrific images in my head. They blur together... Emma\u2019s cold hands, her pale face, the blood. The lights from the ambulance. The blood. Her headstone. My guilt. The blood.</p><p>I close my eyes for a minute, and behind my lids it\u2019s red from the blood that I can\u2019t stop seeing. I open them helplessly and I can\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t get my tongue to work.</p><p>All I can do is grab Jacey and pull her to me, forcing her lips to my own. Hers are soft and yielding, kissing me back for just a second until she pulls away. When she does, there are tears streaking down her face again, falling in black rivulets down her cheeks, mixing with the rain.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d she says softly when I don\u2019t say anything. \u201cAnswer me one question, Dominic. And be honest. For once, please, just be completely, brutally honest.\u201d She swallows hard, her hands clenched, and looks me in the eye.</p><p>\u201cAre you still in love with Emma? Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>She might as well have hit me with a Mack Truck. I stare at her, silent, trying to figure out how to explain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d I say helplessly. But she shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a yes or no answer, Dom. You taught me this game. Are you still in love with Emma? Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, waiting. From the look in her eyes I can tell she\u2019s wavering between wanting to know and being afraid to know.</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I draw in a shaky breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her breath exhales in a feathery hiss and she shoves her hair out of her eyes with shaking fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe word yes has never hurt so much.\u201d Her voice is a whisper, so soft I can barely hear it. I reach for her, but she shrugs away, out of my reach.</p><p>She walks away, her shoulders slumped as she gets into her car and drives off.</p><p>I stand in the rain for what seems like forever, watching as her taillights disappear into the rain, and the night swallows up her car.</p><p>I stand there and let the rain run into my eyes until I can no longer see.</p><p>Until I can no longer see that she left me.</p><p>When I get into my car, I\u2019m empty inside, more empty and numb than I\u2019ve been in years. Emptier than I\u2019ve ever felt before.</p><p>There\u2019s only one place I can think of to go, one place that will absorb my pain. As I pass through the gates of Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery, the darkness surrounds me, and I feel a sense of comfort... of familiarity.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been here in years, but I find Emma\u2019s headstone easily. I go straight to it. It\u2019s easy to see. Her parents bought an enormous white marble stone encircled by the wings of an angel.</p><p>I kneel in front of it and trace her name under my fingers.</p><p>Emma Brandt.</p><p>She was no angel, but I loved her anyway. Her stone is cold to the touch... as cold as ice, as cold as my heart. I think of Sin\u2019s song.</p><p>Your heart is cold, cold as ice, but it\u2019s mine to take.</p><p>My heart is cold as ice. It will stay that way... because of Emma. I curl up in front of her name and lie with my cheek against the stone, staring into the night.</p><p>She wrecked me. She might as well have me.</p><p>I\u2019m not fit for anyone else.</p><p>In a while, it starts to rain again, a light, cold rain that soaks into my clothes and lingers on my skin. I don\u2019t even care, and honestly, I barely notice. It can\u2019t wash away who I am, what I\u2019ve done, or who I\u2019ve been. I fall asleep listening to the rain falling on Emma\u2019s stone.</p><p>When I open my eyes again, it\u2019s morning.</p><p>My clothes are wet and my throat is raspy since I breathed damp night air all night long. I sit up and look around, ignoring the odd looks from a cemetery worker. He goes back to weeding a flower bed, but still glances at me every now and then, probably wondering if I\u2019m crazy. I should save him the trouble and just tell him that I am.</p><p>I check my phone and find ten messages from Tally. Because, fuck, I missed my flight home. I should be on-set right now. I sigh and climb back into my car.</p><p>Everything seems like it\u2019s falling apart and I don\u2019t know how to stop it. This is the reason I\u2019m carefully detached, always. I\u2019m cool and calm and collected and I do the things I need to do. Always. I do it so that I don\u2019t fall apart.</p><p>But now there\u2019s Jacey.</p><p>And nothing is the same as it was before.</p><p>Jacey</p><p>I can\u2019t see through the tears streaming down my cheeks. They\u2019re hot and salty and drip onto my clothes.</p><p>I pick up the phone and dial Maddy\u2019s number, wanting to cry on her shoulder, to get her sage advice, but her voicemail picks up.</p><p>I wait, then try again a few minutes later, but still no answer.</p><p>I drive aimlessly until I realize where I\u2019m headed.</p><p>Brand.</p><p>I shake my head. Of course I\u2019m headed for Brand. It\u2019s what I always do when I need help or when I need comforting.</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t run to him anymore because he wants to comfort me in ways that I don\u2019t want. He wants to be with me. For real.</p><p>But I can\u2019t think of anything but Dominic. My heart hurts in such a way that it\u2019s almost blinding. It\u2019s all I can feel.</p><p>I pull up out front of his condo building and almost sprint for his door. When I reach it, I\u2019m out of breath, my makeup is smeared, and I\u2019m a sniveling wreck. He answers the door, shirtless and in workout shorts, and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Jacey?\u201d he asks quickly, pulling me inside. \u201cWhat happened? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>I nod, then shake my head, then drop onto his sofa and cry. He sits next to me awkwardly, patting my back with his giant hands.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he tells me helplessly. \u201cDid he hurt you? I\u2019ll fucking kick his teeth in if he did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head, then nod.</p><p>\u201cBut not how you think,\u201d I add quickly when Brand immediately starts to get up. With his military background, whenever he hears the word hurt, he automatically assumes it\u2019s in a physical way. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lay a finger on me.\u201d</p><p>Brand pauses, then stares down at me with confusion in his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen what did he do?\u201d he asks hesitantly.</p> <p>I drop my face into my hands, taking a moment to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cHe obliterated me,\u201d I say limply.</p><p>I curl onto my side, burying my face into the sofa cushions, and sob. I cry for all the things I can\u2019t say, the things I can\u2019t put into words. How Dominic is so haunted and damaged, and how I thought I could help him by showing him that people are good. That not everyone will hurt him. How I can\u2019t make him see that. How he makes me feel so alive and so sexy, yet at the same time, he must be so toxic for me... because right now I\u2019m empty and it\u2019s because of him.</p><p>I cry for all of this.</p><p>For all of these things that Brand doesn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Regardless, he stays next to me, patting me, soothing me. And he stays that way, just letting me cry until I can\u2019t cry anymore. He does what Brand always does... makes me feel better just by being here for me.</p><p>When I finally sit up, my eyes are hot and tired.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Brand asks calmly, his gaze level and strong. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me from the beginning not to get attached to him,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut I did anyway. He told me, Brand. It wasn\u2019t his fault. I guess, deep down, I thought I could fix him somehow. He\u2019s got issues. His girlfriend died and he still loves her and it\u2019s just a messed up ball of shit.\u201d</p><p>Brand stares at me sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cJace, you should know by now that you can\u2019t fix anyone. And if his girlfriend died... well, it\u2019s hard to say how that will affect him. Grief does strange things to people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it was six years ago,\u201d I tell him. \u201cDominic blames himself for some fucked-up reason. I don\u2019t know why, because he won\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Brand stares at me, and something flickers in his eyes. I\u2019ve seen him look that way before, haunted and sad. But then he hides it and shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIf he won\u2019t say, then maybe he should blame himself. Maybe it is his fault,\u201d he suggests softly.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I mutter. But then I see Brand\u2019s face, and his soft gaze, and I\u2019m reminded once again of the truth.</p><p>For him, I\u2019m no longer his little sister. His feelings for me have grown. I can\u2019t cry to him anymore about my issues with men. Not when he\u2019s in love with me.</p><p>God. Why did I come here? My heart squeezes in my chest and I reach for Brand\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cBrand, I\u2019m sorry to unload on you like this. It isn\u2019t fair now that I know how you feel...\u201d</p><p>My voice trails off like the dumbass I am. But Brand levels a stare at me.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I feel?\u201d he asks quietly. He\u2019s hesitant and nervous and appalled. If I tried to lie, it would be an insult to him.</p><p>\u201cI can see how you feel about me,\u201d I say limply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brand. I wish I felt the same way. You\u2019re the best person I know. It\u2019s why I always come to you, because you\u2019re so fucking amazing. I wish that I loved you like you want me to.\u201d</p><p>He flushes, the first time I\u2019ve ever seen him flush.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s my issue to deal with, not yours. It\u2019s not your fault that things changed for me and not for you. I\u2019ll get a handle on it. We won\u2019t change, Jace.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, at the goodness in his eyes and his heart. Brand is just so... good. Through and through. All along, I\u2019ve been chasing what\u2019s bad for me when maybe the very best thing for me has been in front of me all along.</p><p>On impulse, I lean over and kiss him. On the mouth.</p><p>He kisses me back. For one split second. Then he pulls away. I try to cling to him, but he pushes me away.</p><p>\u201cMake me feel better, Brand,\u201d I murmur pleadingly. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Brand glares at me as he takes a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jacey. Give me a second.\u201d</p><p>He pulls himself under control as I breathe harshly on the opposite end of the sofa. He finally turns and looks at me, and there is pain in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me,\u201d he says pointedly. \u201cNot really. I know that and you know that. You want Dominic Kinkaide, but you can\u2019t have him, so you want to use me to fill up the rejection that you feel. It\u2019s not fair, Jace. Not to me and not to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s breathing hard as he watches me, as he waits for my reaction. I close my eyes and he continues.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you always do, Jacey. You\u2019ve done it since you were a teenager. I\u2019ve stood by and watched it. Your dad was never home, he never cared, and you sought out that acceptance and approval for years from random guys. And when you\u2019re rejected, you run straight to the next guy. But you can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d</p><p>I choke on my tears because I know he\u2019s right. Because I know it and because that\u2019s exactly what my therapist told me. It\u2019s humiliating and true and horrible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d I mumble before I start crying again. \u201cI\u2019m a horrible, weak person. I\u2019m sorry if I led you on, Brand. I didn\u2019t mean to. I love you. You\u2019re like my brother, and I can\u2019t stand the thought of being without you.\u201d</p><p>Brand pulls me into his arms again, pulling me to his chest where I hide my face. I try to ignore the fact that my chest is pushed against him. I\u2019d never have worried about that before, and I hate it that I think of it now.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019ll never be without me. Not ever. Got it?\u201d Brand stares down at me, his eyes stern. I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd second, you\u2019re not horrible. You\u2019re beautiful and strong. And what\u2019s more, you\u2019ve pretty much got this shit figured out. You chose to walk away from Dominic because he can\u2019t be what you need. That\u2019s half the battle, Jacey. Now all you\u2019ve got to do is figure out how to stop running to a new guy to make you feel better. You don\u2019t need their acceptance, Jacey. You\u2019re strong enough to deal with things on your own.\u201d</p><p>I snivel into his shirt, breathing in his familiar cologne.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I am.\u201d I sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t feel strong. Ever since Jared... did what he did, I\u2019ve tried not to be weak. I\u2019ve tried to change, but I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s impossible. At least for me. Because against my better judgment, I fell for Dominic, Brand. I knew better, and I did it anyway. And he was the worst possible person for me to fall for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you walked away, Jacey. That\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble. \u201cAnd I came here and tried to force myself on you instead.\u201d</p><p>Brand\u2019s chest rumbles as he speaks with a voice that has always had the power to soothe me, even now when he\u2019s in love with me and I\u2019m crying to him about another guy.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what your grandma told me once?\u201d he asks, and I raise my head.</p><p>\u201cMy Gran?\u201d</p><p>Brand nods. \u201cYeah. It was one summer when I was staying at their lake house with you. She and I were down by the lake and I was upset over some girl... she\u2019d broken up with me and I thought that the world was ending. I told her that I was never going to love anyone else again, because falling in love was the dumbest thing in the world because it hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>I have to smile, because I can practically see teenage Brand saying that. Brand is and always was a one hundred percent in or out kind of guy. \u201cWhat did Gran say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandma was the wisest person I ever knew.\u201d He nods. \u201cShe looked at me and she said, \u2018Branden, the best things in life are worth the greatest risk. Falling in love is one of those things. Can it break our hearts? Yes. Most definitely. But more often than not, before we fall, we fly\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck did that mean?\u201d I ask in confusion. Brand nods again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I asked her. It didn\u2019t make any sense. But then she explained and it was perfect. She said we\u2019re like birds who leap from trees for the first time, terrified that they\u2019re going to crash and die on the ground below. The bird will almost always fly before it falls to its death. So too will we, and so we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to do the things that will bring us the greatest reward... like falling in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if we fall in love with the wrong people?\u201d I stammer. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve done that a hundred times, and each time I\u2019ve gotten hurt or hurt someone else. I\u2019m tired of doing that. How many times do we have to fall before we finally fly?\u201d</p><p>Brand shakes his head and grins wryly. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask your Gran that.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but Brand lifts my chin with his finger. \u201cIt might take several failures, but eventually it will happen. I don\u2019t know if it will happen with this guy or not, but you\u2019ll learn something from each failed attempt. So at least there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but stare at him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s comforting.\u201d</p><p>Brand chuckles. \u201cI know. And that\u2019s actually what I thought back when your Gran had this discussion with me in the first place. But just think on it, and after you do, you\u2019ll see that what she said is true. Before you fall, you\u2019ll fly, Jacey. Whether it\u2019s now or later, it\u2019ll happen. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope it happens before my wings get broken,\u201d I mutter, curling up on his chest. He chuckles softly and pats my back. I rest that way for a while longer before I sit up and straighten my clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brand,\u201d I tell him, looking him in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I always run to you. That you always have to pick me up and put me back together. I\u2019m sorry that it seems like I use you. I don\u2019t mean to. It\u2019s just that... deep down, I always feel like I\u2019m not good enough. And you always make me feel like I am. But I\u2019m going to stop depending on you to remind me of that. I\u2019m going to have to remind myself.\u201d</p><p>Brand bends forward and presses his lips to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cJust be you, Jacey. You are always good enough and then some. You really have come a long way since everything happened with Jared. Just keep it up. Tonight was just a tiny slipup. You came to me because I\u2019m familiar. That\u2019s all. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile as I get up and walk out. Pausing in the doorway, I look back.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You\u2019ll never know how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>Brand smiles, but I can see the sadness in it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he tells me easily in his Brand-like way. \u201cI know. I love you too, but I\u2019m going to need some space for a while, Jace. I\u2019m going to pull my head together and sort this out so that I love you the way I should... the way you love me. I\u2019m always here for you if you need me, but try not to need me for a while, OK?\u201d</p><p>I nod as my heart swells in my throat at the thought of how I have accidentally hurt one of the people I love most in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d I agree. \u201cI\u2019ll give you space. I\u2019m sorry, Brand.\u201d</p><p>I feel utterly sad as I walk out to my car, but I have to admit that I feel stronger. Being with Brand always makes me feel stronger. He knows me. He\u2019s always known me. There\u2019s comfort in familiarity like that. I hate that I can\u2019t give him what he needs, and in a weird way, that only makes me feel closer to Dom.</p><p>Because I know how he feels.</p><p>He can\u2019t give me what I need, either.</p> <p>Sighing, I blink my tears away and drive into the night.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Dominic</p><p>The world is unraveling.</p><p>After I arrive a few hours late and receive a firm chastising from the director, I go through the motions on-set, then fly back to Chicago, then go to work at the gym. The entire time, I can\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019m utterly numb. But when I walk into the gym, my breath catches, because for the first time in days I feel something.</p> <p>The desire to see Jacey.</p><p>And when I do see her, when I bump into her, she turns away like I\u2019m not there, like I don\u2019t even exist, exactly the way I\u2019ve treated her a hundred times in the past. And that moment is when I know why the world is falling to shit.</p><p>I need her.</p><p>I need her in my life. I knew I wanted her before, but to know that I need her is something entirely different, something terrifying, and the mere thought causes my heart to pound. The problem is, she doesn\u2019t need me. She\u2019s barely acknowledges my presence, barely glances at me.</p><p>She\u2019s definitely learned the art of being detached from its best practitioner.</p><p>Me.</p> <p>Being on the receiving end of such iciness is complete shit. For the first time in years, my heart fucking hurts... because I\u2019ve opened it up to that. It\u2019s an aching reminder of why I\u2019ve always shut myself off, away from people.</p><p>It isn\u2019t worth the pain.</p><p>I look around as I wipe off the counters in the kitchen, musing about how much has changed in a few weeks time. I just finished making twenty peanut butter sandwiches and wrapping them in foil. Why?</p><p>Because Joe insists on sending sandwiches home with the boys, because so many of them don\u2019t have enough to eat. Why does this signify change? Because I just found myself making a mental note to buy some pre-charged debit cards to send home with some of them for groceries. They shouldn\u2019t have to worry about eating.</p><p>But this isn\u2019t something I would even have thought of a month ago.</p><p>Just like how a month ago, my heart wouldn\u2019t be hurting. It would be safe and sound in its cage of ice. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s better.</p><p>Jacey sticks her head into the kitchen, interrupting my thoughts and talking to me for the first time since we arrived this morning.</p><p>\u201cHey, have you seen the ladder?\u201d she asks me quietly, hesitantly. She glances around the kitchen for it at the same time I do.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell her needlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>She starts to turn away, but I say her name and she looks back at me. She pauses in the doorway hesitatingly, her eyes saying what her lips won\u2019t.</p><p>I trusted you. But it was a mistake and I won\u2019t do it again.</p><p>It gives me pause and I close my mouth, swallowing all of the words that I\u2019d wanted to say.</p><p>I\u2019m conflicted. I might need her, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I can\u2019t give her what she needs.</p><p>She looks impatient, but all I can do is shake my head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>She turns and walks away, but not before I see the disappointment flash across her face.</p><p>To distract myself from thinking about her, or about the fact that I might\u2019ve let the only good person that I know in the world slip through my fingers, I pile the sandwiches in several neat stacks and fold napkins to go with them.</p><p>As I fold the last napkin, I hear a commotion coming from the gym. Curious, I head out to see what\u2019s going on, only to find a crowd of boys congregated around the ladder in the middle of the room. Some are kneeling, some are standing, but they\u2019re all in a circle around something.</p><p>My heart starts pounding as I see Jacey\u2019s pink tennis shoe poking through the legs.</p><p>Shoving through the crowd, I get there just as Joe does.</p><p>Jacey is motionless on the floor, and my heart stops as I stare down at her limp form. She\u2019s crumpled on the floor, utterly still, her face devoid of color, her eyes closed.</p><p>Holy fuck. I can\u2019t breathe. Because I can\u2019t lose her. Because she doesn\u2019t deserve this.</p><p>Because I can\u2019t do this again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Joe barks as he kneels down beside her. I\u2019m motionless, frozen, as I stare at her still body.</p><p>\u201cShe was changing the light bulb like you asked,\u201d Tig explains quickly. \u201cBut she tripped coming back down the ladder. I think she hit her head on the cement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Joe mutters as he feels her head. \u201cThat\u2019s a big lump. Someone call an ambulance.\u201d No one moves, so he barks, \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Jake bolts for the office and I\u2019m finally able to move.</p><p>I woodenly shove through the boys and drop to my knees beside her. I grab her hand and her fingers are so cold. The coldness sends panic rippling through me, and I shake her shoulder. Hard.</p><p>\u201cJacey, wake up,\u201d I tell her firmly, my heart firmly lodged in my throat. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t even twitch.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening again.</p><p>\u201cJacey,\u201d I shake her. \u201cJacey.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m panicked now, overwhelmed by emotion and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, so much so that I can\u2019t think straight. The last time I was in this situation it didn\u2019t end well.</p><p>It can\u2019t happen this time.</p><p>This time, all I can think is that I need to make Jacey wake up, no matter what it takes. I squeeze her hand and shake her shoulder, chanting her name.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, son,\u201d Joe advises. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t move her neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your son,\u201d I tell him without even looking up. \u201cShe needs to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joe agrees calmly. \u201cShe does. But don\u2019t move her.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him and shake her lightly one more time, and we\u2019re both surprised when she opens her eyes. A thrill like a jolt of electricity ripples through me.</p><p>\u201cDominic?\u201d she asks groggily, staring at me with blurry eyes, trying to focus. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>The relief that floods me is overwhelming. Thank Christ.</p><p>\u201cYou fell,\u201d I tell her softly. \u201cAnd you hit your head, but you\u2019re going to be fine. We\u2019re going to take you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ambulance is on the way,\u201d Jake calls out, jogging over from the office. \u201cDid you trip on your bad foot, Jace?\u201d he asks, kneeling next to me and staring down at Jacey.</p><p>She shakes her head in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Guilt eats at me because I didn\u2019t even know her foot was still bothering her. What I do know is she hurt her foot in the first place because of me. Protecting me.</p><p>I sit with her wordlessly, holding her hand until the paramedics arrive. They load her onto a gurney and roll her into the back of the ambulance, where I insist on riding with her. She\u2019s still disoriented, and I can\u2019t stand the thought of sending her away alone.</p><p>\u201cAre you a family member?\u201d one of them asks, staring at me curiously. I see the realization when it dawns. \u201cAren\u2019t you Dominic Kinkaide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019m her brother.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s eyes are fluttering closed again. At this point and the EMT looks at me, knowing that I\u2019m lying but not questioning my words. \u201cKeep your sister awake,\u201d she instructs. \u201cI\u2019m going to start an IV.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze Jacey\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cJace, you\u2019ve got to stay awake. Let\u2019s talk about the Ferris wheel at Navy Pier. Or about racing. Do you want to go back out to the track?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you,\u201d she tells me groggily, her eyelids fluttering. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you again, Dom. You\u2019re fucking toxic.\u201d</p><p>The EMT glances at me as she pushes a syringe into an IV line. \u201cShe\u2019s probably confused. It\u2019s common with head injuries.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s not confused. At all. She\u2019s never made more sense. But her words have never been more painful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jace,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this when you feel better. For now, you\u2019ve got to stay awake. You hit your head hard. You picked one of the only spots that isn\u2019t covered with a mat to fall on. You probably should\u2019ve planned that a little better.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t crack a smile. Her eyes stay closed, but I know she\u2019s awake because she\u2019s still squeezing my hand from time to time.</p><p>I talk with her the entire ride to the hospital, but when we arrive, they wheel her away on the squeaky gurney and make me stay in the waiting room.</p><p>The emergency room waiting area seems like a wasteland for lost souls. People are hunched over and tired, people are sick, people are curled up and sad. It sucks the energy out of me, and I hunker down in my seat, hoping no one recognizes me. I\u2019m definitely not in the mood for that.</p><p>I keep my nose buried in tattered magazines until I\u2019m called back an hour later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her brother?\u201d the doctor asks. I nod. What\u2019s another lie in the scheme of things?</p><p>\u201cYour sister has a mild concussion. She\u2019s actually really lucky, because from what I was told, she fell from rather high up. We can keep her overnight, but she\u2019d be more comfortable in her own bed. The thing is, she shouldn\u2019t be alone. Would you or someone else be able to stay with her? Wake her up every couple of hours to make sure that she\u2019s lucid? If she acts out of it, or if you can\u2019t wake her, call an ambulance. Do you feel comfortable with that?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll stay with her myself.\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiles tiredly. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll get her paperwork ready and she\u2019ll be ready to go soon.\u201d</p><p>More waiting.</p><p>The clock ticks slowly on and I sigh. Apparently, it doesn\u2019t make it go any faster to watch it.</p><p>I get a cup of shitty hospital coffee, arrange for Jacey\u2019s bill to be sent to me, and am back in the waiting room by the time a nurse comes wheeling her out. Jacey looks disgruntled and she hasn\u2019t even seen me yet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to babysit me,\u201d she grumbles to the nurse as I get to my feet. I have to smile at her attitude.</p><p>The nurse looks at me in relief, probably anxious to get Jacey off her hands.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is here to take you home. He\u2019s going to watch you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s head snaps up and she looks around.</p><p>\u201cGabe\u2019s here?\u201d she asks, and it pains me to hear the excitement in her voice. I hate to be the one to disappoint her.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, her expression falling like a stone, but she doesn\u2019t reveal my lie to the nurse. She waits until exactly five minutes later when we\u2019re in my car alone to rip into me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d she snaps as I drive out of the parking garage and toward her little house. \u201cYou think you can take advantage of me when I\u2019m down? Really? That\u2019s how you operate? I don\u2019t want you to stay with me, Dominic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just want to help,\u201d I assure her, glancing at the way she\u2019s rubbing her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you fell, Jacey.

I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jacey snaps, staring at me, her brown eyes snapping. \u201cJust... no. Stop the car and I\u2019ll call someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Brand?\u201d I ask acerbically. \u201cYou want him to come riding to your rescue again and you can pretend that you don\u2019t know what he feels for you?\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me, her gaze falling, and for a minute I feel bad for goading her. But shit. She can\u2019t keep running to him every time she has a problem.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired to argue,\u201d Jacey finally says wearily, leaning her head against the window. \u201cBrand and I had a come-to-Jesus, and you were right, okay? Is that what you want to hear? You were right. Brand\u2019s in love with me. I don\u2019t feel the same way, and it\u2019s driving a wedge in between us, so I can\u2019t call him. I\u2019m on my own. Just... take me home and drop me off, if you want to help. I\u2019m so tired that I can\u2019t stay awake.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned about her and Brand. I\u2019m stunned she would tell me that I was right all along. I\u2019m stunned that she\u2019s not going to call him anyway because she leans on him for everything.</p><p>A part of me feels intense satisfaction that she\u2019s not leaning on him tonight.</p><p>I\u2019m here instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Brand,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI know how much you love him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him,\u201d she answers firmly. \u201cLet\u2019s just... not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply, ignoring her icy tone. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just tell you that you\u2019re not on your own. I\u2019m here. And it\u2019s normal to feel sleepy. You can go to sleep when we get to your house, but I have to stay with you and wake you up every two hours. Doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fucking great,\u201d she mutters, closing her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>When we get to her house, she changes into pajamas and then climbs into bed.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep on the sofa,\u201d she tells me firmly as I pull the blankets up to her chin. I nod.</p><p>\u201cWhatever makes you comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou leaving would make me comfortable,\u201d she grumbles and rolls onto her side, dismissing me. I settle myself on the sofa.</p><p>I don\u2019t sleep. Instead I read a book until it\u2019s time to wake her up the first time.</p><p>As I stare down at her, I can\u2019t help but notice how innocent and beautiful she looks while she\u2019s asleep. Completely trusting. I gently shake her shoulder and she opens her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJacey, do you feel all right?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d I clarify.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she sighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your full name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJaselyn Elizabeth Vincent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>It suits her. But I don\u2019t add that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after my grandma.\u201d She yawns. \u201cWhen I was born, Gabe couldn\u2019t say it very well. He called me Jacey, and eventually everyone else did too. Can I go back to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I tell her uncertainly. \u201cI need to make sure you\u2019re lucid first.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, and I can see when the sleep lifts and clarity sets in. Her expression hardens.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Dominic?\u201d she asks suddenly. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told the hospital the truth\u2014and they would\u2019ve asked me for someone else to call. You didn\u2019t have to stay there and you don\u2019t have to stay here now. What kind of game are you playing?\u201d</p><p>A tiny muscle in my jaw ticks. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer her honestly. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a game. For once, it\u2019s not a game. I want to be here.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, a tiny sound in the night. \u201cBut why? You\u2019re only making things worse. You\u2019re dragging things out when we need to just end them. It\u2019s cleaner that way. Less painful. Trust me, I know all about endings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to end things,\u201d I tell her raggedly. I know that her response could crush me, but I can\u2019t take it back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to end things,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>As I say the words aloud, it validates what I feel even more. I don\u2019t want to end things. I don\u2019t know what I want, but I don\u2019t want that. Somehow, against my best efforts, I\u2019ve let her in. And now that she\u2019s in, I can\u2019t let go of her. I can\u2019t experience that kind of loss again.</p><p>She closes her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t give me what I need, Dominic,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cSo what\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t settle for less. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Panic wells up in me, leaving a bitter taste on my tongue, because she might be right. Not because I don\u2019t want to give her what she needs, but because I might be incapable.</p><p>But I can fucking try.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d I ask, and the words scrape my throat painfully.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she answers simply. \u201cAll of you... and you aren\u2019t able to give me that.\u201d</p><p>My breath comes quicker now, in rasps and almost pants. I don\u2019t know what a panic attack feels like, but I feel like I might be getting ready to have one. My ribs feel like steel bands that are constricting my lungs in a vise. I suck a harsh breath in, then let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I ask finally. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you,\u201d she says simply, her eyes closed and her eyelashes dark against her pale cheeks. \u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I ask, my voice empty. \u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>Jacey opens her eyes again, and I see a million things there. Painful things, confused things.</p><p>Hopeful things.</p><p>\u201cFine. Maybe I don\u2019t, so why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she suggests softly. \u201cTell me who you are. Tell me about Emma. That\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The vise around my lungs moves to my heart, constricting it, crushing it, grinding it to a pulp while I try to breathe.</p><p>I manage to take a breath and stare into the corner of the room, into the dark.</p><p>\u201cWhy that?\u201d I manage to ask. \u201cWhy do I have to talk about Emma? She doesn\u2019t affect you and me.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me, her gaze dark. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she?\u201d she asks softly. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with her, Dominic. And she\u2019s there... in every little thing you do.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes closed, trying to force out the truth. But I know she\u2019s right. Everything I do, everything that is fucked up about me, is because of Emma. And if I ever want to get past it, if I ever want something that is real and good, I have to confront it. I have to confront her.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jacey asks quietly. \u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t do it. Just go, Dom. I\u2019ll call Kaylie to sit with me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fly open.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say firmly, fueled by desperation. \u201cLet me try.\u201d Jacey stares at me doubtfully, afraid to hope now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with Emma. She\u2019s dead. I know that. But I can\u2019t help but love her. She was my first everything. My first kiss, my first love, my first time. I\u2019ll always love her. Because of everything that happened with her, I\u2019ll never get away from it. From her.\u201d</p><p>I pause, letting the words soak in for Jacey.</p><p>\u201cEmma\u2019s dead. She died a horrible death and it was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t think I can describe that night, I can\u2019t even put it into words. I\u2019ve never been able to talk about it with anyone... not even my family. I think about her face and that last night and I freeze up. The words die in my mouth and I can\u2019t say them. But if you need this... if this is what you need... I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>The air is charged between us, and it hangs heavily. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because the one thing I need happens... Jacey\u2019s face softens at my words and she nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispers softly. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard. But I do need this. I need to understand what happened, because I think it will explain everything. I need to know you, Dom.\u201d</p><p>I feel weak with relief, but at the same time I\u2019m tense. I know I have one shot to explain, to make her understand, and I have to get it right. Even though there\u2019s no getting anything with Emma\u2019s fucked-up situation right. It was always all wrong. On every level.</p><p>I look out the window at the night sky as I speak. I can\u2019t look at Jacey\u2019s face... it might kill me to see her reaction. There\u2019s no way I want to see her face when she hears what I did. Who I was. How I acted.</p><p>\u201cEmma and I grew up together,\u201d I begin. \u201cShe was always at my house, with Kira, playing with Duncan, Sin, Fiona, and me. We were all like family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you started dating,\u201d Jacey interrupts. I smile, just a little, at the memory of my first date with Emma.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Our first date was an accident... when we were sophomores. Her car died on our road. I was on my way out, so I picked her up and took her with me. I was driving my dad\u2019s old classic Nova... and it had a cassette tape stuck in the deck. If we wanted to listen to anything, our only choice was \u201cBrown Eyed Girl.\u201d We probably listened to that song fifty times that night... but it turned out all right because the night ended with a goodnight kiss. All of a sudden, we realized that we didn\u2019t feel like brother and sister anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me, a knowing look in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s how you knew about Brand. You recognized it because that\u2019s what happened with you and Emma.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWe dated all through high school. No one said our names separately... we were like one person, Dom-and-Emma. But then, my senior year...\u201d</p><p>My voice trails off as pain rips through me. Memories are so vivid, so fucking vivid, and I close my eyes against them.</p><p>The blood, the pain in Emma\u2019s eyes. The guilt, Jesus Christ, the guilt.</p><p>My spine feels like it\u2019s being ripped out of my body at the mere memory.</p><p>I swallow hard, then swallow again. Jacey waits patiently, but I can feel her watching me, wondering if I\u2019m going to be able to do it.</p><p>\u201cEmma killed herself because of me,\u201d I finally manage to say thickly, and my tongue feels like a dead thing in my mouth.</p><p>All the blood, her blood, swims in front of my eyes, and for a moment I only see red. I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s the only color I\u2019m ever going to see.</p><p>Jacey gasps a ragged breath and her eyes widen. \u201cOh my god. Jesus, Dominic.\u201d She takes another breath. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I try to make myself numb, like I always do when I think about this, about Emma.</p><p>I reach into my pocket, turning the aquamarine pendant over and over in my fingers. Like always, knowing that she used to wear it around her neck when she was still healthy and alive calms me down enough so I can speak.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d I finally answer. \u201cThe important thing is that she did. And it was my fault.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacey stares at me, her eyes still horror filled, but now there\u2019s something else too. Curiosity. A need to know. A need to understand. And beneath all that, a hope that I\u2019m wrong\u2014that I\u2019m not to blame.</p><p>But I am.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how it was your fault,\u201d she answers slowly. \u201cSuicide is a personal choice. You couldn\u2019t have made her do such a thing. But if you think that\u2019s true, then we need to talk about it, because it has definitely affected you.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut hard, trying to blink away the red, then take another breath.</p> <p>\u201cEmma cheated on me with Cris. She told me about it and she cried. She was so sorry. Apparently, they got drunk one night when I was out with other friends. One thing led to another, and they had sex. She was sorry and I was devastated.\u201d</p><p>Jacey freezes now, her eyes glued to mine. \u201cThat\u2019s why you hate Cris now.\u201d</p><p>I nod silently.</p><p>Jacey stares at me a second, then speaks hesitantly. \u201cOkay. I can see where you would be pissed at him. But to this degree? You were kids, Dom. I mean, you were teenagers. Even adults make that mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sigh. \u201cBut Emma got pregnant, Jacey. And since we always used condoms, we had a pretty good idea that the baby was Cris\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>I look away. \u201cI remember standing over a pile of pregnancy tests in Emma\u2019s bathroom, all of them showing a fuzzy pink plus sign. If I could go back in time to any one moment, it would be to that one. I would handle everything differently.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have annihilated her.</p><p>Jacey sucks in her breath, her hands twisted in her lap. \u201cJesus. I don\u2019t know what to say, Dom. What happened?\u201d</p><p>I failed her.</p><p>\u201cI was so pissed at her,\u201d I admit. \u201cI screamed and she cried, but at the end of the day, it boiled down to one thing. I loved her. More than anything. More than a pregnancy, more than her cheating on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you stayed with her?\u201d Jacey asks hesitantly. I can see that that notion doesn\u2019t match the idea of me that lives in her head. That\u2019s because that version of me died with Emma.</p> <p>\u201cShe swore to me that it was a one-time thing, an accident. That she\u2019d been lonely because I\u2019d been away so much, visiting colleges. I\u2019d pulled away from her a little and Cris moved in. He took up my slack and hung out with her all the time. I should\u2019ve seen what he was doing, but I didn\u2019t. He was my best friend and I was blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think it was your fault that Emma cheated on you?\u201d Jacey asks doubtfully.</p><p>I ignore that and take a gulp of water. \u201cBecause I could see that it was true, that Cris had swooped in on her and I\u2019d been neglecting her, I forgave her. He took advantage of her. And they were drunk. But I demanded one thing from her in exchange for my forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>I pause, staring out the window again as I remember the way Emma\u2019s head had dropped when I told her. How I\u2019d stood over her and how I didn\u2019t feel sorry about what I was asking. I didn\u2019t care that it devastated her. I didn\u2019t care about anything but myself and my own pain.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even begun to know pain yet. I just didn\u2019t know it at the time.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to say the ugly words to Jacey. I don\u2019t want her to know. But she prompts me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you demand?\u201d she asks quietly, but there\u2019s a certain knowingness to her tone, an aching fragile timbre. She knows.</p><p>\u201cAn abortion. I demanded that she have an abortion. I wasn\u2019t man enough to raise his baby. I forgave her, but I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>Jacey\u2019s quiet now, still. She watches me, waiting for me to continue. I don\u2019t want to, but I know I have to. The bullet is out of the gun now. There\u2019s no putting it back.</p><p>\u201cWe were just eighteen,\u201d I say quietly, staring at the wall. \u201cWe were getting ready to go away to college together. We were going to have a new start, away from Cris. I made my forgiveness contingent on that one thing. She had to get an abortion. If she wouldn\u2019t, then I was done. I made that very clear.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s face is in my head, innocent and young, as she pleads with me.</p><p>Dominic, I can\u2019t, she\u2019d cried. My parents would kill me. And it\u2019s wrong, Dom. It\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cI pressured her hard,\u201d I finally continue, even though those words are a gross understatement. \u201cEvery day. Every hour. She cried and I raged and I refused to give in. I didn\u2019t care that her family was strict Catholic. I didn\u2019t care that she thought her soul was in jeopardy and that her parents would never forgive her. In my head, I thought of the baby as an it, as Cris\u2019s mistake. I didn\u2019t think of it as an actual human life. I was too blinded by my anger and my hurt and my hate to care about anything but myself.\u201d</p><p>I pause and stare at Jacey. \u201cDo you see how selfish I was?\u201d</p><p>Jacey is deathly pale as she stares at me, as a million thoughts flash through her eyes. \u201cAnyone would\u2019ve been upset, Dominic,\u201d she finally answers hesitantly. I can see that she doesn\u2019t know what to say. I can\u2019t fault her for that... because who would?</p><p>I turn away, staring into the dark, trying to focus on the night instead of the memories in my head.</p><p>\u201cI took her to get the abortion. It was a quiet ride. They wouldn\u2019t let me go back with her, so she had to do it alone. On the way home, she huddled into the car door and cried. She wouldn\u2019t talk to me for days. But she talked to Cris. Because a few days later, on our graduation day, I went over to her house and got there just as he was leaving. I lost my shit. I told her that I never wanted to see her again, that if she wanted Cris she could have him. So after making her have an abortion for me, I left her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jacey utters a weird noise, a guttural sound that I\u2019ve never heard pass her lips before. Her knuckles graze her teeth as she presses her fist to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cEmma skipped the graduation parties. She didn\u2019t come and I didn\u2019t care. I went to a party with Sin and Duncan that night, determined to get drunk and forget all about her. So that\u2019s what I did. I was getting a lap dance from Taylor McKay when Emma called me. It was late and she was babbling and I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails out of what she was saying... except that she\u2019d cut her wrists. And that she needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go?\u201d Jacey whispers, and I can see from her face she\u2019s afraid of the answer.</p><p>\u201cOf course I went. But it was too late to save her.\u201d</p><p>Jacey shakes her head in disbelief now, like she\u2019s expecting that I\u2019m just spinning a tale, acting out a scene. \u201cDom... I...\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have the words. Because the answer is clear. I\u2019m a horrible person. A monster.</p><p>I nod curtly, once, determined to keep my composure.</p><p>\u201cEmma was a light. Everyone who met her knew that. She was too good for me. And I failed her. She trusted the wrong person, because I turned away when she needed me the most. I abandoned her. The worst part is that she loved me anyway.\u201d</p><p>And she did. I\u2019ll never forget the look on her face when she saw me come in. It was like everything was right in the world, even though she was dying in a sea of her own blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you got there?\u201d Jacey whispers.</p><p>I\u2019m wooden now as I force the words from my lips. I stare back out the window, away from Jacey\u2019s horror, as I see the memories in my head.</p><p>\u201cThe bed was covered in blood, and Emma was pale and shaking and cold. She\u2019d sliced her arms from wrist to elbow, and I knew that it wasn\u2019t a cry for help. She wanted to die. She didn\u2019t want to be saved. She was surrounded by poems that she had written, all about death. I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see that I\u2019d broken her so completely.\u201d</p><p>I pause, trying to untangle my tongue, trying to swallow the emotion that lingers there, trying to swallow the memories so that I can act calm. I\u2019m a fucking actor, for Christ\u2019s sake. I can act calm.</p><p>I somehow manage it, because my words come out in a wooden monotone. \u201cThere was so much blood. There were bloody footprints everywhere. I\u2019ve never seen so much blood. She grabbed my shirt and clung to me and her hands were so cold. Her lips were so blue.\u201d</p><p>She was so pale.</p><p>The blood.</p><p>The blood.</p><p>The blood.</p><p>I pause. \u201cThere was so much blood. We had towels wrapped around her arms, but they soaked through within minutes. The EMTs came in and she acted like they weren\u2019t even there. She just kept apologizing to me. Telling me how sorry she was for killing our baby... a baby I\u2019d never wanted in the first place. I begged her to hold on until they got her to the hospital, I begged her to try. But she didn\u2019t even make it to the ambulance. I begged, but she died anyway.\u201d</p><p>The room is quiet now, utterly silent but for the soft sounds of Jacey\u2019s breathing. I close my eyes, and behind my eyelids a movie plays out. The movie of my life. The movie of the night that destroyed me.</p><p>\u201cThere was so much blood,\u201d I murmur, seeing it like it was yesterday. Some emotion has slipped through my voice, but only a little. I\u2019m still in check. For now. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much. Emma\u2019s entire bed was covered in it. The towels were soaked, my clothes were soaked. It was all over my hands, my face. Her mom was screaming on the phone with emergency dispatch... her dad was crying. Emma and I were on her bed, and she got weaker and weaker so fast, and then she kept trying to tell me something, but she couldn\u2019t get the words out. But I finally figured it out.\u201d</p><p>I turn and look at Jacey. \u201cShe was saying Cris\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Jacey opens her mouth, but closes it again. There\u2019s nothing she can say.</p><p>\u201cI ignored it. I pretended I didn\u2019t hear. Instead, I just told her that I was so sorry that I\u2019d pressured her. I told her that I loved her and that I would always love her no matter what had happened with Cris. Nothing else mattered in that moment because I knew she was dying. I knew she only had a few minutes left, and I didn\u2019t want to spend those minutes being ugly. In the end, all that matters is life. You forget the ugliness, you forget the pain. Just for one moment.\u201d</p><p>My eyes burn and I look out the window, seeing Emma\u2019s face. She was so beautiful, even then, even with her lips blue and her eyes wide and scared and sad. Her body was so slight, so cold as I held her.</p><p>\u201cShe died in my arms.\u201d</p><p>Jacey is utterly silent, horror in her eyes. I don\u2019t know what else to do but keep talking.</p><p>\u201cI was drunk, but I\u2019ll never forget how still she was. I didn\u2019t even know she was gone at first... I was clutching her to me, pleading with her, and then all of a sudden I realized that she wasn\u2019t answering. I pulled away from her, just a little, and she was like a rag doll. Her eyes were empty.\u201d I pause, taking a deep breath, filling up lungs that don\u2019t deserve the oxygen.</p><p>\u201cShe died while I was holding her, and I didn\u2019t even know it. I don\u2019t know when she took her last breath. Even at the end, she deserved so much more than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Jacey breathes, and horror is in her eyes as she looks at me. She finally sees me for the monster I am, but I don\u2019t get any satisfaction from it. \u201cDominic, what she did wasn\u2019t your fault. You were young and scared and you asked her to get an abortion. You didn\u2019t ask her to kill herself. She did that on her own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did do it,\u201d I argue firmly. \u201cI annihilated her. I pushed her. She loved me so much, and all she wanted was to be with me. I practically pushed her into Cris\u2019s arms by neglecting her. It was my fault. And then all she wanted was for me to forgive her, and I made her do an unimaginable thing. She couldn\u2019t take it. She couldn\u2019t live with the guilt.\u201d</p><p>Jacey reaches over and grabs my hand again, her fingers small and cold. She holds it and I let her, but my heart is cold and empty. For the first time since it happened, I\u2019ve told someone. And it doesn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows,\u201d I add limply. \u201cHer parents don\u2019t even know. She didn\u2019t leave a note. All she left were those fucking poems about death. I didn\u2019t see the point in telling them all of the ugliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve given them some closure,\u201d Jacey points out hesitantly. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably been torturing themselves, wondering why she did it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t occur to me,\u201d I admit shakily. \u201cI was so wrapped up in my own grief. After the funeral, they moved away. Mr. Brandt got a job in New York City and they moved to New Jersey. They couldn\u2019t stand to stay in the same house where she died.\u201d</p><p>Not in a house where one room was covered in their only daughter\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d Jacey answers quietly.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d I agree. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I moved to California and rarely come home. Trust me, I totally get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cris,\u201d Jacey says hesitantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never talked to Cris about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d I spit angrily. \u201cI forgave Emma for what happened, but I\u2019ll never fucking forgive Cris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying so much anger and hatred still,\u201d Jacey points out slowly. \u201cYou blame Cris, you blame yourself. You\u2019re mad at Emma, you love Emma. Those are a lot of unresolved emotions to carry, Dom. You\u2019re not being fair to yourself. When we hate someone so much, we think that we\u2019re hurting them. But we\u2019re not. We\u2019re only hurting ourselves, because carrying that much ugliness around is toxic.\u201d</p><p>A knot forms in my throat, heavy and hard. I can\u2019t swallow past it, and my eyes sting. I look up at the ceiling, I look out the window, I look at the floor. Anything to avoid looking at Jacey.</p><p>\u201cDominic,\u201d she says softly. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I look at her.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault that Emma died. She died from something she shouldn\u2019t have done. If you\u2019d known, you would\u2019ve tried to stop her.\u201d</p> <p>I nod stiltedly. At least that much is true.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t keep blaming yourself for such a terrible accident. Because it was an accident, Dominic. Emma wasn\u2019t in her right mind. She was just a kid herself.\u201d</p><p>I take a breath, and it\u2019s ragged in the dark.</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t live with the guilt. Before she started asking for Cris, she kept crying incoherently about the guilt. I told her that I\u2019d forgiven her and she just shook her head. She couldn\u2019t forgive herself and she couldn\u2019t trust me to forgive her, either. So she killed herself. I might not have cut her wrists, but I killed her all the same.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Jacey</p><p>My chest literally hurts at the look on Dominic\u2019s face... at how shattered he is... at how shattered he\u2019s always been.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve carried this for so long,\u201d I finally manage to say. \u201cThis has been so much to carry, Dominic.\u201d</p> <p>He sits slumped in the chair by my bed, his hands in his lap. I\u2019m holding his hand, but his fingers are limp. He doesn\u2019t even think that he deserves comfort. It\u2019s heartbreaking and I feel mine shatter into a million tiny pieces.</p><p>\u201cDom,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou didn\u2019t push her into Cris\u2019s arms. This wasn\u2019t your fault. She made the choice. Not you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, he just closes his eyes. I see that his hands are shaking, and it breaks my heart. Such a young girl, so much loss... and Dominic. God. He was so young, too. Too young to carry such a heavy burden.</p><p>My head pounds, but I ignore it as I roll out of bed and kneel in front of Dom.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I tell him softly. He keeps his eyes closed, so I repeat myself more firmly. \u201cLook at me, Dom.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes, and they\u2019re so, so dark. Filled with grief, filled with guilt, filled with unimaginable things.</p><p>Things that he has actually seen.</p><p>\u201cIs this why you won\u2019t get close to anyone?\u201d I whisper, gripping his hands hard. \u201cYou think that you\u2019re not fit to be with anyone because you killed Emma. Is that right? That\u2019s what you think?\u201d</p><p>He just stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d I ask bluntly.</p><p>There\u2019s a beat, then he nods once.</p><p>My heart breaks and I feel a tear slip down my cheek. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t trust anyone to not hurt you like that again, right? She crushed you. She died and left you... she left you with all of that guilt, and you were furious at her for that, right?\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Dominic?\u201d I know I sound harsh, but he has to face this or he\u2019s never going to get past it. I\u2019m no expert, but even I know that.</p><p>He nods once more.</p><p>\u201cAnger is a normal response when someone dies,\u201d I tell him softly. \u201cTrust me, I know. Remember when I told you that my last boyfriend did something terrible? Well, he was a psychopath. And I shouldn\u2019t have gone back to him, but I was weak and I did. And when I did, a good friend of mine died because of my actions. He died because he tried to save me. And when he died, I was so pissed. I was pissed at him for trying to help me, but then I was pissed at myself... because if I wasn\u2019t so weak, he wouldn\u2019t have had to save me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been your fault.\u201d Dominic finally speaks. I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cNo? I tell myself that. But I\u2019m not sure I believe it. Not deep down. That\u2019s something you know a lot about, right?\u201d</p><p>Dominic nods. \u201cBut your situation is different than mine.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s really not. Someone I love died because of a decision I made. You think someone died because of you. The difference between you and me is that my friend really died because of me. Emma died because of a choice she made herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your friend made that choice himself, too,\u201d Dominic tells me, his voice as dark as his eyes. \u201cHe chose to try and help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him softly. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think about every day. Because he was close to me, because he loved me. That guilt is hard to carry. But it\u2019s also something I know that I have to let go... and I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019ve been working on it ever since that horrible day. You have to let this go, Dominic. You have to try. Regardless of why, Emma is gone. You can\u2019t bring her back, and it\u2019s not going to help anything to carry the blame forever. It won\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou have to believe that I\u2019d do anything to let it go. I feel chained by her... by what happened. I feel trapped by everything. It\u2019s around me all of the time. I can never get away from it. Every day, I know what I did to her. I love her and I hate her at the same time. I feel like there\u2019s a wall in front of me and I can\u2019t move forward. I would give anything to break through it and be able to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Dominic,\u201d I tell him urgently, squeezing his hands. \u201cYou really can. You just have to go through the motions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d he answers limply. \u201cWhen I met you, when I got to know you... for the first time since Emma died, I felt a need to get close to someone, to you. But even you can\u2019t save me from this. You can\u2019t help. No one can. And if you try, Kira was right... you\u2019ll drown right along with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to get close to me?\u201d I ask quietly, incredulously, because his actions have been so contradictory lately.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Dominic admits, looking away. \u201cBut then I realized that it\u2019s not fair to drag you into my toxic life. That\u2019s when I ended things. Not because I really wanted to, but because you deserve far, far better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me decide that?\u201d I suggest gently. But Dom just looks away, his jaw clenched. I can see in his eyes that he\u2019s thinking of Emma, and of how he let her in and she decimated him. How he thinks that he killed her. How he thinks he wasn\u2019t enough to save her, as if that was ever within his power in the first place.</p><p>The look on his face, so sad, so vulnerable, so hopeless... it shatters me. And so I do the only thing I can think of to do.</p><p>I kiss him.</p><p>I take all of my sadness for him, all of my heartache, and I channel it into a kiss. It\u2019s the only thing I know to do. I want to take his sadness away, I want to absorb it in the only way I know how.</p><p>At first, Dominic is limp, sitting still as I envelop him in my arms. But after a minute, his hands slide up my back and I feel the warmth of his fingers gripping me. His breathing picks up, ragged and harsh.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be with me,\u201d he tells me again desperately. But I ignore him.</p><p>We kiss again and again, and our hands are everywhere, a sudden and feverish frenzy. I want him. I want to take his pain and replace it with something good. He deserves that... if only I can make him see. His heart beats against mine, loud and strong as I run my hands down his chest, down to his belt buckle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d he rasps against my ear. \u201cI want to. But I don\u2019t think I can. I haven\u2019t been able to... be with anyone since Emma died. I have this debilitating fear of trusting someone again. After Emma died, I didn\u2019t handle my grief. I suppressed it. I focused so much on the fear and the guilt that it grew into a monster that I can\u2019t get past. There\u2019s something inside of me that\u2019s broken, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I stare into his eyes, into his heartbreak, and I melt.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s fix you.\u201d</p><p>I silence his protests with my lips as I crawl onto his lap and suck down his pain. I breathe it in as my hands stroke him everywhere, his face, his chest, his arms. I take his guilt and his sadness and his angst. My chest presses against his, my heart beating with his.</p><p>Both of them are racing, pounding, breaking.</p><p>\u201cFix me, Jacey,\u201d he whispers, his hands pulling at my nightgown, pushing it up and pulling it over my head. \u201cIf you can.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I can.</p><p>I tug at his clothes until there is nothing left between us but skin and heat. Heat and skin. The delicious smell of him, the feel of his fingers and his tongue. There\u2019s so much emotion between us now that my body feels so sensitive, electric. Every touch of his fingers sends me arching toward the sky, pulling him onto me.</p><p>Because I want more of him.</p><p>I\u2019m finally going to get all of him.</p><p>We tumble onto my bed together, his hand behind my head. He kisses me again and again and again, and our heat feels like it\u2019s going to explode in a firestorm of emotion. I\u2019m not sure I can take this much sensation. It\u2019s too much to bear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything is a blur now... a blur of emotion and need and heat. His hands, his face, his eyes... his aching.</p><p>His guilt.</p><p>All of it wraps around me and I inhale it. I want to free him of it.</p><p>In this moment, he wants to change, and I want to help him do it.</p> <p>\u201cBe with me, Dom.\u201d I breathe. \u201cBe with me.\u201d</p><p>The energy in the room is palpable as he fluidly slips his fingers into me, cool and long. His body hovers over me in the dark, his breath warm on my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do this,\u201d he says again, uncertainly. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d I assure him firmly. \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>I can.</p> <p>I slip from under him and flip over on top of him, straddling his hips as I stare down at him. His face is beautiful in the dark, even as it is tortured.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d I whisper softly, leaning forward to trail my fingers down his cheek. I can feel his erection pressing against me, rigid and hard. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>He nods and I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><p>He smiles ever so slightly, but I can see the pain behind it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmurs, his hands gripping my hips and pulling me closer. With one movement, I lift and sink onto him, burying him deep within me. He glides into me easily, deeply, completely.</p> <p>The moment is frozen in time, like the world stops.</p><p>Like it\u2019s so fucking reverent.</p><p>Like the universe knows how significant this is.</p><p>We gasp at the same time, then Dominic groans, closing his eyes as my warmth surrounds him, as he sinks into a woman\u2019s body for the first time in six years.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he mumbles, his fingers digging into my skin as I rock on top of him. I start out slow, but I can\u2019t keep from growing frantic. I want to please him, to pleasure him... to save him.</p><p>As a whole, what we\u2019re doing is so much more than this simple action. It\u2019s more than a simple fuck. And we both know it.</p><p>It\u2019s significant on a thousand different levels.</p><p>Words escape me as I watch his face... at the look of wonder, amazement, and raw pleasure. I realize in this moment that he actually thought he couldn\u2019t do it. He had an actual mental block and he thought he\u2019d never get past it. It took me pushing him... taking matters into my own hands to make him do it.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you feel good,\u201d he murmurs, opening his eyes and staring into mine. I lean down and kiss him, my tongue tangling with his, my heat pouring into him.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I ask him, rocking softly atop him once again. He reaches up and cups my breasts, kneading my skin, his thumbs rubbing over my nipples, gentle at first, then harder. \u201cYou thought that only the dark and taboo worked for you. You thought you deserved that. You thought you deserved dark corners and hidden rooms. But you deserve this too, Dom. You deserve to be loved.\u201d</p><p>Dom stops and looks at me, his eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>His voice is quiet and shocked. And he\u2019s no more shocked than I am that I said the words out loud.</p><p>I stop all movement, shoving my hair away from my face as I stare at him. The idea of putting myself out there like that is terrifying. But I have to do it.</p><p>He has to know.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper hesitantly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Dominic closes his eyes, squeezes them closed as his hands slide lightly down my back, his fingernails grazing my skin. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispers. \u201cDon\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>I bend and cup his face in my hands, kissing him on the mouth. \u201cToo late,\u201d I whisper against his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>A tiny bit of wetness escapes from Dominic\u2019s eye, streaking down his cheek. I wipe it away as he opens his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, god help you then,\u201d he says simply.</p><p>He groans and flips me over, pinning me against the bed before he plunges into me, hard and fast, deep inside of me, as far inside as he can be. He throws his head back and practically growls. I grip his back, scratching into him as I kiss his arm.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I tell him urgently. \u201cGive me more.\u201d</p><p>He thrusts harder and faster, moaning into my neck, nipping at my skin. I feel his heart beating, I feel his heat, I feel the moisture from his skin. His scent surrounds me, uniquely him, and I inhale it, pulling it into me along with the rest of him.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I say again, and he thrusts again.</p><p>His eyes are glued to mine as he thrusts. His green eyes are almost black and all the hidden things that usually linger there are gone. His intense gaze is open, and it\u2019s all for me.</p><p>I limply cling to his back until finally he shudders, throwing his head back before he collapses on top of me, pulling me close. He breathes into my neck as his hands caress my back. It\u2019s a long time before he speaks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he finally admits quietly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d I answer softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>And I mean it. Words aren\u2019t necessary right now. I know what he\u2019s afraid of. I know what he thinks he is. It\u2019s up to me to show him that there\u2019s nothing to fear.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s eyes fly open.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use protection,\u201d he says shakily. \u201cJesus. I didn\u2019t think about it. I haven\u2019t had to worry about that in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about it now,\u201d I tell him calmly. \u201cI\u2019m on the pill and I haven\u2019t had unprotected sex in a very long time. I\u2019m healthy. You don\u2019t need to worry about me getting pregnant. You won\u2019t have to go through that again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes and I feel him relax into the bed next to me.</p><p>\u201cOk. I\u2019ll just worry about fucking you up with my fucked-uppedness,\u201d he mutters as he pulls me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, either,\u201d I tell him softly, pressing a kiss to his damp brow. \u201cI\u2019m fucked up enough on my own.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, his eyes still closed, and I have to wonder if I should worry. Closing my eyes, I decide that I won\u2019t. Not tonight.</p><p>I can start that shit tomorrow.</p><p>For now, I fall asleep in the arms of the man I love.</p><p>I love.</p><p>I love.</p><p>I love.</p><p>I love him.</p><p>He rejected me, but he came back. I stood my ground and he\u2019s willing to try. Maybe there\u2019s hope for us both.</p><p>I love him.</p><p>He\u2019s sad and broken and amazing and sexy and haunted. He\u2019s all of those things and I love him. It\u2019s a wonderment to me and it\u2019s the last thing I can think of as I drift into sleep.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I lean up on my elbow and watch Jacey sleep. The sunlight shines across her face and it makes her look almost angelic. I smile at what would be her surprise if I told her that.</p><p>I glance at the clock, then pick up the phone to call Joe. There\u2019s no way Jacey needs to go into work today, not after I had to wake her up every couple of hours in the night. She\u2019s going to be exhausted. Thankfully, Joe understands and even tells me to take the day off to look after her. I hang up and look back at Jacey, and when I do, she\u2019s staring at me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she says lightly, but her gaze is heavy. \u201cSo... last night was... something.\u201d</p><p>I smile, just a little, and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cIf by \u2018something\u2019 you mean an earth-shattering breakthrough for me, then yeah. It was something.\u201d</p><p>Jacey smiles and reaches for me, pulling me down to her.</p><p>\u201cLast night was intense,\u201d she rephrases.</p><p>My heart feels oddly numb, but beneath the numb layers it feels happy for the first time in years. I feel Jacey\u2019s lips curve into a smile against my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d Jacey asks quietly, her face still buried against me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer honestly. \u201cThis is all new ground for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she says confidently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I tell her. And I find that I mean it. It\u2019s such a good fucking feeling. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to work through what happened, but I was able to talk about it for the first time last night. You and I are... a step in the right direction. That\u2019s got to mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it does. We\u2019ll figure it out. And you don\u2019t have to stay with me today,\u201d she says with her lips against my neck. \u201cI feel fine. I have a headache, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really,\u201d I drawl, running my hands up her back, trying to lighten the situation. \u201cYou\u2019ve been wanting me in your bed for a month, and now I\u2019m here and you want me gone?\u201d</p><p>Jacey pulls away and looks at me, her expression serious. \u201cI do want you in my bed,\u201d she confirms. \u201cBut I want a lot of things. We\u2019re going to have to talk about it, Dominic. Last night was amazing, but it\u2019s only the beginning. I want you, Dom. And we\u2019re going to have to talk about how much of you you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, at her wide brown eyes, her slender shoulders, her full lips. \u201cYou can have all of me,\u201d I tell her simply. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you want it, but you can have it.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me, her lip quivering, then she dives into my arms, burying her head next to my chest.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take it,\u201d she announces. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be work, Dom. It will be a process. You\u2019re hurting inside. And you\u2019re not going to heal overnight. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and nod. \u201cI know. For now, I\u2019ll be satisfied with just being with you. Is that fine with you?\u201d</p><p>She nods, then hesitates. \u201cYes. But there\u2019s something else. Cris said that there\u2019s things you don\u2019t know. I really think that in order to really start moving forward, you need to know everything there is to know. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, unable to contain my disgust.</p><p>\u201cI never want to look at Cris again,\u201d I tell her truthfully. \u201cI\u2019m not transferring my blame to him, trust me. I blame myself plenty. But he\u2019s just as at fault. And he won\u2019t admit it. I don\u2019t want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he knows something you need to know,\u201d Jacey points out. \u201cAnd you need to heal. Please, Dom. I want to be with you. I do. But I need for you to start out with an open mind, ready to be in a relationship with me. To do that, you need to put your relationship with Emma to bed once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Her words float in the room around us, on the sun, on the air, and I know she\u2019s right. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can do it.</p><p>Because I can\u2019t.</p><p>I throw back the covers and stand up, pulling on my clothes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I tell her simply. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try with you, but I can\u2019t do that. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>I walk out, leaving her alone in her bedroom as I slide into my car and drive away.</p><p>I feel empty and crushed as I drive, oddly disjointed from the situation. But I\u2019ve always been good at that, at detaching myself when I have to. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always had to do to survive.</p><p>I haven\u2019t even reached the end of the street when Jacey texts me.</p><p>Don\u2019t throw this away, Dom. You deserve to be happy. Don\u2019t run from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words stop me in my tracks, right in the middle of the road. I don\u2019t care that someone is honking behind me.</p><p>Don\u2019t run.</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for years. I\u2019ve been running from what happened, hoping I could hide from it, hoping to never deal with it.</p><p>Running.</p> <p>Only a fucking pussy does that.</p><p>I turn my car around and go back, striding up the walk, not even bothering to knock on her door. I just walk directly into Jacey\u2019s house. She freezes in the doorway of her bedroom, standing there in just a T-shirt and panties. She doesn\u2019t look surprised to see me.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I tell her curtly. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to Cris, but I can\u2019t promise that I won\u2019t punch him in the throat.\u201d</p><p>Jacey smiles, a wide and beatific smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask for everything,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut this is good, Dom. Seriously. Should we call him and have him here, or should we go to your parents\u2019? Where should we meet with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSin\u2019s,\u201d I say automatically. \u201cI don\u2019t want the drama of doing it at my parents. And I don\u2019t want him stepping one foot into your house. We\u2019ll do it at Sin\u2019s. He won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jacey says quietly. \u201cThank you for doing this for me, Dominic. I hope you see that we\u2019re really doing this for you, too.\u201d I nod, and my gut clenches at the look on her face. It\u2019s genuine and real and she loves me.</p><p>She loves me.</p><p>Sin\u2019s house is quiet when we arrive, and Jacey turns to me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this empty,\u201d she observes as we walk in the front door. \u201cIs there anyone downstairs?\u201d</p><p>By \u201cdownstairs,\u201d I know what she means and I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Sin\u2019s parties aren\u2019t ongoing, although they seem like it. There\u2019s usually not anyone down there during the day. Besides, he knows we\u2019re coming to talk to Cris. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to sit in. He\u2019s been curious about what happened for years.\u201d</p><p>Jacey slips her hand in mine, and for the first time in a long time I feel comfortable leaving it there. I don\u2019t know why. All I know is that I want to touch her, and for the first time it seems okay.</p><p>We make our way to the living room, where Sin\u2019s already waiting. He\u2019s even got a shirt on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d I observe. Sin grins.</p><p>\u201cSince when is four in the afternoon early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early for you,\u201d I amend.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sin looks at me curiously. \u201cWhy the change of heart about Cris?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I had a change of heart. I said I want to talk to him. Jacey talked me into it. It\u2019s a good idea to know everything so that I can put everything surrounding Emma to bed.\u201d</p> <p>Sin nods in surprised approval. \u201cIt\u2019s time, Dom. It really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answer simply. \u201cAnd Sin, if you\u2019re going to be here today, there\u2019s going to be some stuff you didn\u2019t know... I should probably just go ahead and tell you. Emma got pregnant back in high school. And it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sin asks stiltedly, his face suddenly deathly pale. But I don\u2019t have time to answer, because Cris clears his throat in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he announces. Jacey squeezes my hand in encouragement, to calm me down, to prevent me from punching Cris\u2019s face in right off the bat. I glance down at her, and she stares at me in support.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d she tells me quietly.</p><p>I nod. I know I can. I have a brief moment of clarity. This whole mess originated with Cris, with what Cris did with my girlfriend. The pressure should be on him, not me.</p><p>I motion for Cris to come in, and Sin, of course, pours him a drink, shoving it into his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll need that,\u201d Sin tells him. \u201cSit anywhere you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Cris chooses a chair across from me and sits, wildly banging his foot against the chair leg. When he sees me looking at it, he stops moving.</p><p>\u201cFiona didn\u2019t come?\u201d I ask curiously. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like her.\u201d</p><p>Cris shrugs. \u201cShe felt that this was between you and me. She didn\u2019t want to choose a side.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? Now she decides that? She didn\u2019t feel that way the last time she was here at Sin\u2019s, screaming at me about what a lunatic I am. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I draw in a deep breath. \u201cThank you for coming. I... felt like it was time for me to talk to you about what happened with Emma. About what you know that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Cris nods hesitantly, staring me in the eye. For a minute I see the kid he was, back when we were best friends. He\u2019s nervous. And because of that, I know whatever he\u2019s going to tell me is going to be bad. His eyes hold something ominous.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cJust get it out in the open. I can tell it\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d</p><p>Cris looks away. \u201cI actually don\u2019t even know where to start. It\u2019s been so long. I\u2019ve thought about it a million different times, tried to figure out what I\u2019d say if you\u2019d ever gave me the chance, or if I even should. But let me just start out with... I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry that this has split us apart. I\u2019m sorry for any part I had in making you so... damaged.\u201d</p><p>He says damaged, although I know he\u2019s really thinking fucked up. I can\u2019t fault him for that. The rest of my family feels the same way, because it\u2019s true. I stare at him wordlessly.</p><p>He stares back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been something... something I wanted to protect you from. Something bad, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unresponsive as I prepare myself, as I sit waiting.</p><p>Cris looks at me.</p><p>\u201cShould I just lay it out there?\u201d he finally asks. \u201cOr do you want me to sugarcoat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I want you to sugarcoat it?\u201d I answer stiffly. \u201cJust say it.\u201d</p><p>Cris looks away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you over the years,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ve kept an eye on you. I knew when you graduated school, even after you had to pull out to go film Visceral Need. I watched you give interviews after your first movie was a hit. I watched you retreat from public life as much as they would let you. I watched the way your face grew tired and haunted. And I knew, I could see it on your face, that you were as haunted by Emma as I was.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, and Jacey squeezes my hand.</p><p>You can do this.</p><p>I can practically hear her saying the words. I squeeze her hand back.</p><p>\u201cI was haunted, am haunted, by a different reason than you, of course,\u201d Cris continues. \u201cI\u2019m haunted because I failed her. She trusted me with knowledge that I carried around in secret, just like she\u2019d asked, because we thought it was for the best. As a kid, I didn\u2019t realize that some secrets should be exposed, some promises should be broken. So I kept her secret. I should\u2019ve tried harder to tell you, because she changed her mind at the end. She wanted you to know. I failed her because I couldn\u2019t get you to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>My impatience swells up in me like a sudden cresting wave. \u201cI\u2019m listening now,\u201d I snap. \u201cJust fucking tell me.\u201d</p><p>Cris levels a gaze at me. \u201cDo you remember the day of Emma\u2019s funeral... I tried to talk to you and you wouldn\u2019t listen? I only managed to get a few words out before you shoved me into the wall. Do you remember what I said?\u201d</p><p>I think back to that day, to the day that was filled with black... black dresses, black suits, black emotions. There was so much blackness that I couldn\u2019t think straight. Cris tried to talk to me and I couldn\u2019t take it. I couldn\u2019t stand the sound of his voice. But I do remember exactly what he said.</p><p>\u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t you,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhat the fuck did that mean? \u201d</p><p>Cris sighs and stares at the floor as he remembers the past, as it plays in his head, probably the way it plays in mine... like a nightmare.</p><p>\u201cEmma told you that she and I got carried away one night, right?\u201d Cris asks, his voice as heavy as lead. I nod. \u201cShe said that she and I were sharing a bottle of your dad\u2019s liquor in the old tree house while you and Duncan were in Chicago. Isn\u2019t that what she told you?\u201d</p><p>I have to steel myself in order to nod. \u201cYou know that\u2019s what she said.\u201d</p><p>Cris nods. \u201cShe asked me if she could tell you that. But that\u2019s not what happened. Well, it did happen exactly that way. And all of it was true. Except for who she was with. The guy she was with that night, the guy who got her pregnant... it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>The breath rushes from my body, out of my lips, and into the air around me as I struggle to comprehend what Cris just said.</p><p>Not him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I spit. \u201cWhy would you carry the blame all of these years? That\u2019s ridiculous. Who in the world would be so important that you would sacrifice our friendship for? You were my best friend, man. You told me it was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he argues. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Emma told you it was me. I just let her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who the fuck was it?\u201d</p><p>Cris stands still, his hands limp, his lips pressed together. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the right thing to do after all,\u201d he finally says, like the coward he is. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s best to let sleeping dogs lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d I snarl. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Sin breaks in. \u201cJust wait, Dom. Let\u2019s sort this out calmly. Take a breath and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I tune out my brother, because all I can see is Cris shaking his head... shaking his head like he\u2019s not going to tell me.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see red.</p><p>Red billows in once again from the corners of my eyes, and I attack him, raging like a bull, roaring like a wild animal as I leap onto him, pounding my fists into his face. My knuckles connect with his cheekbone in a satisfying crack.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d I demand from him, over and over.</p><p>But Cris doesn\u2019t fight back and he doesn\u2019t answer. He lets me hit him over and over. Everything is a blur of noise and emotion and colors and I don\u2019t even understand what anyone is saying to me.</p><p>Except for one thing. Horrible words break through my fury, slicing through the red clouds that are distorting my logic.</p><p>\u201cIt was me.\u201d</p><p>The voice is Sin\u2019s.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Jacey</p><p>We all freeze when we hear those words.</p><p>It was me.</p><p>The world stops turning as Dom spins and looks at his brother with the most heartbreaking expression of betrayal and shock on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He\u2019s incredulous. In utter shock. And so am I.</p><p>Sin nods. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know that she got pregnant, Dom\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dominic interrupts him, spitting ugly words. \u201cYou. Fucking. Worthless. Piece. Of. Shit. You\u2019ve always done anything you felt like doing... but this? This is fucking unforgivable.\u201d</p><p>Sin stands up, looking confused and still aghast.</p><p>\u201cDom, I... we... It was an accident. We were hanging out and we got drunk and it happened. We didn\u2019t tell you because we didn\u2019t want to hurt you. I didn\u2019t know she got pregnant. I didn\u2019t know that until today, until now. It meant nothing to us. It was... an accident. I thought that was all there was to it. I had no idea that... this came from it. We were just kids, Dominic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse,\u201d Dom says coldly as he walks over to him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a kid. You were nineteen. A horny, worthless fuck who fucked his brother\u2019s girlfriend. Emma and I had a life planned, Sin. And you ruined it.\u201d</p><p>Sin holds up his hand. \u201cDom, calm down. It was a long time ago. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I thought it would blow over and you\u2019d go away to college and you\u2019d never know. I\u2019m sorry. She was sorry. She cried afterward.\u201d</p><p>Dom stares at him, an empty gaze filled with ice. \u201cAnd that\u2019s supposed to make it better? What am I supposed to do with this?\u201d</p><p>Sin\u2019s eyes are filled with guilt. \u201cDom, I swear to Christ that I didn\u2019t know that I had anything at all to do with her death. I honestly thought that she\u2019d screwed around with Cris and that you couldn\u2019t forgive either of them. The dickhead in me was glad about that, that you could focus on that and never find out what I did. I put it out of my mind and tried to pretend that it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic scowls. \u201cBut it did happen. You fucked Emma. I thought all along that my best friend fucked my girlfriend, that he got her pregnant, that I forced her into an abortion. I thought I caused her to commit suicide. But all along, it was you, Sin. It was you.\u201d</p><p>Everyone pauses, everyone stops. And while it doesn\u2019t really matter now what actually happened because both Emma and the baby are dead, it matters in a million different ways.</p><p>Dominic has blamed himself for so long, carried a guilt that might not have been his to carry. It makes this whole tragic situation a thousand times worse. I turn to him.</p><p>\u201cDom,\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, his dark eyes so filled with pain, then he looks at his brother.</p> <p>\u201cIs it? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not. My fucking brother, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I start to interrupt, but Dom looks at me. \u201cI know that I\u2019m the one who insisted that she get an abortion. I know that. But that\u2019s when I thought she cheated with Cris. I thought that I could forgive her. But if I\u2019d known that it was Sin, I couldn\u2019t have gotten past it. If I\u2019d known, I would\u2019ve walked away. Because there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve forgiven that.\u201d</p><p>Cris stares at us, his face pale and bloody.</p><p>\u201cYou thought that Emma said my name at the end because there was something between us. But she was saying my name because she wanted me to tell you the truth. She couldn\u2019t do it herself and she wanted you to know. I\u2019ve always loved you and Sin like brothers, Dom. I don\u2019t want to drive a wedge between you.\u201d \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the one who drove the wedge between us,\u201d Dominic spits angrily, turning his back on Cris. \u201cMy brother did that for himself.\u201d</p><p>He takes a step, then clocks Sin squarely on the mouth. Sin falls back, stumbling onto the floor from the force of the blow. Blood streams from his mouth as he looks up at his brother.</p> <p>\u201cDominic. I love you. I never wanted to hurt you. It happened and it shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Dom looks down at his brother. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. It shouldn\u2019t have. But it did.\u201d</p><p>And then he walks away, leaving us all staring at each other.</p><p>I start to go after him, but Sin grabs my arm. \u201cYou might want to give him a little space right now. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cTrust you? Trust the guy who couldn\u2019t keep his dick in his pants?\u201d</p><p>Sin looks wounded, and I look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you were just a kid too. This is all just so... tragic and terrible. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to help Dominic. He was crushed by this before he knew the truth. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll reach him now. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Sin hands me a bottle of whiskey and I take a long drink, relaxing when the warmth spreads to my belly.</p> <p>\u201cTell me this,\u201d he asks, his eyes urgent. \u201cDo you believe me that I didn\u2019t mean to do it? That I didn\u2019t mean to hurt Dominic?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, at the gorgeous rocker that the world adores, shaking as he stands in front of me, awaiting my judgment. The world should see him now, I think.</p><p>\u201cI do believe that you didn\u2019t want to hurt him,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cYou were only a kid too. What were you, nineteen? It was a mistake. Unfortunately, the situation is more tragic than it would\u2019ve been because Emma died. Because everything is so fucked up, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to fix it with Dom.\u201d</p><p>I hand the bottle back to Sin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need this more than me. I need to go after Dom.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to fix him or what I\u2019ll say to him to make it better; all I know is that I have to try.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s running,\u201d Sin says raggedly. \u201cGive him some time to calm down and then meet him at his house. I know that\u2019s where he\u2019s going. You can take my jet.\u201d</p><p>I stand in front of Dominic\u2019s door uncertainly. The flight to California had taken a few hours, and each of those hours was excruciating because I couldn\u2019t reach Dominic.</p><p>But I know he\u2019s here.</p><p>I know in my heart that he retreated here to his quiet hideaway. I know it because Sin called and asked the private hangar if Dom\u2019s jet had been used and where it was going. They had confirmed that he was flying home, just as Sin had suspected. Also, Dom\u2019s Porsche is sitting in front of the house and the hood is warm.</p><p>He\u2019s here.</p><p>But he\u2019s not answering the door. Fortunately, when I turn the handle, the door swings wide open. It\u2019s not locked.</p><p>\u201cDominic!\u201d I call out as I walk in. My heels click on the tiled floors. There\u2019s no answer. I walk through, glancing outside to see if he\u2019s there, but he\u2019s not. I walk through the living room, through the dining room, through all of the rooms on the main floor.</p><p>When I approach the stairs, I hear something from upstairs.</p><p>Step by step, I get closer to the noise, to the talking.</p><p>It\u2019s a woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>The breath dies on my lips as I hear her words, over and over as Dom pauses the DVD, rewinds it, then replays it.</p><p>I love you, Dom. Don\u2019t hate me.</p><p>I love you, Dom. Don\u2019t hate me.</p><p>I love you, Dom. Don\u2019t hate me.</p><p>I step hesitantly into his bedroom to find him sitting on an ottoman in front of the TV, staring at the screen. The DVD player is on, and the envelope from Emma is open now, lying in torn pieces next to him.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s face is closed, drawn, cold.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look up at me, but he knows I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cI did, you know. I hated her. For years, I\u2019ve loved her and hated her. But since she was gone, I focused that hate on Cris. I never, in a million years, would have thought I should be focusing on Sin. I hate her, Jacey. She knew she was going to kill herself. She planned it out and recorded this fucking DVD as an apology. Then she left it for me in my car. I didn\u2019t find it until the day after she died. I\u2019ve never opened the envelope because I didn\u2019t want to know what she had to say.\u201d</p><p>His voice is icy cold, as cold as he believes his heart to be. It breaks mine.</p><p>\u201cDom,\u201d I start out, rushing to him. I drop to my knees in front of him, grabbing his hands. He lets me hold them, but he doesn\u2019t grip mine. His are as cold as his voice.</p><p>\u201cDom, it\u2019s okay to hate her. I know that part of you does. But the other part loves her, and that\u2019s okay, too. This is a fucked-up situation. It really is. And it\u2019s a situation that you\u2019ve carried on your back for years. There\u2019s no wonder that you feel so fucked up.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, his eyes so dark. \u201cIs this supposed to help?\u201d</p><p>I ignore the icy tone. \u201cI think part of what made it so terrible is that it was all a secret. You felt you couldn\u2019t talk about it. But now it\u2019s all out in the light where everyone can see. In order to get past something, you have to confront it. And it will be so much easier now that you can see what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see it,\u201d Dominic says limply, turning off the TV. Emma\u2019s face disappears, a black screen remaining where she had been. \u201cI want to forget that any of it ever happened. I don\u2019t even want to look at Sin. It\u2019ll be a long time before I can do that.\u201d</p><p>My heart hurts as I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI understand, \u201cI tell him. \u201cThe natural reaction would be to bury it and try not to think about it. But I don\u2019t know that\u2019s the healthiest thing do to, or even if it\u2019ll be possible. And Dom. Just so you know, Sin is gutted over this. He was just a kid, like you, and he never realized the ramifications of his actions.\u201d</p><p>Dominic closes his eyes. \u201cPlease, just don\u2019t talk about Sin with me. I\u2019m pissed at the entire world right now, Jacey. I\u2019m not sure that you should be here with me. I should probably be alone. I\u2019m not fit company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be surprised if you were,\u201d I tell him honestly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m not leaving you alone. I\u2019ll go downstairs and hang out by myself. And if you want to talk to someone\u2014even if you want to vent and yell, come get me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic nods slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou exist,\u201d I tell him honestly. \u201cYou exist and I love you. All of you. All of the monsters and the hate and the ugliness. And the goodness and the honesty and person that I know you are deep down.\u201d</p><p>Dominic closes his eyes and I slip from the room.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I sit for quite some time, but eventually the room closes in on me, dark and silent. The walls cave in and I swing at them, punching a hole into the drywall. But it\u2019s not enough. I glance into the mirror and hate how destroyed I look, so I pick up a heavy stone vase and throw it into the mirror. It all shatters onto the floor.</p><p>Within a minute, Jacey appears in the door, hesitant and beautiful. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asks as she stares at the broken glass.</p><p>I stare at her, hard.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step toward me, but I stop her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell her. \u201cDon\u2019t come in. It\u2019s ugly in here, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help,\u201d she says softly. \u201cTell me how to help, Dom.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, staring at her. All of the feelings that I\u2019ve suppressed so long\u2014combined with the new ones that I have over Sin\u2019s betrayal\u2014come bubbling to the surface, and I feel consumed by them. Consumed by the ugliness.</p><p>\u201cYou want to help?\u201d I ask between my teeth, taking a step toward her. \u201cFine. Come help, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t see her. Not really. I see her blond hair, her goodness, her innocence, and my pain. I see a lot of my pain. And my pain fuels my anger.</p><p>Jacey willingly steps into the room, right up to me.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d she says quietly, like she knows what I want to do. Like she knows what I need to do to get rid of this godforsaken pain.</p><p>I grab her arms, hard, shoving her onto the bed as I hover over her. \u201cI\u2019ve told you not to be with me,\u201d I snarl. \u201cI told you. I warned you. You should\u2019ve listened.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me, unafraid, as I wrap my fist in the hair at her neck, pulling her to me to kiss her ferociously. There\u2019s nothing tender in my kiss. There\u2019s ugliness there. Roughness. Hatred and pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kisses me back, angrily, her teeth scraping against mine.</p><p>\u201cFine. You need me to vent? Vent to me, Dom. Go ahead. Do it. Vent in me if you need to. I can take it.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes hold a challenge, and suddenly she\u2019s angry too.</p><p>\u201cYou use this darkness, this roughness as a mask, Dom,\u201d she tells me, her brown eyes snapping. \u201cFor years, you\u2019ve lingered on the edge of taboo, doing things that most people don\u2019t because that\u2019s what you think you deserve. You confused it for being something you actually like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I like it,\u201d I tell her firmly, pulling her to me roughly and nipping at her neck. There\u2019s a red mark where my teeth were. \u201cMake no mistake about that. I like being rough. I like the pain, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I pick her up and shove her against the wall, thrusting my hips into hers as I pin here there, staring into her eyes. \u201cTrust me, I do it because I want to. Not because I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>I lift her thighs and slam her into the wall again, not too hard, but hard enough to prove my point. My dick is rock hard now, fueled by anger and the feeling of her pussy pressed against it.</p><p>\u201cYou like the pain because it takes your mind off of what really hurts, Dominic,\u201d Jacey says softly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you like.\u201d</p><p>But she kisses me, and her mouth is soft and sweet and it tightens my groin, against my better judgment, against any good that\u2019s left in me.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be with me right now,\u201d I warn her. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>Jacey looks me in the eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I want to do,\u201d she commands softly. \u201cIf you can dish it, I can take it.\u201d</p><p>Fumbling with my jeans, I pull my dick out, shove her skirt up, and thrust into her hard, with no preamble, no foreplay. Her eyes widen, but she takes it without a whimper or a sigh.</p><p>Pinning her against the wall, I hold her wrists above her head with one hand, squeezing them hard.</p><p>\u201cStill want to take it?\u201d I growl into her mouth.</p> <p>She nods, her eyes surprisingly glazed over... with lust. \u201cFuck me,\u201d she says breathlessly as I thrust into her over and over. \u201cI can take it. I want to take it.\u201d</p><p>So I do.</p><p>I fuck her hard, I fuck her into the wall, grinding her back into it, an outlet for my ugliness. But as I open my eyes finally, hers are staring into mine.</p><p>And they\u2019re brown. Not blue.</p><p>She\u2019s Jacey, not Emma.</p><p>And all the rage that I\u2019m feeling, it\u2019s not directed at her. The pain that I\u2019m feeling... it\u2019s not because of her.</p><p>I freeze as the revelation occurs to me. As I realize that she was right. I like pain because it\u2019s an outlet for what I really feel. It\u2019s a vent. And I\u2019m not venting into Jacey.</p><p>Sliding Jacey off the wall, I carry her to the bed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper to her urgently as I use my knee to open her legs. She lets them fall easily open, and I slide into her, gently this time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes and pulls me to her, letting my head rest in the crook of her shoulder. The energy of the room has changed from frenetic to soft, from rough to gentle.</p><p>I come softly, silently, straining into her, holding her to me.</p><p>I destroy everyone I touch.</p><p>I can\u2019t destroy her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Jacey</p><p>Dominic might not want to admit it, but I felt his heart break with every movement.</p><p>I\u2019m quiet as I lie staring at him, and it\u2019s a long time before he opens his eyes. When he does, there\u2019s guilt in them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says simply. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jacey. I was... angry. At the world, at Sin, at Emma, at you for being right. You were right. I get off on watching people have sex because I can do it without getting involved. I like sexual pain because it distracts me from what really causes me pain. And that\u2019s not you. You don\u2019t cause me pain. I have no right to hold you accountable for something you didn\u2019t do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>My heart squeezes. \u201cI know,\u201d I tell him softly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And I do. I know what it\u2019s like to be so overwhelmed by emotion that you can\u2019t even think straight. I felt the same way the day Jared turned my world upside down.</p><p>I curl into Dominic\u2019s side and he holds me there, clutched to him.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think she is?\u201d he muses aloud after a while, staring out the window. \u201cI worry about that sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I stroke his arm and I know he\u2019s talking about Emma.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve wondered that about the people I love. I like to think that they\u2019re in a better place. That they\u2019re somewhere where tears and pain don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019re in a better place than we are,\u201d Dominic says tiredly.</p><p>\u201cWe can hope,\u201d I answer. \u201cDeath is going to come to us all, Dom. It\u2019s up to us how we handle it. It\u2019s hard, I know.\u201d</p><p>He remains silent, and I grab his hand. He lets me, but I can see his heart\u2019s not in it. His fingers are cold, his eyes are blank.</p><p>After a few more minutes I turn to him, desperate to make him understand that there\u2019s hope. After having such angry sex, I thought he might feel somewhat better, that it had been an outlet for his rage. And it had been.</p><p>But now he only seems hopeless.</p><p>\u201cDominic, I know you\u2019re pissed at the world. But we\u2019ll get past this. You\u2019ll see that you can trust the people you love. Sometimes they make bad decisions, but we all do. It\u2019s human nature. We\u2019ll get past this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCris knew this the whole fucking time,\u201d Dom answers, staring at me with a black stare. \u201cHe could\u2019ve told me years ago. Even though I didn\u2019t want to talk to him, he could\u2019ve figured out a way.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know. He didn\u2019t handle it well. But he feels terrible too. He didn\u2019t know what to do. And he handled it badly. Just like you did. He loved you and Sin both so much that he sacrificed his relationship with you to save your relationship with Sin. I think that says a lot. And if it makes you feel any better, he and Fiona broke up. She was pissed that he didn\u2019t tell someone.\u201d</p><p>Dominic nods, turning to face the window, turning away from me. I have a feeling that the emotions of the day are just too overwhelming for him to take right now.</p><p>I understand how that feels. I feel the same way.</p><p>I wrap my arms around him and press my face to his back, letting my weary eyes close as the weight of the world seems to rest on my eyelids.</p><p>The silence grows and grows, until eventually Dominic falls asleep. I stay with him for the longest time, holding him tightly. If anyone deserves the oblivion that sleeps brings, he does.</p><p>He only wakes once, after I have Chinese delivered. He stays awake long enough to eat with me and then he suggests that I sleep in the guest room so that I can get some rest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be tossing and turning,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been patient enough with me today. You deserve a break.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want a break, but I don\u2019t argue.</p><p>Dominic slips back into the darkened master suite and I close the door to the guest room. If he wants to be alone, I\u2019ll let him be alone.</p><p>Whatever it takes for him to process this.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>Dominic</p><p>I try to sleep alone.</p><p>But strangely, after years of seeking out solitude, it\u2019s the last thing I want now.</p><p>And I don\u2019t just want anyone... I want Jacey.</p><p>I look at the clock. Two seventeen A.M. I squeeze my tired eyes closed, then open them again, throwing the covers back as I get out of bed. I pad down to Jacey\u2019s room.</p><p>She\u2019s sleeping peacefully, her hand curled under her chin. Her eyelids flutter when I climb in beside her, and she turns into me when I wrap my arms around her.</p><p>Her warmth envelops me, soaking into the cold that has surrounded me for so long.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so good to me,\u201d I whisper to her. For the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out why she would be. I haven\u2019t done anything to deserve it.</p><p>She sighs sleepily, not answering. Her hands flutter across my chest and down to my waist. It\u2019s answer enough, and just like that, because of the brush of her fingertips, I want her.</p><p>She lifts her hips and I pull off her underwear. Her mouth meets mine sleepily, hotly. And I slip into her.</p><p>Her warmth surrounds me and I groan, throwing my head back and losing myself in the sensations... in her.</p><p>I feel her hands on my back, her fingernails. I hear her moans, her breath. I feel the world exploding, then I fall limply onto her, rolling over so I don\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Then we sleep.</p><p>When I wake, sunshine is pouring into the bedroom, and I blearily look around, trying to see what woke me. My phone buzzes again.</p><p>My phone.</p><p>I pick it up and focus on it, finding a text from Sin.</p><p>You\u2019re my brother and there\u2019s nothing more important than that. I love you. I\u2019ll love you forever. I\u2019m sorry I fucked up.</p><p>I put the phone back down and close my eyes.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Jacey</p><p>I get off the phone with Joe, smiling as I think about how badass he always tries to act, but how soft his heart actually is.</p><p>I\u2019d explained the situation, in very vague terms, and said that we wouldn\u2019t be back to work until Monday. He was perfectly fine with that. We won\u2019t be in trouble. That\u2019s a relief, because that\u2019s the last thing we need on top of everything else.</p><p>I tiptoe back into the bedroom and stare at Dom.</p><p>In sleep, he\u2019s peaceful. Nothing can hurt him when he sleeps, and that\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve let him sleep for two straight days. It\u2019s almost as if his body needed it to absorb the emotional shock that it\u2019s undergone the last few days.</p><p>At night, I climb into bed and he wraps his arms around me, holding me close. During the day I get up, but I check in on him from time to time. He\u2019s woken up a couple of times for water, but nothing else.</p><p>As I stand over him, I feel the intense need to protect him from anything else that might hurt him.</p><p>That\u2019s why when Sin shows up on the doorstep a couple hours later, I\u2019m hesitant to let him in.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re sorry,\u201d I tell him hesitantly. \u201cI know. But he\u2019s messed up, Sin. He\u2019s been sleeping for two days. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in a place where he\u2019s ready to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Sin stares at me with his doleful rocker stare. \u201cYou know, I was right when I told you that you were good for Dominic. Wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cYeah. And if it were up to me, I\u2019d invite you in and you could talk to Dom. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Dominic\u2019s voice comes from behind me. \u201cLet him in.\u201d</p><p>I turn around to find Dom sitting on the bottom step, staring at his brother. His hair is mussed, but other than that, you\u2019d never guess he\u2019d just slept for two days.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask softly. He glances at me, and there\u2019s something so potent in his eyes... something powerful and shining.</p><p>He loves me. He hasn\u2019t said it, but I know it\u2019s true. I swallow as he nods.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, babe.\u201d He glances at his brother. \u201cI ignored your texts for a reason, Sin. I didn\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sin swallows, then nods. \u201cI figured. But I take no for an answer as well as you do. Dom, this shit happened six years ago. Think of everything that happened over the past six years. Now think of who has been with you that whole time. Me. I swear on my life that I will never fuck up like that again.\u201d</p><p>Dom sighs, rubbing his face, then looking up at his brother. \u201cI know. I know, Sin.\u201d</p><p>I exhale the breath I\u2019d been holding, and Sin stares at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p> <p>Dom nods. \u201cYeah. I know. I\u2019m still pissed at you, but I know.\u201d</p><p>Sin stares at him hesitantly. \u201cWhen you say you know, what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Dominic sighs. \u201cI know that it was one night. You were both drunk and she wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. You were nineteen and you were thinking with your cock. You didn\u2019t know she got pregnant. You didn\u2019t know that I made her get an abortion. You didn\u2019t know any of it. It was a huge, fucked-up mess, but I can\u2019t dwell on it any longer. I\u2019ll get over it. I\u2019m not over it yet, but I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d Sin sounds hopeful, yet nervous. Dom nods.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Eventually. I can\u2019t believe you fucking did it, but I\u2019ll try to get over it. We\u2019re brothers, and I know you\u2019d never do it now. Right?\u201d</p> <p>Sin immediately shakes his head. \u201cFuck no. I\u2019ve grown up, Dom. I would never try to take what\u2019s yours. I didn\u2019t try to take what was yours then, I was just too young and stupid to rein in my hormones. I won\u2019t make that same mistake twice.\u201d</p><p>Sin lifts Dom to his feet and pulls him into a hug. He practically clings to Dom as he murmurs into Dom\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, dude. I swear to Christ I didn\u2019t know that I was to blame for fucking you up. I swear to Christ. If I knew, I would\u2019ve told you long ago.\u201d</p><p>Dom doesn\u2019t respond for a minute, but then wraps his arms around his brother, hugging him back. He\u2019s reluctant, but it\u2019s still a hug. It\u2019s something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man,\u201d Sin tells him again, and I can honestly hear the sadness in his voice. \u201cYou know I loved Emma... but not like that. That night was just a mistake. Neither of us meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dominic nods. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>I can see from his face that he means it. He does know. And that\u2019s a far cry from the Dominic that I saw two days ago. As we wind our way out to the veranda, I turn to him.</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been some sleep you had.\u201d</p><p>He smiles ever so slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve slept a full night since Emma died. So, yeah. It was pretty good. I\u2019m thinking more clearly now.\u201d</p><p>Sin stops and turns to Dom, his dark blue eyes unsure. \u201cDom. I didn\u2019t come alone. Cris is in the car. He\u2019s in a bad way. Can you talk to him?\u201d</p><p>I freeze, watching Dom. He knows that Cris was trying to protect his relationship with Sin, but knowing it and knowing it are two different things, because he also knows that Cris could\u2019ve spoken up years ago.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dom sighs. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to someday. It might as well be now.\u201d</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief as Sin and I watch him duck around the side of the house and head out to the car. In a minute, we see them through the windows of the house, sitting at the kitchen table and talking earnestly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re okay?\u201d I ask Sin nervously. He eyes them, glancing at the way they\u2019re angled toward each other, still talking.</p> <p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no blood yet, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cOh, that\u2019s helpful.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re in there for what seems like forever, and when they come out, they\u2019re both quiet.</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something,\u201d Dom says to me, his voice serious and dark. \u201cWe all have to do something so that we get closure. But to do it, we need to go home.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re on the jet within an hour.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>Dominic</p><p>The faces staring back at me from around my parents\u2019 dining room table are covered in a myriad of emotions. Sadness, anger, confusion, grief, guilt.</p><p>My parents, Fiona, Duncan, Cris, Emma\u2019s parents, and, of course, Sin and Jacey are all here so we can discuss what happened to Emma. What I did, what Emma did, what Emma and Sin did. It\u2019s not an easy conversation, but it\u2019s one that needs to be had.</p><p>What Jacey said once about Emma\u2019s parents\u2019 needing closure was true. While they hated to hear what happened with Sin, with me, with their daughter getting an abortion, they at least know now.</p><p>They have a reason for the suicide, something that makes sense.</p><p>\u201cSo you can blame me,\u201d I finally tell them quietly. \u201cEmma and Sin slipped up, but they were kids. I\u2019m the one who pushed her to get an abortion. The blame rests on my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Brandt grips his own hands tightly, so tight that his fingers turn white. But he doesn\u2019t say anything. He just stares at the table.</p><p>Mrs. Brandt looks at me with Emma\u2019s bright blue eyes, and they\u2019re filled with tears. I fight the urge to look away, but I don\u2019t. I expect to see hate in them, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDominic, it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s a tragedy and you just have to let it go. You do.\u201d</p><p>A lump forms in my throat for the millionth time this month, and I swallow hard against it. \u201cWe just thought you should know,\u201d I tell her quietly. \u201cThe truth is always necessary for real closure. A smart person told me that once.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze Jacey\u2019s hand under the table.</p><p>Everyone talks to each other quietly, and while it\u2019s uncomfortable, a part of me is relieved. Jacey was right. Getting things into the light makes it easier to deal with them. I tune out everyone\u2019s low voices and stare out the window.</p><p>Down by the pond the tree house hangs, faded and old. My heart constricts just looking at it, thinking of all the time Emma and I spent in it. And of what she and Sin had done in it. I swallow hard and glance up to find my father looking at me.</p><p>\u201cDom, come with me for a minute. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I follow him out of the house, out to the barn, and stare at him in confusion as he hands me a large mallet.</p><p>\u201cYou want to show me a mallet?\u201d I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDid you say that Sin and Emma... that they were together in the old tree house?\u201d my dad asks quietly. I nod.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good that Sin apologized. And you and I both know that he never meant to hurt you like he did. That\u2019s well and good too. But as long as it\u2019s standing, it\u2019s gonna remind you of what happened. It\u2019s gonna remind you of all kinds of ugliness. Go tear it down, son. Tear it all down and you\u2019ll never have to look at it again.\u201d</p><p>He hands me the mallet. I stare at him, the heavy mallet in my hands, and I know he\u2019s right. Tearing that old thing down is going to feel good.</p><p>I head down to the pond and climb the old rickety ladder on the side of the tree. With my first swing, I smash a hole in the roof. After three more swings, the roof caves completely in. The walls follow. Then the floor.</p><p>By this time, my shoulders are on fire, my biceps ache. But I don\u2019t stop swinging. Because my dad was right. I\u2019m not just tearing down a tree house. I\u2019m tearing a memory down. I don\u2019t stop until it\u2019s splintered into a million pieces and I\u2019ve even torn the ladder off the tree trunk.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, it\u2019s all gone.</p><p>Every board, every bad memory is lying in a splintered pile in front of me. I\u2019ll never have to look at it again.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how it makes me feel better, but it does. With the tree house gone, the memory can start to fade too. I won\u2019t pretend that it didn\u2019t happen, but at least it won\u2019t be so potent, so vivid. It won\u2019t have the same power over me.</p><p>I turn to head back to the house and find Jacey sitting on the edge of the pond, her legs tucked under her. She\u2019s watching me, concerned.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks when I draw nearer. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah. For the first time in a long time, I can say that I am... after I do one more thing.\u201d I pull her up and drag her with me to the barn.</p><p>The old Nova is in the back corner, covered with a tarp. I pull off the tarp and stare at it. It\u2019s got a few more scratches now than it used to, and there\u2019s a crack in the windshield, but just looking at it brings back a thousand memories.</p><p>\u201cI lost my virginity in this car,\u201d I tell Jacey. \u201cAnd Emma and I had our first kiss in it. Is that too much information?\u201d</p><p>Jacey looks slightly pained, but shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cShe and I went on a million dates in this thing. It\u2019s what I rode to her house in that night... that last night. My dad had to replace the floor mats because my shoes tracked so much blood into it. To be honest, I can\u2019t look at it anymore. Come with me?\u201d</p><p>Jacey doesn\u2019t even ask where, she just nods and climbs into the dusty passenger seat.</p><p>I turn the key, and miraculously the battery is charged enough to start. \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d floats from the radio, the familiar words filling my ears.</p><p>\u201cI must\u2019ve heard this song a million times,\u201d I tell Jacey as I steer the old car down to the pond. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the edge of the water, I pull Emma\u2019s pendant from my pocket, the stone cool between my fingers.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I picture her wearing it, how it used to lay just right on her chest. How it was the exact shade of her eyes.</p><p>I open my eyes and hang it on the rearview mirror.</p><p>And then I shift the car into neutral.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me push?\u201d I look at Jacey and her eyes widen in surprise, but she nods.</p><p>Together we push the old car filled with my memories into the lake.</p><p>It seems fitting. We stand and watch as the car sinks, bubbles erupting around it until it\u2019s no longer visible. In my head, I imagine it sinking to the very bottom, where it will stay forever.</p><p>Jacey looks at me. \u201cWill your dad be mad? That was a classic.\u201d</p><p>I smile, just a little. \u201cNah. I\u2019ll buy him another one. One that has a working tape deck.\u201d</p><p>Even though the old car is gone, sunken in the water, I swear I can still hear that song. Do you remember when, we used to sing... sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da...</p><p>Glancing over my shoulder, the pond seems quietly eerie, the last of the bubbles forming in the middle, the only evidence that it is the watery grave for my memories.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Emma,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>Jacey squeezes my hand and we walk for the house. As we wind along the old path, I pause, staring into Jacey\u2019s brown eyes, eyes that contain such warmth and goodness.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I murmur to her, finally able to say the words. \u201cI think I\u2019ve known that for a while. I\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s taken so long for me to say it. I love you so fucking much.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, a radiant white smile.</p><p>\u201cAll that matters is that you\u2019re saying it now,\u201d she says gently. \u201cI love you too. I love you to the moon and back. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I do.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that even though Emma was such a big part of my past, you are my future. You are my present. You\u2019re everything, Jacey. I need you to know that. I love you more than anything, more than life itself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispers softly, and I can see from her gentle expression that she does.</p><p>I pull her to me and kiss her, thorough and sweet and with just a hint of wild. It\u2019s the way she deserves to be kissed... it\u2019s everything she is. Sweet, with just a hint of wild.</p><p>There\u2019s no ugliness here.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p> <p>Jacey</p><p>One Month Later</p><p>My brother\u2019s excited voice echoes into my ear loudly, and I hold the phone just a little bit away from my head.</p><p>\u201cElijah Gabriel Vincent. He\u2019s eight pounds and three ounces and he\u2019s beautiful, Jacey. He\u2019s so fucking beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I smile and congratulate my big brother, so happy to hear him so happy. There was a time when I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see the day. But here it is. And he so deserves it.</p> <p>\u201cBrand just happened to be here for a meeting when Maddy\u2019s water broke. You should\u2019ve seen his face,\u201d Gabe crows. \u201cOh my god. It was priceless. I thought he might pass out.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI can imagine. Please tell him hello for me. I miss him. I haven\u2019t seen him in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sobers up. \u201cYou can tell him yourself. He\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>Before I can say anything, Gabe hands the phone to Brand and Brand sighs into it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacey.\u201d</p><p>My heart squeezes. I hurt him. I hurt the most amazingly gentle badass on the planet.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Brand,\u201d I say brightly, forcing enthusiasm. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve now seen amniotic fluid on the floor. I can cross that off my bucket list. And after hearing Maddy scream during labor, I don\u2019t know how you women do it.\u201d</p><p>I can practically see him shudder and I smile, imagining that he sat right outside of her delivery room, waiting to hear that everything was all right.</p><p>\u201cUm. I\u2019m sorry, Brand. For everything,\u201d I say tentatively. Sorry is all I can think of to say. It\u2019s what I feel... I just don\u2019t know how to express it to him enough.</p><p>He sighs again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t think anything else about it. This is my issue, not yours. I\u2019ll get past it and things will be like they were, okay?\u201d</p><p>He sounds tired and sad and I hate it. But I know him and I know he doesn\u2019t want to dwell on it. So I nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I want you to know that I love you. Not like you want me to love you, but I still love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll talk to you later, Jace.\u201d</p><p>He hands the phone back to my brother, leaving my heart clenched in my chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay, Jacey,\u201d my brother tells me quietly. \u201cJust so you know. So don\u2019t worry about him. I think he always knew that you and he weren\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know. But it still hurts me that I hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Gabe insists. \u201cMaddy\u2019s gonna work on setting him up with some of her friends. Trust me, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will be,\u201d I agree. \u201cHe\u2019s strong. He\u2019s survived far worse things than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right, kiddo. When are you coming to see your nephew? How\u2019s the new job? What are they calling their new restaurant chain?\u201d</p><p>I think back to the day a couple of weeks ago when Dom, Duncan, and Sin argued over a name for the new restaurant chain that they\u2019re launching together. They\u2019d bickered for hours until I chimed into the conversation.</p><p>How about The Dirty Dog? Because that\u2019s what you three are. Dirty fucking dogs. Perverted as hell.</p><p>They\u2019d stared at me in shock, then had a toast to the name, because they knew that it fit them like a glove. And then Sin had asked me to come work for them on their business development team, since I have \u201crestaurant experience.\u201d</p><p>Since I\u2019ll have my business degree finished up in a couple of weeks, it made sense, so I accepted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s The Dirty Dog. We\u2019re going to sell seafood and craft beer. I\u2019ve actually already started part-time, since I quit Saffron, but I\u2019ll be starting full time in a couple of weeks when I officially finish my business degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Jacey,\u201d Gabriel tells me happily. \u201cYou\u2019ve really pulled your shit together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answer. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry that I gave you so much trouble along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he replies with a chuckle. \u201cLike Brand, I\u2019ve been through far worse than you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve gotta go. I\u2019ll try to get up there in a couple of weeks. Give that baby a kiss for me and send me pics, okay? And tell Maddy that I love her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel agrees and we hang up.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, babe?\u201d</p><p>I turn to find Dominic lounging in the doorway. Like always, he takes my breath away. He\u2019s just that sexy. He\u2019s wearing dark slacks and a dark shirt today, dressed up to go to the ribbon-cutting of the newly renovated Joe\u2019s Gladiators.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He leads me through my little house to his car, where he opens the door for me. When he gets in, I glance at my home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss this little place, Dom. Are you sure you want to buy a fancy condo for when we\u2019re here in Chicago? We could just stay here. It wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Dom glances at it. \u201cUm. There\u2019s no garage for my car.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWhatever. Fine. We can get a fancy condo. You\u2019re spoiled, though.\u201d</p><p>He throws his head back and laughs. \u201cReally? Coming from the woman who just bought four new sets of sheets for absolutely no reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge. Good sheets are essential.\u201d I stick my nose in the air and he leans over to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, babe,\u201d he adds. \u201cI want to spoil you.\u201d</p><p>We pull up to Joe\u2019s a few minutes later, and I barely recognize the place. The building has been completely renovated, inside and out. A state-of-the-art gym with all new equipment and offices, an after-school meal program, and even a running track out back.</p><p>They\u2019ve been waiting on us to arrive, so when we approach they hand Dominic the giant scissors to snip the red velvet ribbon across the door.</p><p>\u201cOn behalf of the Emma Brandt Foundation, we are pleased to present you with the reopening of Joe\u2019s Gladiator\u2019s!\u201d Dominic announces. Flashbulbs pop, and for once Dom isn\u2019t bothered by his picture being taken.</p><p>He shakes Joe\u2019s hand, and Joe looks pleased as he can be by the big turnout. I know that in large part, the press showed up because of Dominic, but regardless. They\u2019re here, and any attention we can get for the underprivileged kids is worth it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did your foundation choose this particular project, Dominic?\u201d one of the reporters calls out.</p><p>Dominic smiles. Jake waves to the cameras off to the side and everyone laughs.</p><p>\u201cWe chose this project because there was a need. There are good kids here, and all they need is a chance. Sometimes, bad things happen, unfair things... and all we can do is handle it the best we can. Most of the time, with a little help, we come through it just fine. A smart person once told me, \u2018Before we fall, we fly.\u2019 We just wanted to help these kids fly.\u201d</p><p>Everyone applauds, and I\u2019m so proud of Dominic I could burst.</p><p>We head into the reception where we chat with the boys, eat, and drink punch. I\u2019m utterly filled with happiness when we finally walk out to our car.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind that we named the foundation after Emma?\u201d Dom asks as we climb inside. I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know me better than that. I think it was the only thing to do. She never had a chance to live her dream. We\u2019ve got to give other kids the chance to live theirs.\u201d</p><p>Dominic fires the engine up, then turns to me. \u201cYou know what I love? How you always say we. You never say I. Or you. It\u2019s always we.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think. In my head, we\u2019re a team. We\u2019re always going to be we, Dom. Get used to it.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me, long and thoroughly. When he pulls away, I\u2019m breathless.</p><p>\u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d he announces. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it. I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love surprises,\u201d I tell him, even though he knows that already. \u201cDon\u2019t give me any hints. I want to be really surprised.\u201d</p><p>I have to admit, I\u2019m completely stumped as we drive toward the country, out of the city. But then we approach Palos Park, his childhood home.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Castle Kinkaide?\u201d I ask in confusion. He smirks, but doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>When we pull up to his parents\u2019 house, there\u2019s a red, yellow, and black hot air balloon set up on their lawn. It\u2019s huge and majestic as it billows against the sky.</p><p>\u201cYour chariot, my lady,\u201d Dom bows low.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cLord. Is this what I\u2019ve got to look forward to all during filming? I know you like to get into character, but you realize that you\u2019re not really a knight, right?\u201d</p><p>Dom\u2019s been rehearsing for a sixteenth-century period movie, and it\u2019s made life interesting, to say the least. I fully intend to see him in a suit of armor around the house soon.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cCan you just go with it?\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cFine. Yes, my squire. I\u2019d love a ride in your fine chariot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSquire?\u201d Dom\u2019s the one rolling his eyes now. \u201cTry sir. I\u2019m a knight, Jace.\u201d</p><p>But he takes my hand and helps me into the balloon, introducing me to the pilot. Within minutes, we\u2019re floating up and above Palos Park, above Chicago. The city is amazing from up here, with the evening sun reflecting off all of the glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking.\u201d I breathe, looking down. \u201cThank you, Dom. But what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>Dominic turns to me, his dark gaze serious. It\u2019s a gaze that causes butterflies to flutter in my chest.</p><p>\u201cJacey, before I met you, I thought all I deserved was the darkness in life. The dark corners, the taboo, the unspeakable. But you\u2019ve given me a new start. A fresh life. A new outlook. I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve you, but I\u2019ll be forever grateful that you saw potential in me. That you saw what no one else did. You looked past the asshole, past the actor, past the name. You saw me. I love you for that. I love you for always grounding me, always reminding me of what\u2019s important. I love you for always being my breath of fresh air, the challenge to my question.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and my heart pounds in my chest.</p><p>Is he...? Is this...?</p><p>And then Dominic bends down, on one knee.</p><p>It is.</p><p>OHMYGOD.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d he begins, in an exaggerated English accent, the one he\u2019s been working on for a week. \u201cI have but one question to ask of you. One favor that I wish for you to bestow, if but only you desire.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, laughter in my eyes and the utmost of happiness in my heart.</p><p>\u201cYes, good knight. Anything you wish to ask.\u201d</p><p>Dom looks at me, his eyes smoldering, and he drops the accent.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me? Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>He holds out a ring, a gorgeous princess cut diamond, and I feel like swooning. It\u2019s the most gorgeous thing I\u2019ve ever seen, held by the sexiest man in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look up at him, losing myself in his dark, dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He breathes in sharply. \u201cYes? You\u2019re sure you want me? You know all of my monsters, Jace. You want me anyway?\u201d</p><p>I nod, choking up. \u201cI want you because of your monsters,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThey\u2019ve made you who you are, and I can\u2019t imagine loving you any more than I do. I\u2019ll want you every day of my life. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic smiles a gentle smile as he slips the ring onto my finger and pulls me into his side. He kisses me slowly and gently before he wraps his arm around my shoulders, and we watch the city passing beneath us.</p><p>As we watch it, I think of everything that\u2019s happened... to both of us. We\u2019re both messed up in our own ways, but we\u2019re both overcoming it. It\u2019s a process, but we\u2019re doing it. Everything that\u2019s happened has made us stronger, individually and together.</p><p>Looking up at Dominic, I brush my fingers along his cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy? Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>Dominic looks down at me and I see a million promises in his eyes, a million forevers.</p> <p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>I smile.</p><p>That\u2019s all I needed to hear.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Jacey</p><p>I race through the tropical flowers, through the plants, and over the twisted path that leads to our little rented cottage off of the most beautiful beach in Hawaii. It\u2019s the perfect place for a honeymoon, a true garden of Eden.</p> <p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d I call over my shoulder to my husband.</p><p>My husband.</p><p>The words ring through my head, and even though they sound foreign, they don\u2019t feel that way. Dominic and Jacey Kinkaide. Bound together forever. By love and by lust and by everything in between. That\u2019s what Duncan announced earlier at our ceremony on the beach. He\u2019d gotten his license to perform marriages specifically for this occasion.</p><p>Dominic catches up to me and scoops me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou thought you\u2019d walk over the threshold yourself?\u201d he asks impishly. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t our house,\u201d I start to say. But then I drop it. If the man wants to carry me, he can carry me. He scoops me up into his arms and carries me to the bed, a four-poster-covered-in-filmy-gauze bed.</p><p>Sitting me down, he peels me out of my dress, kissing every inch of me as he does. When he\u2019s done, by the time I stand in front of him naked, I\u2019m dying for him.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d I tell him simply. \u201cFill me up, Dominic. Make me yours.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles, the smile I love, the private one... the one just for me. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been mine,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>He pushes me back onto the bed and kisses me again, his tongue so hot and wet and perfect against mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve always been yours,\u201d he adds. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it. But I know it now, and that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d</p><p>He straddles me, bending over me, owning me.</p><p>He knows just what to do to make my body sing, to crest me toward the precipice of orgasm as he slides his fingers in all the right places.</p><p>Emotion wells up in me, overwhelming and hot. Love, lust, and everything in between.</p><p>I grip Dom\u2019s shoulders, pulling him into me, closer and closer. I wrap my leg around his hip, pulling him deeper inside.</p><p>He groans, then drags his tongue along my nipples. He circles them, then sucks, driving me to the brink of madness.</p><p>I arch upward, pressing against his strong chest, and he groans again as he thrusts, the muscles in his back flexing. I call out and scratch into him, breathing in the smell of his skin as I bury my face in his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mrs. Kinkaide,\u201d he breathes as he slides in and out of me, slower now, gentle. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>I want to roll my eyes and tell him that he\u2019s so dramatic, that this isn\u2019t a movie script. But I don\u2019t. Because like always, scripted or not, his words are perfect.</p><p>I arch into him and come, the waves of my orgasm carrying me up and away, far from here. And then he throws his head back and follows me. It\u2019s a few minutes before I return to the present, before I can once again think logical thought.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I answer finally, when I can catch my breath. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>I fall asleep in his arms.</p><p>I\u2019m awakened by a sound. The world is dark outside the cottage and the gauzy curtains flutter in the breeze. I sit up and look around, only to be startled by a woman sitting in the chair next to the bed.</p><p>She\u2019s humming \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d ever so softly.</p><p>Her aquamarine eyes meet mine, and I know who she is. Oddly enough, I\u2019m not afraid.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d I whisper. She nods, her face young and beautiful in the night. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I must be.</p><p>\u201cI needed you to know something,\u201d she tells me softly, and her voice is like a song, gentle and melodic. She looks down at Dominic, her gaze full of love. \u201cI chose you for him,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>I stare at her in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember me? I met you. Years ago on Goose Beach. I was there with my mom, you were there with your grandma. You got my ice cream money back from a horrible little girl.\u201d</p><p>The hazy memory comes back, but I struggle to put the pieces together. \u201cHeather Edel. She was the meanest girl in the sixth grade. You were wearing a red swimsuit.\u201d</p><p>Emma nods.</p><p>\u201cShe terrified me, but you stood up to her like it was nothing and got my money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a seashell,\u201d I say slowly, remembering how the little girl had handed it to me and then ran off with her mom. \u201cA white one.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiles. \u201cI used to collect them.\u201d</p><p>A memory of the tiny shells in Dominic\u2019s black velvet box comes to mind and the shell on her pendant... I stare at her soundlessly, my breath lingering on my lips.</p><p>\u201cI was so in awe of you,\u201d she continues. \u201cOf how you were so brave and stood up for someone you didn\u2019t even know. It seemed like you weren\u2019t afraid of anything. You swam out to the buoy line a hundred times that day, while I was afraid to go past the sandbar. After I went home, I never saw you again. But when Dominic needed saving, I knew it had to be you. He needed someone brave and strong, so I brought you to him.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, transfixed. \u201cThis is a strange dream.\u201d</p><p>Emma laughs, a tinkling sound in the night.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to think that,\u201d she assures me. \u201cThere are some things that can\u2019t be explained, so you probably shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you \u2018bring me to Dominic\u2019?\u201d I ask doubtfully. \u201cSurely that can be explained.\u201d</p><p>She smiles patiently. \u201cWasn\u2019t it strange how drugs ended up in Dominic\u2019s car... when you both swore they weren\u2019t yours? It\u2019s almost as if they just appeared there.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d I breathe. \u201cWhy?\u201d She smiles and the room seems to glow with it.</p><p>\u201cBecause love eclipses death, Jacey. It\u2019s forever. And because I love him, I want him to be happy. I knew you could make him happy, so I brought you together the only way I knew how. I\u2019m at peace now. Tell him that. Tell him I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s moving on, that he\u2019s forgetting me. Tell him good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not forgetting you,\u201d I protest. \u201cHe\u2019ll never forget you. You\u2019re a healthy memory now, instead of a painful one. That\u2019s all. And that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and nods. \u201cI know. That\u2019s all I ever wanted. Thank you, Jacey. Thank you for saving him. I knew you would.\u201d</p><p>She trails her fingers along his leg as she walks to the door. Once she gets there, she looks back, her face luminescent in the night.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Jacey? Take care of him.\u201d</p><p>I nod, transfixed and in awe. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She walks away, humming.</p><p>Do you remember when, we used to sing... sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da... You\u2019re my... brown eyed girl.</p><p>I try to wake up, but then realize that I\u2019m not sleeping. I have no conscious recollection of waking up. Or if I was ever actually asleep. Everything\u2019s a haze. A blur. Except for the memory of Emma\u2019s striking blue eyes staring at me from two feet away.</p><p>I sit up in bed, trying to wrap my mind around it.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have... it didn\u2019t... it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>I turn to Dominic to wake him up, to share the crazy dream with him, when something catches my eye on the bedside table. Something that glistens pearly white in the light of the moon.</p><p>A seashell.</p><p>While the curtains rustle with the breeze and the ocean crashes against the beach, my heart pounds. And as the soft wind blows my hair away from my face, I hear it.</p><p>Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da...</p><p>The faint strain of \u201cBrown Eyed Girl,\u201d floating in from the water. </p> </body></html>"]
