Since Howling Moon was a low-rent dive hidden on the shadier side of Miami, a bar that catered to werewolves, wel , the lady was very much out of fucking place. And, if she wasn\u2019t careful, she might just become the night\u2019s entertainment.</p><p>Jace Vaughn tensed when he saw her. He wasn\u2019t as drunk as the other wolves, not yet anyway, so he recognized the deceptively delicate woman instantly. He could see the hint of her smal fangs peeking out just behind the plump ful ness of her too-red lips.</p><p>Vamps\u2019 fangs always came out when they were about to fight or fuck. So which one was the vamp about to do?</p> <p>She stil ed inside the doorway of the bar. Her long blond hair tumbled behind her as her gaze raked to the left. To the right. Huh. Looked like she was hunting for someone</p><p>\u2014or something. In this place, the only thing she\u2019d find was a pack ready to rip her to pieces. Vampires and wolves weren\u2019t exactly playing nice these days. Or any days.</p><p>She should know that.</p><p>But then her gaze swept by him. Swept by, then came right back. Her blue eyes</p><p>\u2014bright with a vamp\u2019s power\u2014caught his. She stared at him, and Jace found he couldn\u2019t look away. A vampire\u2019s trick of compulsion?</p> <p>Nah...more likely just his own lust. Because the lady was hot. Most female vamps were, those pureblood ones anyway. And Jace knew he was looking at one of the elite pureblood Florida vamps.</p><p>A pureblood, in a werewolf hel .</p><p>He smiled. Fate must be laughing her ass off somewhere.</p><p>Then, she smiled too. A lick of heat shot straight through his body, and the beast that he kept chained inside stretched and growled.</p><p>Want.</p><p>She started walking toward him in her high, fuck-me or fuck-off black boots. Jace shoved away from the bar.</p> <p>But the others had noticed her now, and they were closing in. Three males. Big and hulking because that was the way of the beast.</p><p>\u201cVampire...\u201d The snarl floated in the air, and the males reached for her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His roar broke a second too slowly.</p><p>Two of the males crashed into nearby tables. They\u2019d made the mistake of actual y touching her. You didn\u2019t touch a vampiress who didn\u2019t want to be touched. Fools should know that rule.</p><p>Purebloods were especial y strong.</p><p>Excitement had the beast inside yanking on his leash.</p><p>Every person in the bar froze for a moment, then instantly turned their attention on her. The vamp had the third wolf on the floor in front of her. He hadn\u2019t shifted, not yet, but his claws were already lengthening. She had one smal hand at his throat while the other held tight to his hair, yanking his head back to better expose his neck. Vampires always went for the throat. So predictable. Their hunger made them weak every time.</p><p>\u201cKil the bitch...\u201d Ah, that mutter came from one of the guys she\u2019d tossed a good ten feet. He was already rising with his claws out and blood dripping from his busted cheek. Jace lifted his hand, staying the men even as they rose. \u201cNot...yet.\u201d</p> <p>He knew no one would disobey. They couldn\u2019t. He was alpha, and if they tried, he\u2019d be the one kicking ass.</p><p>Even the shitty band stopped playing as he crossed the room. The few human females in the bar glanced around curiously, and he saw a couple of the shifters push them toward the back. The women came to play at Howling Moon. Or rather, the wolves played with them. Those women knew the score about the supernatural world, and they knew to keep quiet about the paranormal society.</p><p>The vampiress didn\u2019t release her grip on her prey. Jace took his time stalking toward her. Like most vamps, she had pale, ivory skin. Her features were...damn, pretty perfect. Wide eyes, high cheeks, smal nose. Her chin was pointed a little, giving her a slightly stubborn edge, but then, bloodsuckers were not exactly known to be easy going. Neither were wolves.</p><p>She wore al black. Tight black shirt, a very short black skirt, and those boots that oozed sex.</p><p>Sex and violence. Yeah, that was pretty much how vamps and wolves rol ed. As he closed in on her, Jace picked up her scent, separating the light perfume of her skin from the booze, sweat, and the cigarettes in the air. The vampire smel ed sweet, tempting. Her kind always did. The better to lure their prey in for that deadly bite. But she was\u2014</p><p>More.</p><p>He inclined his head toward her. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her voice rol ed lightly, soft, sensual, but had no accent. She dropped her hold on the wolf instantly.</p><p>Then Mike made the mistake of lunging back up and slicing at her with his claws.</p><p>Rage exploded inside of Jace, and he leapt forward even as his own claws broke from his fingertips.</p><p>Don\u2019t hurt\u2014</p><p>She stepped back, ducked, then shoved her fist right at the wolf\u2019s heart. Her punch threw Mike back against Jace.</p><p>Jace grabbed the wolf and twisted him around. He lifted the other guy off the floor and glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you permission to attack, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He heard the vamp\u2019s breaths panting lightly and knew she wasn\u2019t as control ed as she appeared. No scent of fear, not yet.</p><p>\u201cB-bloodsucker...comin\u2019 in here...\u201d Mike snarled. \u201cShe can\u2019t just...walk in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was invited here,\u201d she said smoothly.</p><p>Stil trapped in Jace\u2019s grip, Mike twisted and glared over his shoulder. \u201cWho the hel</p><p>would be dumb enough to invite a vampire here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour alpha.\u201d Her answer came with a shrug as her gaze lifted back to Jace. Then she inclined her head in the smal est of subservient gestures. Submission. \u201cI was told of your offer, and I\u2019m here to accept.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s head swung back toward him. \u201cJace?\u201d His voice was stronger now. Wolves always healed fast. \u201cWhat bul shit is she talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jace slammed his forehead into Mike\u2019s nose. Bones crunched and blood spurted even as the smal er wolf howled. Then Jace threw the guy against the nearest wal , one that was about fifteen feet away. When Mike crashed, he didn\u2019t get up. Silence. So thick it covered the whole bar. Jace stared at the vamp, trying to keep al emotion from his face. Then, slowly, he closed the remaining space between him and the woman who was going to change everything for him.</p><p>He caught her hand and turned her palm over. Hel , yes, the mark was there, cradled inside her left hand. Just like he\u2019d known it would be. A blood-red rose. He stood close enough to see the circle of gold in her eyes. The faint gold that marked her just as her hand did. She was something far more than an ordinary bloodsucker. She was a vampire princess. His key to power, immortality, and she was the perfect weapon that he needed to kick the ass of the demons who\u2019d come to town looking to wipe out his people.</p><p>Her lips parted as she stared up at him. He glimpsed her deceptively delicate fangs. And he caught the scent of fear as it swept through her.</p><p>She was right to be afraid. Now that she was there, within his grasp, and he\u2019d never let her go.</p><p>Never.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jace.\u201d He let her see his own fangs. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mine.\u201d A claim made before al the wolves in the room. From now on, any wolf who touched her would face him</p><p>\u2014and death. She swal owed and tilted her head back to better meet his stare. \u201cHel o, husband.\u201d</p><p>The wolf within growled... Mine.</p><p>When you were stuck between death and hel , sometimes, you had to turn to big, bad wolf for help.</p><p>The door to the smal storeroom closed with a soft click behind Morgan LaBeaux, and she tried hard not to tense her shoulders.</p><p>Alone. With him. The werewolf\u2019s footsteps padded around the room. She kept her chin up and knew that he\u2019d smel her fear. Dammit, she hated being afraid. But the idea of bonding with this male and staying with him for the rest of her very long life\u2014</p><p>hello, fear.</p><p>Morgan didn\u2019t fear many things, but every vamp in lower Florida knew it was smart to step cautiously around Jace Vaughn. He hadn\u2019t earned the alpha title by playing nicely. No, he\u2019d earned it by cutting a bloody path through his rivals and leaving their savaged bodies in his wake.</p><p>And I get to marry him?</p><p>Some days, a bride was just lucky.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think the vamps were going to accept my deal.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded more like a beast\u2019s than a man\u2019s. Deep. Rumbling. He propped his shoulders against the wal in front of her and crossed his powerful arms over his chest. His eyes, so dark they almost looked black, swept over her once more. \u201cA real fucking princess,\u201d</p><p>he muttered as he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019l be damned.\u201d</p><p>Probably. They al would be. That\u2019s why they were monsters. Though she real y hadn\u2019t been given much choice since she\u2019d been one of the few vamps actual y born to the blood\u2019s cal .</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cAt first, the Council didn\u2019t plan to accept your...ah...offer.\u201d</p><p>The Vampire Council\u2014the strongest vamps in the area\u2014hadn\u2019t exactly been keen on Jace\u2019s plan. But then the game had changed when their guards started showing up dead, courtesy of the demon bastards who\u2019d come to town.</p><p>Once upon a time, the supernaturals had al lurked in the shadows, content to exist only in the nightmares of humans. Why take the spotlight? Death and persecution would only fol ow. The witch trials had taught them al that.</p><p>Vampires had never sought attention, stil didn\u2019t.</p><p>Wolves, yes, they got a little wild and some rumors had been known to circulate about them, but they\u2019d kept fairly quiet over the centuries, too.</p><p>But the demons\u2014those assholes who were escaping hel in increasing numbers</p><p>\u2014they weren\u2019t in the mood for quiet. They\u2019d amassed in Miami and were planning one deadly coming out party. But first, they wanted to prove they were the biggest, toughest prey in the night.</p><p>So they were eliminating their supernatural competition.</p><p>A war was coming. No, it had already started. Vampires versus demons. Demons versus wolves.</p><p>The enemy of my enemy...</p><p>Is my husband.</p><p>\u201cThe demons want to wipe us out,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want them stopped as much as we do.\u201d He stil hadn\u2019t moved. Just stood there with his arms crossed. But at least there was no sign of his claws, not anymore. \u201cYou were right. The best way for us to end this battle is to team up.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a half-smile that didn\u2019t lighten his face. It just made him look al the more dangerous.</p><p>The guy exuded danger like no one she\u2019d ever seen. Darkly tan, golden skin covered a body hard with muscles. Jace Vaughn towered over her, easily passing sixfoot-three or sixfoot-four. He wasn\u2019t handsome, no, his face was too savage for that.</p><p>His long, dark mane of hair brushed his shoulders. He had hard, tense features.</p><p>Not handsome. But...sexy. Dammit, sexy.</p><p>Wolves and their animal appeal. She hadn\u2019t thought that appeal would work on her.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cWolves are holding their own...\u201d Now his arms dropped as he stepped toward her.</p><p>\u201cSo far,\u201d she whispered. That would change soon enough. Once the demons started concentrating their ful strength on them. \u201cYou know we have to find the doorway that\u2019s letting these demons out of hel and close it. If we don\u2019t, they\u2019l take over.\u201d</p><p>And their coming out party to the humans would be a nightmare. His eyes held hers.</p><p>When he took another step toward her, Morgan held her ground. She had an image to maintain. A vampire can\u2019t tremble before a werewolf. But the slight flare of his nostrils told her that the wolf was drinking in her scent, and no doubt picking up on her fear.Great.</p><p>When his hand lifted toward her, she tensed.</p><p>\u201cEasy, princess,\u201d he murmured, \u201cit\u2019s just a touch.\u201d</p><p>Right. And if they were going through with this bargain, he\u2019d be doing a whole lot more touching.</p><p>What\u2019s one life versus the fate of your people? That had been the Council\u2019s big sel ing speech to her. Sacrifice yourself. Save everyone else.</p><p>Go be food for the big, bad wolf...because he can save our asses.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Morgan,\u201d her voice came out huskier than she\u2019d intended, but his hand was on her cheek, smoothing over the flesh, and she wanted to shiver. Don\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t show that weakness. His hands were hard, but his touch felt whisper-soft.</p><p>\u201cMorgan LaBeaux.\u201d</p><p>There was pride in the words because she was named after the first pureblood vampire ever to be born, Morganna La Fey.</p><p>The first, but not the last.</p><p>His gaze swept her face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe...they\u2019d real y trade...you?\u201d</p><p>She swal owed. In the end, it wasn\u2019t about the Council. It wasn\u2019t their lives that would be offered. \u201cIt\u2019s my cal .\u201d His hand slipped down her throat and his fingers pressed lightly over the pulse that raced beneath his touch.</p><p>Yes, her heart stil beat. She breathed. She wasn\u2019t dead, despite what humans thought. Purebloods were born as vampires. They simply stopped aging around their twenty-fifth year. Stopped aging and developed a lust for blood.</p><p>The others...those who\u2019d been brought over by the bite, wel , they did die, but only for a few moments. They came back, stronger than before, and their hearts beat again when they took their first breath of air as a vampire.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re wil ingly offering yourself to me?\u201d The wolf asked, voice darker than before. The weight of his hand felt too heavy against her throat. Wolves were always so big, too big. In a second\u2019s time, their claws could emerge, and they could rip apart their enemies. And when they went into a ful shift...</p><p>We need their strength. \u201cOnce you help us to defeat the demons, I\u2019l marry you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wolves and vampires would be irrevocably bound.</p><p>Any supernatural that wanted a piece of them would find an al iance that was unbreakable. Unbeatable.</p><p>Jace laughed. The sound was sinister and strangely sexy. This time, Morgan couldn\u2019t stop her shiver, and she knew he felt it.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d His head leaned toward her and his lips hovered over hers.</p><p>\u201cYou want the demons taken out, then you give me what I want first.\u201d</p><p>What he wanted...</p><p>\u201cMarry me, bond with me, and you\u2019l have your own personal guard who\u2019l tear apart anyone who comes near you.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s...ah, not just about me.\u201d She wasn\u2019t doing this to save her own skin. \u201cIt\u2019s about al the vampires in my nest. They al need protection. Your pack has to give to al \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my concern.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut if they matter to you, then they can have pack protection. We\u2019l take out the demons and leave a bloody trail to warn al others never to fuck with us again.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was good at that kind of trail.</p><p>Over the years, the vampires had become, wel , some said too civilized. They\u2019d taken to drinking blood from handy little plastic bags. They married humans. They blended almost perfectly with society.</p><p>Because so many of them wanted to be human.</p><p>Morgan had wanted that, too. Then she saw how easily the humans died. Now she wanted to be strong. A fighter.</p><p>The vampires were fal ing too quickly to the demon horde. The wolves\u2014they were lasting longer. Because they\u2019re stronger now. If they were going to stop hel , then the vampires needed the wolves at their sides.</p><p>\u201cMarry me...\u201d Jace\u2019s whisper.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d do anything, but before she could speak, a hard thud shook the wal . Morgan jerked. \u201cWhat is\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hands around her shoulders and lifted her up so that she had to stare straight into her eyes. \u201cDemons fol owed you here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible, I was careful, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow my pack is tearing them apart.\u201d</p><p>If only. But, sadly, she\u2019d discovered that it wasn\u2019t simple to kil a demon. You had to sever its head, and cleaving through demon flesh wasn\u2019t an easy task. While a demon\u2019s flesh looked like a human\u2019s, it was harder to penetrate than any armor she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cDo I have your agreement? You wil marry me right away?\u201d</p><p>Why did she like the rumble of his voice so much? Morgan nodded. Another thud shook the wal , and she was pretty sure she heard a scream. Or two.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d A growl. Then the wolf did something she hadn\u2019t expected. His mouth took hers. Her lips had parted in surprise, and his tongue thrust inside her mouth. He didn\u2019t taste like a vampire or a like a human. She had experience with those types of men.</p><p>But Jace...</p><p>He tasted wild. Hot.</p><p>Her arms curled around his neck as she pul ed him closer.</p><p>A growl worked in his throat when she sucked his tongue. Oh, yes, she liked that.</p><p>Vampires had the wrong image. Cold, stiff. Unfeeling. She\u2019d never been like that. She\u2019d always wanted. Needed.</p><p>Maybe he can give me what I want.</p><p>Her nipples were hard, stabbing against his chest, and her sex began to moisten.</p><p>Wolves weren\u2019t easy lovers, or so the stories said. No quick tumble in the darkness for them. Instead, sex that lasted for hours.</p><p>Hours.</p><p>The Council elder\u2019s face had been sad when he\u2019d said, \u201cWe hate for you to make this sacrifice...\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel like much of a sacrifice to her.</p><p>Just felt like white-hot lust.</p><p>Her fangs started to lengthen. What will his blood taste like?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait to find out.</p><p>His hands were on her ass now, holding her up and against the hard bulge of his arousal. No missing that fierce length of flesh. The wolf was big al over. Yes.</p><p>Very slowly, and only after he tasted her once more, Jace lifted his head and lowered her to the ground. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that.\u201d</p><p>She could stil taste him.</p><p>\u201cGuess vampires can feel more than hate for the wolves.\u201d</p><p>Morgan pul ed in a deep breath. \u201cAnd I guess wolves can lust for the bloodsuckers they claim to despise.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, and she realized she didn\u2019t hear any muffled voices from the bar any longer. No more thuds. No screams.</p><p>His hand took hers and his palm felt red-hot against the mark on her flesh. Wolves were so hot, when she\u2019d known only the cold for so long.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>Do it. Go. Don\u2019t back down now. Just because she\u2019d tasted the wolf and realized that control ing him might not be as easy as she\u2019d planned, wel , that didn\u2019t mean she could run away.</p><p>He opened the door. The smel of blood hit her. But it wasn\u2019t the normal y sweet, tempting scent that cal ed to her kind.</p><p>Rancid. Brimstone. Hel .</p><p>Demons.</p><p>Their bodies lay on the floor. Their heads had been severed, and their eyes\u2014as red as the hel they\u2019d escaped\u2014stared straight up at her. Two demons down...</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d She breathed the word in surprise. The vamps had taken hours to kil demons, while the wolves had decapitated these two in mere minutes.</p><p>The wolf shifter that Jace had cal ed Mike lifted his hand. His claws glinted. \u201cWe can slice through anything.\u201d His gaze seemed to bore into her. \u201cAnything. \u201d The unmistakable threat was in his eyes.</p><p>That wolf would be a problem.</p><p>She might just have to kil him soon.</p><p>Jace caught her hand and threaded his fingers through hers.</p><p>But the kil ing would have to wait. Because, ah, first, she\u2019d have to marry her alpha wolf.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Morgan liked to bite. In fact, she was very good with her teeth. But being bitten wasn\u2019t so much her thing.</p><p>She stood in the middle of Howling Moon, congealing demon blood getting way too close to her boots, and knew that she\u2019d have to offer her neck.</p><p>The wolves surrounded her. Jace held her hand in a deceptively light grip.</p><p>\u201cThis is Morgan LaBeaux.\u201d Jace\u2019s voice boomed out and every wolf there stil ed.</p><p>When an alpha talked, you damn wel listened.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s racing heartbeat fil ed her ears. He kept staring right at her as he said,</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the fuck no!\u201d The instant denial came from Mike. She\u2019d expected that outburst.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t expected\u2014</p><p>Jace tore away from her and in an instant, his claws sank into that wolf\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, the fuck, yes,\u201d he snarled right back. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t accept her...\u201d He yanked out his claws as Mike stumbled back.</p><p>Wolves are brutal. Another Council warning.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t accept her,\u201d Jace continued, \u201cthen get out of my pack.\u201d</p><p>Pain broke rough lines on Mike\u2019s face. \u201cA vampire? You\u2019re tying to a bloodsucker\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now she wanted to claw him. The wolves kept acting like Jace was the one trading down. Dude. Vampire princess.</p><p>She toed the dead demon\u2019s body. The blood had reached her boots, and it wouldn\u2019t be coming out of the leather. \u201cThey\u2019l destroy you.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her voice that captured everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>Mike puffed out his bloody chest. \u201cWe did a good job of destroying them.\u201d</p><p>Yes, they had. And she was impressed, but she wasn\u2019t planning to show it. \u201cYou took out two...\u201d Her gaze swept the room. \u201cWith twenty to two odds, I should hope you\u2019d win the match.\u201d</p><p>Jace lifted a brow and watched her.</p><p>She braced her legs and tried to look al kick-ass. \u201cWhat are your plans when there are two thousand of them...and stil just twenty of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that bitch just say two thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo damn thousand?\u201d</p><p>Shock coated the faces of the shifters. Even Mike looked nervous. Jace didn\u2019t. He just kept watching her, and he kept his claws out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being hunted,\u201d she told them. \u201cHow many wolves have the demons taken out in the last few weeks?\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t answer, but she saw the swift glances that passed between the pack members.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re also attacking us,\u201d she said. \u201cFor once, the vampires and the werewolves share an enemy.\u201d Now they were al focusing on her with narrowed eyes and tense faces. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take these bastards out, believe me, they will destroy us. They\u2019ve got the numbers on their side. They have the power...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Mike demanded. \u201cAn al iance?\u201d He fired a fierce stare at Jace. \u201cIs this just some truce \u2018til we kick the ass of al \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mating,\u201d Jace said, voice flat. \u201cIt\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>Until death. \u201cA doorway opened between hel and earth, and the demons are slipping right through that door,\u201d Morgan said. More of the hel spawn came through each day.</p><p>\u201cSo close the damn door!\u201d Mike snapped.</p><p>Jace\u2019s fingers stretched as if he were itching to plunge his claws back into the wolf.</p><p>Maybe he was.</p><p>\u201cWe wil ,\u201d Jace said simply. \u201cThe wolves and the vampires wil send them back and close the door.\u201d</p><p>They had to work together. In order for that doorway to shut, they\u2019d both need to bleed. Only she\u2019d be the one giving up the most blood.</p><p>And Jace would be the one to face hel .</p><p>Murmurs swept through the bar. The wolves final y seemed to realize just how serious this night was. A vampire wasn\u2019t their prey. Instead, a vampire was becoming their alpha\u2019s mate.</p><p>Jace came to her side again. When his hands\u2014stil tipped with those deadly claws</p><p>\u2014rose to her throat, Morgan didn\u2019t flinch. He swept back her hair and his knuckles brushed over her skin.</p><p>The wolves closed in now, watching, and some\u2014some were already shifting. Mike swore and turned away. He stomped for the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Jace\u2019s voice, right at her ear. She felt the whisper of his breath on her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Her own voice was just as soft as his.</p><p>His claws skated down her neck. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Wolf senses. Could he real y smel her fear?</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been bitten?\u201d he asked.</p><p>So many eyes were on her. She\u2019d known the bite would have to be in public. It was one of the pack rules. Claimings had to be public. Witnesses had to see the bite.</p><p>Witnesses\u2014just like in human marriage ceremonies.</p><p>Because that\u2019s what a marking was...marriage. When a male wolf bit his female in front of the pack, he claimed her.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>It would just help if her knees weren\u2019t shaking.</p><p>She gave him the truth, \u201cNo.\u201d No one had ever bitten her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Too much satisfaction purred in the one word.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d her voice was way too breathless. She wasn\u2019t actual y looking forward to this, was she? \u201cI get my turn later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn.</p><p>She titled her head, arching her neck even as she closed her eyes. She wouldn\u2019t look at the others as he did this. She would just close her eyes and pretend that\u2014</p><p>That I\u2019m not giving my life to a werewolf.</p><p>His lips touched her skin first. She\u2019d expected the bite. The sharp sting of teeth.</p><p>Werewolves were supposed to be wild.</p><p>No better than animals. That\u2019s what the Council said, that\u2019s what\u2014</p><p>His tongue licked her skin, and Morgan lost her breath. Her breasts tightened even as her body tensed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t open her eyes. Don\u2019t want to see them.</p><p>He sucked her skin, licked her, but didn\u2019t bite, not yet. His arms surrounded her, his body sheltered her, and he made her wait.</p><p>Worse, the bastard made her want.</p><p>Because her skin was too sensitive, his lips too wickedly skil ed, and if a vampire had a sweet spot\u2014okay, yes, they al did\u2014it was the neck. Just a few licks there, and she was choking back a moan.</p><p>Then she felt the edge of his teeth on her skin.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she told him, desperate.</p><p>\u201cYou accept me?\u201d</p><p>Morgan nodded.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Morgan, I need the words. You have to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept you!\u201d</p><p>His teeth sank into her. Not her neck, but the curve of her shoulder. The pain was whitehot, pulsing. Then pleasure whipped through her. A wave of pleasure so intense that she cried out and opened her eyes.</p><p>And saw a giant, white wolf leaping right at her.</p><p>Barely a bride, and already, the groom\u2019s family was gunning for her. Jace lifted his head at her cry and he roared, \u201cMike!\u201d even as he shoved her back. Then her husband jumped into the air. His bones crunched, popped, and fur broke over his skin.</p><p>The man vanished, and a giant black wolf attacked in mid-air. Morgan touched her shoulder and felt the wet warmth of her blood. The skin ached, but she knew the flesh was already healing.</p><p>Vamp healing power.</p><p>The two wolves were a twisting, snarling mass. Claws flew, razor-sharp teeth snapped. Blood matted their fur, and their growls fil ed the air.</p><p>She lunged forward, but a hard hand wrapped around her arm.</p><p>\u201cEasy, there, cher. \u201d The man\u2019s voice rol ed with a Cajun accent she\u2019d once heard during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. \u201cDon\u2019t go gettin\u2019 between wolves. If Mike wants a chal enge, then Jace wil give him one...\u201d</p><p>As she watched, the other wolves circled and howled. Jace tore into the white wolf.</p><p>More blood. Her nose twitched at the smel .</p><p>Didn\u2019t they know better than to fil a room with blood when a vampire was around? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her teeth began to burn as they stretched in her mouth. What would it be like? To have that fresh, wolf blood? Would it truly be as powerful as the Council said?</p><p>Jace went for the white wolf\u2019s throat. His powerful jaws caught the flesh, caught, held...</p><p>Mike sagged beneath him, the fight gone. Surrender.</p> <p>Submission.</p><p>Jace tossed his head back. His howl fil ed the bar.</p><p>Then the black wolf turned and stared at her. His teeth were bloody. His eyes wild.</p><p>What have I done?</p><p>The Council was wrong. There was no way she\u2019d ever be able to control him. The wolves were running around now, some human, some animal, and it was chaos. Jace transformed as he approached. Fur melted. Bones shifted. By the time he reached for her, he was a man.</p> <p>Even if his stare was stil the wild gaze of the wolf. He came to her, caught her hand, and said, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>She knew that it was too late to run.</p><p>Mike raced away from the bar even as Jace\u2019s howl fil ed his ears. Bastard. He\u2019d hated that asshole for years and now Jace was pairing up with a vampire?</p><p>Another reason to hate the SOB.</p><p>Mike had shifted, transforming in order to heal. Jace had sliced him too deep. Even now, the blood spil ed down his neck.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet...\u201d</p> <p>The whisper had Mike slowing. His gaze swept the dark shadows. A row of broken buildings waited on the left. Empty. Faded.</p><p>His nostrils flared, and he scented... bloodsucker.</p><p>Mike slapped a hand over his throat, and he began to back away. Normal y he wouldn\u2019t run from a vamp, but...but he\u2019d already gotten his ass handed to him once tonight. \u201cStay away from me!\u201d He shouted.</p><p>Laughter floated in the air.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d The voice was closer now. \u201cI saw you...I watched it al .\u201d</p><p>Mike spun around and came face-to-face with the vamp. Tal , as pale as the woman had been, but muscled.</p><p>And the vamp\u2019s fangs were out.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to kil the female, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Talk about being screwed. He should have known the bitch hadn\u2019t come in alone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He could be honest here. Maybe it would help his cause. \u201cI was going to kil him. \u201d</p><p>More laughter, and then the vampire closed in. Mike didn\u2019t even have a chance to scream.</p><p>\u201cThis is...ah...your place?\u201d Morgan paced in front of the fireplace. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I was expecting.\u201d Jace pul ed his gaze off her ass. The rush from the shift stil fueled his body. No, not just from the shift. From her.</p><p>He had her taste now. Knew the feel of her body. Knew the sound of pleasure on her lips. He wanted more.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d His voice was rough. Always was. Like sandpaper when hers sounded like silk.</p><p>Morgan stopped her pacing. She slanted him a quick glance from beneath lowered lashes.</p><p>\u201cA cage?\u201d He tossed out.</p><p>Her smal jaw tensed. \u201cAnd I suppose you never once wondered if I slept in a coffin?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, princess, I know better.\u201d She just needed to stay out of sunlight because the light made her weak, almost human. Not because it set her skin on fire.</p><p>That was just a Hol ywood myth.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know better, too.\u201d Her voice came even softer than before. She turned to stare at the heavy bookshelves that lined his wal s. \u201cBut I did expect pin-up queens and at least one big screen TV.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, wel , they were al on the other side of the house. Jace shrugged. Then he took off his t-shirt.</p><p>Her gazed immediately dipped to his chest. Her hand lifted and rubbed the curve of her shoulder, the tasty spot he\u2019d sampled less than an hour before. He\u2019d be sampling a whole lot more of her soon.</p><p>The fucking princess. He\u2019d asked for her because, hel , yeah, he knew the power that she wielded in her blood. If he got enough of that vampire blood in him, he\u2019d be near invincible.</p><p>He wanted that power. Would need it if he was going to stop the demons. But there was...</p><p>more.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her. Had, for a very, very long time. The lady didn\u2019t even know how long he\u2019d been watching her.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I saw you.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to say the words, but they broke from him. How many nights had his vampire princess haunted his dreams?</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWh-what?\u201d There it was again. That smal stutter. The hesitation he hadn\u2019t expected from her. He\u2019d thought that the years would have made her harder. Perhaps they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Or perhaps she was just playing him. Time would tel .</p><p>\u201cYou stopped aging ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>A slight inclination of her head. Freshmeat, or at least, that\u2019s what the pack would have cal ed her.</p><p>Jace just thought of her as\u2014</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never met.\u201d Now her voice wasn\u2019t so hesitant, but her fingers were stil curled over the mark he\u2019d put on her flesh.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve watched you.\u201d Before he\u2019d taken over the pack, his job had been to monitor the vampires. To catalog their every move and report back to his alpha. He\u2019d watched and seen a blond beauty gaze up at the sun with tears in her eyes. Her twenty-fifth birthday. The day she\u2019d final y changed.</p><p>Lathan, the ex-alpha, had wanted the pureblood taken out. She was supposed to have been a message to the vamps. We\u2019re taking over this town. Time for you to be our bitches. But Jace had seen her stare at that sun, and instead of hurting her, he\u2019d torn his alpha apart.</p><p>Wolves couldn\u2019t real y recognize their mates on sight. At least, they weren\u2019t supposed to recognize them.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cJace?\u201d He liked the way she said his name, though he would prefer hearing her scream it in pleasure to whispering it so quietly. Later. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d</p><p>she said with a lift of that stubborn chin.</p><p>He might as wel put his cards on the table. In this devil\u2019s bargain, they only had each other. If he couldn\u2019t trust her... then maybe I will be the one to kill her one day.</p><p>\u201cA few years back, I was your guard dog.\u201d He used the derogatory term deliberately. A faint furrow appeared between her brows.</p><p>\u201cFor seven months, I watched you. Day and night.\u201d He\u2019d even seen her drink her first batch of blood\u2014and watched her vomit it out moments later.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to be a monster, but fate had different plans for her. And him.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s bedroom eyes widened. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before your change.\u201d His gaze swept over her. \u201cRight before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before you took over the pack,\u201d she finished and her hand dropped. Now he was the one surprised. \u201cDid your research on me, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Flat. \u201cI know al about you. The lives you\u2019ve taken\u2014the vampires you\u2019ve beheaded.\u201d</p><p>Because once, that had been his job. Watch. Hunt. Kill.</p><p>Until a vampiress had shed tears of blood at sunset.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d exactly become Mr. Nice Guy since that night. He just hadn\u2019t kil ed her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, and stil you\u2019re ready to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>She kept her chin up even as her hands clenched into fists at her sides. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to\u2014to fuck for the bonding to take place. You drank from me, now I just need to drink from you.\u201dJace slowly shook his head as he stalked toward her. \u201cYou think you can drink me, and not want sex?\u201d He understood vampires so wel . The reason most of them had stopped taking from live sources was because once they tasted blood</p><p>\u2014ah, fresh from the vein\u2014the bloodlust tended to overwhelm them.</p><p>Her gaze held his. \u201cI can control myself.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. His nostrils flared. She had control, but she was also aroused. From the idea of drinking his blood? Or just, from him?</p><p>He\u2019d worried that a vampire female would be repulsed by him. Normal y, they went for class.</p><p>Not for a beast that howled at the moon. But this princess, his princess, was something different. He\u2019d known that for years. He\u2019d just had to bide his time and wait for her.</p><p>\u201cYou might have control,\u201d he al owed, \u201cbut we wolves aren\u2019t exactly known for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Again, not pul ing her punches.</p><p>So he wouldn\u2019t either. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve wanted to fuck you for ten years.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, and she gave him a glimpse of those little fangs. \u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>Why did he find her fangs sexy? \u201cI don\u2019t care if drinking me spikes your bloodlust. I don\u2019t care how rough you get.\u201d He wasn\u2019t worried about some bruises and scratches when pleasure waited. \u201cI can handle anything you\u2019ve got,\u201d he told her as his hand stroked down her arm. Such smooth, soft skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure, wolf.\u201d</p><p>But he was. \u201cSo why are you doing this?\u201d His hand deliberately brushed the side of her breast. Want a taste. \u201cWhy throw yourself to the wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be saving my people.\u201d Her lips firmed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>Her lashes swept down but she didn\u2019t back away as she said, \u201cI mean, that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing it, right? You\u2019re sacrificing yourself\u2014mating to a bloodsucker\u2014in order to save your pack.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, but Jace did begin undressing her.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her fast stutter almost made him smile. Would have, if he hadn\u2019t been so hard and hungry for her. He couldn\u2019t even draw in a breath without tasting her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to finish this.\u201d They\u2019d done the public ritual, and now they would bond. He could feel a new power fil ing his body. He\u2019d drank from her only once, and already the change was happening. Soon he\u2019d be infinitely stronger, faster. To stop the demons, he\u2019d have to become more. So would she.</p><p>But first, they\u2019d have to fuck.</p><p>Her hands caught his, stil ing him.</p><p>He stared down at their bodies. She looked so breakable, but wasn\u2019t. Not even close. So why the hel did he feel the need to be gentle with her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told her. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her long lashes swept up, and she gazed at him. The gold in her eyes seemed even brighter. \u201cOh, wolf...\u201d She sighed and then her lips curled in a smile that punched right into his gut. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who needs to worry about getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>Then her hands were on him, pushing back, and he realized Morgan was very strong. The wolf inside growled.</p><p>Her fangs were out, and Jace knew what his lady was going to say even as her lips parted</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to bite.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>They made it to the bedroom. Morgan had a fast impression of heavy furniture, thick curtains, and then\u2014</p><p>Silk sheets. Black silk sheets.</p><p>The wolf had surprised her again.</p><p>She stared at him as the haze of need built within her. She wanted his blood. She needed it. And she wanted him. The lust for him wasn\u2019t unexpected. The guy was freaking sexy. Jace was already naked. His chest flexed and rippled with muscles. His body was perfect. So strong. So dark. So...</p><p>Very aroused.</p><p>His cock stretched toward her, heavy and thick, and there was no doubt that he wanted her.</p><p>Not just a bloodsucker to him.</p><p>She ran her tongue over the edge of her fangs. \u201cI need to confess\u2014\u201d</p><p>His gaze darkened.</p><p>\u201cI, um, don\u2019t have a lot of experience at this.\u201d Most vampires she knew actual y didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t move. But he did cal , \u201cBul shit.\u201d</p><p>It must have been her boots. She\u2019d thought they looked rather fuck-me. \u201cBloodlust and physical lust...they can combine too much. We don\u2019t, ah, drink from sources.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t supposed to, but the rules were changing.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She felt hunted. The back of her knees hit the bed. \u201cSo I don\u2019t drink and\u2014and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWith me, you wil .\u201d</p><p>His hands sank into her hair and tipped her head back. Then his lips took hers in a kiss that stole her breath even as it heated her blood. The wolf knew how to kiss. Oh, damn, did he. His tongue thrust inside her mouth, and Morgan found her arms rising and wrapping around his line-backer shoulders.</p><p>A kiss shouldn\u2019t sweep fire through her whole body, but his did. Her shirt and bra were long gone. His hands slipped down and pushed away her skirt. It slipped over her boots and hit the floor. Then his fingers caught her panties and the rip of fabric fil ed her ears.</p><p>Morgan pul ed back. What am I doing?</p><p>His glowing eyes stared down at her.</p><p>Her thighs hit the mattress, and she fel back onto the bed. She expected him to pounce on her, literal y. Instead, he caught one foot and lifted it up, then slowly, inch by inch, Jace pul ed off her leather boot.</p><p>His hands kneaded her flesh. Smoothed over her calf. Slipped up her thigh. Morgan tensed even as her fangs burned.</p><p>His hand eased back, and he reached for the other boot.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away from him. Dark hair. Golden flesh. The boot came off, and his hand smoothed over her skin. He parted her thighs.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty...\u201d</p><p>She was wet for him. Morgan wanted his blood so badly that she trembled and, even more, she wanted that hot, hard body of his against her. In her. He licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cWho gets to taste first?\u201d</p><p>Damn. She wasn\u2019t supposed to have sex with him. The Council had been adamant about that. Drink him, yes, take his power, give him hers, but sex?</p><p>Forbidden.</p><p>But the Council wasn\u2019t there, and for once, Morgan was going to take pleasure like other women did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said and reached for him.</p><p>His smile had her heartbeat kicking, but, to show him that she wasn\u2019t like the mortal women he\u2019d probably known before, Morgan twisted and shoved him, forcing him onto his back on the bed. Then she climbed on top of him, spreading her legs so that the aroused length of his cock just brushed her sex.</p><p>More, please.</p> <p>Her nails raked down his chest. Not enough to break the skin. No sense wasting blood. His smal nipples tightened beneath her touch. She leaned down and slid her tongue over the left nipple. He arched beneath her, and the head of his cock pushed against her core. She lifted her head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Was that breathless, hungry voice real y hers?</p><p>His hands were on her hips, holding her tight. So much power. She\u2019d had a handful of lovers\u2014al human\u2014in her life. They\u2019d felt warm and alive but Jace was something al together different.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t just warmth. He was a furnace, and the heat from his flesh warmed every inch of her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play too long,\u201d came his warning to her.</p><p>A warning she ignored. She\u2019d never played. Why not try now?</p> <p>She kissed her way up his body. Morgan knew she should have felt hesitant, nervous, and moments before, she had. But now she just needed.</p><p>She licked his neck and felt the wild drumming of his pulse beneath her mouth. A vampire\u2019s bite wasn\u2019t like a wolf\u2019s. There was no pain, there never was, not unless the vampire decided to play rough.</p><p>No pain, and, when done right...pleasure.</p><p>She real y wanted to do this right for him.</p><p>His hands trailed up her body. Such big hands, with rough fingertips and a gentle touch. His hands curled around her breasts, and a moan slipped from her. His name.</p><p>Her nipples were tight, and when his fingers pushed over the hungry peaks, she closed her eyes.</p> <p>Her teeth pressed against his skin.</p><p>Her thighs shifted, spreading even more for him. She couldn\u2019t ever remember being this aroused for another.</p><p>Not about duty. Not about the vampire nest.</p><p>Right then, it was just about a man and a woman.</p><p>\u201cTake me in,\u201d he whispered as his cock pushed up between her legs. Her body resisted because the wolf was so big. The head of his cock stretched her, but it didn\u2019t hurt. It felt good, so good.</p><p>She pushed down, even as his hips thrust up, hard, harder . Morgan took him al in and her teeth sank deep into his neck. His blood flowed on her tongue, and his blood was as addictive as his kiss. She drank him in, drank\u2014</p><p>Jace growled, and the room spun. No, he spun, pushing her beneath him while never taking that thick cock from her body. And she didn\u2019t take her teeth from his neck.</p><p>No, no, she wanted more of his blood.</p> <p>More, Jace. More.</p><p>Images raced through her mind. A thousand flashes, like photos flying in a storm.</p><p>They hit her, rol ing through her mind as his memories became hers. Bonding.</p><p>She took more of his blood. Licked his throat.</p><p>He thrust deep. Harder. His fingers pushed between her legs. Found the center of her need and stroked her.</p><p>The images vanished. The only thing that remained\u2014Jace.</p><p>Her mouth eased from his throat. She swiped her tongue over her lips. Stared up at him. His jaw was locked. His eyes glowed so brightly that it almost hurt to look into them. He\u2019d obviously been waiting for her to look up, to see him.</p><p>\u201cNow we finish,\u201d he promised and drove deep into her.</p><p>Her legs wrapped around his hips. Her nails sank into his arms. She arched against him, pushing as hard as she could. He thrust inside, fil ing her, every inch so stretched and ful , and she loved it.</p><p>He withdrew, sliding nearly out of her eager sex, only to plunge back inside. Again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>The headboard slammed into the wal . The bed slats gave way with a groan, and the mattress tumbled onto the floor.</p><p>He kept thrusting. She held on. Wanted more blood. Wanted more of him. Pleasure had her sex clamping around him. The climax bore down on her, so close, so\u2014</p><p>She bit him when she came.</p><p>He erupted inside of her, hot jets of semen that fil ed her.</p><p>And he held her tight. So tight that she wondered if he\u2019d ever let her go. Then she realized her hands were clamped around his shoulders. Her nails deep in his skin.</p><p>Holding Jace just as tightly...</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t want to let him go.</p><p>Morgan dreamed of Jace\u2019s life that day. The images flew through her mind, one after the other. A young Jace, had to be barely thirteen, running through the woods. Falling.</p><p>Shifting. Screaming.</p><p>Changing.</p><p>Older, he strode into a vampire bar. When two vampires leapt at him, he struck out with his claws.</p><p>Blood covered the floor.</p><p>There was more blood. Always more. He hunted. He kil ed. A perfect weapon.</p><p>There were women. They passed in a flurry. Beds. Sex.</p><p>Jace. Aging. Growing.</p><p>Stronger, deadlier.</p><p>Not enough laughter in his life. Just death and violence.</p><p>Then...</p><p>Me.</p><p>Morgan saw herself in his memories, in the days that she already struggled to remember. Standing in the sunshine that last time, feeling normal. Human. He\u2019d watched her. Seen her cry. Not human tears, because then, she\u2019d been beyond that.</p><p>Tears of blood. The sign that her change was at hand.</p><p>\u201cKill the bitch. Teach them that no vampire is beyond our reach.\u201d</p><p>An image of the pack\u2019s ex-alpha rol ed through her mind. \u201cDo the job. Rip out her throat.\u201d</p><p>Jace stalked toward her. She stood on her balcony, staring up at the night. His claws were out.</p><p>Then she looked down\u2014at him.</p><p>There were no tears this time.</p><p>Jace turned away.</p><p>But the blood didn\u2019t stop. He\u2019d gone back for the alpha. \u201cYou can\u2019t take me, boy, you don\u2019t even know how strong I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The alpha\u2019s blood had stained Jace\u2019s claws.</p><p>Morgan tried to shut out the memories. It was too much. She didn\u2019t want to see anymore. No more death. It was al he knew.</p><p>Yet he hadn\u2019t kil ed her .</p><p>As the images kept pushing forward, she realized that Jace had visited her again.</p><p>And again. She hadn\u2019t known it, but he\u2019d been there so many times. Not to kil .</p><p>To guard.</p><p>Jace watched her while she slept and wondered what memories she saw. He knew how the bite worked. Another reason the vamps had stopped drinking directly from humans was because they couldn\u2019t stand the memory overload. When you drank from a live source, you saw memories.</p><p>What did the vampiress see?</p><p>He bent over the bed and wiped away the bloody tears that trekked from her eyes.</p><p>He\u2019d always hated her tears.</p><p>You see me now, don\u2019t you? The dead had piled at his feet over the years. If he had one talent in this world, it was kil ing.</p><p>It would be a talent that aided them when the battle with the demons came. But</p><p>...what would Morgan think of him when she woke?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking monster.\u201d Liar, liar...and who\u2019d know better than her? In his head now, always, there\u2019d be no hiding from her.</p><p>She\u2019d know it al and understand the obsession he carried. For her. He eased away from the bed. He didn\u2019t want to look into her eyes with the memories between them.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Jace spun away and left the room.</p><p>He hurried down the hal and shoved open the front door. The afternoon sunlight hit him, bright and hot, the way it always was in Miami. The buzz of insects bled from the nearby swamp, droning on and on. When he jumped down the steps, his first in command, Louis, pushed away from his truck.</p><p>Jace had heard the other wolf drive up. He\u2019d just taken his time about heading out.</p><p>\u201cWe got trouble,\u201d Louis said, his Cajun accent rol ing easily on the words. \u201cNo one seen any sign of Mike. Nothin\u2019 except his blood in an al ey.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s brows snapped up. \u201cLook, that asshole is just sleeping it off someplace, he\u2019</p><p>s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat al ey reeked of vamp, alpha.\u201d Louis shook his head. \u201cNot your pretty little vamp. Didn\u2019t smel like sex and blood and flowers...\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s teeth snapped together. But, fuck, yeah, that was how she smel ed.</p><p>\u201cMore like hate, death, and...brimstone.\u201d</p><p>Brimstone? \u201cYou saying demons were there, too?\u201d</p><p>Louis\u2019s shoulders rol ed. \u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 we got us a missin\u2019 wolf. And blood and vamps where they damn sure don\u2019t need to be.\u201d</p><p>In wolf territory.</p><p>He glanced back at the house.</p><p>Gravel crunched beneath Louis\u2019s feet. \u201cYou gave that cher your blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to.\u201d It was part of the deal. The vamps wanted a power boost by taking wolf blood. \u201cI gave her mine, and I took hers.\u201d Jace glanced down at his hands. With barely a thought, he had his claws springing out. \u201cIt worked just like we thought. Her blood in me...\u201d</p><p>The rush was stil un-freaking-believable. \u201cI can already feel the power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna get more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l get as much as I can take.\u201d His gaze held the other wolf\u2019s. Louis nodded. \u201cWil it be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The world exploded. The blast tossed Jace into the air, and he slammed into the front of Louis\u2019s pickup.</p><p>It took him three seconds to realize it wasn\u2019t the world that had actual y erupted. No, that giant bal of flames had come from his house.</p><p>Morgan.</p><p>The fire ripped up at the sky, twisting and turning.</p><p>Blood dripped down the side of Louis\u2019s face. \u201cWhat the hel is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jace ran for the house.</p><p>\u201cJace! No!\u201d Louis\u2019s footsteps pounded after him.</p><p>He ran faster. Morgan was in the house. A vampire\u2019s skin couldn\u2019t stand the fire.</p><p>She\u2019d die\u2014</p><p>He grabbed the door handle and shoved. The door col apsed beneath his hand.</p><p>\u201cMorgan!\u201d</p><p>He bel owed her name and rushed inside.</p><p>And he tripped over her. Morgan was on the floor, her arm stretched toward the door. Stretched fucking toward him.</p><p>He grabbed her and hoisted her into his arms. The flames crackled and flared around him, licking out at his skin. He ignored the burn. Morgan\u2019s head sagged against him, and her eyes didn\u2019t open.</p><p>Jace held her tight and leapt back through that broken doorway. Smoke bil owed out behind him.</p><p>She barely seemed to breathe. Ash and soot covered her, and Jace could see the angry red blisters that lined her perfect skin.</p><p>Hurt. On his watch.</p><p>Not ever again.</p><p>Windows shattered behind him, and Jace hunched his shoulders, curling his body in to protect her. Glass flew into the air, and shards sank into his flesh. Rage grew within him with each step that he took away from the inferno. Jace didn\u2019t ease his hold on Morgan, not until he\u2019d settled behind Louis\u2019s truck. Then he careful y lowered her onto the ground. Her eyes stil didn\u2019t open.</p><p>\u201cOh, hel ...\u201d Louis\u2019s drawl. \u201cShe\u2019s not...\u201d The shifter\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cThe cher ain\u2019t alive, is she now?\u201d</p><p>Jace put his hand over her heart and didn\u2019t feel it beat.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Blood flowed into her mouth, hot and rich, and she drank greedily. The blood brought memories. His memories. Not of death and hel this time, but of a wild run through the woods. The thril of the chase.</p><p>I\u2019m hunting.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s eyes cracked open. She wondered why she hurt. Every part of her body burned and ached and\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes, she burned because she\u2019d been on fire.</p><p>Jace pul ed his wrist away from her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again, got it?\u201d</p><p>She was on the ground. No, not on the ground, but sitting on Jace\u2019s lap. His blood was already sliding through her veins, healing her even in sunlight. She wasn\u2019t naked anymore. Because she\u2019d had to run through that fire naked. She\u2019d woken in his room only because the fire licked at her skin. She\u2019d leapt through the flames even as she screamed his name.</p><p>Now she wore his shirt. It smel ed of smoke and him. And her teeth were stil sharp, and she was pissed.</p><p>In a flash, she twisted around and pinned him against the ground. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>His twisted grin flashed. \u201cGlad you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d</p><p>She felt rather like burned shit right then. \u201cYou tried to kil me.\u201d The bastard had left her to the flames.</p><p>That wiped the grin right off his face. \u201cThe hel I did.\u201d</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t been there. \u201cYou left me when you knew I was weak.\u201d Her hands dug into his wrists. She was aware of the other wolf shifter walking cautiously around her.</p><p>Smart wolf, he wasn\u2019t coming too close, not yet. \u201cYou set me on fire.\u201d</p><p>The Council had been right. She should have known better than to trust the alpha.</p><p>Not even married a ful day and he was already trying to kil her. Her teeth snapped together as she glared down at him. She\u2019d actual y started to trust the wolf. How stupid was she?</p><p>\u201cI saved you,\u201d he threw at her and\u2014and he wasn\u2019t fighting her. He was just staring at her, eyes too bright, and...bleeding. Cuts and blisters covered his skin. Blisters, as if he\u2019d been in the fire.</p><p>Her head snapped up. An ugly green pickup blocked her view of the house, but she could hear the crackle of the flames and the stench of the smoke burned her nose.</p><p>\u201cI was out here with Louis when the fire started.\u201d Jace\u2019s voice hummed with quiet fury.</p><p>\u201cThen I fucking raced in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I fucking raced in for you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d...gone in there for her?</p><p>\u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d So much rage underscored his words. \u201cSo I made you drink. I knew my blood could help heal you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not dead. But close.</p><p>She gazed at him. Her thighs hugged his hips just as they had last night. The memories were there, between them both.</p><p>\u201cUh, I hate to interrupt this would-be make-out scene...\u201d The other wolf mumbled as he ran a hand over his face. \u201cBut I think we got us a real big problem.\u201d Tension had tightened the faint lines on his handsome face.</p> <p>Morgan rose slowly. Her knees wanted to wobble but she forced herself to stand. A quick glance showed the blisters on her arms were almost gone.</p><p>Such powerful blood.</p><p>Jace rose and towered over her. He glanced back at his house, and she saw the muscle flex in his jaw. \u201cSome asshole is going to pay.\u201d He pointed at the blond wolf.</p><p>\u201cLouis, get the pack.\u201d Then he was gone. Running back toward the fire. No, real y, just... no.</p><p>Morgan leapt after him. \u201cJace, stop!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy.\u201d The other guy\u2014Louis\u2014had his arms around her. She head-butted him and kept going after Jace. But Jace wasn\u2019t heading back into the flames. He raced around the house. Leaned toward the flames. Sniffed\u2014</p><p>Got a scent.</p><p>He spun around and stared at her. His whole face seemed to just go blank.</p><p>\u201cSomething you need to tel me, princess?\u201d He murmured, voice a silken threat.</p><p>The fire raged behind him. They were at the edge of the glades. No neighbors to see the flames and cal 9-1-1.</p><p>His chest was bare. His eyes bright. Sexy.</p> <p>Jace closed the distance between them and caught her hand. \u201cNow\u2019s the time. If you\u2019ve been holding back, tel me.\u201d</p><p>Holding back? Morgan shook her head.</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>What? Her head throbbed. The sun was too bright. The flames too hot, and, even with Jace\u2019s blood, she was weak.</p><p>Almost human again.</p><p>Before she could speak, Jace had her. The guy moved in one of his quick lunges and caught her in his arms. The world spun, and she found herself hanging over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJace!\u201d He ignored her yelp and marched for the truck.</p><p>Louis was already inside. Morgan slapped her hands against Jace\u2019s rather fine ass. He didn\u2019t stop marching. Didn\u2019t even pause.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Other than hauling her around like\u2014</p><p>He yanked open the passenger door and tossed her into the truck. \u201cThe game just changed on us.\u201d</p><p>Her hair fel over her eyes. Morgan shoved it back and frowned at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The truck\u2019s motor snarled to life.</p><p>\u201cYou know whose scent I caught al around that house?\u201d</p><p>Louis pul ed out his phone and dialed quickly.</p><p>Morgan licked her lips. \u201cDemon scent.\u201d It made sense. If they knew she\u2019d agreed to team up with Jace, then they\u2019d come after her. She just hadn\u2019t expected an attack so soon.</p><p>\u201cGot a fire out on Mooreline Road,\u201d Louis said into his phone. \u201cSend the trucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot demons.\u201d Jace spared a glance back at his burning house. \u201cNot this time.\u201d His gaze came back to her. \u201cYou were almost burned alive by your own kind. It\u2019s the vamps who came</p><p>\u2014their stench was al around the house. They set the fucking place to blow with you inside it.\u201d</p><p>When a wolf stormed a vampire stronghold, he damn wel stormed it. Louis drove the pickup right through the fancy electronic gate at the vampire compound. \u201cDon\u2019t do this!\u201d Morgan ordered Jace, grabbing his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake! They didn\u2019t attack me!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they had. And they\u2019d pay.</p><p>The other wolves in his pack flooded in behind them.</p><p>Attacking in the daylight gave them the advantage, and Jace was more than ready to kick some vampire ass.</p><p>He jumped out of the truck and barely held back his howl of fury. She hadn\u2019t even seemed to be breathing. Oh, yeah, vamps were about to pay. Morgan hopped out right behind him. Dogs were barking, snarling. Figured the vamps would keep Dobermans as their attack dogs.</p><p>Jace turned his head and snarled at the dog. \u201cBite me,\u201d he dared.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Morgan said, voice soft and wan because she\u2019d nearly died, \u201cbut if you don\u2019t stand down, I wil .\u201d</p><p>Then his vampiress put herself between him and the entrance to the vampire pit.</p><p>Not a pit, real y. More like a mil ion dol ar mansion. The vampires had to do everything with style.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re choosing the wrong side,\u201d he told her as his pack lined up behind him. But she shook her head even as he heard the soft echo of an alarm from inside the mansion. The vamps were coming...</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir scents were everywhere.\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind her. He\u2019d expected human guards. Instead, the vampires fil ed the doorway. Three men. Forever young. Pale like Morgan, but with wide shoulders and hard jaws.And eyes that burned with rage.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Morganna?\u201d The first guy demanded, an old-school English accent dripping from the words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d she said, not glancing back. \u201cHe thinks you tried to kil me today.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Morgan blinked and, this time, she did look back over her shoulder. \u201cTel him it\u2019s not true, Devon,\u201d she demanded. \u201cTel him you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to burn her to ash while she was stil in my bed,\u201d Jace finished, his claws stretching. It would be so easy to kil that bastard. One stroke from his claws, and the vampire\u2019s head would hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe merely...tested,\u201d Devon said quietly as he shrugged. \u201cIt was necessary.\u201d</p><p>Morgan rocked on her heels, then spun around and caught the vamp bastard by his throat.</p><p>\u201cRun that by me again.\u201d</p><p>Devon blanched. \u201cAh, Morganna...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tested me? With fire?\u201d</p><p>He tried to talk, but no sound emerged from his lips.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s startin\u2019 to remind me of someone...\u201d Louis murmured from beside Jace.</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d Jace cal ed out.</p><p>Her hold tightened on the vampire.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he can speak,\u201d Louis shouted, probably in what he thought would be a helping way.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s hold eased a bit.</p><p>Oddly enough, the other two vampires didn\u2019t move to restrain her. Smart of them, because if they\u2019d touched her, Jace would have ripped them apart. They just waited.</p><p>Watched. One even glared at Devon Shire, Council-fuckingextraordinaire-member.</p><p>Jace had come across Devon before. Almost kil ed him twice. Third time will be the charm.</p><p>\u201cYou drank his blood.\u201d Devon\u2019s voice held a distinct wheeze now. \u201cWe had to see</p><p>...had to make sure it was making you stronger...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you set me on fire?\u201d</p><p>But Devon didn\u2019t back down. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to shut the doorway to hel , you have to be able to withstand the heat, Morganna. We have to test your skin, see how it\u2019s holding up against the flames\u2014\u201d</p><p>She punched him, a hard right cut that took the vampire down.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your strength\u2019s improving, Morg,\u201d one of the other vampire\u2019s said, lips twitching.</p><p>Fuck this. \u201cKil them,\u201d Jace ordered.</p><p>Morgan whirled around, eyes wide. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>The wolves were already shifting.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He held his hand to her. \u201cNo sense in you watching them get ripped apart.\u201d</p><p>The smiling vampire lunged forward then. A tal bloodsucker, with pale green eyes and a sloping scar that wrapped around his chin. One made, not born, or he wouldn\u2019t be sporting that scar.</p><p>The blond made the mistake of putting his body between Morgan and Jace. \u201cWe\u2019re not your prey,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Morgan put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cPaul...\u201d</p><p>Fury pushed through Jace\u2019s body. There was something between them, he could see it. Smell it.</p><p>Morgan\u2019s blood, in the vampire. She\u2019d made him.</p><p>Oh, the fuck, no.</p><p>His claws burst from his fingertips as he prepared to attack. The wind whipped around them, blowing hot and hard. Wait, hot?</p><p>He glanced up at the sky and saw the creatures coming. Flying toward them.</p><p>Fucking flying in daylight.</p><p>Demons.</p><p>\u201cThey are the ones we need to fight!\u201d Devon screamed as he scrambled to his feet. \u201cNot each other!\u201d</p><p>This from the asshole who\u2019d torched his place?</p><p>But then Devon surprised him. The guy grabbed Morgan and hauled her back toward the house. \u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough yet. We can\u2019t let them get you!\u201d</p><p>Now the asshole was protecting her?</p><p>Jace\u2019s men spun around, snarling at the new threat. A threat that smel ed of brimstone and death. The demons looked like humans, for the most part. Their faces appeared human, their bodies shaped like men. But they had claws that sprouted from their hands, claws even sharper than a wolf\u2019s. Big and strong, demons had eyes that blazed as red as hel and skin that was twisted and marked with scars that sliced across their flesh. Demons could fly. Demons could control fire. And, most days, demons could kick ass. Not today.</p><p>His gaze met Morgan\u2019s. A vampire in the sunlight. Even with his blood, how strong could she be?</p><p>He shoved back the one she\u2019d cal ed Paul. \u201cGet inside.\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t move. \u201cWe fight, we don\u2019t flee, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>The demons hit the ground and came running. The wolves turned, holding their line, not attacking, not yet.</p><p>Not until Jace gave the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who gets to rip you apart,\u201d Jace promised. \u201cNot them.\u201d Demons...</p><p>\u201cNow get Morgan inside. \u201d</p><p>\u201cJace!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn at her cry. He grabbed Louis, stopping his friend before he could change. The heavy metal door swung shut behind the vampires.</p><p>The demons were smiling, showing fangs as sharp as a vampire\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGuard the door,\u201d Jace ordered. \u201cNothing gets to her.\u201d No one. Louis nodded.</p><p>\u201cSend them back to hel ,\u201d he told his men as his bones began to shift. The change didn\u2019t even hurt, not anymore. Al he could think about now was the battle. \u201cIn pieces.\u201d</p><p>The wolves attacked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting for us,\u201d Devon\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cThey\u2019re actual y honoring the agreement.\u201d Morgan paced. She\u2019d quickly changed once she\u2019d entered the compound. No longer overexposed in Jace\u2019s shirt, she now wore jeans, a t-shirt, and her boots. As she paced, the sounds of battle seemed to burn her ears. Howls. Screams. \u201cWe need to be out there!\u201d</p><p>But Paul shook his head. \u201cThe demons came at us in the daylight. They knew we\u2019d be weak.\u201d The sun would set soon, just not soon enough for them.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know we\u2019d have the wolves with us!\u201d Devon was al but crowing. \u201cThe bastards can fight and kil each other off, and when night comes, we\u2019l be stronger than them al .\u201dShe was tired of the Council leader\u2019s bul shit. Jace had fed her twice. He had to be weak from that loss, and now he was out there, fighting, while she stayed safe inside?</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019d died this morning?\u201d She\u2019d never forget waking to that blaze. The bastard must have planted one of his bombs. She knew he\u2019d taken out other enemies that way over the years.</p><p>Am I an enemy?</p><p>\u201cIt was merely a test, Morganna. Merely\u2014\u201d</p><p>More howls from the wolves and screams from the demons. A demon\u2019s scream sounded like nails ripping down a chalkboard. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d died? Jace had to pul me from the fire. He could have left me there. I would have burned.\u201d</p><p>Devon just stared back at her with his soul ess blue eyes. \u201cThen we would have known the plan wasn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>The big plan. To mix the blood of a vampire and a werewolf. To create a being strong enough to shut the doorway to hel , a being who\u2019d be able to survive the fires of hel long enough to make sure that doorway stayed closed. Forever.</p><p>A vampire couldn\u2019t do it on her own. Fire kil ed vamps too easily. At least, it had before. But today, the fire hadn\u2019t destroyed her. An inferno that should have kil ed her had only left her with blisters.</p><p>\u201cYou just need more blood from him,\u201d Devon said with a nod. \u201cMore blood, and you\u2019l be strong enough for the job.\u201d</p><p>Paul had moved to peer through the series of spy holes located along the room\u2019s perimeter. \u201cOr he wil be.\u201d</p><p>Now Devon final y showed emotion. Confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Paul whistled. \u201cThat wolf is cutting right through the demons. Slashing every last one. Never seen anything like this...\u201d</p><p>She shoved him aside and stared through the spy hole. Her gaze locked on the wolf, a wolf that was bigger than he had been last night. The giant black beast turned around and Jace\u2019s bright stare flew past her as he snarled.</p><p>His teeth and claws were covered with blood.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not supposed to be that big,\u201d Devon muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him shift before, he\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Devon broke off as he caught her arm and jerked her toward him. \u201cYou let him drink from you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulder seemed to burn, and she remembered his bite. \u201cYou know the rules of a werewolf mating. He had to drink.\u201d</p><p>But Devon started shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize...the bastard knew! \u201dHis hands wrapped around her shoulders, and he hauled Morgan off her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t give him anymore blood.\u201d Spittle flew from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Look, you know you don\u2019t have to worry about me turning him. Werewolves can\u2019t become vampires.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The transformation from human to vampire was brutal. The victim had to be near death, a heartbeat away from the afterlife. The vampire had to drain her prey and then force him to drink her own blood.</p><p>Only...werewolves had never transformed. Vamps had tried to change a few of them, centuries before, but it hadn\u2019t worked. Their beasts were too strong to die. They couldn\u2019t transform.</p><p>Devon had told her that. He\u2019d been the one to \u201cexperiment\u201d on those unlucky wolves in the past.</p> <p>Did Jace know? Did he realize that Devon had captured wolves over the centuries and sliced them apart to see how much pain they could take? To learn how fast they\u2019d regenerate?</p><p>Know your enemy. One of Devon\u2019s favorite phrases.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>He\u2019d ruled the vampires in this area for too long. But now he wasn\u2019t the strongest vamp in the room.</p><p>I am.</p> <p>Devon didn\u2019t even seem to see her as he said, \u201cThey can\u2019t become like us...\u201d His gaze stared at the past. \u201cFucking animals...should have seen it...didn\u2019t think...\u201d He spun around and his fist slammed into the wal . \u201cThey can become more.\u201d</p><p>The screams stopped, but the howls didn\u2019t. They grew louder. Wilder. The wolves had won. Vanquished the demons.</p><p>\u201cMore wil come,\u201d Paul said and she knew he was right. The flood of demons wouldn\u2019t stop, not until that doorway was blocked.</p><p>Time to shut that door. If a demon was left alive, they could force him to show them the entrance to hel .</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, Morg. You\u2019re not strong enough,\u201d Paul said. Ah, Paul, he knew her so wel . She glanced over at him. \u201cGuess we\u2019l see about that.\u201d</p><p>He flinched and there was no missing the worry on his face.</p> <p>It had been three years since she\u2019d turned him. He was the only human she\u2019d ever turned. Sometimes, she wondered...did he wish that she\u2019d just left him to die?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let him drink from you again!\u201d Devon was stil screeching as she marched away from him. \u201cMorganna! Do you hear me? You can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She threw a hard glance back at him. \u201cYou forget yourself, Devon. You can no longer tel me what I can or cannot do.\u201d She bared her teeth at him. \u201cI\u2019m not part of the vampire nest anymore.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wolf.\u201d So shove that down your throat and choke on it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t realize\u2014he\u2019l become more! \u201d</p><p>She yanked open the door and the scent of hel hit her. \u201cHe already is.\u201d And he\u2019s mine. Morgan strode into the sunlight. The big, black wolf stood in the middle of the carnage. When he saw her step out of the compound, his body tensed.</p><p>But the battle was over. His men were already shifting back to their human forms.</p> <p>He began to shift as wel .</p><p>And that was when the other two demons dropped from the sky behind him.</p><p>Demons...so tricky. So deceptive. They\u2019d waited until he was weak. His attention divided. Because of me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She screamed even as they slashed at Jace. Their claws sank into his back.</p><p>She moved faster than she\u2019d ever moved in her life. She grabbed the first demon and twisted his head. The snap barely slowed her down. She turned for the other hel spawn</p><p>\u2014</p><p>But Jace\u2019s men had already ripped him apart.</p><p>She spun back around. Jace stood before her, naked, body heaving, blood pouring from him. Fear tightened her throat. \u201cJace?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were blind, not seeming to see her at al . She stared down at his chest.</p><p>The demon\u2019s fist and claws had ripped right through him, back to front, and, oh, no, please...</p><p>The demon had cut through his heart.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Morgan caught Jace before he fel . A scream ripped from her as she held him as tightly as she could.</p><p>And she knew what she had to do.</p><p>She\u2019d found Paul like this. He\u2019d been beaten, bleeding out, dying in a dirty al ey al alone. He hadn\u2019t been able to speak because a knife had been stuck in his throat. His lips had trembled and he\u2019d mouthed, Help me.</p><p>She had. A stranger, and she\u2019d given him forever.</p><p>She\u2019d damn wel save the man she\u2019d taken as husband.</p><p>She lowered Jace gently to the ground. The pack closed in around her, nearly blocking the light. Louis stood right beside her. She grabbed his hand before he could stop her. His claws were stil out, and she sliced them down the length of her throat.</p><p>\u201cCher, no, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Blood dripped down her neck and wet her shirt. She leaned over Jace. His eyes were open. On her. \u201cDrink from me.\u201d</p><p>A slight flare of his pupils. She put her throat against his mouth. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted. His tongue licked her skin. The edge of his teeth scraped over her neck. Then he drank. Slowly at first. So slow.</p><p>After a tense moment, his hands rose and wrapped around her. He pul ed her closer, held her tighter.</p><p>Tighter.</p><p>She felt his canines expand and push into her skin. Morgan held her body stil . He needs this. His mouth worked on her flesh. Lips. Tongue. Teeth. He took.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Devon\u2019s scream. Over Jace\u2019s shoulder, she saw the Council leader trying to shove his way through the pack.</p><p>They shoved him back.</p><p>\u201cMorgan, no! He\u2019ll destroy you! All of us!\u201d</p><p>But Jace had saved them today. She closed her eyes. She\u2019d begun to feel the heavy pul of the sunlight, like a weight upon her skin. Pressing against her. Devon stopped screaming.</p><p>Her fast heartbeat slowed. Her breath sighed out of her.</p><p>Stil Jace held her. So very tight.</p><p>He...he should have enough blood now. She brought her hands up and pushed against his chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop. Fear tightened her stomach.</p><p>Then Jace swiped his tongue over her throat and his growled whisper reached her ears,</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>She wondered just how much more he would take.</p><p>Devon stumbled away from the wolves. Fucking animals. Any minute now, they might rip into him. He hadn\u2019t forgotten the alpha\u2019s order. The bastard had ordered his death as carelessly as he\u2019d order dinner. Kill them.</p><p>When the alpha\u2019s strength came back, Devon had no doubt that he\u2019d give the same order once more.</p><p>The way the alpha was gulping Morganna\u2019s blood, his strength would be back in seconds. Should have realized...so blind...</p><p>He rushed through the compound, winding down deep into its hidden tunnels.</p><p>Escape tunnels\u2014because the vampires always had to be prepared.</p><p>He snaked through the tunnels, moving perfectly in the pitch blackness. To the left, to the right...</p><p>He punched in the combination to the door in front of him. The heavy lock opened with a hiss, and he hurried inside.</p><p>There wouldn\u2019t be time to waste. Kil or be kil ed.</p><p>Once Jace finished off al the demons, there would be no stopping that alpha. He\u2019d want total control of the area.</p><p>And Devon wasn\u2019t about to bow down to an animal.</p><p>\u201cLet me the fuck go!\u201d The shout from his captive echoed in the lab. His lab. His playroom.</p><p>Devon grabbed a scalpel from the table. Its edge gleamed so perfectly in the light.</p><p>When he\u2019d first started his experiments, Devon had always used his hands. Then he\u2019d realized the others thought he enjoyed the work too much. Because I do.</p><p>So now he used the surgical instruments to make it look more...clinical. Still the same. They bleed. I smile.</p><p>No one was in the lab but his latest specimen. If Morganna knew that he hadn\u2019t stopped the experiments...</p><p>Oh, wel , the bitch couldn\u2019t stop him now. No one could.</p><p>He crossed to stand in front of the wolf. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be very useful to me, Mike.\u201d If Morganna\u2019s strength had increased with a few swal ows of wolf\u2019s blood, just how strong would he become if he drained a whole wolf?</p><p>Strong enough to fight off the alpha. Strong enough to rule. The wolf glared at Devon. \u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d</p><p>Devon sliced across the wolf\u2019s throat with his scalpel. Then he caught the flowing blood in a cup.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t dirty his teeth on the wolf\u2019s flesh.</p><p>The wolf strained against his chains as his blood poured from his body. Devon smiled.</p><p>Jace\u2019s men carried in the demon that Morgan had attacked as the wolves pushed inside the vampire stronghold. The guy\u2019s head was twisted and hung at a sagging angle. Not for long, though. A broken neck wouldn\u2019t kil a demon. But when I take that neck from his body...</p><p>Dead demon.</p><p>Jace had never been inside the vampire mansion before. He\u2019d stalked outside plenty of times. Come kil ing close, but never actual y walked the hal owed hal s. But, yeah, it was as high-priced as he\u2019d figured. Fancy furniture. Marble tiles. Big, glittering chandeliers. Money.</p><p>Class.</p><p>And...a blood fountain.</p><p>He turned away from the fountain and found Morgan staring at him. Even paler than before, but she stil met his gaze. Her lips weren\u2019t red now. Instead, they were the lightest shade of pink, and the gold had faded from her eyes.</p><p>Took too much.</p><p>Her blood and the rush of power that came with it were addictive. He\u2019d have to be more careful with her. Far more careful.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Jace asked Louis.</p><p>Vampires lined one side of the room. Wolves the other. Jace stood in the middle.</p><p>Morgan...she waited next to the vamp he\u2019d been itching to slay. The one who touched her far too much. Paul.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes. Maybe five.\u201d Louis shrugged. \u201cCould be sooner. You know they never stay out long.\u201d</p><p>Not much time, but... He strode forward and took Morgan\u2019s hand. When he touched her, he caught the deepening of her scent. Not with arousal.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Took too much.</p><p>Louis had needed to pry her out of Jace\u2019s arms. He clenched his teeth as pain ripped through him.</p><p>If Louis hadn\u2019t stopped me... His breath rushed out.</p><p>Another debt I owe that wolf.</p><p>\u201cWe need to be alone.\u201d The blood had dried on her throat. Her wounds were closed already, but dark shadows lined her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, wolf,\u201d this came from the fool who would be her protector. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing you need.\u201d</p><p>The wolves shifted, inching forward, and he could feel their aggression level spiking in the room.</p><p>Because his aggression level was damn wel spiking. \u201cDon\u2019t get between us again.\u201d</p><p>But the vampire stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath?\u201d Jace finished silkily. \u201cYou sure about that? Because one fine dark night, in an al ey that smel ed of blood and vomit, you sure seemed afraid to me.\u201d Jace wasn\u2019t exactly sure how it had happened. Vampires were the only ones who were supposed to be able to drink memories.</p><p>But when he\u2019d taken Morgan\u2019s blood moments before, he\u2019d seen her life. Seen her transform this one\u2014Paul\u2014even as she cried and whispered her apologies. She hadn\u2019t wanted to make him into a monster, but she hadn\u2019t been able to let him die, not when he\u2019d wanted to live.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole\u2014\u201d Paul lunged at Jace with bared fangs.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Morgan\u2019s quiet voice. Her hand touched Paul\u2019s shoulder. The vampire stil ed instantly.</p><p>Morgan tilted her head back and met Jace\u2019s stare. \u201cHow do you know about that night?\u201d</p><p>No point lying. Besides, he didn\u2019t want to lie. Not to her. \u201cI drank your memories, princess.\u201d</p><p>Instant murmurs of disbelief came from the vampires. Paul shook his head. \u201cNo, no way, that can\u2019t happen. Plenty of humans have tasted our blood and seen nothing. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not human.\u201d Jace stated the obvious. \u201cThose rules don\u2019t apply to me.\u201d And in their blood past, al those long centuries of hate that stood between the vampires and werewolves, wel , his kind hadn\u2019t wanted to spend time tasting a vampire\u2019s blood.</p><p>Ripping them apart. Beheading them.</p><p>Not sampling the blood supply.</p><p>\u201cThe game has changed now,\u201d he said as the vampires and wolves eyed each other. He didn\u2019t know if that was good or bad. Behind him, he heard the snap of bones.</p><p>Jace glanced back. That snap hadn\u2019t come from one of his own shifting. The demon\u2019s neck was popping back into place. Not much longer.</p><p>\u201cHold him,\u201d he ordered Louis. \u201cDon\u2019t...start until I get back.\u201d</p><p>Torture would come. Anything, everything that he had to do in order to make the demon talk.</p><p>Then he glanced back at Morgan. \u201cYou need me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d From Paul again. \u201cDo you real y think she needs someone to drain her dry?\u201d</p><p>The bastard was begging for a beating. Begging. But... Morgan cares for him.</p><p>\u201cThe way you did when she changed you? How many days did she sleep after that because you took too much? How many\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Morgan\u2019s shout froze them al . She looked like a breeze would topple her then, but her voice packed a punch of undeniable fury. \u201cYou.\u201d She jabbed her finger at Paul.</p><p>\u201cYou were desperate, changing\u2014you had to take my blood. I offered it to you.\u201d</p><p>Paul smirked. Begging.</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d She exhaled as she shook her head and focused on Jace. \u201cWhat did you think I was going to do? Let you die in front of me?\u201d Before he could answer, she ran a shaking hand over her neck. \u201cYou might be an alpha asshole, but you\u2019re mine, and I wasn\u2019t letting you go without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d Ever. His hand lifted and rubbed lightly over the marks he\u2019d left on her flesh. \u201cNow you need me... let me help you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her tongue snaked out and licked over her lower lip. He knew she understood his meaning because her fangs started to grow.</p><p>\u201cThe battle\u2019s coming. You have to be strong.\u201d A strength she\u2019d get from him. He eased back and offered his hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>But she was shaking her head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your place, wolf.\u201d</p> <p>A stiffness fil ed his chest. Pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d She grabbed his hand. \u201cSo you come with me.\u201d Then she led him away from the vampires and wolves. Led him up a spiral staircase and into a room without windows. A room that smel ed of her.</p><p>Before the door closed, he had her in his arms.</p><p>Five minutes.</p><p>Not even that. Not now.</p> <p>His lips took hers. Jace thrust his tongue inside her mouth. She kissed him back with no hesitation, even though the scent of fear stil hovered on her skin. He stroked her with his tongue, caressed with his lips, but the scent remained. Jaw clenching, he lifted his head. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes rose, and she blinked at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you fear me.\u201d He stalked away from her. It was either step away or pounce, and he wanted to show her that he could have restraint. It won\u2019t last long.</p><p>They were in an apartment of sorts. A leather couch. A TV. Bookshelves. Then toward the right...a bed. A big, four-poster.</p><p>Morgan, in that bed...</p><p>An image too tempting to resist. Let the demon wait. The vamps and wolves could keep him...entertained.</p> <p>He reached for Morgan\u2019s hand. Entwined his fingers with hers and led her to the bed. She sat down on the edge of the mattress and stared up at him. \u201cI can\u2019t figure you out, wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tasted my life.\u201d Now he truly knew what that meant. \u201cHow can I possibly have secrets from you?\u201d He lowered onto his knees and positioned his body between her spread legs. Then Jace tilted his head and offered his throat. \u201cDrink.\u201d The ultimate pose of submission. For her, only her.</p><p>She\u2019d nearly traded her life for his. Louis, we\u2019ll name our first son after you</p><p>\u2014because you fucking saved my ass.</p><p>If he\u2019d gone too far, taken too much from her...</p><p>Her eyes seemed so wide as she gazed at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fear me,\u201d he\u2019d meant the words as a plea but they came out sounding like an order. Dammit. He cleared his throat. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. I give you my word it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were already pul ing back before Louis dislocated your shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>He blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou kept your control. And the blood\u2014it was freely given.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t drinking from him. Why the hel not?</p><p>Her hand slid down his shirt. Pressed against his heart. His chest was bare. After the shift and the fury, the wolves had dressed in their back up jeans, but most hadn\u2019t bothered with shirts. Her touch seemed to burn right through his flesh.</p><p>She stared down at her hand. At his chest. \u201cWhat separates the man from the beast?\u201d</p><p>Morgan asked softly.</p><p>He forced his jaw to unlock. \u201cThere is no separation.\u201d</p><p>Her hand dipped lower. Found the snap of his jeans. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a wolf,\u201d her voice grew huskier, \u201cdo you stil have the mind of a man? Some stories say no. Others say yes.\u201d</p><p>The zipper hissed down. \u201cIt\u2019s...both.\u201d Man and beast.</p><p>Her fingers curled around his aroused flesh. \u201cHow do you see me then? As prey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The wolf had only wanted to protect her. As did the man. Her thumb slid over the head of his arousal. \u201cAs what?\u201d Her eyes held his.</p><p>\u201cAs everything.\u201d Because that was what she\u2019d become. Had it started that long ago night? Started with bloody tears and culminated when he\u2019d taken her flesh?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. To him, she was...al . Everything.</p><p>\u201cGood answer,\u201d she whispered as she leaned forward. \u201cVery, very good.\u201d Her fangs sank into him\u2014not in his throat, but at the curve of his shoulder. The exact place he\u2019d marked her for their wolf claiming. She was\u2014she was claiming him . Pleasure exploded through Jace at her bite. White-hot, pulsing. Inside, his wolf howled even as Jace wrapped his arms around Morgan and held tight.</p><p>They tumbled back on the bed. Her mouth stayed on him. He shoved off her jeans.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered with underwear. Good. That made things so much easier. Her tongue swiped over the smal wound she\u2019d made on his flesh. He shuddered against her. \u201cOh, damn...\u201d His head rose, and he stared down at her. She was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen in his life.</p><p>No way would he be heading into hel without having her once more. Jace thrust into her in one long, hard drive. Her gasp fil ed his ears, made him al the wilder, as her legs wrapped around him. Morgan arched her body and met him, thrust for thrust.</p><p>Faster, faster.</p><p>Their eyes held. Their breaths heaved out.</p><p>Her body was tight and slick, and Jace\u2019s thin control slipped away with every sensual move of her body.</p><p>He took her mouth even as he took her body.</p><p>Nothing was as good as this.</p><p>Her sex clenched around him when she came, and he felt the ripples of her release al along the length of his cock. Stil he thrust. Deeper. As far as he could go\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Morgan whispered.</p><p>In the next instant, Jace was on his back, and she rose above him. Then she rode him, her movements as wild as his, and he knew, he knew he\u2019d never find anyone else like her. He heaved up and took her breast in his mouth. The nipple was pink and sweet, and he scored her flesh with his teeth.</p><p>They both liked to bite.</p><p>This time, when she came, he erupted with her. Pleasure had him going nearly blind. He held onto her as tightly as he could.</p><p>The drumming of his heartbeat fil ed his ears. Morgan gasped his name, and he was pretty sure he\u2019d shouted hers.</p><p>The pleasure faded slowly. The ravenous need met, they stared at each other.</p><p>Jace realized this moment was important, but damned if he knew what he should say to her.Morgan didn\u2019t climb off him. She stayed there, and her pale skin seemed to shine.</p><p>From the pleasure? His blood?</p><p>\u201cIf we keep this up,\u201d she final y said as her hands slid over his chest. \u201cYou could get me pregnant.\u201d</p><p>That was the plan. Or it had been. To have a child with a vampire\u2019s immortality and a wolf\u2019s brutal strength. A child to rule them al .</p><p>But now...</p><p>Was that ever really the true plan? Or just an excuse he\u2019d made to have her?</p><p>\u201cCould you love a child that was part vampire?\u201d</p><p>I already love her mother. I have for years. Instead of answering her, he asked,</p><p>\u201cCould you ever love an animal?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Now her fingers rose and traced just under his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t see an animal.\u201d</p><p>The woman could break him.</p><p>Fuck, how had this become confession time? \u201cHel \u2019s waiting.\u201d As much as he wanted to ignore the devil at the door, he couldn\u2019t. Slowly, he eased away from her body. He rose, snagged his jeans, and dressed. His eyes couldn\u2019t seem to stay off her. She climbed from the bed. Didn\u2019t dress, but did grab his arm. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go in alone.\u201d</p><p>His body iced. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the deal.\u201d He knew. He\u2019d been the one to go to the Council and lay out the scheme. \u201cI\u2019m the one who goes in, who closes that bitch from the inside. You were the one who was supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she gave a sad shake of her head, interrupting him, and confessed, \u201cI was the one who was supposed to betray you and make sure that the doorway closed with you trapped inside.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sonofabitch. He\u2019d wondered...and had known that the vampires gave in too easily to his demands. \u201cLet me guess\u2014Devon\u2019s plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon hates wolves.\u201d A faint shrug lifted her shoulders. \u201cHe told the others I would go in as an assassin. Fool you, take your blood, and get strong enough to close the door.\u201d</p><p>His claws were out. \u201cSo why are you confessing to me? Seems like one fine plan.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d been such a blind fool. Wanting her, needing her so much, and she would have just\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecause it was never my plan.\u201d Her gaze locked on him. \u201cBut maybe those memories haven\u2019t come to you yet.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cI only saw you change Paul.\u201d He\u2019d seen it, like a living nightmare in his head. Her, running into that al ey. Finding the bloody mess that was Paul, with stab wounds al over his body and a knife shoved into his throat.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to live...</p><p>\u201cWhen we find that doorway,\u201d she told him, voice calm, \u201cI am going in with you\u2014and we\u2019re both coming out. That\u2019s the new deal.\u201d</p><p>He swal owed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I won\u2019t let you face hel alone.\u201d Now her expression changed. Softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I need to, I\u2019l haul your ass out myself. I just found you, wolf, and I\u2019m not about to lose you.\u201dHis fingers slid under the thick weight of her hair as he tilted her head back.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He kissed her. Long, hard, hot. Kissed her and wanted her again. Soon...</p><p>soon he\u2019d have her forever.</p><p>If he managed to survive the night.</p><p>The vamps and the wolves hadn\u2019t kil ed each other. Morgan thought that was a good sign. Wel , mostly good.</p><p>When she and Jace re-entered the great room, the wolves were stil lined up on the left, and the vamps were glaring on the right. The vamps seemed a bit cockier now, probably because they were gaining strength from the setting sun.</p><p>Two of the wolves held the now conscious demon. The guy\u2019s face was broken and bloody, so it looked like the wolves had been enjoying some play time. Louis raised a brow. \u201cAl better now?\u201d</p><p>Jace growled at him.</p><p>But, actual y, yes, she was better. One hundred percent better. Power seemed to pulse in her veins. If this rush would come to her each time that she and Jace exchanged blood, then she\u2019d make sure they exchanged every day for the rest of her life. Since she planned to spend al of her days and nights with him, an exchange wouldn\u2019t be a hardship at al .</p><p>Her blood would enable him to live longer. Human mates who sipped from their vampire lovers could stay young and strong as long as they had that blood supply.</p><p>She\u2019d make sure Jace fed wel and often.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeding a dog?\u201d The demon spat blood on the ground at Jace\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cVampire, don\u2019t you know better than to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jace lunged and grabbed the demon around his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to slice you open.\u201d</p><p>The demon just laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been in hell, asshole. You can\u2019t do anything to me that hasn\u2019t already been done.\u201d</p><p>And Morgan hesitated. The demon had a point.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l see.\u201d Jace didn\u2019t seem worried. \u201cOnce I slice off your hands and crack open your rib cage, we\u2019l find out if you feel like talking then.\u201d</p><p>But the demon shook his head. \u201cBeen there, done that. Why do you think we\u2019re al coming out? This world...\u201d His red eyes flew around the room. \u201cIt\u2019s life. We\u2019re coming, and we\u2019re taking it over, and you can\u2019t stop us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l shut your damn door,\u201d Jace promised, \u201cand you\u2019l stay in your cage.\u201d</p><p>More laughter. \u201cNot if you can\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l talk,\u201d Jace promised. Then he glanced back at Morgan. \u201cYou don\u2019t...want to see this.\u201d But she read his eyes and understood. Don\u2019t watch me do this. He would torture. He would push and push and push...because he wanted to save her. Save his people.</p><p>But sometimes, there was just too much darkness, too much of a price, to be paid for some actions.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another way.\u201d A better way because her gut told her that the demon wasn\u2019t bul shitting. He wouldn\u2019t break. What can we do that hell hasn\u2019t done?</p><p>Jace stil ed.</p><p>Morgan spared a swift glance for the vampires. Men. Women. Their gazes were determined, their bodies tense. They understood what she meant. They were ready.</p><p>She licked her lips and offered, \u201cWe can drink from him.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s bel ow shook the mansion, and she knew that they had the bastard.</p><p>You won\u2019t talk. Fine. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to talk,\u201d she said as she crept closer to him.</p><p>\u201cWe just need you to bleed.\u201d</p><p>Time to sample the demon\u2019s memories.</p><p>Jace blocked her path. \u201cThis is a shitty plan.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan that wil work. You know we pul memories with the bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but just what else wil happen when you bite him? You ever had demon blood?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cNever had the pleasure,\u201d she said and saw the demon tense.</p><p>\u201cIt could be poison. It could fry you from the inside out. It could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never had werewolf blood until I tasted you.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him. Only for a moment. \u201cYeah, princess, but we al know that once you go wolf, you don\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>And there, when she shouldn\u2019t have, when it was the wrong time and the wrong place, she laughed.</p><p>Jace froze. Then he squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d What was her wolf talking about now?</p><p>His eyes opened and a muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cYou aren\u2019t tasting him.\u201d He pointed to the vamps behind them. \u201cOne of those assholes can do it. They can all do it.</p><p>But not you.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed her close. \u201cI don\u2019t want you having memories of hel .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stil didn\u2019t get it. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to protect me.\u201d She motioned to the vampires.</p><p>They lined up.

She pushed past Jace and grabbed the demon, wrenching him away from the wolves. \u201cRemember me? I\u2019m the vamp bitch who broke your neck.\u201d</p><p>His red eyes bulged as she promised, \u201cI\u2019m also the one who\u2019s going to drain you dry.\u201d</p><p>Louis snapped his fingers together. \u201cNow I know who she reminds me of...\u201d His gaze flew to Jace. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Jace snarled.</p><p>\u201cCome ahead, bitch,\u201d the demon dared. \u201cYou think you\u2019re strong? My blood wil burn you from the inside out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d she whispered and moved as fast as Jace had, a blur. She grabbed the demon\u2019s head and yanked it back. \u201cBleed for me.\u201d</p><p>She sank her teeth into him.</p><p>His blood fil ed her mouth. Warm. Not burning. But bitter. So bitter. She drank and took the memories. Fire. Hel . Screams that never ended.</p><p>\u201cMorgan.\u201d Jace\u2019s hands settled on her back.</p><p>She kept drinking.</p><p>A white light entered hel . Smal . Such a narrow opening. A man\u2019s voice cal ed.</p> <p>Chanting. Serving up blood sacrifices. Trading lives because he wanted power.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d The demon bel owed.</p><p>She drank more.</p><p>More.</p><p>The doorway opened. She saw the bastard who\u2019d unlocked that door. Fucking asshole. Betrayal.</p><p>The door opened in her mind, and fire raced out, burning, burning...</p><p>Morgan jerked away, screaming, as smoke rose from her mouth.</p><p>The demon laughed. \u201cTold you, b-bitch...you\u2019l burn...\u201d</p> <p>She could feel the blisters in her throat. But...but she was already healing. Jace\u2019s blood.</p><p>She blew the smoke into the demon\u2019s face. \u201cTime for you to go back home.\u201d</p><p>He flinched.</p><p>\u201cTel me you know where the doorway is,\u201d Jace growled the words behind her. She held the demon\u2019s red stare a moment longer, long enough to see the fear flare in his eyes, then she faced Jace. \u201cI know.\u201d But first she had another matter to take care of. A little matter of a blood betrayal.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jace pul ed her away. \u201cThen it\u2019s time to kil the bastard.\u201d</p><p>The demon screamed in fury and surged against the wolves who\u2019d grabbed him.</p><p>Morgan slipped back a few steps. She caught Paul\u2019s stare and inclined her head toward the door.</p><p>The demon\u2019s screams rose.</p><p>She swal owed back the taste of ash. \u201cWhere\u2019s Devon?\u201d She whispered to Paul.</p><p>Betrayal. She should have seen this coming. He\u2019d always been such a power hungry asshole.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been testing her with that fire. He\u2019d wanted to kil her. So she wouldn\u2019t find out what he\u2019d done.</p><p>You nearly killed us all.</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon kil ing humans.\u201d Not just kil ing. Torturing. Sacrificing. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who opened the doorway.\u201d It made sense, but she\u2019d been too blind to see it before. Devon was over five hundred years old. He would know al the ancient legends and spel s. He would know how to raise demons, how to open a doorway.</p><p>And to get power, he\u2019d done it.</p><p>Only the demons he\u2019d let out hadn\u2019t exactly been keen on obeying him. You can\u2019t cage some beasts.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d Paul\u2019s hands fisted. The demon wasn\u2019t screaming anymore. Out of time.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since the wolves came inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s running.\u201d Dammit. \u201cThis is our mess to clean up.\u201d Not for the wolves. Vampire business. \u201cGet the others. Hunt him.\u201d The order she\u2019d never thought to give came from her as Morgan said, \u201cKil him.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded. He always fol owed her orders. Always.</p><p>Morgan rushed away from him, already heading to the winding tunnels that led beneath the house. Before she faced hel , she\u2019d take care of her own nightmare. And she\u2019d take ful control of her vampire nest.</p><p>Morgan raced down the stairs. The others would come soon, spreading out.</p><p>Searching. Rage fueled her blood. So many vampires had died at the hands of the demons. The demons hunted in heavy packs. Swooping in, preying when the vamps were weak\u2014 ripping us apart.</p><p>They\u2019d tried to stop them for months. And Devon, he\u2019d been the asshole to bring those monsters into the world.</p><p>She twisted to the left. Snaked down the tunnel to the right. The scent of blood hit her. Fresh blood.</p><p>Dammit, what had he done now?</p><p>A heavy metal door waited in front of her, open by a few precious inches. Open just enough to let the scent of blood spil out.</p><p>\u201cDevon!\u201d She cal ed out as she shoved at the door. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Inside, a pool of blood soaked the floor. And in the middle of that pool...the broken body of the werewolf who\u2019d attacked Jace at Howling Moon.</p><p>Footsteps thudded behind her. \u201cMorgan!\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s rumbling voice. She swal owed and glanced around the room. Blood-stained footprints led to the left, to an escape tunnel. One that opened in the heart of the swamp.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jace\u2019s shoulders brushed hers.</p><p>Paul came in behind him and scanned the room. Disgust tightened his face. \u201cLooks like Devon was stil experimenting.\u201d</p><p>Right below them. Right damn below them. The other Council members had forbidden his work long ago. But the bastard must have liked his blood and pain too much. Jace\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cHe fucking slaughtered a wolf.\u201d And that\u2019s what it was\u2014a slaughter. The wolf\u2019s flesh was a pale white, and Morgan knew that Devon had drained Mike\u2019s blood. A fresh kil . While they\u2019d been upstairs, this wolf had been dying. Jace\u2019s dark eyes locked on her.</p><p>She swal owed back the bile that rose in her throat. \u201c Jace, I-I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Like that would make it better. She should have known. Her nest. Her responsibility. It was al ...</p><p>on me.</p><p>\u201cLook, I was coming to kil Devon, okay? He\u2019s the one who opened the doorway for the demons. When I drank that demon\u2019s blood, I saw him!\u201d</p><p>Jace stared at the footprints, fol owing them with his eyes. His shoulders were tense, and she could nearly feel the fury roiling from him. \u201cThe vampires summoned the demons.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s claws burst out. \u201cThe vampires have been capturing wolves...what other little secrets haven\u2019t you told me, mate? \u201d</p><p>Oh, this wasn\u2019t going to be good.</p><p>\u201cJace, let me explain, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d He grabbed her and put his claws at her throat. \u201cToo late, princess. \u201d</p><p>Morgan knew she was staring at death.</p><p>\u201cI want every single one of you bloodsucking assholes to get in that cage.\u201d His head jerked toward the left. Toward the heavily barred cel that Devon had used to house vampire prisoners over the years.</p><p>Those bars were reinforced. Able to hold demons, wolves, and, yes, even vamps.</p><p>We won\u2019t be able to get out.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d he ordered, \u201cor I slice open her throat.\u201d</p><p>Her blood chil ed at that threat.</p><p>Paul raised his chin. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jace held her gaze. His stare seemed so cold. So...empty. Would he? \u201cGet in the cel , Paul,\u201d she told him quietly.</p><p>Jace\u2019s jaw tensed.</p><p>Footsteps shuffled and snarls fil ed the air as the vamps went into their prison.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in!\u201d Louis cal ed out.</p><p>Jace didn\u2019t let her go. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d She asked. \u201cI\u2019m the one who knows where the doorway is. You need me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon knows where the doorway is. I bet that bastard is running there right now.</p><p>How did you put it? High on wolf blood. He\u2019l think he\u2019s fucking invincible, and he\u2019l go back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p><p>\u201cEither way, I\u2019ve got his scent.\u201d Jace brought his head close to hers and those wicked claws didn\u2019t move from her flesh. \u201cI\u2019m going to track him down and rip him apart.\u201d</p><p>Because Devon had kil ed a wolf.</p><p>\u201cHe risked you. Tried to kil you.\u201d His claws fel away. \u201cThe vamp wil burn by dawn.\u201d</p><p>Wha\u2014</p><p>Jace lifted her up, moved too fast\u2014damn him\u2014and put her in the cel . Then he swung the door shut and locked her inside.</p><p>She grabbed the bars. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave us like this.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cWatch me.\u201d He paused, staring down at Mike\u2019s lifeless form.</p><p>\u201cTake care of him,\u201d he ordered two of his men, and they immediately bent to pick up the body. Then Jace fol owed the bloody trail of footprints.</p><p>\u201cJace! Dammit, I wasn\u2019t going to betray you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop, but she caught his growled, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cThen why are you doing this? Why?\u201d</p><p>One-by-one, the wolves exited the containment area. Jace was the last to leave.</p><p>His broad shoulders scraped the arching sides of the doorway. \u201cI\u2019l be back, Morgan.\u201d</p><p>Her breath heaved in her chest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not ending.\u201d He spared her a glittering stare. \u201cI\u2019m not risking you, and I\u2019m damn sure not taking the chance that the fire wil get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJace\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was gone, and Morgan was trapped with an angry cel of vampires. Her knuckles whitened around the bars. Alpha asshole. He thought he could go out and take al the risks? While she what\u2014stayed there and worried about him?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the kind of girl who stayed behind. Mostly because she wasn\u2019t a girl.</p><p>\u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d Paul\u2019s cocky voice.</p><p>She\u2019d known it, too. His claws had trembled and never so much as nicked her flesh.</p><p>\u201cWe real y going to let those wolves get al the glory?\u201d He continued. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been wanting to give Devon a beating since I turned.\u201d</p><p>She pul ed at the bars. Yes, they\u2019d been reinforced, and normal y, she\u2019d never be able to break them.</p><p>High on wolf blood.</p><p>The bars began to bend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told Paul and the others. \u201cJace isn\u2019t getting away from me.\u201d And he sure wasn\u2019t going into hel without her being there to pul her wolf right back out of the fire.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Jace and his pack chased Devon into the center of the Glades. The vamp had escaped by car, but instead of going back into the city, the guy had headed down the long, winding roads that led deeper into the growing darkness.</p><p>When the road ended, they found his car. Lights on. Doors open. Jace stared out at the night. The insects had stopped chirping when the wolves approached. They knew when danger stalked.</p><p>He inhaled, catching al the scents. Those that belonged, those that didn\u2019t. Blood.</p><p>Brimstone.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYour vamp\u2019s gonna be real pissed at you once she gets out of that cage,\u201d Louis warned him.</p><p>Tell me something I don\u2019t know. But better her alive and pissed than dead and burned to ash.</p><p>He caught the whisper of sound in the air. His head tilted back as he stared at the rising moon. He could see the shapes before the blood moon. So many. Too many.</p><p>Outnumbered. The demons were coming.</p><p>\u201cShift!\u201d They\u2019d have to change quickly. \u201cTake their heads\u2014take out as many of them as you can.\u201d</p><p>Then he leapt forward. The demons were coming because they were close to the doorway. Fuck that. Jace was slamming that door. Devon had run right back to this hole, and now Jace would kil him and stop the demons.</p><p>Endgame.</p><p>He shoved through the brush as the howls behind him fil ed the night.</p><p>Morgan had seen the doorway, the great gaping hole in the middle of the blackened earth. Devon had opened the door to hel \u2014opened it on vampire land, and she hadn\u2019t even realized it. The vamps spread out when they arrived at the battle. The snarls and growls of the wolves blended with the vicious cries of the demons. Blood bathed the ground.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any of their blood in you,\u201d she warned, stil tasting ash. \u201cAnd make sure you cover the wolves.\u201d</p><p>Because the dead were already on the ground, and she didn\u2019t want to lose anyone else. Demons flew from the air at her. \u201cGo!\u201d She shouted to the vampires. She lifted her gun. The vamps had taken the time to load up before they\u2019d gone hunting. She aimed. Fired. The closest demon hit the ground. A wolf jumped on him and bit into his neck.More shots fired. The vamps knew what to do. Take the demons down. Make them weak. Let the wolves finish the kil .</p><p>She fired as she ran through the heaving bodies. No sense cal ing for Jace. She didn\u2019t see him there. Didn\u2019t see Devon either.</p><p>The twist in her gut told her where she\u2019d find them both.</p><p>Deeper, deeper into the dark she went.</p><p>Her enhanced vision al owed her to see easily as she leapt over fal en trees and darted into the thick brush.</p><p>The crackle and hiss of fire reached her ears. So close.</p><p>The grass disappeared. The ground hardened beneath her feet.</p><p>Then she saw the broken skeletons. The remains of the sacrifices. So many. Far more than she\u2019d ever imagined. Hundreds of skul s and spines. Broken bones tossed aside like garbage. She stared at the stark white graveyard as rage fil ed her. Devon.</p><p>She leapt over the bones. There\u2014 there. A sunken, sloping entrance on the ground. Smoke trickled from the thick hole and...she could hear the faintest echo of screams emanating from within the pit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou always did let emotion rule you,\u201d came Devon\u2019s voice from the darkness.</p><p>Morgan spun around, and took a few quick steps away from the pit. \u201cYou did this.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been attacking us, Devon! Kil ing us! You were the Council leader, you had\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the Council.\u201d He smiled, showing off his bloody fangs. \u201cAnd fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cVampires were always so busy hiding. Oh, no, mustn\u2019t let the humans know we\u2019re here.\u201d He smirked at her. \u201cWrong. It\u2019s time for them to know. Time for us to show the humans that their only purpose is to feed us. They\u2019re prey. We\u2019re fucking gods.\u201d</p><p>She could only shake her head. \u201cYou bargained with the devil, you opened a doorway because\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I wanted a war. Because the vampires needed to learn...it\u2019s kil or be kil ed. We weren\u2019t meant to hide. We\u2019re meant to dominate.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. \u201cAnd so you sent the demons after your own kind? How is that us dominating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent the demons after the weak. Those vampires who can\u2019t survive don\u2019t belong in this world.\u201d His lips stil twisted in that sick grin as he said, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t make more of our kind.\u201d</p><p>More like him? No way. \u201cYou won\u2019t be changing anyone. You won\u2019t be kil ing anyone else.\u201d Where was Jace? \u201cThis ends tonight.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFunny. That\u2019s exactly what your wolf said...\u201d</p><p>A fist squeezed her heart.</p> <p>\u201cRight before I kicked his ass into hel .\u201d</p><p>The screams behind her seemed louder. Like more demons were fighting to get out.</p><p>\u201cSounds like they\u2019re enjoying their new meal.\u201d His fangs flashed in the dark. \u201cThat\u2019s how it works, you see. For them to come out, I offer a trade. A life.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why there were so many bones. A skeleton for each demon he\u2019d brought forth.</p><p>\u201cThey devour the flesh, then toss out the parts that are too hard.\u201d</p><p>Not Jace. He wasn\u2019t in that pit. \u201cWe\u2019re closing that hole.\u201d</p><p>Devon took a step toward her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that kind of power. You think you\u2019re so fucking special.\u201d Another step. \u201cJust because you were born pureblood. You always thought you were better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d But I do now. I\u2019m not a psychotic asshole, so yes, that makes me better.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know why I wanted you to marry the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Wel , saving the vamp nest obviously wasn\u2019t the reason. Morgan held her ground.</p><p>Hel waited behind her, and this bastard caged her in front.</p><p>\u201cI needed you to get close to him,\u201d Devon said. \u201cI needed you to take his blood</p><p>...because I wanted to give the demons a special tribute.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cYou see, now that they\u2019ve been kil ing, they\u2019re developed a taste for wolf blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not taking his blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in order to close the deal with them, I had to prove how much I\u2019d be wil ing to sacrifice.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWith demons, it\u2019s al about the sacrifice. You have to offer them something, or the lazy assholes won\u2019t do a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve offered them humans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m fucking tired of hiding in the shadows. The vampires wouldn\u2019t take control, they were too scared of humans finding out the truth. But my demons\u2014 they\u2019re not afraid of anything.\u201d</p><p>The screams from the pit almost drowned out his words. \u201cWhat are you sacrificing?\u201d</p><p>Because, shit, this was a trap. For the wolves. For Jace. For\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Then he lunged at her.</p><p>But Morgan was ready. She grabbed his arms, twisted, and tossed the traitor right over her shoulder. He hit the ground just feet away from the pit, and smoke bil owed out in a heavy burst.</p><p>He flew back to his feet. Smiled. \u201cThis wil be fun.\u201d He licked his lips, tasting the blood that stained his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re the only pureblood around here. You\u2019re the best sacrifice I can give them. I bet you\u2019l be worth ten demons...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d lost it. \u201cAnd I bet it wil hurt when you fal into hel .\u201d</p><p>That wiped the smile off his face. \u201cYour wolf sure screamed when the demons took him.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, that was the second time he\u2019d said\u2014her gaze darted to the pit. \u201cJace!\u201d</p><p>Devon slammed into her, and they hit the earth. \u201cBitch, I\u2019ve got wolf blood in me.</p><p>More than you. I drained that mutt.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d left Mike\u2019s broken body behind. Another casualty.</p><p>Morgan kicked up, slamming her knee into his bal s. He jerked back. \u201cYou\u2019ve got wolf blood,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now you also have bal s in your throat.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to her feet. \u201cJace!\u201d Her scream broke through the night. He couldn\u2019t be in that pit, he couldn\u2019t...</p><p>Devon\u2019s arms wrapped around her from behind. He squeezed so tight she lost her breath and her ribs burned...burned.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Pain beat through her as her ribs broke.</p><p>\u201cSo tired of you...\u201d Devon lifted her and carried her toward the pit. \u201cFucking a wolf</p><p>blending with humans...crying when you lost the light...\u201d</p><p>She slammed her head back and heard the sweet crunch of bones when she broke his nose. Morgan clawed at his arms, slicing open his flesh as she fought him. His blood littered the ground as he took her to the pit.</p><p>\u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>Jace. His roar. Relief had her feeling light-headed. Or maybe that dizziness was from the pain.</p><p>Jace leapt forward. He was naked and blood poured from a gash on his cheeks.</p><p>His eyes glowed as he raised his claws and ran toward them.</p><p>Devon had her nearly over the pit. This was what she\u2019d planned. To enter hel . To close the door from the inside out.</p><p>Only...wel , in the original plan, Jace had been the one to go through the doorway.</p><p>She was supposed to stay back and then pul him out.</p><p>I won\u2019t sacrifice him.</p><p>The rules had indeed changed. Jace didn\u2019t realize it. She did. If demons were al about sacrifice, then she\u2019d give them a sacrifice al right.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t give them Jace.</p><p>\u201cWatch her burn, wolf!\u201d Devon shouted. \u201cWatch. Her. Burn!\u201d</p><p>Morgan stopped fighting. Instead of slicing her nails against Devon, she twisted her hands and locked tight to him. Her gaze met Jace\u2019s. He yel ed her name.</p><p>\u201cBring me back,\u201d she whispered. Then Morgan heaved toward the pit, and she yanked Devon with her.</p><p>He tried to wrench back his arms, but she wouldn\u2019t let go. His yel s fil ed her ears as he fought and twisted, but Morgan wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>No more dead humans. No more tortured wolves. This was it.</p><p>They fel into the pit, and the screams from the demons drowned out her voice as she told them, \u201cI\u2019ve got a sacrifice for you, assholes...\u201d</p><p>The fire burned, blasting at her skin and she refused to cry out. Even when the demons reached for her.</p><p>Jace\u2019s heart stopped when Morgan jumped into that fiery pit. \u201cNo!\u201d Not her. She wasn\u2019t supposed to go in. Not. Her. He flew forward, and his body slammed into the ground even as his arms snaked into that hole in a desperate bid to grab her.</p><p>He\u2019d moved fast, faster than he\u2019d ever moved in his life, and when he shoved his hands into that hot furnace, he touched...</p><p>Flames.</p><p>The fire lanced his skin, but he didn\u2019t let go. He could feel a body in the middle of that wild heat. He could smel the acrid scent of burning flesh.</p><p>Morgan.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let go. He pul ed even as he felt another force tugging his prize back down.</p><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t have her!\u201d He yel ed as the fire licked him.</p><p>His upper body fel into the pit as he struggled.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Jace!\u201d Louis\u2019s yel from behind him. Then suddenly Jace felt other hands on his body, trying to haul him back.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going back without Morgan\u201cKeep him!\u201d He roared the words in the fire.</p><p>\u201cChoke on him\u2014but give her to me!\u201d</p><p>A breath of flames blew against him and blisters immediately covered his flesh.</p><p>\u201cGive her to me!\u201d He bel owed.</p><p>\u201cPull him up!\u201d Louis snarled at the same instant. \u201cGet him out of there, now!\u201d</p><p>They yanked him back, but he didn\u2019t let go of the fiery prize he held. Be Morgan. Be</p><p>He broke from the pit and fire raced along his body. Louis shoved at him and Jace fel to the ground. He rol ed, battling the flames on him and\u2014 on her. Sweet fuck, he\u2019d pul ed her out.</p><p>The others immediately joined him and battled the flames that covered her flesh.</p><p>Red, swol en, every inch of her body had felt the kiss of the fire. Should have been me.</p><p>Her eyes weren\u2019t open. \u201cMorgan?\u201d Now, he was afraid to touch her. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her, and he knew his touch would. She was injured so badly, even a breath on her skin would hurt.</p><p>His touch would pain her, but his blood wouldn\u2019t. Jace lifted his hand to his mouth and bit his wrist. He tore with his teeth and put his hand over her mouth. \u201cPrincess, please...\u201d</p><p>The blood trickled into her mouth. Her lips moved the faintest bit against his skin.</p><p>\u201cTake more.\u201d She could take everything if she needed it.</p><p>\u201cAlpha.\u201d Louis\u2019s quiet voice had his head lifting. His friend stared at him with a tense face. \u201cYou\u2019re weak, too. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s yours, but she\u2019s also pack.\u201d Louis offered his bleeding wrist. \u201cIf the blood of one wolf makes her strong, how fast do you think she\u2019l heal when she drinks from six?\u201d</p><p>And the others who\u2019d survived the battle crowded behind him. Al had their wrists open. Al were ready to sacrifice for the vampire who\u2019d seen hel .</p><p>As she fed from him, her lips like a whisper on his skin, Jace\u2019s gaze tracked back to the pit. Only the entrance wasn\u2019t there any longer. Dirt had fil ed in, total y blocking the gaping hole. The ground was blackened, cracked, but no smoke drifted into the air.</p><p>The doorway was closed.</p><p>He leaned close to her. \u201cYou did it,\u201d he whispered. Her vampires were safe. The battle was over.</p><p>Now, his princess just had to survive.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The vampiress walked into the werewolf bar as if she owned the place. Since she was mated to the alpha, Jace figured that, wel , she pretty much did. Her skin was pale and perfect, not even a blister left from the fire that had nearly stolen her from him. Her lips were red, ful , and he\u2019d soon feel them beneath his mouth. She was wearing a new pair of fuck-me boots that showed off the long length of her legs. And her eyes\u2014they were on him.</p><p>When the others became aware of her, they stopped talking. Heads swiveled toward her. Toward him. The bar waited.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. Jace wanted to jump up, run to her, grab her, but he was also enjoying the sexy picture she made as she crossed the bar.</p><p>Morgan smiled at him, flashing fangs. \u201cThe Miami Vampire Council would like to official y extend its appreciation to you,\u201d she said, her voice clear and her eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cAnd if there is anything that the Council can do for the pack...\u201d She stopped just a foot away from him. \u201cYou have only to ask,\u201d Morgan finished, her voice softer.</p><p>She\u2019d spent two days healing. Even with al the wolf blood, she\u2019d had to battle to stay alive. He\u2019d been by her side, determined to keep death away.</p><p>He\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>When she\u2019d woken, the vampires had made her the head of their Council. He knew she\u2019d weeded out the vamps who\u2019d been secretly working with Devon. The bastard hadn\u2019t been implementing his plan alone.</p><p>She\u2019d cut the head off the snake when she sent Devon to hel , and now Jace knew that she\u2019d cut up the body, too.</p><p>Stil , he didn\u2019t touch her, not yet. \u201cGlad the Council approves,\u201d he said, his own voice mild.Understanding flared in her eyes. She lifted her hand and put her palm against his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have my personal gratitude...\u201d Her lips curved. \u201cFor pul ing my ass out of hel .\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. Pressed it harder against his chest. \u201cLeaving you there wasn\u2019t exactly an option for me.\u201d</p><p>Jace saw the delicate movement of her throat as she swal owed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d Louis cal ed out. \u201cWhat did you see, cher ?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cIt was damn hot.\u201d</p><p>Some of the wolves laughed.</p><p>\u201cAs for what I saw...\u201d Morgan shook her head. \u201cSome things are better not said.\u201d</p><p>When she turned back to him, memories were in her eyes. While her body might have healed, Jace knew she\u2019d carry the scars inside. Some memories couldn\u2019t be forgotten.</p><p>\u201cIs the gateway closed for good?\u201d Because he didn\u2019t want any more demons coming after her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stil held her hand. She didn\u2019t pul away. She inched closer as she said, \u201cIt closed when the demons kil ed Devon. He was the sacrifice I gave to them. He opened the pit, so it only seemed fitting that he close it.\u201d</p><p>Jace waited. He knew there was more.</p><p>\u201cI made a deal while I burned.\u201d Her lashes lowered as she stared at their hands.</p><p>His dark, hers so light. After a moment, she glanced back up at him. \u201cI told those demon assholes that if they accepted Devon and shut the door, I wouldn\u2019t send my wolf down to tear hel apart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he would have.

But hel wasn\u2019t ready for you.\u201d Her hand fisted beneath his. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think the guy in charge down there real y liked for his demons to escape.\u201d</p><p>No, Jace bet he hadn\u2019t been eager to lose those bastards. \u201cSo it\u2019s over,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Now her body brushed against his. \u201cThe demons are gone, but things are far from over.\u201d Her head tilted back. Her lips were inches from his. \u201cIn fact, I think you promised me that things would just be getting started...\u201d</p><p>They would be.</p><p>\u201cYou locked me in a cage,\u201d she told him, a faint frown pul ing between her eyes. He brought his hands up to curl around her shoulders. \u201cBut I also pul ed you out of hel .</p><p>Makes us even, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her soft laughter put an ache in his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she told him, \u201cI think that might put you ahead.\u201d</p><p>His lips took hers because his control broke. The kiss was too rough, too wild, but that was his way.</p><p>And she kissed him back just as wildly and with just as much desperate need. He lifted his mouth from hers long enough to growl, \u201cThere\u2019s no score between mates. You don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d He wanted her out of the bar and naked beneath him.</p><p>\u201cI owe you forever,\u201d she told him as she rose onto her toes and kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you.\u201d</p><p>Forever with his vampiress...it was the only thing he wanted.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, wolf,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Enough. He grabbed her and hoisted her high into his arms. The pack shouted and laughed as he passed them, but he didn\u2019t slow down. He wanted her alone. Wanted in her.</p><p>Jace took her upstairs. Since his house had burned, he\u2019d taken over Howling Moon. The apartment above the bar had a bed, and that was al he needed. He kicked the door shut behind them and lowered her in front of him. Morgan smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to say that you love me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cBut...you already know.\u201d She had to know.</p><p>\u201cA woman stil likes to hear the words.\u201d</p><p>He yanked off his shirt and kicked off his boots.

Then turn the page to check out Cynthia Eden\u2019s sexy werewolf romance novel, NEVER CRY WOLF, available from Kensington Brava in July of 2011. Excerpt from NEVER CRY WOLF by Cynthia Eden (Kensington Brava, July 2011):</p><p>Lucas Simone definitely wouldn\u2019t classify as handsome, but Sarah real y wasn\u2019t the type to be swayed by a pretty face.</p><p>She was much more the I-need-a-freaking-badass-to-save-my-ass right then type.</p><p>\u201cI should explain...\u201d She began, clearing her throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should.\u201d An order.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cUh, I think it\u2019s important to note that I saved your hide back there.\u201d Very, very important to note. In fact, she was wagering on the old wolf pack code to help her out. The I-Scratch-Your-Back, You-Protect-Mine code. He grunted. \u201cI didn\u2019t need saving, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d The wolf would stil be caged if it hadn\u2019t been for her\u2014and the folks she\u2019d bribed. Using the last of my cash.</p><p>She needed shelter. Her growling stomach reminded her that she also needed food. And she desperately needed some serious muscle.</p><p>Her gaze dropped down to his chest.</p><p>Muscle, check.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had sex, lover.\u201d He drew the last out, more like a growl instead of a word. Sarah couldn\u2019t help it, she flushed. She felt her face heat and knew she had to be beat red. The curse of her fair skin. She always blushed too fast. \u201cYou were in jail.</p><p>They were penning a murder rap on you.\u201d Facts that real y shouldn\u2019t have to be pointed out to the ungrateful wolf. Come on. Where was her thank you?</p><p>\u201cI remember every woman I\u2019ve had sex with,\u201d he continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>His eyes, hooded, swept over her, making her cheeks burn al the more. She\u2019d dressed, deliberately provocative, before going down to the station. Her red blouse plunged to reveal the swel of her breasts. The short, black skirt revealed a long expanse of leg. Her sandals were smal , curved and designed more to be sexy than serviceable. He whistled slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you.\u201d</p><p>Right, and she didn\u2019t buy for a minute that the guy remembered every woman he\u2019d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cSome women like to take things slow. They like to kiss, they like to stroke. Others like to strip, to fuck, as fast as possible.\u201d A pause as his eyes rose back to hers. \u201cThey like it rough because they like the rush of being with a monster.\u201d</p><p>She swal owed and took a quick step back, unable to help herself because Lucas looked very, very threatening.</p><p>\u201cAre you one of those women?\u201d He moved forward, closing that distance. His hand lifted and traced her cheek. \u201cDo you like the thril of walking on the wild side?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing. Her knees were knocking again\u2014wel , okay, they\u2019d never stopped. She licked her lips and managed, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared and the grin that curved his lips was grim. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hel . Shifter senses. Some said their senses were acute enough to catch a lie.</p><p>Not to actual y smel a lie, but to hear the jerk of an increased heartbeat, to scent the sweat that broke through the skin at a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turned on right now,\u201d he told her, voice so rough that she almost shivered,</p><p>\u201cjust like you were when we kissed outside that damn cage.\u201d</p><p>Now what was she supposed to say to that? Especial y since the guy was right?</p><p>His hand slid down her face and his fingers curled over her throat. His palm pushed against her pulse. He didn\u2019t hurt her, not like he\u2019d hurt the cop, but Sarah tensed, knowing just how dangerous he could be.</p><p>I saw the photos. He\u2019s killed before. Without remorse. Fast, brutal. I know what he can do.</p><p>That\u2019s why she had come to him.</p><p>When a girl was caught between hel and a hard place, she needed the devil to help her out. \u201cWho are you?\u201d He breathed the words against her. \u201cNot some angel come to save me in my dark hour of need...\u201d</p><p>Hardly. She managed to lift her chin. \u201cLet go of me, and I\u2019l tel you everything.\u201d</p><p>Almost everything. Okay, not even almost, but at least the important parts.

She wasn\u2019t exactly sure what she was doing here but for the tenth time in the last hour she regretted her decision to put any credence to that anonymous email. \u2018Want the story of the year?</p><p>Underwood mansion. Nine o\u2019clock. Tonight. Don\u2019t trust anyone and don\u2019t be seen.\u2019</p><p>The cryptic message annoyed her. As one of the few journalists in the smal town of Hudson Creek, Texas, she\u2019d had no choice but to fol ow up on the lead. She certainly wasn\u2019t going to give the story to someone else.</p><p>Since she\u2019d grown up here\u2014and had attended a few high school parties at the mansion courtesy of Tara Underwood\u2014she knew exactly where the security cameras were and how to avoid them. Squashing the twinge of guilt at using that knowledge against her friend\u2019s parents, she peered around the pil ar. A bright ful moon hung high in the sky il uminating only one car. The District Attorney\u2019s Mercedes. Made sense Richard Underwood would be home. She doubted he\u2019d sent her the email because what could Richard be doing to warrant such a mysterious message?</p><p>Frowning, she glanced down the long street. The upscale neighborhood was quiet tonight. Stil she tucked her long hair into the thick knitted cap she\u2019d brought and pul ed it down low on her head. Without it, her strawberry blonde hair would be like a beacon for anyone to see. Wearing al black and feeling like a thief, she gritted her teeth and sprinted toward the closest oak tree on the property. Using the darkness and shadows as her friend, she hurried toward the six foot wal surrounding the property. Her heart pounded wildly and her palms were clammy inside her gloves. She hadn\u2019t even told her boss where she was going. But she wasn\u2019t total y unprepared. Her Glock 33 was tucked into the back of her pants as a precaution.</p><p>As she crept down the length of the brick wal , the sound of a male voice shouting made her pause. She was right in line with the main house but the voice was farther away. Almost like it was outside, but too muted. The pool house.</p><p>Careful to dodge two of the security cameras, she moved fast until she was hunkered down by a couple of overgrown bushes. The lights from the pool house were on, but the blinds were shut. She could see two silhouettes moving around inside. The shapes were too blurry to make out whether the people were male or female.</p><p>After glancing around the backyard to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed any more video cameras, she pul ed her cap down lower and began making her way across the grass. It was almost nine o\u2019clock so maybe this meeting was what her anonymous email had been talking about. A man started shouting again and her curiosity surged higher. She couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying but his tone was angry. As she started to move closer the very distinctive sound of gunshots erupted.</p><p>Pop. Pop. Pop. One shot right after another.</p><p>Then silence. Adrenaline surged through her like a raging river. And she was standing right in the middle of the yard like a freaking target. Not caring if any of the cameras caught her, she ran toward the cluster of bushes lining the pool house and jumped behind them. She needed to cal the cops, but hiding was her number one priority. Eve held her breath and when there were no other sounds she raised her head and tried to look in one of the windows. The blinds were drawn shut and she could barely see through the sliver between the edge of the blinds and the edge of the window. Immediately she spotted a pair of male dress shoes. Expensive shoes. From the angle it looked like they were attached to someone lying on the ground. Someone not moving. Slowly, she reached down to grab her cel phone out of her pocket. When she patted nothing, she inwardly cursed. Sure, she\u2019d remembered her gun but she\u2019d left her damn phone in her purse which was in her car a few blocks over. A lot of good that would do her now. If someone was dead or dying, she had to get help.</p><p>The sound of a door opening and then slamming shut made her duck back down into the bushes. She hoped her dark clothing would help conceal her. Even though she hated to move, she withdrew her gun. Her hand shook slightly but she\u2019d spent countless hours on the range. When the time came, she knew she could use it if she had to. At the sound of footsteps running away, she inched above the foliage only to see the French door that led into the main house slam shut. A light went on in one of the rooms downstairs and then a few seconds later a light upstairs flipped on.</p><p>Taking a chance, she hurried from her hiding place and ran to the front of the pool house. Eve cringed as her boots thudded against the stone patio at the front of the smal structure but she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><p>Her time was limited.</p><p>Easing the door open with her shoulder, she kept her gun tight in her hands. Her gut roiled at the sight in front of her. Next to the splatters of blood on the slick tile floor, the pale yel ow wal s seemed garish and too bright. Right beside the bil iard table in the corner of the room, Al en freaking Martin lay on his back. His dark unblinking eyes were wide open, and a look of shock covered his handsome face. Her gut told her he was dead.</p><p>Eve hadn\u2019t exactly liked the guy but, damn. She quickly peeked back out the door and when she saw no one was there, hurried over to the body. After spending months embedded with the troops in Afghanistan, she\u2019d seen her share of dead bodies and she had a feeling he was gone, but she checked his pulse anyway.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Crimson flowed from the three gaping holes in his chest and was beginning to pool on the tile floor. The coppery scent of death fil ed her nostrils.</p><p>Instinctively she started to step back. She didn\u2019t want to contaminate the crime scene and she real y didn\u2019t want to leave any evidence behind. She had no business being here but she did need to cal the cops</p><p>\u2014even if she didn\u2019t have much faith in their abilities. Her car was blocks over and she couldn\u2019t waste that much time. She just hoped Martin had a phone on him.</p><p>Avoiding the growing pool of blood, she felt the front of his jacket pocket until she found his cel . Once her fingers clasped around it she hurried back to the door. When she looked out she saw the light upstairs in the main house shut off.</p><p>Crap!</p><p>Whoever had done this was probably coming back. She just couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around the fact that Richard Underwood had shot Al en Martin. Sure, Martin was sleazy, but Underwood was a good, honest DA. Or she\u2019d thought he was. Now it looked like he might be a kil er. Hurrying back the way she\u2019d come, she paused once she was outside the fenced yard to use Martin\u2019s phone. She dialed 911.</p><p>As soon as the operator picked up she started whispering into the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s a dead body at the Underwood mansion. 685 Kent Ave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am, can you please repeat that address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dead body in the pool house behind the Underwood mansion on Kent Avenue. Al en Martin has been shot three times in the chest and he\u2019s not breathing.</p><p>Hurry!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am, are you tel ing me that Al en Martin is dead in the DA\u2019s pool house?\u201d Eve doubted the operator was supposed to let her disbelief show, but in a smal town she\u2019d have no doubt where the Underwood mansion was and exactly who owned it.</p><p>She sighed at the woman\u2019s question. The dispatcher should already be contacting a patrol car. Another strike against the police department of Hudson Creek. They\u2019d screwed up the prosecution of the man who\u2019d kil ed her parents. Why not screw this up too?</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m tel ing you. Send someone now. The kil er is stil here.\u201d It was hard to keep her voice a whisper when she wanted to shout at the operator.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sending a patrol over but I need to know who I\u2019m speaking to.\u201d</p><p>Not freaking likely.</p> <p>Instead of answering, Eve hung up. She couldn\u2019t afford to say anything else. She\u2019d trespassed on the property and admitting that to the sheriff would give him an excuse to waste hours interrogating her. As she glanced around she realized no one must have heard the shots because the street was deathly quiet. She desperately wanted to wait around and make sure the cops showed up but knew she couldn\u2019t. If they found her here she\u2019d be in a world of trouble. Hurrying, she continued her escape down the sidewalk. When the phone she\u2019d taken started ringing, she jumped. The cal er ID</p><p>screen said restricted.</p><p>\u201cHey, I hear it,\u201d a thick, accented male voice said from behind the fence of the Underwood\u2019s place. Panic jumped in Eve\u2019s chest. She pressed the end button, effectively silencing the cal as she started running down the sidewalk. Her boots thudded loudly but there was nothing she could do about it. She wanted to turn it off completely but didn\u2019t have time to waste.</p><p>\u201cHey! Stop!\u201d the same voice shouted behind her a few moments later. A sharp pop blasted through the air and the trunk of one of the trees lining the street splintered. The pop sounded again and Eve felt a gush of air rush past her face. Someone was shooting at her!</p><p>Taking a sharp right, she darted across the Hawkins\u2019 lawn. Even though they had an incredible house their security was shit and she knew they had an opening in their wrought iron fence in the backyard. If she could just make it.</p><p>Her leg muscles strained and for the first time in years she was thankful for her daily jogging routine. Pumping her arms and legs, she cleared the edge of the house. A spotlight on the side of the house flipped on\u2014likely motion sensors\u2014but she didn\u2019t pause.</p> <p>It almost felt as if someone was breathing down her neck, but she knew it was fear and adrenaline surging through her. Then she heard a muttered curse farther behind than before. At least they weren\u2019t stil shooting. Probably because whoever it was didn\u2019t want to draw more attention to themselves. She needed to make it to the opening and hoped no one saw her slip through. Her car was on the next street over. Her heart pounded that erratic tattoo against her chest as she dove over a cluster of bushes lining the back fence.</p><p>Blood rushed loudly in her ears as she began to slowly crawl toward the opening.</p><p>When the phone started ringing again, her chest tightened. They were trying to track her using the sound. She silenced it again then slid the back casing off. She\u2019d only have a few seconds to do this. Sliding the SIM card out, she put it in her pocket then left the phone lying in the dirt. As she continued crawling, she pul ed her gun out. When she reached the smal gap in the fence she shimmied under it. Ignoring the dirt coating her hands and the underbrush caught in her cap and clothes, she shoved up and ran through the neighboring backyard.</p><p>After risking a brief glance behind her, she saw she wasn\u2019t being fol owed. She al owed herself a smal measure of relief but didn\u2019t stop running. Even if they were stil looking for her, they weren\u2019t going to find her.</p><p>Unfortunately she couldn\u2019t go home. She hadn\u2019t recognized the voice but she couldn\u2019t be sure whoever had been chasing her hadn\u2019t identified her. That left one couldn\u2019t be sure whoever had been chasing her hadn\u2019t identified her. That left one place to go. Macklin wasn\u2019t going to be happy to see her, but Mr. Tal , dark, and too-sexy-for-his-own-good would have to deal with it. He was one of the few people on the planet she would trust with her life.</p><p>Mac paused as he ran a towel over his damp hair. Then he heard the sound again. Someone was banging on his front door. Insistently. He glanced at the watch he\u2019d left on his bathroom counter. It was almost ten. Normal y he\u2019d be in bed by now and so would most of his men, but they\u2019d had trouble with some of the cattle getting out after a section of one of his fences had been intentional y knocked down. By drug smugglers no doubt. They were getting worse in this area and he was fed up with it. Without bothering to put on clothes, he headed toward the front door. That\u2019s when he heard the one voice that had the ability to make him go rock hard in seconds.</p><p>\u201cMacklin Quinn, I know you\u2019re in there! You better open this door right now!\u201d Eve\u2019s shouts were fol owed by three more bangs.</p><p>For such a petite woman she had a loud knock. Shaking his head, he jerked the door open.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, Mac...\u201d She trailed off as she stared at him. Unabashedly her eyes tracked down his bare chest to the damp towel hanging on his hips.</p><p>Her peaches and cream complexion often gave away her emotions and now was no different. Those dark eyes of hers flared with momentary interest as they reached the top of his towel. When her gaze landed on his growing erection, her cheeks tinged an adorable pink and she quickly looked up. \u201cUh...do you have company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The only company he wanted was her. In his bed. But that wasn\u2019t going to happen. So why was she here?</p><p>She sighed and visibly relaxed. \u201cI need a place to stay tonight.\u201d</p><p>Mac wouldn\u2019t mind accommodating her but he knew her wel enough that she wasn\u2019t looking to jump into his bed. If only. He frowned as he took in her appearance. \u201cWhat the hel happened to you, Eve?\u201d The question came out harsher than he intended. Her hair was hidden by a dark cap and she wore al black, like some sort of cat burglar. Dirt smudges covered her face and...were those leaves sticking out of her col ar?</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and eyed him nervously. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to let me in?\u201d</p><p>Sighing because he couldn\u2019t say no to her, he stepped back. When he shut the door behind her she wrung her hands in front of her stomach. \u201cI did something stupid tonight but I\u2019m not going to tel you what it is if you\u2019re going to give me a lecture.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. If the stubborn woman was actual y admitting she\u2019d done something stupid, he\u2019d no doubt need a shot of whiskey. Stepping further into the foyer, he motioned with his hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go to my office.\u201d</p><p>Once they reached his office she tugged the cap off her head and al those gorgeous strawberry blonde waves fel around her face and shoulders. He resisted the very real urge to reach over and run his hands through her hair. To cup her head tight, pul her close, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you put on a shirt or something,\u201d she muttered as she sat on the cushy chair across from his desk.</p><p>He stiffened at her words. Instinctively he rubbed a hand over his left side and al the hideous scarred skin. It didn\u2019t hurt anymore and most days he forgot about it but now...he wished he had put on a shirt. He didn\u2019t like her seeing this deformed side of him.</p><p>Before he could respond she continued. \u201cDon\u2019t get that hurt look on your face. You know I didn\u2019t mean it because of your scars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you say it?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed again as she found a spot on the wal behind him to stare at.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t think with you half naked.\u201d The way she spoke through gritted teeth told him she meant it even if she didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t please him, but it did. Probably too much. He bit back a grin because it would only annoy her. Eve was one of the few women he knew who didn\u2019t focus on superficial stuff. And she\u2019d been one of the few people who hadn\u2019t acted like she felt sorry for him when he\u2019d moved home injured, scarred and pissed off at the world. No, she\u2019d told him to get over himself and be thankful he was alive.</p><p>\u201cStay put and don\u2019t get into trouble for sixty seconds, okay?\u201d Without waiting for a response he hurried to his room and tossed on a pair of faded jeans and a sweater.</p><p>He found her sitting in the same spot with that worried expression on her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saw a murder,\u201d she blurted. As she launched into a crazy story he was torn between strangling her and hugging her. When she final y finished she tucked a wayward curl behind her ear and stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou real y think Richard Underwood kil ed Martin?\u201d Al en Martin was one of the sleaziest men Mac knew. He owned five car dealerships around the immediate area and lived up to that greasy car salesman clich\u00e9. But that didn\u2019t mean he deserved to be shot.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know who kil ed him, but Richard\u2019s car was outside the house. Whoever chased after me wasn\u2019t him. That much I\u2019m pretty sure of. The guy had an accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he cal ed the phone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you took.\u201d It was smart she\u2019d taken it to cal the police, but stupid that she\u2019d been there by herself in the first place.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt. When he cal ed Martin\u2019s phone he said \u2018I hear it\u2019 or something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he was probably talking to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d Her eyes glazed over for a moment and he could practical y see the wheels turning in her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Instantly she jerked out of her trance and cleared her throat. \u201cNothing. Can I stay here tonight? I don\u2019t think whoever it was recognized me but just in case I\u2019d feel safer here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to cal Sheriff Marcel,\u201d he said mildly, knowing it wouldn\u2019t do a bit of difference in convincing her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo way. Those jerks don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019l probably think it was me or something.\u201d</p><p>Mac bit back a sigh because he understood her anger. Her parents had been kil ed by a drunk driver and the current sheriff\u2019s predecessor had botched the entire process. It had gone to trial but when they\u2019d lost the blood test results with the other driver\u2019s blood alcohol content, it had been over before it began. And it didn\u2019t help that the attending officer had been a new recruit and had gotten so flustered on the stand, the defendant\u2019s attorney had ripped him apart.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lump Marcel and his guys in with...his predecessor.\u201d Mac didn\u2019t even like to say Frank Reed\u2019s name. It only made pain flash in Eve\u2019s eyes and seeing that was like someone stabbing him.</p><p>\u201cI can do whatever I want,\u201d she said, though she\u2019d lost most of her steam.</p><p>\u201cBesides, Marcel\u2019s mad at me because he thinks I got in the way of his last investigation. I don\u2019t want to give him more ammunition against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pissed at you because you keep turning him down for dates.\u201d How did she not know that?</p><p>Eve blinked twice then frowned at him. \u201cHe\u2019s not serious.\u201d</p><p>Mac snorted. Oh yes, the sheriff was. He\u2019d been after Eve since she\u2019d moved back to town a couple years ago. And he wasn\u2019t the only one. It shouldn\u2019t bother Mac. He had no claim on her. But damn if he didn\u2019t want her for himself. Things between them would be too complicated though and he couldn\u2019t travel down that road with her. \u201cFine, I\u2019l place a cal to him tomorrow and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jumped out of her seat. \u201cNo! I already have a plan and I don\u2019t need your help.</p><p>Tomorrow I\u2019m going to head to the station and act like I\u2019m fol owing up on a lead about Al en Martin. I can\u2019t accuse the DA of anything until I\u2019m positive he\u2019s involved in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think just showing up at the station is suspicious?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pul ed into a thin line as she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m always bugging the sheriff about stuff.\u201d</p><p>Mac scrubbed a hand over his face. It took al his self-control not to cal the sheriff but in his gut he knew it wouldn\u2019t do much good. She\u2019d already cal ed the cops and if he told the sheriff what he knew, Eve could get in a lot of trouble. Not to mention it would break her trust. Not something he could do and live with himself. Standing, he pushed his chair back. \u201cI\u2019m beat so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I know I barged in on you. If you have a t-shirt or something I could borrow to sleep in I promise I\u2019l stay out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>His lower abdomen burned with need at the thought of her wearing something of his. Instead of responding\u2014because he didn\u2019t trust his voice\u2014he grunted something incomprehensible and motioned for her to fol ow him.</p><p>Hating how tight his skin felt and the uncomfortable sensation coursing through him, he stalked down the hal to his room. The five bedroom house was big for just him and now he felt as if it were taking forever to make it across the house.</p><p>As he final y entered his room he cringed. A pile of dirty clothes lay in one corner and he\u2019d tossed his dirty work clothes at the end of his unmade bed. Nice.</p><p>Behind him, Eve chuckled under her breath and muttered something about him being \u2018such a guy\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>but he ignored it. He was definitely feeling like a guy right now. Being near her was making his brain short circuit and giving him a raging hard on. It was embarrassing that he couldn\u2019t control himself. He shifted uncomfortably as he jerked open one of his dresser drawers and rummaged around until he found one of his old Marine Corps t-shirts. It was about a decade old and he\u2019d gotten it when he\u2019d first enlisted. Since that first year in he\u2019d put on a lot of muscle so while it would stil be big, it wouldn\u2019t completely swal ow her. Next he grabbed a pair of sweatpants that would definitely be too big but it was al he had.</p><p>When he handed the bundle of clothes to her, their fingers brushed and they both froze. An undeniable electric arc of energy sparked between them and made him almost jerk back. Staring into her dark eyes, he fought that familiar drowning sensation he experienced every single fucking time she was near. She made him feel like a randy teenager. Out of control and horny al the time. He could lose himself with her.</p><p>His brain struggled to think of something\u2014anything\u2014to say but she beat him to the punch. It vaguely registered that this was exactly why he avoided her. She mumbled</p> <p>\u2018thanks\u2019 as she took the clothes but she stil didn\u2019t make a move to leave. Just stared at him as if she wanted him to kiss her. Ten years ago it wouldn\u2019t have surprised him, but it did now. She wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore. She was a beautiful, grown woman and shouldn\u2019t want anything to do with a roughneck like him.</p><p>But damn, did he ever want to fol ow through with this kiss.</p><p>More than kiss. He wanted to taste her, dominate her, make her forget anyone but him existed... The flare of lust in her eyes was too much.</p><p>Reaching out, he cupped her cheek. When he did, she sucked in a shaky breath but didn\u2019t pul away. He wanted to tel her to go but the words wouldn\u2019t form. And her skin was so soft and female. He rubbed the pad of his cal used thumb over her cheek.</p><p>Her eyes grew heavy-lidded for a moment. He could practical y feel the heat rol ing off her. Stepping forward slowly, he gave her time to back away as he closed the distance between them. But she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>She met him halfway. Before he could react her hands slid up his chest and around his neck. He was so screwed. The thought rang in his head crystal clear.
