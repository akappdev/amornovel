Not in the same way women love Titanic or The Notebook\u2014I cry every time I watch them. But Star Wars is different for men. It\u2019s not just entertainment.</p><p>They believe in it.</p><p>It\u2019s their handbook, their Bible. Apparently, all the secrets of life can be found in George Lucas\u2019s films. At least in the first three. According to Drew, the last three \u201csuck ass.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re watching The Empire Strikes Back now.</p> <p>Drew and I have been living together for just over a month. But it feels like it\u2019s been longer. You know when you get your hair highlighted? And after just a day or two you can\u2019t remember what you looked like before? Can\u2019t imagine a time when your hair wasn\u2019t this vibrant, multifaceted shade? It\u2019s a lot like that.</p><p>There we are\u2014on the floor, snuggled under a pile of pillows and blankets, eating popcorn\u2014while Han Solo is about to be frozen in carbonite. Oh, and Mackenzie is here too. Alexandra and Steven asked us to watch her for the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s eyes don\u2019t stray from the plasma. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you get?\u201d</p><p>I sit up as I explain. \u201cThe man is most likely about to die, and the woman he\u2019s wanted all this time finally tells him she loves him\u2014and what does he say? I know? What kind of line is that?\u201d</p> <p>Drew looks genuinely shocked. \u201cUh...the greatest in cinematic history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just say he loves her too?\u201d</p><p>He sits up, giving me his full attention. Prepare to be tutored in the finer points of male logic.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s Han freaking Solo. He\u2019s the coolest guy in the galaxy. He doesn\u2018t have to say he loves her\u2014look at everything he\u2019s done for her. She should already know.\u201d</p><p>Typical. I shake my head and look down at Mackenzie, who sits between us. \u201cWhen you fall in love? Go for a guy like Luke.\u201d</p><p>Drew is highly offended. \u201cNo. No way...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s sweet. Brave but sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke is a whiny little bitch until Return of the Jedi.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie reaches for her calculator and adds ten to the tab. Did you miss the Bad Word Jar that\u2019s sitting on the coffee table? Yeah\u2014it\u2019s almost full. I say Drew should just buy her a Ferrari now. By the time she\u2019s old enough to drive it, they should be about even.</p><p>\u201cIf you decide you want to get married, Mackenzie\u2014someday\u2014it should be to a guy like Han.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie turns her head from Drew to me, like she\u2019s watching a match at Wimbledon.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s selfish and egotistical. Always running off in his space cruiser\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Millennium Falcon to you,\u201d Drew interrupts.</p><p>I ignore his correction. \u201cAnd he\u2019s obviously a playboy! A womanizer. Why would you want Mackenzie with someone like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCorrection: he was a womanizer. Until he met Leia. She changed him. And Mackenzie\u2014like Leia\u2014is going to be smart, strong, and powerful. She\u2019ll eat a weakling like Luke for breakfast. Han, on the other hand, will keep up with her. Keep her satisfied.\u201d</p><p>He smirks\u2014in that way that makes my stomach tighten\u2014as he adds, \u201cLike us.\u201d</p><p>I smile teasingly. \u201cBut I\u2019m never satisfied. I always want more.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s voice drops suggestively. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to work harder, then.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, we\u2019re in Lust Land. Get used to it\u2014it happens often. Our gazes lock, and our mouths gravitate towards each other. Don\u2019t worry about Mackenzie; it\u2019s nothing she hasn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>Drew is big on the PDAs. Because when it comes to affection\u2014and everything, for that matter\u2014he\u2019s impatient and spoiled. So if he wants to touch me, kiss me? He does. And he really doesn\u2019t give a damn who\u2019s around at the time.</p><p>It can be a real turn-on\u2014or incredibly frustrating, depending on the circumstances.</p><p>Before our lips touch, the phone rings. And Mackenzie\u2019s blond head pops up between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d</p><p>Alexandra said she\u2019s really into answering the phone lately.</p><p>\u201cEvans-Brooks res-dance?\u201d</p><p>Has a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>She listens to the receiver, then turns to Drew. \u201cUncle Drew, it the doorman. He say there a package for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to sign for it, and I\u2019ll pick it up later.\u201d</p><p>She does. Then she listens again and says, \u201cHe say it per-ish-able.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s brow furrows, wondering what it could be. \u201cOkay. Tell him to send it up.\u201d</p><p>Drew pauses the movie. Before he stands, he picks up my hand and kisses it softly. And his eyes promise more to come.</p><p>This is our first clothed weekend. And although I adore Mackenzie, I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t looking forward to some non-G-rated activity later on. Yes\u2014my name is Kate, and I am a newly indoctrinated sex addict.</p><p>But come on, look at the man. Can you blame me?</p><p>Drew opens the door, and a uniformed man hands him a clipboard before sliding a large cardboard box\u2014with holes on top\u2014through the doorway. Drew signs, looks down at the box, and kicks it with his foot. \u201cWhat\u2019s in\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he can finish, a chorus of sounds emerges from the box.</p><p>Meows.</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s jaw drops as she runs forward. \u201cIt sounds like kittens!\u201d She takes the lid off the box. \u201cIt is! Is a whole box full of kittens!\u201d</p><p>Is it ever. I stand up and peer inside. Eight kittens, to be exact.</p><p>Drew looks accusingly at the deliveryman. \u201cWhat the f**k is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are your foster kittens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?!\u201d</p><p>Kitten Man checks the clipboard. \u201cDrew Evans, right?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cYou signed up to be an animal foster parent. These are your wards for the next four to six weeks.\u201d</p><p>Drew is already shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for shit. I hate cats\u2014they\u2019re Satan\u2019s pets.\u201d</p><p>Kitten Man hands Drew the clipboard. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it says here.\u201d</p><p>By this time, Mackenzie is cooing and petting the box of meowing fur. And I cover my mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>Have you figured it out yet?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her. I swear to God! I\u2019m gonna be an only child by the time this day is over!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I start laughing. Loudly. As I ask him, \u201cWhat did you expect? You had a farm animal delivered to her condo on Christmas morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was a gift! This is just mean.\u201d</p><p>Drew hands the clipboard back to Kitten Man. \u201cTake them back. There\u2019s been a mix up. They can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>Kitten Man looks disappointed. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Without you, these little guys will be euthanized by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>Big round blue eyes stare up at Drew.</p> <p>\u201cWhat eufanized mean, Uncle Drew?\u201d</p><p>Drew looks at her sad little face for about five seconds. Then he lowers his head in defeat. \u201cGoddamn it.\u201d</p><p>I smile at Mackenzie. \u201cIt means the kittens are staying, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYippee!\u201d She starts taking them out of the box one by one.</p><p>Kitten Man turns to go. \u201cHappy Holidays. God bless you.\u201d</p> <p>Drew scowls. \u201cYeah, yeah. Happy f**king New Year.\u201d</p><p>Then he kicks the door closed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna name you Nala, and you Simba, and you Fluffy, and you Muffy...and I\u2019m gonna call you Drew Junior! He look like Uncle Drew, don\u2019t he, Aunt Kate?\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah\u2014I\u2019m already Aunt Kate. How great is that?</p><p>\u201cHe does. He\u2019s very handsome and seems smart too. Don\u2019t you think, Drew?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still pouting. \u201cYeah. Fantastic. Hey, here\u2019s an idea\u2014let\u2019s take Drew Junior and his buddies down to the Hudson River and see if they can swim?\u201d</p> <p>I saunter towards my boyfriend. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201dWith Mackenzie\u2019s focus still on the kittens, I slide my hand under Drew\u2019s T-shirt and scrape my nails over his abs.</p><p>That gets his attention.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I keep my voice low. \u201cNope. Because rescuing poor defenseless animals gets me really ...hot.\u201d</p><p>Drew raises his brows. \u201cHow hot?\u201d</p><p>I lick my lips. He watches.</p><p>\u201cVery. I\u2019ll probably need you to cool me down with...ice cubes...or whipped cream...\u201d</p><p>He puts his hands on my hips and pulls me forward. \u201cMmmm. Maybe...kittens have their good points after all.\u201d</p> <p>I smile and nod. And then our mouths are joined. I wrap my arms around his neck, and my feet leave the floor as Drew lifts me up.</p><p>Just as his tongue comes out to play, Mackenzie calls out, \u201cUncle Drew! Simba went pee-pee on the rug!\u201d</p><p>He sighs. And presses his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending The Bitch the bill when I get these carpets cleaned. No...better...I\u2019ll have them replaced. That\u2019ll bite her in the ass.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want him too focused on a war with his sister. Not when there are so many other\u2014more enjoyable\u2014things he could be focusing on.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Drew. And after Mackenzie leaves, you can bite my ass instead.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. And nips at my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019ll be a lot more fun.\u201d</p><p>The Honeymoon\u2019s Over (Drew POV)</p><p>Endorphins: chemicals in the brain that instill feelings of well-being or euphoria.</p><p>They\u2019re the reason we keep going back to the gym for those punishing workouts. They\u2019re the reason even the most uptight man on earth can fall asleep after a good lay. They are also responsible for a little phenomenon commonly referred to as The Honeymoon Period.</p><p>You know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s the beginning of a relationship\u2014when everything is all sweetness and light. Everyone\u2019s on their best behavior.</p><p>Guys don\u2019t pass gas; women don't eat.</p><p>Or, if they just can\u2019t help themselves, even the worst habits seem like the most adorable thing since Punky frigging Brewster. His cute little snore, her delightful nail biting.</p><p>Humans are not the only ones who go through a Honeymoon Period. It\u2019s an interspecies experience. In fact, without it, sharks would cease to exist. See, sharks are natural predators. They\u2019ll eat anything\u2014including their own offspring.</p><p>Right after giving birth, however, the mother shark\u2019s brain is flooded with endorphins, putting her into a kind of ecstatic coma. This gives the baby shark about ten minutes to swim away.</p><p>Because if he\u2019s still around when Momma wakes up? He\u2019s lunch.</p><p>Which brings us to the other universal characteristic of The Honeymoon Period:</p><p>Eventually, it ends.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kate?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Saturday afternoon. Matthew and Steven are over. We\u2019re in the living room, watching the game.</p><p>\u201cKate!\u201d</p><p>And we need beer.</p><p>Sure, she\u2019s in the office working, but the Yankees are on. And I\u2019m a New York boy\u2014born and raised. Which means there are only two teams I like: the Yankees and whoever\u2019s playing the Boston Red Sox.</p><p>\u201cKAAATE!\u201d</p><p>She appears at the entrance to the room, arms folded, hip cocked. She\u2019s wearing a sundress\u2014short with a sexy floral pattern and buttons down the front for easy removal. I worship the creator of the sundress.</p><p>Her voice is annoyed. \u201cWhat is it, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I toss her a smile. \u201cHey, babe...could you grab us a few beers from the fridge?\u201d</p><p>Animals are non-verbal. A girl dog can\u2019t tell a boy dog, Screw me now; I want to have your puppies. So instead she sticks her ass in the air. Now, if the boy dog happens to read her signals wrong? If he jumps on her ass before it\u2019s raised?</p><p>He might just get his balls bitten off.</p><p>Women are a lot like female canines\u2014or bitches, if you want the correct terminology\u2014and God help the man who misreads them.</p><p>We\u2019ll get back to that later.</p><p>As for now, when Kate raises one eyebrow at me, I know she\u2019s looking for an explanation. I gesture towards the television. \u201cJeter\u2019s about to beat the all-time hitting record.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. Pacified. \u201cOkay.\u201d Then she heads off to the kitchen.</p><p>A few minutes later, she comes back with her arms full of beer bottles. She hands one to Matthew.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kate.\u201d</p><p>And one to Steven. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>And one to me. I take a sip. And flinch. \u201cAh, this is piss warm.\u201d I hand it back to her.</p><p>\u201cI just took it out of the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>With my eyes still on the game, I flick my wrist, shooing her back to the kitchen. \u201cYou have to take them from the back of the fridge. That\u2019s where the cold ones are...Come on, A-rod! Get your head out of your ass and in the game!\u201d</p><p>And we should pause here a moment.</p><p>Remember those dogs I was talking about? The cues? While I was watching TV, I missed a few. Take a look:</p><p>Steven is smiling, almost laughing. After all the punishment he\u2019s received from my sister over the years, he\u2019s developed quite the sadistic streak when it comes to other people getting their asses handed to them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then there\u2019s Matthew. God only knows what kind of sick and depraved penalties Delores has inflicted on that poor bastard, because he just looks scared.</p><p>Kate, on the other hand, is staring at my hand like it\u2019s a cockroach. That she wants to squash. And then she gets an idea\u2014a wonderful, awful idea. If you look hard enough, you can see the light bulb go on above her head. She smiles and leaves the room.</p><p>I missed all this the first time.</p><p>A few minutes later, Kate breezes back in carrying an ice bucket filled with beer. Nope, not beer bottles. Just beer. She stands next to the couch, and I\u2014eyes still on the game\u2014hold out my hand for my drink. And she proceeds to take her bucket and dump it over my f**king head.</p> <p>Splash.</p><p>I jump up, dripping and choking. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>She asks me sweetly, \u201cIs that cold enough for you, honey?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my face with my hand and glare at her. \u201cAre you crazy!\u201d</p><p>She glares right back. \u201cNo\u2014and I\u2019m not a waitress either! Though I would hope you\u2019d show a little more courtesy to them.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew stands up. \u201cI\u2019m going to head down to McCarthy\u2019s Bar and watch the game from there.\u201d</p><p>Steven gets his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>I wring out the bottom of my shirt. \u201cHold the cab for me, guys. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>Matthew laughs. And pats me on the back. \u201cSure you will, buddy. Bye, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer them. She\u2019s too busy trying to kill me with her eyes.</p> <p>And with that, Matthew and Steven make their escape.</p><p>While Kate and I glower at each other.</p><p>Ding-ding.</p><p>Yep\u2014that\u2019s the bell. Round one just got started.</p><p>I begin calmly. When verbally sparring with an adversary, it\u2019s always better to stay levelheaded. Choose your words carefully. Be smart.</p><p>And lethal.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this about?\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Kate does not share my philosophy.</p> <p>\u201cYou tell me, Drew! Tell me why the hell Matthew and Steven can say please and thank you and all I get from you is a...\u201d She flicks her hand dismissively, mimicking my earlier action.</p><p>And once again, I stay composed. Still dripping\u2014but composed.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you wasted good beer and ruined my Saturday afternoon because I forgot my manners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just say, \u2018Hey, Drew, a thank you would be nice\u2019? Was it necessary to be such a god damn drama queen about it?\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms and scoffs, \u201cI am not a drama queen.\u201d</p><p>I hold up my fingers. \u201cTwo words, Kate: Chanel suit.\u201d</p><p>You remember, don\u2019t you? The one I bought her from Saks, after our first screw-fest?</p><p>Her eyes narrow. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows rise. \u201cWhat about it? You set it on fire.\u201d</p><p>Yep\u2014she and Delores made like homeless people and incinerated the freaking thing in the dumpster outside Kate\u2019s old building.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSo? You were nothing to me, and I wanted to make sure everything you\u2019d ever given me was nothing too.\u201d</p><p>And that, boys and girls, is called proving my point. I smirk. \u201cI really don\u2019t need to say anything else.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cWhatever. I didn\u2019t throw beer on you just because you forgot to say thank you. I\u2019m not some hysterical nagging psycho-bitch.\u201d</p><p>Right. And if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...it\u2019s a horse.</p><p>She goes on. \u201cThere are a lot of things that have been bothering me lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m actually curious. As far as I know, Kate and I have the perfect relationship. And I\u2014of course\u2014am the perfect boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cLike how you never help me clean up in the kitchen. Every time we cook, you disappear while I\u2019m stuck washing and drying and putting away!\u201d</p><p>My voice becomes a little louder. Defensive. \u201cYou do most of the cooking. I figure you want to organize the kitchen! I don\u2019t want to mess up your system.\u201d</p><p>And this is partly true. But if I\u2019m being totally honest, I\u2019ve never seen my old man wash a dish in his life. Not even a frigging spoon. And Steven\u2014the one time he tried to help The Bitch out with the laundry? She pissed and moaned for a week about how he ruined her gentle delicates, whatever the hell those are.</p><p>\u201cAnd you never complained about it before. If you wanted my help, why didn\u2019t you just ask me?\u201d</p><p>Her volume reaches maximum decibels. \u201cWhy should I have to ask you? You\u2019re a grown man! You should just know!\u201d</p><p>And there it is, kiddies. The Famous Female Mind Fuck.</p><p>That\u2019s short for: If you can\u2019t read their minds? You\u2019re f**ked.</p><p>And as for that composure I was so proud of? Yeah\u2014he took a hike. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t! For Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t give me enough rope to hang myself and then cut my balls off when I actually do! You should\u2019ve just told me!\u201d</p><p>Kate pushes my shoulders, and my shirt makes a wet squishing sound.</p><p>\u201cFine. You wanna know? I\u2019ll tell you now.\u201d</p><p>Despite what I just said, no, I don\u2019t want to know. No guy likes being criticized. No one wants to be told they\u2019re screwing up. So, like any man under attack, I go on the offensive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a joy to live with all the time either.\u201d</p><p>That stops Kate\u2019s tirade in its tracks. Her brow furrows slightly. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Honestly? I have no idea. I have two reactions to anything Kate does: she makes me smile or she makes me hard. Smile, hard, smile, hard, smile...hard. Usually both at the same time. You know that song \u201cEvery Little Thing She Does Is Magic\u201d? It\u2019s a lot like that. Nothing she does turns me off. But I\u2019m not about to let her know that. This is our first argument.</p><p>Winning is crucial. I have to set a precedent.</p><p>So, genius that I am, I spew the first thing that pops into my head. \u201cYou chew on your pens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Too late now\u2014might as well go with it. \u201cWhen we\u2019re working in the office. You chew on your pen. It\u2019s distracting. It sounds like some crazed woodchuck is trying to eat its way through the drywall. Chck, chck, chck, chck.\u201d</p><p>She thinks about it a moment. And shrugs. \u201cFine. I won\u2019t chew my pen anymore. But we\u2019re not talking about me right now. We\u2019re talking about you...and...and how you disrespect me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hold on. Back the hell up. I am an extremely respectful person. Always. Even to my do-me-once-and-don\u2019t-ever-talk-to-me-agains\u2014I was a goddamn gentleman.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? How do I disrespect you?\u201d</p><p>Her tone is clipped. Accusing. \u201cYou\u2019ve never once changed the toilet paper roll.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s kidding, right? Seriously. Tell me she\u2019s f**king with me.</p> <p>\u201cAnd how exactly does me not changing the toilet paper roll disrespect you?\u201d</p><p>Her face goes blank, like she\u2019s shocked that I don\u2019t immediately understand the insanity that is her.</p><p>\u201cWell, who do you think is going to change it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh...I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She spreads her arms out, like I just said the magic words.</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I pinch my nose. Maybe if I stem the flow of blood to my brain, I\u2019ll pass out.</p><p>She goes on, \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it at all! You just assume, \u2018Oh Kate will do it. She\u2019s got nothing better to do\u2019...\u201d</p><p>I put my hand up, cutting her off. \u201cNo, no\u2014I don\u2019t think that! If I need toilet paper and it\u2019s there, I use it. If it\u2019s not, I improvise.\u201d</p><p>Her face wrinkles. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just disgusting.\u201d</p><p>So this is what it feels like to be stuck in quicksand. You kick and struggle...but you just keep on sinking.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what? Okay, fine. You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll change the toilet paper roll from now on. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>But apparently it\u2019s not.</p><p>She folds her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be right, Drew. I don\u2019t want you to change the toilet paper roll because I\u2019m yelling at you. I want you to want to change the toilet paper roll.\u201d</p><p>Okay\u2014now I start laughing. I just can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k would anyone want to change the toilet paper roll!\u201d</p><p>She looks offended. Highly. \u201cFor me. For me, Drew! You know, I happen to like doing things for you because I love you. But only if you appreciate it. When it just becomes...expected...then I feel degraded. And it makes me not want to do things for you!\u201d</p><p>Her lips are moving. I know she\u2019s trying to tell me something.</p><p>What it is? No clue.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means!\u201d</p><p>She points her finger at me. And hops up and down. \u201cYes, you do! You\u2019re just purposely not seeing my point to drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m really not. Because judging from this conversation? She\u2019s already there.</p><p>And then a thought occurs to me. \u201cAre you on the rag?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opens wide. And you might want to take a step back, because I think her head might actually explode.</p><p>She grabs the nearest thing she can reach\u2014a picture of us on vacation two months ago\u2014and flings it at my head. Frisbee style. Lucky for me, she\u2019s got bad aim. The shelf behind me? Not so lucky.</p><p>Smash.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it that whenever a woman is justifiably upset, the guy always blames it on PMS?\u201d</p><p>Please. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of Alexandra\u2019s premenstrual-induced psychosis often enough to recognize the signs.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know...could it be because it usually is the reason?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Kate starts to pummel me.</p><p>With both fists.</p><p>Like a kindergartener going to the mat over his favorite color crayon.</p><p>\u201cYou...are...such...a...jerk!\u201d</p><p>Somewhere in between the second and the fifth punch, my dick peeks out from where he\u2019s been hiding since the beer bath to reevaluate the situation. To see if there\u2019s any way to turn this sorry state of affairs into something...a little more to his liking.</p><p>He thinks there is. And so I grab Kate\u2019s wrists and back her up against the wall, holding her hands over her head.</p><p>Restrained\u2014such a nice look for her.</p><p>Her chin is high, and her eyes are blazing. \u201cI so don\u2019t like you right now!\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cI\u2019m sensing that.\u201d</p><p>She twists and pulls but can\u2019t get free. Like some beautiful, exotic fish caught in a net.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an insensitive prick.\u201d</p><p>I lean in, pressing the lower half of our bodies together. \u201cI resent that. My prick happens to be extremely sensitive. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>Kate catches on to what\u2019s coming and opens her mouth to protest. Which works well for me. I swoop in and cover her lips with mine. She tries to turn her head away, but I grab her chin and hold it tight. Which allows her to take one newly freed hand and bury it in my hair.</p><p>Before yanking with all of her motherfucking might.</p><p>I lift my mouth from hers. \u201cFeisty. I appreciate you trying to make things more interesting, but it\u2019s really not necessary.\u201d</p><p>And then I\u2019m at her neck, nipping and sucking, working my way down to her cle**age. Kate slaps at my shoulder, but there\u2019s no real effort behind it. Which means I\u2019m wearing her down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d</p><p>I rest my nose against her skin, inhaling deeply. Then I take one nipple in my mouth\u2014over her dress\u2014and suckle it hard.</p><p>See, Kate\u2019s br**sts are kind of like start buttons. No matter how tired or moody she may be, a little attention to those bad boys switches things around real quick.</p><p>Her head slams back against the wall. And she moans, holding my head in place.</p><p>We have ignition.</p><p>I grip her knee and hoist it up around my waist, lining us up, and grind against her. And despite my soaked clothes, I can feel how hot she is.</p><p>Turned on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her again, our tongues tangling in their own sensuous battle. Then I slide my hand between us, down her panties. She\u2019s slick and smooth. Velvet wetness. When I push two fingers inside her, her voice changes. It\u2019s all breathy and moaning\u2014not a trace of pissed-offness to be heard.</p><p>\u201cGod...Drew...\u201d</p><p>And then she\u2019s pulling me against her and kissing me back with all she\u2019s got. Telling me without words what I\u2019ve known all along: horny and angry are a fabulous combination.</p><p>I push my shorts down and drag both of her legs up around me. Pressing her into the wall.</p><p>But just as I\u2019m about to slide into home, Kate puts her palm against my forehead and pushes it back.</p><p>\u201cWait...no...wait...\u201d</p><p>What? Wait? I hate waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Even though she\u2019s panting, her eyes are round and dark with...worry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to talk about this. We can\u2019t just cover all our problems with sex. I have some valid issues here, and if this is going to work, we need to figure this out.\u201d</p><p>I press my forehead to hers. Thinking. Or trying to, anyway.</p><p>With my c**k so close to Mecca, it\u2019s difficult to remember my own name at the moment.</p><p>And then it all becomes clear. And I look at Kate\u2019s face. \u201cSo, in a nutshell...you want me to stop being a dickhead?\u201d</p> <p>She mulls it over. And then she nods.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Pretty much.\u201d</p><p>I nod too. \u201cGot it. That\u2019s really all you needed to say, baby.\u201d</p><p>And then those lips that I love break into a big happy bang-me-up-against-the-wall smile. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d She scrapes my bottom lip between her teeth before moving down my jaw and nibbling my neck.</p><p>Then she whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss the game.\u201d</p> <p>I shred her underwear and get what\u2019s left of her dress out of my way.</p><p>\u201cFuck the game.\u201d That\u2019s why God gave us DVR, right?</p><p>She giggles wickedly. And looks me straight in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you f**k me.\u201d</p><p>Have I mentioned how much I absolutely adore this woman?</p><p>I lean back just long enough to rip my sopping shirt over my head. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p> <p>Kate giggles again. And in her best Han Solo impression, tells me, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Okay, ladies\u2014what have we learned from this example? Keep it simple. Be broad but don\u2019t bog us down with specifics. It\u2019ll only confuse us.</p><p>You\u2019re an ass**le.</p><p>You\u2019re a slob.</p><p>Stop being that way.</p><p>Any of the above should work just fine.</p><p>As for Kate and me? We had our first living-together-in-sin fight. A milestone. Go us. Overall, I think it went pretty well. In fact, if all of our arguments end like this? I won\u2019t complain at all.</p><p>No. Wait. I take that back.</p> <p>If all of our arguments end like this?</p><p>I plan on complaining a whole hell of a lot.</p><p>What A Difference A Year Makes</p><p>Dates are important to women. Particularly to women in relationships.</p><p>There\u2019s all the major holidays: Christmas, Valentine\u2019s, Easter. There\u2019s the birthday\u2014obviously. Then there\u2019s the day you met, the day you went out, the day you dropped the L-bomb, the day you got engaged, the day you got married...</p><p>I could go on, but I really don\u2019t want to.</p><p>Because here\u2019s the thing\u2014guys don\u2019t give a shit about any of that stuff. When we pretend to care? It\u2019s only to avoid the verbal ass-whipping that\u2019s sure to follow if we act like we don\u2019t. For us, there\u2019s only one day worth commemorating. One moment that deserves recognition. The ultimate holy day of obligation.</p><p>I like to call it\u2014the Fuckiversary.</p><p>It\u2019s the day you first sealed the deal. Bumped uglies. Hit the homerun.</p><p>Or in my case\u2014the grand slam.</p><p>I mean, seriously, you meet new people every day; it\u2019s a common occurrence. But unless you have a stellar record like yours truly, you don\u2019t screw a new person every day. So for guys, the first time you did the deed is definitely a day to celebrate.</p><p>And for me and Kate? That day is today, kiddies. It\u2019s huge. One year ago, the course of my life was altered forever. The foundation of my existence was shaken.</p><p>And my bed frame.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m in the kitchen right now. See me? Whistling, slicing fruit, and squaring a variety of cheeses? They\u2019re for later. We\u2019re going to need them\u2014gotta keep the energy up. Because, in my book, you don\u2019t just memorialize a f**kiversary. You top it. And considering the Olympic-worthy high bar that was set that night? I\u2019ve got my work cut out for me.</p><p>But I\u2019m always up for a challenge. Pun intended.</p><p>I don\u2019t want you to think that f**kiversaries are just about humping like dogs either. Although, that position is always fun.</p><p>But no, it\u2019s also about tradition. Sentiment.</p><p>Presents.</p><p>For a first wedding anniversary, gifts are supposed to be made of paper or some kind of useless crap like that. My gift is so much better\u2014Santa\u2019s elves can eat their hearts out. Kate is going to lose it when she sees it. Her jaw\u2019s gonna hit the floor. And her panties will be right behind it.</p><p>The front door opens.</p><p>That would be the lucky lady herself.</p><p>I left work at noon\u2014had preparations to make\u2014so I haven\u2019t seen her since lunch. I walk into the living room. And there she is\u2014bag in hand, a mid-length trench coat wrapped around her scrumptious little body. Her hair is down and shiny. Spiked black heels encase the tasty toes I like to suck on like a hard candy.</p><p>She smiles.</p><p>And as with every other time\u2014it hits me like a punch to the gut.</p><p>\u201cHello, Boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Sickening, aren\u2019t we? There\u2019s a garbage can in the corner if you feel the need to puke.</p><p>I stalk towards her. \u201cHow was your day, dear?\u201d</p><p>She puts her bag down, but leaves the coat on. \u201cIt was...distracting.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to ask her what that means, but she cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d She\u2019s referring to the lighted candles and rose petals strewn about the place.</p><p>Depending on your lifestyle, there are different definitions of romance. For some it\u2019s classical music, a foot massage, or satin sheets. Personally, I happen to think a blow job during a Yankee game is ideal. But Kate is a more frilly, girly, kind of romantic. So these are for her.</p><p>\u201cCandles.\u201d</p><p>She smirks. \u201cThank you, Captain Obvious. I mean what are they for?\u201d</p><p>I walk around her, my eyes caressing every curve slowly\u2014like my hands will be doing shortly. Then I lean in and whisper next to her ear, \u201cThey\u2019re part of your surprise. Because today is a very, very special day.\u201d</p><p>She shivers\u2014in the good kind of way. And her voice drops low. \u201cI know. One year ago today, I rocked your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rocked my world?\u201d</p><p>She nods, and her eyes sparkle. \u201cYep. Right off its axis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue peeks out and wets her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re sadly mistaken, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>I move in closer. \u201cMaybe you need a refresher, Miss Brooks.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head, looking up into my eyes. Daring me.</p><p>\u201cI think a refresher is exactly what I need.\u201d</p><p>My hand snakes around her neck, pulling her against me. And our lips mold together. A year ago, I didn\u2019t appreciate the value of kissing. Then it was just a teaser\u2014like the never-ending stream of previews you have to sit through in the movie theater until you get to the main attraction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But with Kate, kissing is a whole f**king event in and of itself. The way she tastes. The way she moans. The way her tongue slides against mine. It\u2019s goddamn dizzying.</p><p>My hands come up to remove her coat, but she grabs them. And she pulls back, a little out of breath. \u201cWait. Not yet. I left work early today\u2014to pick some things up. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you something too. Can I go first?\u201d</p><p>I like being first. It\u2019s just how I am.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I stand in front of her. Then I slowly unbutton my shirt, keeping eye contact the whole time.</p><p>Kate tries to guess. \u201cDid you take strip-tease lessons?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cNo. But I\u2019ll keep that in mind for next year.\u201d My dress shirt hits the floor. I lift my white T-shirt over my head. And Kate\u2019s hand rises to my chest and trails down my stomach. I back away and wag my finger. \u201cPatience, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She stomps her foot and pouts. And I want to tell her just where she can put those pouty lips. But I don\u2019t. Gifts come first.</p><p>Then it\u2019s our turn.</p><p>Ha\u2014did you get that?</p><p>I turn to the side and remove the gauze bandage that covers my upper right bicep. And then she sees it. Her eyes glaze over, and her jaw goes slack.</p><p>And she whispers, \u201cYou got a tattoo...of my name?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a black whip\u2014that spells out KATE.</p><p>I hope you weren\u2019t thinking it was going to be an engagement ring or something. Screw that. In today\u2019s day and age, rings don\u2019t mean much. Ask any married man who frequents the titty bars\u2014rings can be removed.</p><p>But a tattoo? That\u2019s forever. Permanent\u2014unless you like the idea of having several layers of skin scraped off.</p><p>Kate\u2019s fingers slide around it disbelievingly. \u201cI love it, Drew. It\u2019s the most...amazing thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I cup her cheek with my hand. \u201cNot like I love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles for a moment. But then her expression changes. And she looks...disappointed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing...it\u2019s just...you branded my name on your flesh. I guess I just feel a little stupid. All I got you were toys.\u201d</p><p>My ears perk up. Like a dog hearing the rustle of his food bag.</p><p>\u201cToys? Would these toys be...naughty...in nature?\u201d</p> <p>Kate bites her lip. And nods.</p><p>Sweet Jesus. My mouth goes dry. \u201cCan I...see them?\u201d</p><p>Some guys aren\u2019t into toys. Dildos\u2014with their bells and whistles\u2014can be intimidating. But not to me. I think of them as tools of the trade. Power tools, to be exact, and there\u2019s no shame in using them. Even a master carpenter wouldn\u2019t try to build a house without a handsaw and hammer, you know?</p><p>Kate takes a bag out of her purse. She reaches in and pulls out a short, velvet-tipped riding crop.</p><p>And my c**k comes alive like Frankenstein\u2019s monster.</p><p>For all you ladies out there? Take notes. Sex toys are the ultimate gift. Fun for the whole family. Okay, not really. But they\u2019re definitely the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p>She hands it to me. \u201cRemember a few weeks ago? In the living room when you...you know...with your hand?\u201d</p><p>My voice is breathless. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Of course I remember. You might not know it looking at her, but deep down, Kate is a total c**k tease. She likes to push me to the edge\u2014see me snap. And on that particular day, she\u2019d been taunting me all morning, walking around braless in a barely-there tank top and underwear. At one point, she sat on my lap and wiggled around.</p><p>Then she hopped off claiming she didn\u2019t have time to finish what she\u2019d started because she had work to do.</p><p>And I lost it. I pulled her back, threw her across my thighs and spanked her.</p><p>Like the naughty girl she was. Wasn\u2019t anything to write The Story of O about\u2014just a few short slaps to the ass. But it was fun.</p><p>Kate smiles shyly. \u201cI liked it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, baby\u2014she wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>Kate reaches back into the bag from heaven. And pulls out a small silver cylinder.</p><p>It\u2019s a vibrator. It almost looks like one of those practical-joke electric buzzer things we all had when we were kids. She hands it over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullet,\u201d I finish for her. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I stare at it. And images of Kate writhing under me\u2014bordering on the brink of insanity and begging to come\u2014fill my head.</p><p>My voice comes out rough, but worshipful. \u201cYou are the most awesome girlfriend ever.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around her and kiss her. And it\u2019s long and slow and appreciative.</p><p>Kate pulls back and smiles big. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing. I saved the best for last.\u201d</p><p>She slides the belt of her coat slowly from the loops and grips the lapels with both hands. Then, in one fluid motion, she drops the jacket to the floor.</p><p>And I almost come on the spot.</p><p>Lots of women think lingerie is the magic ingredient of seduction. They buy something lacey and expensive and expect us guys to be drooling into our frigging laps. But it doesn\u2019t really work that way.</p><p>At Christmas, for example, when you see a big, brightly wrapped package under the tree with your name on it, you\u2019re interested. But it\u2019s not the wrapping paper you\u2019re looking forward to. It\u2019s the present inside. Lingerie works the same way. It\u2019s nice\u2014but naked is always better.</p><p>Except for this.</p><p>This is the wet dream of every man born after 1975.</p><p>It\u2019s the elite of eroticism.</p><p>The ultimate fantasy.</p><p>Oh yeah\u2014it\u2019s the Princess Leia bikini.</p><p>My mouth drops open. \u201cOh...my...motherfuck.\u201d</p><p>Kate spins slowly. Proudly. \u201cDo you like it? It\u2019s crotchless.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m speechless.</p><p>Seriously. I have no words. I\u2019m pretty sure every ounce of blood in my body has been rerouted to my dick, so there\u2019s not enough left in my brain to form them.</p><p>Kate\u2019s voice is hushed and tempting. \u201cIf you promise to be good...I\u2019ll let you chain me up like Jabba did to Leia.\u201d</p><p>I break out of my horny-induced trance. I grab her upper arms and haul her against me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, the only thing I\u2019m promising is you won\u2019t be able to walk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I pick her up and throw her over my shoulder. She screams. And laughs. And I walk down the hallway, passing by my tray of prepared snacks.</p><p>Because, really\u2014who the hell needs food?</p><p>I slide Kate off my shoulder, gripping her sweet little ass on the way down. I turn her around so her back\u2019s to me. Then I bend the riding crop halfway and let it fly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Snap.</p><p>It lands on the exposed skin of her ass cheek, and she lurches forward with a squeal. Then she giggles. \u201cMaybe this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. With great power comes great responsibility, Batman.\u201d</p><p>I take my pants and boxers off in record time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, sweetheart. I plan on satisfying every responsibility I have, again and again and again for good measure. Now get on the f**king bed.\u201d</p> <p>She does\u2014on all fours. Her hair falls over one shoulder, and her eyes are on mine. Christ, look at her. All laid out\u2014just for me\u2014waiting.</p><p>I feel like a goddamn kid in a candy store.</p><p>The only question is: Where to start first? It\u2019s always a fabulous conundrum. Every one of Kate\u2019s assets are equally deserving of attention. Hell, even the backs of her knees are sexy.</p><p>I slide the velvet tip of the crop across her chest, between her br**sts, and down her stomach. I pause between her legs.</p><p>And rub.</p> <p>The beauty with this kind of tool is that the nerve endings rush to wherever it touches, making the skin hypersensitive. Taut\u2014like an over-tuned guitar string just dying to get plucked.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes close, and her head tilts back. I rub the crop over her pu**y, back and forth.</p><p>Then I smack it lightly.</p><p>And she gasps.</p><p>When I was ten, my parents got me a racing bike during the height of the BMX craze. I remember thinking at the time that it was the greatest gift I\u2019d ever get.</p><p>Boy, was I a moron.</p> <p>I lean closer to the bed, over her, and kiss a trail up Kate\u2019s spine and around her neck.</p><p>I pull the gold bikini down from one plump tit and latch on.</p><p>Delicious.</p><p>Her nipple\u2019s already a stiff pink peak, but I flick my tongue over it anyway. Kate moans. And lifts one hand to the back of my head.</p><p>I smack her ass with the riding crop. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Her hand snaps back to the bed.</p><p>This...submission. It\u2019s not about degradation or humiliation\u2014it\u2019s about faith. Leaving yourself completely open, totally exposed. Offering everything you\u2019ve got, everything you are, to someone else. Letting them see the real you, not just the person you want to be. Every sin, every fantasy, because you know they\u2019ll never judge you. Never hurt you. Some people go their entire sorry lives without knowing what real trust is.</p><p>But I know.</p> <p>I have it.</p><p>With Kate. Only ever with her.</p><p>I give her nipple one last lick and move on. I put the riding crop down and twist the vibrator on.</p><p>Then I move down to Kate\u2019s ass. A bright red square marks one cheek. I soothe it with my mouth. And bring the buzzing bullet between her legs, moving in wide, slow circles\u2014coming close to her clit but not actually touching it.</p><p>Anticipation, satisfaction\u2014pleasure and pain\u2014it\u2019s a delicate balance. When combined in the right amounts, the sensation can be overwhelming. And because I\u2019m an expert on Kate\u2019s body, I know just how to play her. When to speed up and slow down. If Kate were an orchestra, I\u2019d be a maestro.</p><p>She moans and wiggles her ass, trying to move her hot spot closer to the vibrating toy. But I\u2019m not having it.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>I grip the gold bikini bottom from the back, drag it down her hips and toss it on the floor. Because as fun as crotchless panties are, Kate Brooks\u2019s cunt is just too f**king pretty to cover.</p><p>I move the bullet in ever tightening circles in front. And then I dip my head down between her spread legs from behind. I nibble around the outside, taking my time. Then, I plunge my tongue deep inside.</p><p>The bullet finally makes its way to her clit\u2014and I press it down firmly.</p><p>She moans as she comes. Her forehead hits the bed and her arms and legs tremble with aftershocks. She pants, \u201cDrew...please...I want...God...\u201d</p><p>All the nightingales out there? They should just freaking kill themselves with a bird-sized BB gun.</p><p>Because Kate begging for it is by far the sweetest sound God ever made.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby...what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Instead of pleading for my cock, like I thought she would, Kate turns the tables on me. She spins around, and before I can blink, my painfully hard dick is down her throat.</p><p>My head rolls back. And I\u2019m pretty sure I just went blind.</p><p>\u201cJesus...Kate...\u201d</p><p>She sucks hard and moves her lips up and down fast. Yet as unbelievably perfect as her mouth feels, I find the willpower to pull out. I turn her around, grab her hips with my hands, and thrust into her from behind. She groans long and low. With relief and satisfaction.</p><p>Or maybe that was me.</p><p>We\u2019re both so f**king turned on\u2014I can\u2019t tell anymore.</p><p>She pushes back against me as I surge forward. Kate\u2019s head is low, and her hair swings like a pendulum as we rock and grind against each other. Clashing. My strokes gain force. Driving us forward.</p><p>But I need more. I need to feel her\u2014be closer. I nudge her further onto the bed and climb on behind her.</p><p>Then, still buried inside, I pull Kate up by her shoulders and bend my knees so she\u2019s straddling me\u2014but facing away. Reverse Cowgirl Style.</p><p>My chest presses against her back. Her hair tickles my face as my lips devour her neck. She\u2019s everywhere\u2014surrounding me. Her scent, the feel of her against me, the taste of her skin, the sound of her voice crying my name.</p><p>It\u2019s consuming.</p><p>Overwhelming.</p><p>Like drowning.</p><p>And if you\u2019ve got to go? Trust me\u2014this is the f**king way.</p><p>My arms cross over Kate\u2019s chest with my hands on her shoulders, pushing down as my hips thrust up hard.</p><p>And her words come out high-pitched and urgent: \u201cDrew...Drew...I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck...I know...I can feel you.\u201d</p><p>Her walls tighten around me like a starved boa constrictor.</p><p>And even though I want to hold out, even though I don\u2019t want it to end yet\u2014or ever\u2014my dick apparently has other ideas, and I explode deep inside her.</p><p>My hands fall down to Kate\u2019s waist, pulling her closer to me. Her head rests on my knees, and my mouth is against her back.</p><p>We\u2019re both panting, out of breath.</p><p>But I find my voice first.</p><p>\u201cBest...gift...ever.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughs against my legs. \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p><p>Much, much later, Kate and I lay in the middle of the bed, on top of the covers. A tangled mess of limp limbs and sweaty skin.</p><p>I like this part.</p><p>That may be pansy to admit, but let\u2019s be real. Kate\u2019s name is tattooed on my frigging arm. Trying to pretend like she doesn\u2019t have my balls in her purse? Really kind of useless at this point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her head rests on my chest. And I feel her smile before she whispers, \u201cTell me something about you. Something no one else knows.\u201d</p><p>I look at the ceiling. And call forth my deepest, darkest secret.</p><p>\u201cI have Justin Bieber on my iPod.\u201d</p><p>She giggles, \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. That \u2018As Long as You Love Me\u2019 song. And if you ever tell the guys, I\u2019ll deny it till the day I die.\u201d</p><p>She traces my abs with her fingers. Then I say, \u201cNow you. Tell me something I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my chest slowly as she thinks. Then she looks up into my eyes. \u201cNothing. You know absolutely everything there is to know about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Then...if you had three wishes, what would you wish for?\u201d</p><p>I once told Kate I wanted to make all her dreams come true. And I didn\u2019t think it was possible at the time, but she means even more to me now than the night I told her that. So if there\u2019s something she wants, something she needs? Heaven and hell better watch their backs\u2014cause I\u2019ll knock both on their asses to get it for her.</p> <p>She thinks some more. And when she speaks, her voice is hushed with surprise and gratitude. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, at this moment, I have everything I want. My mother\u2019s happy; I love my work. And anything more I ever would\u2019ve wished for...is right here in front of me.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. Hearing that answer? That\u2019s better than a whole sack full of sex toys.</p><p>Okay\u2014maybe not the riding crop.</p><p>But it\u2019s definitely close.</p> <p>I frame her face with my hands and kiss her.</p><p>Life\u2019s funny, you know? I mean, did you really think a year ago\u2014when Kate and I were going at it, falling through my front door\u2014that we\u2019d ever end up here? At the time, I figured it would be just another one-nighter. Amazing\u2014no question\u2014but still just a fantastic scratch for my long-suffering itch.</p><p>And yet here I am.</p><p>Committed.</p><p>Monogamous.</p><p>Completely, disgustingly infatuated.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t be happier.</p><p>And this is just year one. Not to go all Notebook on you, but Kate and I have a hell of a lot more years ahead of us. A lifetime\u2019s worth.</p> <p>And I plan on making the most of every f**king one of them. </p> </body></html>"]
