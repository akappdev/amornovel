I could be telling you this from the great beyond or some equally crazy shit. Regardless of how it ends, I\u2019m going back to the beginning, back to where it all started.</p><p>This isn\u2019t your typical love story.</p><p>Okay, maybe it is. Boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after. The things is, my happily ever after didn\u2019t go as planned.</p> <p>Thank God for second chances.</p><p>It all happened in the blink of an eye and, for me, nothing had ever felt more right. Maybe you\u2019ll think it happened too fast, that falling in love again doesn\u2019t happen like this.</p><p>I\u2019m here to tell you it absolutely does.</p><p>It happens when you least expect it, when you realize that a part of your heart and soul always remained in the hands of another.</p><p>It happens when your past collides with your present and shapes your future.</p> <p>We found our way back to one another, so it was easy to fool ourselves into believing that time was on our side.</p><p>Time to get to know one another again.</p><p>Time to fall in love.</p><p>Time to grow old together.</p><p>The thing about time is, it moves achingly slow when you\u2019re doing something you hate and it flies faster than the speed of light when you\u2019re doing something you love. Time is a fickle bitch.</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this story has a happy ending, but I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now. So much has happened so quickly that it all kind of feels like a dream. Maybe it is. Maybe I dreamed every single second of it\u2014the good and the bad.</p> <p>God, I hope it wasn\u2019t a dream. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever wanted more than forever with him.</p><p>I pray we make it out alive in the end, but even if we don\u2019t...</p><p>Those seventeen days...</p><p>Those last seventeen breaths...</p><p>Hell, even those seventeen miserable years...</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t change any of it for the world if the endgame is him.</p><p>Everything happens for a reason, but sometimes you don\u2019t know what that reason is until it\u2019s too late.</p><p>Please don\u2019t let it be too late.</p> <p>Chapter 1\u2014Set Fire to the Rain</p><p>AS I LISTEN to the sound of dresser drawers slamming upstairs in our bedroom, I wonder why I can\u2019t find it in myself to care about what\u2019s happening. A few years ago, hell, a few months ago, I would probably have been sitting here at the kitchen table sobbing and rethinking my decision. I might have even run up the stairs, grabbed onto him and told him not to go.</p><p>I hear a muttered curse as he stomps down the stairs and I don\u2019t even flinch. I listen to him angrily snatch up his keys from the bowl on the table in the foyer and all I can do is count the minutes until he walks out the door, the seconds until I can let out the breath I\u2019ve been holding since I told him I\u2019ve had enough. Five years of dating followed by twelve years of marriage means I\u2019ve spent over half my life loving this man.</p><p>In just a few moments, he will walk out the door and life as I know it will forever change.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost track of how many times over the years I\u2019ve threatened to leave him, how many times I told him as tears streamed down my cheeks that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He had all of me\u2014my heart, my soul, my body and my life. I\u2019ve given it all to him and, time after time, he violated my trust. Month after month, year after year, he looked me right in the eye and lied to my face. I\u2019ve never lied to him, not once in seventeen years, but he played me for a fool each and every time. He knew I was never serious when I made all of those threats, that I needed him and loved him unconditionally. He was my family, my best friend \u0327 my soul mate. He knew that no matter what, I would always forgive him. Over and over again, he sucked me right back in with apologies and promises as he begged me not to leave him. His heartbreaking tears always made me forget my anger and disappointment. I think deep down I was always scared about being alone. I haven\u2019t been alone since I was fifteen years old.</p><p>I hear the shuffle of his shoes and an irritated breath as he hovers in the kitchen doorway behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving, if you even care.\u201d</p><p>That right there, that sarcastic comment, reminds me that I\u2019m doing the right thing. He honestly believes that making me feel guilty will change my mind. He thinks he can make me feel bad about the fact that I just don\u2019t care what he does anymore, but he has officially pushed me past my breaking point. He doesn\u2019t even realize that it\u2019s his actions that have brought us here. His conscious choice to allow addictions and bad decisions to rule his life without a second thought to our marriage has turned me into this person I don\u2019t even recognize anymore.</p><p>I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m sad about seventeen years of my life going down the drain, that it hurts to let go of the man I vowed to love forever, but the truth is, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care if he walks out that door, I don\u2019t care if I never speak to him again, I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m alone and I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s pissed at me.</p><p>I.</p><p>Don\u2019t.</p><p>Care.</p><p>When I cross my arms in front of me and continue to stare at clock hanging on the wall above the kitchen window, refusing to turn around and look at him, he huffs again.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m out of here,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I count his footsteps as he makes his way to the front door.</p><p>One.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Six.</p><p>Seven...</p><p>Slam.</p><p>The silence in the house engulfs me. I close my eyes and breathe for the first time in months.</p><p>Chapter 2\u2014Fire and Ice</p><p>JORDAN AND I met the second semester of our senior year of high school when his dad was transferred for his job. I can still recall every single detail about the day he walked into my senior English class. I can remember exactly what I was wearing, exactly what the teacher was saying when the door opened and he walked in the room and exactly the way my stomach flip-flopped when I looked up from the doodles in my notebook and watched him saunter in and take the seat right next to me.</p><p>I was only two weeks into my recovery that day. My boyfriend of two years, Collin McDaniels, broke up with me via a note delivered by his best friend and shattered my heart into pieces. Like a typical high school girl, I thought my world had ended and nothing would ever make me smile again. Then, Jordan Castillo sat down next to me, asked to borrow a pencil and my shredded heart was never to be thought of again.</p><p>We started dating three weeks later. We were voted Best Couple, Cutest Couple and Couple Most Likely to Get Married. After graduation, Jordan convinced me to hold off on my dream of art school and stay with him, close to home, so we wouldn\u2019t have to be separated. Even though I lost some of my passion for art when my old boyfriend broke things off, I knew I had talent and I shouldn\u2019t let it go to waste just because my first high school relationship didn\u2019t work out. I promised myself that once we were making enough money to be comfortable, I\u2019d take some time off and enroll in art school.</p><p>Jordan and I were polar opposites in every way, but there was something about us together that just worked. I was quiet, studious and not really big into partying. He was loud, outgoing and the life of every party. He was the bad boy of every parent\u2019s nightmare and, in the beginning, I think that\u2019s what attracted me to him. I wanted to be with someone who didn\u2019t remind me of Collin. I wanted someone dark, edgy and exciting and that\u2019s exactly what I found in Jordan. Looking back, maybe I should have seen the signs. Maybe I should have realized that someone\u2019s core personality never really changes as they get older. We fought many times over the years because of his constant need to go out, his tendency to drink too heavily and come home too late and his refusal to grow up. I thought he would settle down after we got married. I thought he would be content in the life we built together and his need to hang out with people who weren\u2019t the best influences would be pushed aside.</p><p>I thought I would be enough for him.</p><p>Looking back on our relationship, I know that my insecurities are what made me continue to stay with him even though he hurt me. When you\u2019ve only had sex with one person, when you\u2019ve only really loved one man your entire life, how can you even think about walking away? How can you even begin to move on when he\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever known? Every time I uncovered another lie and thought about leaving, this is what ran through my mind. We grew up together, we knew everything about each other... how could I ever have that with anyone else and why would I even want to? All that time, all that effort, all the memories and the life we built together... throwing it all away just seemed like the worst possible decision.</p><p>The first time I caught him in a lie was a few months after we were married. He was working the night shift at a local manufacturing plant. I knew he was miserable there. I knew this wasn\u2019t his ideal job and I constantly felt guilty that he was forced to take it so we could make ends meet. For years, he talked about being a tattoo artist and, initially, I really thought he\u2019d make it work. He was a talented artist and I knew if he settled down and focused, he could make it happen. I let a lot of things slide with his behavior during that time because I knew it was hard for him to go to a job day after day that he hated. He was even working overtime, which he definitely wasn\u2019t happy about, but helped our financial situation. Time and a half should\u2019ve meant that we were able to pay the bills with plenty of money left over. Yet every week, we were in the negative. He always had some sort of excuse as to why there was money missing from our account. He got a flat tire and had to pay for a new one, he donated money to a charity at work, his friend lost his job and he let him borrow some money. Week after week, the lies flew smoothly from his mouth and I accepted them without a second thought.</p><p>Why would he lie to me, after all? What reason would he have to make up things like this?</p><p>I quickly found out that reason when one of his friends sent me a text that was supposed to go to Jordan.</p><p>The first time I told him to leave was the day I found out that, while I was losing sleep, crying every night wondering how I was going to pay the electric bill and contemplating getting a second job, he was spending hundreds of dollars each week gambling.</p><p>The second time I told him to leave was after I found out he was addicted to prescription painkillers.</p><p>The third time it was alcohol.</p><p>The fourth time it was cocaine.</p><p>The fifth time it was everything all at once.</p><p>Each time I caught him in a lie, he promised he would never do it again. He promised he was done with the pills and the booze and the blow. He promised he would be honest with me and he promised he wouldn\u2019t let me down again.</p><p>Promises.</p><p>Promises.</p><p>Promises.</p><p>He broke every single one time and time again and I forgave him. Year after year, I felt myself growing weaker and weaker where he was concerned as he was fired from one tattoo apprenticeship after another. I saw his dream slip right through his fingers and overcompensated by being too sweet, too forgiving, too understanding when I knew, deep down, that he was screwing up these opportunities all on his own. He was going into the shops late or sometimes not at all, he showed up hung over half the time and full on drunk or stoned the other. He couldn\u2019t handle the pressure and the realization that his dream might never come true and pretty soon, there wasn\u2019t a tattoo shop within a hundred mile radius that would hire him.</p><p>I stood by and watched as he slipped further and further away from me and became more and more bitter.</p><p>Even though I\u2019m naturally a quiet person, I believed I was strong and confident and would never rely on someone else for my happiness. Every time I forgave Jordan and believed his promises, my confidence and my strength slowly disappeared until I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without him, no matter how bad it got.</p><p>I hate myself for allowing him to manipulate me this way. I hate that I gave up on my dream of art school to help him achieve his goal of being a tattoo artist and he pissed it all away. I hate that when I look in the mirror I can\u2019t stand the woman looking back at me. I hate that he\u2019s always known the hold he\u2019s had on me, that he\u2019s always known my threats were empty.</p><p>Until a month ago.</p><p>When I caught him in another lie, I didn\u2019t break down and cry like I did in the past. I didn\u2019t curl up in our bed fighting tears while contemplating whether or not to even tell him I found out he\u2019d been lying to my face again because I was more scared of losing him than of dealing with his betrayal. I stood in the kitchen staring at a bottle of OxyContin, a razor and a small plastic tube that he used to snort the pills for a greater high and I felt... nothing.</p><p>I found the items in a zip lock bag in the back of his sock drawer. I discovered them after I questioned him about money missing from our account and he told me with a straight face that the two-hundred dollars supposedly went to pay a speeding ticket. When he left the house to run to the store, he forgot his cell phone and I\u2019m not proud of the fact that I went through his text messages as soon as he walked out the door. I didn\u2019t even get upset when I saw a text from an unknown number minutes before he left that simply said \u201c$200 for 20\u201420mg.\u201d</p><p>I blindly set the phone down on the counter and started searching the house until I found what I was looking for. When he came home with a gallon of milk, a good effort on his part to make me think he really went out just to go to the store, I tossed the bag of paraphernalia at him and he caught it with a guilty look on his face.</p><p>He tried; I\u2019ll give him that. He attempted to make up yet another lie. That bag of pills was from months ago. It\u2019s not what it looks like. I\u2019m not doing that shit anymore.</p><p>I looked at him, this man who had been my whole world for seventeen years, thought about all of our ups and downs and everything we\u2019d been through together and I felt nothing. I wasn\u2019t sad, I wasn\u2019t angry, I wasn\u2019t hurt... I was nothing. I was empty. I\u2019d cried enough over him in seventeen years that I couldn\u2019t make the tears come even if I tried. Even though he attempted to make excuses and beg for my forgiveness, I think he could tell by the look in my eyes that this was the final straw. He could continue with his addictions and he could continue screwing up his life, but I would no longer be along for the ride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took two hours of me telling him to go before it finally sunk in. Two hours of me ignoring his pleas with a stony look on my face before he finally understood and began to pack his things. When a woman can look you right in the eye and tell you she just doesn\u2019t care anymore and can do it without any emotion clouding her features, it\u2019s time to take her seriously.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care if he killed himself with his addictions. I didn\u2019t care if I never felt the soft touch of his lips against my own again, I didn\u2019t care if we never laid in bed together at night giggling about an old memory, I didn\u2019t care if he was the only man on earth who had ever known my body and I\u2019d never feel him inside of me again.</p><p>When the tears never came and all I could think about was that I just wanted him gone, I knew there was no turning back.</p> <p>I was done.</p><p>Chapter 3\u2014Slow Burn</p><p>\u201cI CANNOT BELIEVE we are at this bar. I suddenly feel really old,\u201d I complain, glancing around the small dive bar in town we frequented in college.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut it, Finnley. We are not old,\u201d my best friend, Phina, scolds.</p><p>I watch as she flips her long red hair over her shoulder and scans the room. \u201cOkay, so we\u2019re a few years older than most of the people in this place, no big deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few years? I\u2019m pretty sure I used to babysit that guy at the end of the bar,\u201d I tell her with a roll of my eyes.</p><p>The guy in question looks over at me and raises his bottle in my direction in a silent toast. I grimace and quickly look away, bringing my beer to my lips and taking a huge swallow.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hot. Did you seriously used to babysit him? Damn,\u201d Phina says with a low whistle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. The last time I saw him he was ten.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and takes a sip of her rum and Coke. \u201cWell, he\u2019s definitely not ten anymore. The things you could do to him would be completely legal.\u201d</p><p>My best friend, Seraphina Giordano, is amazing and the closest thing to a sister I\u2019ll ever have, but the stuff that comes out of her mouth sometimes makes me question her sanity. We\u2019ve been friends since the first day of high school. When her name was announced and a few students chuckled at the unusualness of it, she put her hands on her hips and stated, \u201cMy name means fiery one. Don\u2019t piss me off or I\u2019ll burn your ass.\u201d Her little outburst earned her an afternoon in detention, but there were no more giggles during roll call. Phina oozed confidence and assertiveness and I wanted to be just like her.</p> <p>She has been by my side through every one of my joys and every one of my disappointments. In the month since Jordan and I separated, she has been my rock. Instead of telling me I-told-you-so and going on about how I should have left him years ago, she stood by me in companionable silence while I worked through my emotions. After four weeks of pouring myself into my job and ignoring every single text, phone call and voice message from Jordan trying to guilt me into letting him come back home, she finally convinced me to get out of the house and take my mind off of everything.</p><p>\u201cSo, I filed for legal separation today,\u201d I tell her as she sips her drink.</p><p>She chokes on the liquid and I pat her on the back as she sputters and tries to cough away the shock of my news. When she finally regains control of herself, she sets her glass on top of the bar and looks at me with her mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cI think this is the first time in all the years I\u2019ve known you that I\u2019ve seen you at a loss for words,\u201d I joke.</p><p>She immediately snaps her mouth closed and shakes her head. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just trying to process what you said. Are you okay? Fuck, that\u2019s a stupid question, of course you\u2019re not okay.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and start peeling the label off of my bottle of beer. \u201cThe weird thing is, I am okay. At least, I think I am. I thought I would be upset, I thought I would feel something. Sadness, regret, anything. I just feel... numb. Like it\u2019s happening to someone else. Like I\u2019m looking down at some other woman ending her marriage without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>Phina reaches out and puts her hand on top of mine, halting my label-peeling process. \u201cHon, you gave this more than a second thought. You\u2019ve been agonizing over this for years. You just finally got the courage to do something about it. I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m proud of you for not giving in to his bullshit anymore. I\u2019m proud of you for putting yourself first for once. God knows he never did that.\u201d</p><p>I honestly wanted to feel bad about the fact that I went to the courthouse today and filed the separation paperwork without even talking to Jordan about it. I wanted to feel some sort of remorse that they would be serving him the paperwork within twenty-four hours and he had no idea it was coming. Even after kicking him out of the house and having no contact with him for a month, he still believes this will blow over, judging from the messages he\u2019s been leaving me. He still thinks I\u2019m going to forgive him and this is just a temporary setback.</p> <p>I don\u2019t really care that he\u2019s probably going to be hurt and shocked, but I am concerned about how pissed he\u2019s going to be that I\u2019ve done something so drastic. My worry over his reaction is the only emotion strong enough to make it past my indifference. I can already imagine the messages he\u2019s going to leave me when he receives those papers, and it forms a thick pool of dread in my stomach. I want this to end peacefully and just move on with my life, but I have a feeling he\u2019s not going to make it easy. Jordan was a good husband for a lot of years. He was sweet and attentive and I know he loved me, but struggling with one addiction after another has turned him into a person I don\u2019t even recognize anymore. He\u2019s quick to anger and even quicker to pin the blame for his life falling apart on everyone but himself. I\u2019m not looking forward to dealing with him when he realizes I won\u2019t be his putting up with his roller coaster of emotions anymore.</p><p>\u201cCan we change the subject? I don\u2019t want to think about this right now. I just want to drown myself in cheap beer and hope I don\u2019t run into anyone else I knew from my teenage years,\u201d I tell Phina with a smile.</p><p>\u201cGot it. No more talk about the king of the douchebags. How about we discuss how hot you\u2019re looking tonight? Did you put extra effort into your appearance just for me?\u201d Phina asks with a wag of her eyebrows.</p><p>I look down at myself and feel a twinge of embarrassment over the amount of time I spent making myself look good tonight. With a pair of tiny black shorts, killer black stilettos that bring my already tall five-foot seven frame up a few inches and a backless black and white tank top that ties around my neck, I feel good. My long, wavy chestnut hair is pulled up in a high ponytail, my bangs are swooped down over one eye and I added a little more make-up than normal, giving myself a smoky eye with black eye shadow and bold red lips. For the first time in a long time, I feel sexy. According to the courts, I\u2019m officially separated, but I didn\u2019t do this to attract male attention. I did this for me.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to lie, though. Seeing a few men in the bar doing a double take when I walked in was great for the self-esteem.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s head out to the patio and get some fresh air,\u201d Phina tells me as she picks up both of our drinks from the bar and starts to head towards the front door that leads out to the wooden patio overlooking the parking lot.</p><p>When I told her that being here made me feel old, I wasn\u2019t lying. We used to come to this place every Thursday night during college as soon as we were of drinking age. We live in a small town where everyone knows everyone else and you were guaranteed to run into a handful of people you knew every time you turned around. In college, it was wonderful. We got to see friends from high school who all went away to college and were home on break and people who moved to another state and came back for the holidays. I always came here with Jordan and it created a sense of pride to walk into this place with him and show everyone that we\u2019d done it\u2014we\u2019d defied the odds and made a high school romance last. Now, walking through this bar that has the same green walls, the same old jukebox in the corner and the same rickety patio, I feel like a failure. Nothing here has changed and yet everything has changed for me. I\u2019m embarrassed to run into someone we might recognize and have them look at me with that knowing look in their eyes that says \u2018We knew it wouldn\u2019t work. High school romances never do.\u2019 The fact that I\u2019m more worried about what people will think than I am about my marriage falling apart tells me that I did the right thing.</p><p>I follow Phina to the only table on the patio that isn\u2019t currently occupied. The barstools have been taken by another table, so we make do with just standing next to it.</p><p>\u201cHottie at your six. Don\u2019t turn around,\u201d Phina whispers conspiratorially as she takes a sip of her drink and looks over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to confirm his hotness if I can\u2019t turn around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, he\u2019s got a great ass. Come on, pretty boy, turn around so momma can see your face,\u201d she mutters, completely ignoring me.</p><p>I shake my head at her and signal to the waitress at the next table that we need another round of drinks.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. Oh, holy fuck. Oh, my God there is no WAY that\u2019s him,\u201d Phina swears.</p><p>I look at her in confusion and start to turn around to see what\u2019s got her so riled up when her hand clamps down on my arm. \u201cNO! Don\u2019t turn around. I repeat, do NOT turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d</p><p>Phina quickly ducks her head and hides her body in front of mine. \u201cShit. You are NOT going to believe who is at the table behind you.\u201d</p><p>At this point I\u2019m a little nervous that she\u2019s going to say Jordan. The fact that he hasn\u2019t shown up at the house is a little disconcerting. Every night, I expect him to waltz through the front door like nothing has happened and every time I leave the house I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to run into him. I\u2019m worried that if I see him right now, some part of me will regret the decision I\u2019ve made and forget about all of the damage he\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cWill you just spit it out? Quit being such a drama queen,\u201d I tell her with a roll of my eyes as the waitress drops off another rum and Coke for Phina and a beer for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed, but Collin McDaniels is standing five feet from you,\u201d she tells me with a huge, fake smile on her face as she speaks through her teeth.</p><p>My heart starts thumping erratically and I can feel my face heating up. I haven\u2019t heard that name in years. Granted, I\u2019d thought about that name several times since I was seventeen-years-old, but I never expected to be in the same room with the guy.</p><p>Collin McDaniels: my first boyfriend and the guy who broke my heart in a note. It might seem silly that I still remember so much about him when I haven\u2019t seen him in over seventeen years, but a girl never forgets her first boyfriend, especially when she was with him for two years during a very pivotal time in her life. Granted, it was a pretty tame relationship in the beginning, filled with trips to the movies that our parents had to drive us to and some heavy petting in each other\u2019s living rooms while our parents made themselves scarce so we could have \u2018date night.\u2019 Once Collin could drive, however, we experienced a lot of firsts together in the back seat of his car. I wasn\u2019t really ready to give up the old V card at that point, though, and I\u2019ve always suspected that played a big role in his breaking up with me out of the blue</p><p>Collin and I both had a strange fascination with fire and I\u2019ve always wondered if that was one of the reasons I was drawn to him. When most people think of fire, they think of the smoldering ruins of a house or a forest decimated by wildfire. Collin and I looked at fire and saw possibilities. He saw the opportunity to save a life and I saw a chance to make something beautiful. We understood each other\u2019s peculiarities and it was a commonality no one could take away from us. I never thought it strange that he spent many weekends sitting on the curb in front of our local fire station, just staring at the building and he never thought it was strange that I spent mine playing with gunpowder and matches. I wasn\u2019t some freaky, teenage girl with a death wish, I was an artist. Or so I thought.</p><p>From the time I was a little girl, I always loved to draw and I would use every medium at my disposal to do it: pens, crayons, food, my mother\u2019s make-up or my father\u2019s shoe polish. You name it and I picked it up and created art with it. I quickly grew bored with the usual tools and one day, I saw a show on television about a Chinese artist named Cai Guo-Qiang. The man was an artistic genius who created breathtaking pictures by sprinkling gunpowder onto Japanese hemp paper, using his fingers to mold it into a picture and then lighting the whole thing on fire in one big burst of an explosion. I was fascinated by what was left behind after the fire quickly burned out. When the smoke cleared, what remained wasn\u2019t charred ashes, but the most brilliant designs I had ever seen in any museum or book.</p><p>My parents, being the loving people that they are, gave me the freedom to try my hand at this - on Sundays, as far away from the house as possible, when the neighbors were at church and the two of them were standing by with fire extinguishers and 911 on speed dial. They quickly realized that I had talent and \u2018only on Sundays\u2019 quickly turned into \u2018only when your mother and I are home and your father always lights the fuse.\u2019 My third attempt at creating one of these pieces is how I met Collin. He lived one street over and was outside washing his dad\u2019s car when he heard the boom created by the gunpowder. He came running over, expecting to see our house up in flames. When he found my parents and I smiling like idiots in the backyard, he asked with wide, excited eyes if I could do it again so he could watch. From that moment on, we were joined at the hip.</p><p>When I wasn\u2019t in the backyard exploding canvases while Collin stood by cheering as the final design made itself known, I was inside, curled up on the couch in Collin\u2019s arms sketching out new designs for my next attempt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Collin did everything he could to encourage me while keeping me safe, even going so far as dragging me to the fire station a few times a month so that the men could look at my supplies and make sure I was taking all of the proper precautions when I created one of my masterpieces. He never complained when my nose was stuck in a sketchpad or my fingers were permanently dyed black from the powder. Even when I hated what I created, he would roll it up, stick it in the backseat of his car and take it home to hang on the wall in his room because he wanted to be the first one to own a \u2018Finnley Morgan Original.\u2019 At the end of our two years together, all four of his walls and his ceiling were completely covered in my designs.</p><p>When our relationship died, so did my love of fire and art. The dream of art school was replaced with settling on a career that would pay the bills and keep a roof over my head while my husband pissed our money away. Whenever I played around with the idea of getting back to my hemp paper and gunpowder, Jordan would roll his eyes and tell me it was a waste of time. After I gave up on my dream, the only time I ever thought about my art was when I thought about Collin and wondered if he was happy. I didn\u2019t even realize how much I missed it\u2014or him\u2014until right this very minute.</p><p>Collin understood my passion for art more than anyone else in my life before or since. He was my first boyfriend, his lips were the first I\u2019d ever kissed, his hands brought me to my first orgasm and his dick was the first I\u2019d ever had in my hands\u2014and my mouth. These are things a girl just doesn\u2019t forget.</p> <p>\u201cShit, I wonder what he\u2019s been up to over the years. That boy has turned into a fine looking man.\u201d</p><p>Not that I\u2019d tell Phina, but I know exactly what he\u2019s been up to. Through the power of Facebook on nights when I had a little too much to drink or when Jordan and I were fighting, I might have looked up his profile and kept tabs on him. After college, he moved out of state and became a fireman like he\u2019d always dreamed. When I realized that I was a very married woman fixating on a man I had no hope of ever seeing again, I made a conscious effort to curb my internet stalking. It\u2019s been a while since I last looked at his page and I had no idea he was back in town.</p><p>\u201cWell, holy shit! If it isn\u2019t Phina Giordano!\u201d</p><p>Both of us make the mistake of turning around when we hear the shout from the next table over. Heading our way with a beer in his hand and a smile on his handsome face is D.J. Taylor, best friend to Collin and the guy who had the unfortunate task of handing me Collin\u2019s break-up note senior year and dealing with me crying on his shoulder between sixth and seventh period.</p><p>\u201cDamn, and Finnley Morgan too? It\u2019s our lucky night, Collin!\u201d</p> <p>Collin turns around when he hears my name and looks in our direction. Our eyes meet and, for a moment, I wonder if he\u2019ll even recognize me. I mean, seventeen years is a long time. I haven\u2019t changed a ton, but I know I don\u2019t look exactly like I did back then. I\u2019m taller and I have curves and boobs that hadn\u2019t quite filled out the last time he had his hands on them. Due to his Facebook pictures that I may or may not have poured over a few dozen times, I would recognize him anywhere. Those pictures did not do him justice, though. Phina was absolutely right. He\u2019s definitely turned into a fine looking man. He was cute as a teenager, but he is fucking hot as an adult. He\u2019s well over six-feet now and the worn jeans sitting low on his hips fit him like they were made for his thighs and ass. He\u2019s wearing a long-sleeved navy-blue t-shirt that stretches across his chest, showing off some very well-defined muscles. My eyes trace over the words Franklin FD written in yellow across his chest, confirming that he must still be a fireman. The fact that the city listed on his shirt is one town over means he must have moved back home since the last time I drunkenly stalked him. I can\u2019t explain the sudden burst of happiness any more than I can contain the smile that hits my face at the thought of Collin being so close.</p><p>I watch a dimple form on his cheek when he smiles back at me and, for some crazy reason, butterflies start rapidly beating in my stomach. I hold my breath as he picks up his bottle of beer and walks towards me.</p><p>His eyes never leave mine even as Phina says hello to him and he responds in kind. He doesn\u2019t stop moving until he\u2019s right in front of me and I have to crane my neck to look up at him. He\u2019s standing so close I can feel the heat from his body and, if I move just an inch, my breasts will be pressed up against that gorgeous chest hidden beneath cotton. He smells faintly of cologne and soap and it\u2019s such a delicious scent that it turns my brain into complete mush.</p><p>I hear Phina and D.J. chatting behind us about what they\u2019ve been up to over the years. I know it\u2019s rude that I haven\u2019t said a word to D.J. in greeting, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to look away from Collin. His blue eyes stare into mine and his smile grows wider as he looks down at me.</p><p>\u201cLee.\u201d</p><p>He whispers his nickname for me from back in the day and hearing it fall from his lips is like a straight shot of lust right between my legs.</p> <p>I brace myself for the guilt to take over as I continue to smile back at him. I wait for my brain to remind me that I\u2019m still technically married and that whatever this is I\u2019m feeling is wrong. I wait for the remorse to come, but it never does. It\u2019s been so long since a man looked at me like this and maybe I\u2019m just so starved to feel something... anything other than numb that I don\u2019t even care.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you look amazing,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>Every inch of my body warms at his words and I ignore the little voice in the back of my head that is finally waking up, telling me this is a bad idea.</p><p>A really bad idea.</p><p>Chapter 4\u2014Sparks Will Fly</p><p>\u201cWE ARE TOO old for this fucking bar. Everyone in this place is still in college,\u201d I complain, tipping back my bottle of beer and finishing it off.</p><p>My best friend ignores me, staring at something over my shoulder. I wave my hand in front of his face. \u201cHey, asshole. Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, it\u2019s Seraphina Giordano. Damn, her tits look amazing,\u201d D.J. says with a sigh as he gets up from his stool. \u201cI\u2019m going over there. She let me get to second base in high school, maybe she\u2019ll throw me a bone tonight.\u201d</p> <p>I glance up at the stars when he yells her name and send up a silent prayer that the poor guy doesn\u2019t get punched in the face. Seventeen years since we\u2019ve been out of high school and D.J. still has the mentality of a teenager when it comes to women. He\u2019s been a loyal friend through the years though and when I told him after graduation that I was following my life-long dream of becoming a fireman, he shrugged his shoulders and said \u201cAlright. Sounds like a plan. When do we leave?\u201d</p><p>We went into the fire academy together and always made sure we were assigned to the same firehouses, even when it meant transferring out of state after the one we worked for shut down seven years ago due to budget cuts. When D.J. decided he wanted to advance his career a few years ago by becoming a paramedic, I helped him study and made sure the new addition to his profession was utilized wherever we worked. Since both of our families still live in the same houses we grew up in, when a Captain\u2019s spot opened up the next city over from them, I came home and D.J. followed right behind me.</p><p>When D.J. suggested we go up to Slammers for a drink, it took a lot of cajoling from him to get me to agree. Slammers was our favorite bar when we were younger. We spent every weekend here hanging out with old friends and I spent most of that time staring at the front door waiting for her to walk in. After too many years spent thinking about the one that got away, D.J. finally put his foot down and told me I was being an idiot. What kind of guy still holds a torch for a girl he dated in high school? Someone he hasn\u2019t seen or talked to in over seventeen years? I put her out of my mind once and for all when I left town.</p><p>The next shout from D.J. has me choking on a sip of beer from the new bottle the waitress just set down in front of me.</p><p>\u201cDamn, and Finnley Morgan too? It\u2019s our lucky night, Collin!\u201d</p><p>Hearing her name makes me feel lightheaded and I wonder for a minute if someone slipped something into my beer. I turn around slowly, thinking that it\u2019s possible D.J. made a mistake. What are the odds that she\u2019s here tonight, my first weekend back in town?</p><p>My eyes zero in on her immediately. It\u2019s hard not to when she\u2019s still the hottest girl in the room even after all this time. I look down and find the sexiest pair of fuck-me shoes I\u2019ve ever seen and I let my gaze slide up her long, toned legs, past hips and a rack she didn\u2019t have at seventeen and finally rest on a face that causes all conscious thought to leave my head. I\u2019d almost forgotten just how beautiful she is. Her full lips are covered in red lipstick and I have a sudden flashback of them wrapped around my dick when we were teenagers. I watch as her brown eyes widen when our eyes meet and a little bit of masculine pride flows through me that she recognizes me. I was a gangly, skinny teenager the last time we were in the same room together. I\u2019m not the kind of guy to pat myself on the back, but regular workouts and carrying a hose that weighs 110 pounds up twenty flights of stairs during drills, along with carrying actual human beings up and down multiple flights of stairs during calls means I\u2019m in pretty good shape.</p><p>My legs move automatically and I head in her direction. I can\u2019t take my eyes off of her as I get closer and closer. I always wondered what I would say to her if I ever saw her again. \u2018I\u2019m sorry for being a dick in high school\u2019 never seemed good enough. I stop right in front of her and her perfume tickles my nose and makes my dick swell in my jeans. It\u2019s the same scent she wore all those years ago: a little sweet, a little spicy and just enough that it doesn\u2019t make your eyes water, but leaves a lingering reminder of her presence in the air long after she\u2019s gone.</p><p>I would never admit it to anyone, especially D.J. because he never lets shit go and would have too good a time making fun of me, but I\u2019ve kept tabs on her over the years. Nothing creepy or stalkerish and really, the only reason I know anything about her life since high school is because of my mom. In a small town, it\u2019s pretty easy to learn things about the people living in it and my mom is the queen of small town gossip. I knew Finnley stayed close to home for college and graduated with a Bachelors in business, working as a marketing manager since she got her degree. I knew she married that fucker Jordan Castillo, who swooped in like a buzzard right after we broke up, and I knew they still lived in the area. I was always surprised she never went to art school like we used to talk about.</p><p>I know it\u2019s wrong to be having impure thoughts about a married woman, but I can\u2019t bring myself to give a fuck. She was my girl first. We have a history and, even though it was another lifetime ago, there are some things you just don\u2019t forget or get over. Finnley Morgan-Castillo is the one thing I\u2019ve never forgot.</p><p>Or gotten over.</p><p>\u201cLee.\u201d</p><p>I whisper the nickname I called her when we were together and I watch her smile widen and light up her face.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you look amazing,\u201d I tell her honestly as I make another blatant perusal of her body. Her hand comes up and she tugs lightly on her earlobe and I can\u2019t help but smile. She used to do that when she was nervous. Something about the fact that I still make her nervous makes me bold enough to lean down and brush my lips against her cheek.</p><p>I slide my hand not holding the bottle of beer around her hip and let it rest on her lower back, keeping my cheek pressed against hers as I speak softly in her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you, Lee.\u201d</p><p>I hear her exhale a shaky breath when I move away and let my hand fall from her back before I do something stupid, like grab her ass and kiss her square on the mouth just to see if her lips still taste like the bubblegum lip-gloss she used to wear. For all I know, that dick bag husband of hers is waiting around the corner to interrupt this little reunion and pour a cold bucket of water all over the erection I sprung the moment I heard her name.</p><p>\u201cSo, what brings you ladies to this fancy establishment tonight?\u201d D.J. asks them with a laugh.</p><p>Finnley turns away from me and I move in next to her at the high top table, resting my elbows on top of it and watching her sip her beer out of the corner of my eye. When she licks her lips after she pulls the bottle away, I have to shift my legs to keep my hard-on under wraps.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing much. Just needed to get out of the house and do some celebrating,\u201d Phina replies, sharing a pointed look with Finnley.</p><p>Some type of weird, silent, chick communication thing goes on between them and, if I weren\u2019t staring so intently at Finnley\u2019s profile, I would have missed the almost imperceptible shake of her head. Before I can contemplate what that could possibly mean, D.J. takes Phina\u2019s explanation as an invitation to celebrate with them.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit! I think that calls for some shots. Who wants tequila?!\u201d</p><p>Phina cheers and Finnley and I both share a groan. She looks at me and we both laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d she asks with a tilt of her head.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not thinking about how great it would feel to have her body pressed up against mine again, so I move my train of thought away from that dangerous territory and think back to the party D.J. threw the summer before senior year.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about the time we polished off a bottle of tequila two days before school started and we were still puking during first period Spanish, then yes,\u201d I tell her with a grin.</p><p>I watch as she grimaces and shakes her head to try and clear the memory from her mind. \u201cTequila es no bueno.\u201d</p><p>We reminisce about the party and the food poisoning story the four of us told the nurse to explain why we were all sick as dogs on the first day of school. A few minutes later, shots are placed in front of us along with a plate of sugarcoated lemons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our small group each takes a shot glass and a lemon, raising them up in the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to regret everything about this night, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Finnley asks Phina with a laugh.</p><p>Forgetting about dick bag husbands who may or may not kick my ass, I slide close enough to Finnley that our arms are touching, leaning down until my lips brush her ear to whisper, \u201cHopefully you won\u2019t regret everything about tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 5\u2014Let the Flames Begin</p><p>I\u2019M DRUNK.</p><p>I lost count how many shots of tequila I tossed back after number three. As the night wore on, the four of us continued to reminisce about high school and Collin and I moved closer and closer to one another until we were pressed together from shoulder to wrist. After who knows what number shot, my head fell to the side until it was resting on his shoulder. He never acknowledged that it happened or moved away, so at least I didn\u2019t have to be mortified about moving into sloppy drunk girl territory and making him regret coming over here.</p><p>I lift my head off of his shoulder when I realize the conversation has gone silent because Phina and D.J. are making out across the table from us.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom,\u201d I blurt, suddenly feeling very uncomfortable with the scene unfolding in front of me. Since all I\u2019ve been able to think about after Collin walked over here is kissing him, I\u2019m feeling a little jealous of my best friend and I don\u2019t like it at all.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Collin quickly states, wrapping his arm around my waist and pulling me away from the table.</p><p>He\u2019s obviously not too keen on watching our friends stick their tongues down each other\u2019s throats, either. As we make our way through the throngs of people on the patio, Collin keeps his arm wrapped firmly around my waist, only releasing me once we\u2019ve reached the end of the hallway where the bathrooms are.</p><p>Locking myself in the bathroom, I lean against the door and calm my racing heart.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>Pushing away from the door, I step up to the sink and rest my hands on the countertop, staring at myself in the mirror. Under normal circumstances, I would blame my flushed cheeks and bright eyes on the tequila. It\u2019s definitely the cause for the slight spinning of the room and my unsteady feet, but the pink on my cheeks and the sparkle in my eyes is all Collin. Every time he touched me tonight I got goose bumps, and just thinking about going back out there and standing next to him makes the hair on my arms stand up. I can\u2019t get over how good he looks, how great he smells and how he still has this kind of affect on me after all this time. Shouldn\u2019t I be holding a grudge that he broke my heart? I don\u2019t care how long ago it was, I let him stick his hand down my pants and he thanked me with a note that said \u2018it\u2019s just not working out between us.\u2019</p><p>I want to blame my overactive libido on the fact that it\u2019s been months since I had sex and years since I had good sex. It\u2019s hard to get in the mood when you\u2019re constantly angry with your husband. One week without turned into two, two turned into five and soon we were only having sex because I felt guilty for not having sex with the man I was married to. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I had an orgasm that wasn\u2019t assisted by my own fingers or the arsenal of vibrators we bought to spice things up.</p> <p>Jordan is the one and only man I\u2019ve ever had sex with, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve never thought about what it would have been like with someone else\u2014namely, Collin. He\u2019s the only other person I had any kind of sexual experiences with. I really don\u2019t know why I always turned him down, other than the fact that I just didn\u2019t feel ready until I met Jordan. Seeing him tonight has brought all of those thoughts to the surface. I wonder if he kisses the same and if he\u2019d fumble around in my underwear not really knowing what he was doing. I wonder if my brain would be able to shut off long enough to even let him try something or if thoughts of Jordan would interfere, reminding me that, even though our marriage is over, he\u2019s still the only man I\u2019ve ever been with. Sex was always something special and sacred between us. No one ever really believed it when we told them, but I was his first and only, as well, and that was one of the things we were the most proud of. Would I even know what the hell to do with another man if given the chance? And why am I standing here in the bathroom contemplating this right now? I ran into an old high school boyfriend. Just because he\u2019s hot and he seems to be doing everything he can to get close to me tonight doesn\u2019t mean he really wants anything to do with me. He\u2019s probably just waiting for me to throw up on him like I did the last time we drank tequila together.</p><p>I am such an idiot.</p><p>I\u2019ve been out of the game for far too long. Hell, I was never even really in the game. After Collin, I jumped right into a relationship with Jordan and I eventually married him. With a disgusted shake of my head, I quickly rinse my hands and head back out into the hallway.</p><p>I stop short when I see Collin leaning against the wall across from the bathroom with his hands in his pockets. He looked up as soon as I opened the door and now we\u2019re both just standing here staring at each other. I jump when the bathroom door pulls shut behind me with a bang.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait for me. I\u2019m drunk, but I\u2019m pretty sure I can still walk,\u201d I tell him with an uncomfortable laugh as I lean back against the closed door.</p><p>He pushes himself off the wall and closes the distance between us in two steps, his arms coming up on either side of my head and caging me in.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d he tells me seriously, his eyes staring down at my lips as he speaks.</p><p>My tongue darts out to wet my bottom lip that suddenly became bone dry when he moved in close to me and I hear him groan softly.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper, not really sure if I\u2019m telling him \u2018Okay you can ask me a question\u2019 or \u2018Okay you can fucking kiss me already.\u2019</p><p>Collin moves forward until his hips are pressed up against mine. I keep my hands down by my sides, flattened against the cold steel of the door to try and cool down the heat flowing through my body at his nearness.</p><p>\u201cAre you still married?\u201d he asks with a raise of one eyebrow.</p><p>Of all the things I thought he\u2019d ask me, this definitely wasn\u2019t one of them. How in the hell does he even know that I was married?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... I... we\u2019re separated,\u201d I stutter.</p><p>I thought saying the words out loud would make my heart hurt, but I still feel nothing. If anything, saying them has lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders and helped to drive home the reality that my marriage is over.</p><p>Collin doesn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes, just continues to stare down at me while I watch a muscle tick in his jaw.</p><p>Standing this close to him has turned me into an idiot and I feel like if I don\u2019t say something, this silence is going to stretch between us until it\u2019s uncomfortable. I open my mouth to say who-the-hell-knows-what, but before I can utter a word, Collin nods his head slightly and smiles down at me. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I start to ask him what\u2019s so good about me being separated when his hands suddenly drop from the door, wrap around my waist and pull me tight against his chest. He halts my gasp of surprise when his lips crash against mine. I immediately open my mouth to him and it\u2019s my turn to groan when I feel his tongue slide into my mouth and tangle with my own. My hands immediately fly up to his head and I slide my fingers through his short, black hair, pulling his mouth harder against mine. In all the years I thought about kissing him again, I pictured it exactly like it was in high school\u2014clashing teeth, sloppy tongues and wiping the drool away from our chins when it was over. This kiss is nothing like that. His lips are firm and his tongue moves boldly as it swirls around mine. He tastes like peppermint and beer as he gently sucks my tongue into his mouth. His hips press harder against me and I slide one of my legs around the back of his thigh until I can feel his erection rubbing against the thin material of my shorts between my legs. His tongue begins to move through my mouth in tune with the motion of his hips against me.</p><p>Push.</p><p>Push.</p><p>Push.</p><p>He pushes his tongue deeper and slowly grinds himself between my thighs. He takes his time exploring my mouth and, with each jerk of his hips against me, I can feel myself getting wetter and wetter, the throbbing in my clit growing stronger every time the rough denim of his jeans rubs against my bare thighs and his tongue circles mine. His hands glide down my back to cup my ass and help move my lower body against him. He continues to roll his hips into me as he uses his grip on my ass to slide me up and down over his hardness. I\u2019m moving jerkily against him, not caring how desperate I seem or how needy I sound each time I whimper when I feel another burst of arousal shoot through my core. There isn\u2019t an inch of space between us, our bodies pressed so tightly together that I\u2019m surprised I even have the ability to move against him. My body shakes with the need for release and Collin instinctively knows how close I am to coming, kneading his hands harder into the cheeks of my ass and moving me faster against him. I don\u2019t know how many times we did things like this when we were dating, but it was never this intense and it never had me close to coming this quickly. I can feel my orgasm tingling just beyond my reach...</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I need to use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>A female voice right beside us pulls me out of my hormone-induced stupor and I break off the mind-numbing kiss. When I try to push myself away, Collin tightens his hold on me, maintaining the contact in the lower halves of our bodies as he moves us away from the door. The woman gives us a dirty look before disappearing inside the bathroom.</p><p>With as much strength as I can muster in my lust and alcohol fueled high, I bring my hands up to Collin\u2019s chest and push him away. I look down at my feet, trying not to let the embarrassment I\u2019m currently feeling show on my face. I\u2019m suddenly very conscious of the fact that I was dry humping a guy I haven\u2019t spoken to in seventeen years in a public hallway, a guy I kind of thought I hated until I saw him again tonight. Bringing my hands up to my cheeks and holding them there to cover up the redness I know is prominent, I struggle to calm my racing heart as it threatens to burst out of my chest.</p><p>Without a word, I turn away from Collin and rush down the hall, pushing my way through the crowd that has doubled in size since we walked to the bathroom. When I get back to the patio, I walk as fast as my high-heeled feet will allow, pull Phina out of D.J.\u2019s arms and tell her we need to leave. She takes one look at my face and scoops up her purse, blowing a kiss to D.J. and giving him a wink before whisking me down the steps of the patio and into the parking lot, where she shoves me into her car and quickly pulls away from the bar.</p><p>Wanna know why Phina is my best friend? Please tell me how many women would walk away from a make-out session with a gorgeous fireman without a single protest.</p><p>We\u2019re a few miles down the road before she finally breaks the silence.</p><p>\u201cYou were gone for an awfully long time. Does that have anything to do with your flushed face and the guilty look you\u2019re currently sporting?\u201d she asks, not taking her eyes off of the road.</p><p>Letting my head fall back against the seat rest, I close my eyes and bring my fingers up to my lips, the feel of Collin still there and the ache between my legs a reminder of how close to release I was before we were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me,\u201d I finally admit after a few seconds, turning my head to stare at Phina\u2019s profile.</p><p>\u201cHot damn, he doesn\u2019t waste any time, does he? He totally still has a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>I throw her a look of disbelief even though she can\u2019t see it in the dark car. \u201cIt\u2019s been seventeen years, Phina. I highly doubt he has any sort of thing for me aside from a case of blue balls at this point in time.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and shakes her head at me when she stops at a read light and turns to face me. \u201cCome on, you know he\u2019s regretted breaking up with you every day since he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of the sort. You\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head at me and narrows her eyes. \u201cThis is a small town, my dear, and everyone has a mother with a big mouth. I know for a fact that Collin asks about you practically every time he talks to his mother.\u201d</p><p>I knew it for a fact, too, mostly because my mother, who had never been Jordan\u2019s biggest fan, mentioned it dozens of times over the years. I never paid it much attention, seeing as I was married and all. Sure, I thought about Collin from time to time, but I didn\u2019t really think we\u2019d ever see each other again and I certainly never expected to be kind of single when it happened. I always figured that when I ran into him again, Jordan would be at my side and we\u2019d be blissfully in love and I could rub it in Collin\u2019s face that the guy who picked up the pieces of the broken heart he left behind turned out to be the love of my life and we were living happily ever after.</p><p>Clearly, that is not going to happen.</p><p>Everything about tonight has me confused and I know tomorrow will bring a headache that\u2019s equal parts tequila and emotional distress over what I\u2019m fairly sure was the huge mistake I made tonight.</p><p>I mean, it was a mistake, right?</p><p>This was the first time I\u2019d laid eyes on Collin since graduation and I\u2019m sure it will be another decade and a half before I see him again. We can probably just chalk this up to a lapse in judgment due to an overabundance of alcohol.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Chapter 6\u2014Playing With Fire</p><p>IT\u2019S OFFICIAL.</p><p>It\u2019s done. Jordan has been served the separation papers and my cell phone has been ringing non-stop since it happened. I know I\u2019m being a coward by sending his calls to voicemail, but I really don\u2019t give a shit. He\u2019s had plenty of years to change, plenty of years to be the man I needed him to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too little, too late.</p><p>There\u2019s not one single thing he could say to me now that would make me change my mind. This wasn\u2019t a rash decision. I took these four weeks away from him to really sit down and think about our life together. I was with him for so long. We grew up together and he\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s a scary thing to realize that I stayed for so long because I was in love with the idea of our relationship, not with him. I was seduced by the idea of showing everyone that we could defy the odds, that a couple who met and fell in love in high school could live happily ever after. Walking into the courthouse today, I knew I\u2019d made the right decision when I didn\u2019t mourn the future we might have had if things had been different. Instead, it made me sad to think about all the time I wasted trying to fight for something that was clearly never meant to be.</p><p>After a few hours of work, I suck it up and head into an empty conference room to listen to his voicemails. The first couple of them were just as I expected. Jordan pleading and apologizing for screwing up, promising that he\u2019ll get help and he\u2019ll make it up to me. Each one grows increasingly more desperate until I can pinpoint the exact moment when he stops being upset and just gets angry. He calls me every insult he can think of, curses and yells and then apologizes for his behavior the very next message. It\u2019s an emotional tidal wave that I\u2019ve dealt with from him for years. His words cut like a knife and he thinks that an apology can staunch the bleeding. He has no idea that those words have piled up until the scars on my heart are so jagged there is no sewing them back together.</p> <p>I feel like a fool for the guilt that\u2019s consumed me since Collin\u2019s kiss and my almost-orgasm Saturday night at the bar. Once the residual effects of tequila overload dissipated, I was filled with regret over my response to Collin on what was my first night out without my husband. Even though I feel nothing in my heart anymore for Jordan, he was still my best friend and the man I\u2019d loved for half of my life. I was more than a little ashamed at having let things get so out of hand with Collin, even though I knew the combination of tequila and nostalgia were mostly to blame. Seeing him again brought back a lot of memories and took me back to a time when I was young and carefree and had my whole life ahead of me. It made me remember what it felt like to get butterflies in my stomach during a first kiss and how exciting it was to experience all of those firsts.</p><p>Listening to Jordan berate me and call me a heartless bitch almost makes me wish I would have dragged Collin into a dark, empty room at the bar and let him fuck me up against the wall. Hearing Jordan\u2019s last voicemail announce in a threatening voice that he spoke to his attorney and I can\u2019t keep him out of his house has me storming out of the conference room with my phone clutched so tightly in my hand that I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t snap in half. The loud, high-pitched shriek of the building\u2019s fire alarm starts to blare through the office right before I make it to my desk. I look around to see everyone grabbing his or her things and making a hasty exit towards the stairwell. Usually, we get some sort of notice from building management when we\u2019re going to have a drill. The shocked look on everyone\u2019s faces has me quickly snatching up my purse from the bottom drawer of my desk and following behind them, down four flights of stairs to join the few hundred other people out on the sidewalk from various companies throughout the building.</p><p>Moving away from the small group of work friends I usually hang out with, I find some shade under a tree down on the corner and lean my shoulder against the trunk. I knew Jordan would behave this way. I anticipated it and yet, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. Maybe it\u2019s cruel of me to just want him gone from my life when he so obviously has a problem with addiction. Maybe I should be helping him instead of shutting him out completely. At this point though, I just can\u2019t find it in myself to care. It\u2019s been too many years of the same thing, too much time dealing with one addiction after another. All of my emotions where Jordan is concerned have long been dead and buried.</p><p>I make a conscious decision not to spend another second beating myself up over his failures and my guilt. As I close my eyes and take in a few breaths of fresh spring air, my thoughts immediately turn to the hallway at Slammers and the feel of Collin\u2019s body against mine. I can still recall the sensation of his warm tongue gliding through my mouth and how it felt to have another man moving between my legs. Despite the warmth of the air blowing across my skin, a shiver races up in spine as I wonder just how much further things would have progressed in that dimly lit hallway with the music from the jukebox blaring all around us. If that woman hadn\u2019t interrupted us, would he have slid his hands up the bare skin of my thigh wrapped around him? Would he have edged his fingers inside the hem of my shorts and slid them across the lacy edge of my thong to feel I how wet he\u2019d made me with just one kiss? My nipples harden through my white lace bra and the thin silk of my white blouse and I clench my thighs together beneath the black pencil skirt when I think about how exciting and illicit it would have been if he\u2019d pushed his fingers inside me and brought me to orgasm just a few feet away from the crowds of people who could have seen us at any time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I jerk away from the tree and my eyes fly open in shock at the sound of a deep masculine voice right by my ear.</p><p>Like some sort of twisted dream come true, the object of my current fantasy is standing right in front of me, one muscular arm extended above my head so that his hand is resting against the tree as he looks down at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cCollin! Wh-what are you doing here?\u201d I stutter, trying to hide the quiver in my voice at the sight of him and hope the thoughts I was just having aren\u2019t written all over my face.</p><p>He stares down at me, his eyes taking me in from head to toe, stopping briefly when he gets to my breasts and I almost bring my arms up to cover my traitorous nipples. Jordan\u2019s voice calling me an uncaring bitch flashes through my head and I force myself to keep my hands down by my sides, my anger at his attitude pushing a newfound boldness through me.</p><p>\u201cSmall electrical fire in the basement of your building,\u201d Collin finally answers, moving his body closer to mine. \u201cI\u2019m training the new captain for your town\u2019s fire department so I\u2019m going out on all their calls with them today. The men have it under control now, so you should be able to get back to work in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I finally take the time to look him over myself. He\u2019s got on a short-sleeved version of the shirt he was wearing at Slammers, the thin cotton material clinging to his skin and the cut of his biceps on full display. I watch the muscles in his upper arms tighten under my gaze as I check out the tattoo on his left bicep and it takes everything in me not to reach up and trace my fingers over the ink. My eyes wander down his abs to his tapered waist where his shirt is tucked in to a pair of belted cargo pants before moving back up to his face. The smirk that turns up the corner of his mouth should make me feel mortified that he\u2019s standing here watching me ogle his body, but it doesn\u2019t. It pushes my confidence up a few notches and makes me want to do whatever I can to wipe it off of his face and see if I can make him trip over his words.</p> <p>Aside from that make-out session on Saturday night, he\u2019s only ever known teenage Finnley, a girl who had no clue what she was doing when it came to pleasing a man. He\u2019s definitely proven that his skills have matured over the years, and I feel like it\u2019s only fair to reciprocate.</p><p>At this point, I don\u2019t even care about his reasons for kissing me the other night. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s some misplaced infatuation he\u2019s had for me all these years (which is highly unlikely) or if it was just the excitement of seeing each other again after all that time. I want to watch his pupils dilate with desire and I want to see him try and hide his erection behind those cargo pants when he goes back to work. I\u2019ve been in a near-constant state of arousal since Saturday night, unable to stop thinking about the feel of his lips or what it would be like to have any part of him inside my body.</p><p>If I have to suffer, dammit, I want him right there with me.</p><p>Glancing around to make sure no one is watching, I step closer until my breasts are pressed up against his chest, sliding my hands up his bare arms until my fingers are wrapped around the hard muscles of his biceps. Even in four-inch stilettos, I still have to stand up on my tiptoes to bring our mouths together. I realize he\u2019s holding his breath when I don\u2019t feel it against my lips. When I feel the muscles under my fingers tightening as Collin attempts to hold himself perfectly still, I realize I\u2019m not alone in my attraction.</p><p>Using just the tips of my front teeth, I gently tug on his bottom lip, bringing my tongue out afterwards to gently slide over and soothe the spot I just nipped. He\u2019s statue still, the only indications that my ministrations have any affect at all are in the slight narrowing of his eyes as they bore into mine and the movement of his Adam\u2019s apple as he swallows thickly.</p><p>I slide my hands up across his shoulders and down to his chest, stopping when I can feel his heart thumping against my palms and the heat from his skin burning through the material of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire, Lee,\u201d he growls as I shift my hips against him until I can feel the hardness of his obvious arousal.</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to smirk at him before I slide my cheek against his until my lips are ghosting against his ear. Back when we were teenagers, he used to turn into a boneless mass of horny boy whenever I did anything to his ears. Wondering if that still holds true, I do the same thing to the soft skin of his earlobe that I just did to his bottom lip, gently biting down on the sensitive flesh with the tips of my teeth before sucking it into my mouth and letting my tongue swirl around the skin against my lips.</p> <p>A low, muttered \u201cfuck\u201d comes out of his mouth, so deep and gravelly that it sounded like it had been ripped from the depths of his chest. The arm braced against the tree comes down to wrap around my waist as Collin holds me tightly against him.</p><p>I place my lips right into the hollow of his ear and puff out a warm breath of air before I speak. \u201cLucky for me, you\u2019re a fireman and you can put out the fire.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightens around me until I\u2019m molded to his body from hips to shoulders. I haven\u2019t felt this wicked or sensual in a long time. At this point, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever felt like this. This raw, all-consuming need flowing through my body makes me forget about everything going on in my life. My thoughts are filled with visions of us naked and the feel of his smooth, hard body against my own. I have a brief flash of what him taking me would look like, of gazing down between our bodies and watching him thrust inside of me, of seeing my wetness coating the skin of his cock as he takes me hard, pushing into me until I\u2019m screaming his name and clawing at his back.</p><p>The shouts of my co-workers in the distance break me out of my lust- induced stupor and I reach behind me to remove Collin\u2019s arm from my waist, stepping back a few inches so I can think rationally.</p><p>Turning away from him, I begin heading back into the building. I only make it a few feet when I hear him call my name and, without turning back, I quickly rattle off my address. I put a little extra swing in my hips as I make my way down the sidewalk, confident in the fact that he\u2019s most likely staring at my ass as I go.</p><p>I have no idea when or even if he\u2019ll actually show up at my house. The only thing I\u2019m certain of right now is that if I don\u2019t find out what it feels like to have sex with Collin McDaniels, I\u2019m going to spontaneously combust from desire.</p><p>Chapter 7\u2014Burn With You</p><p>I COULDN\u2019T BRING myself to care that Finnley was still technically married. When she told me Saturday night at the bar she was separated, it was the only confirmation I needed to stop feeling guilty about wanting her so much I ache with it and take the kiss I\u2019d been thinking about ever since I saw her again. One kiss, that\u2019s all I told myself I wanted, just a single taste of her lips to see if my memory had served me well. As soon as I felt her tongue against mine, I was thrown back in time seventeen years, my dick hardening in my jeans immediately when she opened her mouth and let me in. It started off as a test to see if she had the same affect on me. We\u2019ve been apart a long time and we\u2019ve grown and both changed. Just the sight of her got my blood pumping, but who knew if kissing her would still have the same results? I quickly found out that my memory of Finnley was total bullshit compared to the real thing. She\u2019d always been tall and slender and I remember loving the feel of her thin hips in my hands and her smooth skin beneath my palms. All those years changed Finnley for the better. She had curves now that made my head spin and tits that I knew would be more than a handful.</p><p>When the truck pulled up to the office building, I jumped down from the back giving orders to my men, more than a little surprised when I caught a glimpse of her leaning up against a tree not far from the building. My mom had given me regular updates on Finnley throughout the years, so I knew where she worked, but in the sea of people milling around the area, I never expected to run into her.</p><p>She ran off so quickly after that kiss Saturday night I figured I\u2019d scared the shit out of her. I always thought the first time I saw her again would be spent apologizing for my dick behavior when I was young and dumb, not pushing her up against a wall in a bar, wishing she was wearing a skirt so I could slide it up her thighs and fuck her hard enough to make the ache go away. I wanted to kiss her just once as an adult to see if I could finally put all of these obsessive thoughts I\u2019d had about her for seventeen years to bed once and for all.</p><p>Unfortunately, that kiss only ignited the flame and now I just want to take her\u2014on the floor, against the wall, in my bed\u2014anywhere and everywhere I could finally experience the heat of being inside the body she\u2019d always denied me when we were younger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s always pissed me off that we spent two years together and all of my attempts at seduction were turned down because she wasn\u2019t ready, only to find out she jumped right into bed with that asshole Jordan not long after we broke up. I know we were young, I know we definitely weren\u2019t ready for the heavy responsibility that comes with having sex, but I never understood what he had that I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019m thirty-three years old and I\u2019m still pissed off about something that happened when I was seventeen. D.J.\u2019s right, I\u2019m a fucking idiot.</p><p>Once the guys had the electrical fire under control in the basement and I knew the building wasn\u2019t going up in flames, I made my way over to where Finnley stood with her eyes closed, deep in thought, to apologize for what happened Saturday night. I didn\u2019t want her to think I was some pathetic guy who was still pining for his high school girlfriend after almost two decades, even if it was basically true. As soon as I got close to her and smelled her soft, fruity perfume and saw the outline of her hardened nipples through the thin material of her top, my good intentions left my body and were replaced by a rush of need. I wanted to put my mouth over the silk of her shirt and suck her nipples into my mouth. I wanted to stare down at the wet spot left behind that would showcase the rosy color of her nipples and then go back in for another taste, running my tongue in a circle around the tight buds.</p><p>I watched as a beautiful pink spread up her chest and across her cheeks after I spoke, silently praying that blush was a result of my interrupting memories of what happened between us a few nights before. Hope quickly turned into arousal when Finnley looked up at me with a gleam in her big brown eyes, standing up on her toes and leaning forward to bite down on my lip. She obviously remembered how sensitive my ears have always been and it almost made me come in my pants when she ran her tongue right along the edge. It took every bit of self-control I could muster to remember that our co-workers were just a few yards away and I figured pushing up the black skirt that molded to her hips and thighs and fucking her up against the base of the tree would be frowned upon. I don\u2019t know what this thing is happening between us. Right now, I\u2019m chalking it up to residual lust and curiosity about what it would be like to have Finnley Morgan beneath me, something I\u2019d always dreamed about. Thoughts of her regretting what happened were quickly tossed aside at her bold behavior and the flippant way she tossed out her address without a second look back as she walked away from me. I didn\u2019t bother taking my eyes off of her ass as I watched her walk along the sidewalk, hurrying to catch up with her co-workers before disappearing inside the building. This is not the Finnley I remember from high school. That girl was shy and sweet and never initiated anything physical between us. This girl, this woman, radiates sex with just a smile and the husky sound of her voice when she speaks against my ear.</p><p>After a quick shower at the station at the end of my shift, I didn\u2019t think twice about turning my truck in the direction of her house, ignoring the fact that this was probably wrong on so many levels. Even though I wasn\u2019t dating anyone seriously, she was still a married woman, regardless of whether or not her husband was out of the picture. I should probably feel bad that one of the main reasons I\u2019m currently pulling into her driveway is because I\u2019d like nothing more than to fuck with Jordan Castillo\u2019s life, figuratively and literally. I never liked him as a teenager and the things I\u2019ve heard about him as an adult prove that my opinion of him was spot on. There have been a ton of rumors about his bad behavior through the years. I don\u2019t know the cause of their separation, but I hope to God she finally found out the truth about the scumbag she married. I don\u2019t even care if she\u2019s just using me to get back at him, or if their separation isn\u2019t permanent. All I know is that right now, she\u2019s free and clear and she obviously wants me. I couldn\u2019t pass this up if my life depended on it.</p><p>Pulling into the driveway of the address she gave me, I take a minute to stare at the house in front of me. It\u2019s an older two-story colonial with flower boxes attached to the first floor windows and a neatly landscaped yard with an American flag hanging on a pole off of the front porch. This is the home she lived in with her husband, the place where she built a life with another man and never gave me a second thought. Am I really going to waltz in there and defile all of her memories with a quick fuck?</p><p>Remembering the feel of her breasts pressed up against my chest and her warm breath skating over my ear, I think about the way her moans of pleasure vibrated through my mouth as I kissed her. My dick stirs with arousal as I recall the way she rubbed the heat between her thighs against me and I quickly open the door to my truck, slamming it behind me as I stalk up to her front porch.</p><p>You bet your ass I\u2019m going to taint this fucking house.</p><p>I\u2019m going to erase every single memory of Jordan from every single room until she can\u2019t walk into the kitchen without thinking about my cock buried deep inside her. I\u2019m going to fuck her on every available surface and then I\u2019m going to do it again just for the hell of it. I\u2019m going to take what should have been mine years ago before I fucked it all up and then I\u2019m going to walk away and finally put this woman out of my head once and for all.</p><p>The front door opens before I can ring the bell and, seeing Finnley standing in the doorway in nothing but a towel, droplets of water dripping down between the valley of her breasts and her long brown hair curling naturally from the shower she must have recently taken, I quickly realize that walking away from her when this is all said and done might not be as easy as I thought.</p><p>Without speaking a word, I push my way into the house, backing her up and kicking the door closed behind me. I don\u2019t give her time to change her mind, not one single second to rethink her decision to give me her address this afternoon. I charge forward and wrap my arms around her towel-clad body, lifting her up until she can wrap her legs around my waist. If she showed any signs of fear or apprehension on that gorgeous face of hers, I would have stopped immediately. Fortunately for both of us, there\u2019s nothing but need in her eyes as she stares down at me, her chest rising and falling quickly with each breath she takes.</p><p>With one hand under her ass holding her against me, I quickly use the other hand to tug on the edge of the towel tucked in between her breasts to hold it in place. The material parts and I stare at her naked breasts right in front of my face. They\u2019re larger and fuller than the last time I\u2019d seen them and my mouth waters as I think about sucking every inch of them into my mouth. Her fingers slide through the hair on the back of my head and pull me closer, urging me to taste her. I immediately comply, latching my mouth onto one nipple and sucking it into my mouth.</p><p>Finnley tosses her head back and moans softly, her thighs tightening around my hips and her hands pressing me harder against her as I continue to pull her nipple into my mouth and swirl my tongue around and around it, over and over until she starts grinding her hips against me.</p><p>I move a few blind steps forward, stopping when her back crashes into the wall next to the door. I pull my face away from her breast to rip the towel the rest of the way off of her body, impatient with the desire to have her completely naked in my arms. Tossing the towel aside, I use my hips to anchor her in place against the wall, bringing my hands up to frame her face before I slam my lips against hers. I swallow her cries of need as I plunge my tongue into her mouth. Her hands move away from the back of my head and quickly go to the hem of my t-shirt, clawing and tugging on it in an attempt to get it up and off my body. I move away from her lips long enough to help her, tossing my shirt in the general direction of the towel that covered her body before going back in for another taste of her mouth.</p><p>When I pull back a few seconds later, I can\u2019t help but grin at her sounds of protest. I chuckle as she grabs onto my head and tries to pull me back in, outright laughing at the look she gives me when I resist.</p><p>\u201cI love your mouth, baby, but there\u2019s something else I\u2019m dying to taste right now.\u201d</p><p>I watch her eyes flare with equal parts arousal and curiosity as I move my hands away from her face, slowly sliding them down her neck to skate over her collarbones and cup her breasts, lightly pinching her nipples before I resume my downward path. Her legs slide down from around my hips until her feet rest on the floor, her breathing growing more and more erratic as I use my fingertips to lightly trace the skin around her belly button. Breaking eye contact, I follow my hands down her body until I\u2019m kneeling in front of her. I wrap my hands around her hips and pull the lower half of her body forward until I can smell her arousal and practically taste it on my tongue.</p><p>I glance up at her through hooded eyes and see her staring down at me, her skin flushed with desire as her tongue darts out and licks her lips in anticipation of what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what you taste like. You have no idea how badly I wanted to drive my tongue into this tight little pussy all those years ago, but I had no idea what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>My eyes travel down the beautiful woman in front of me, stopping when I meet her waxed, bare sex. Sliding one hand away from her hip, I trace a solitary finger up and down either side of her swollen lips, teasing her by refusing to dip it in between them to pull out her wetness and spread it around. Her hips move against my fingers, begging me for more. I look up at her as she bites down on her lower lip, closing her eyes and letting her head fall back against the wall.</p><p>I slowly drag my finger between her inner lips and circle it around her clit until I hear her moan.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Lee. I want you to watch me suck your clit into my mouth and push my tongue inside you,\u201d I tell her with a low voice.</p> <p>With a shaky breath, she opens her eyes, her eyelids fluttering as she struggles to focus before looking down at me. When I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not going to look away again, I close my own eyes and the distance between us, preparing to do exactly as I promised. I tighten my hand on her hip as she writhes against me, wrap my lips around her clit and pull it hard into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck! Oh, my God.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a strangled curse and it takes everything in me not to shout with her as I get my first taste of her sweet pussy on my tongue.</p><p>Chapter 8\u2014Sex on Fire</p><p>\u201cOPEN YOUR EYES, Lee. I want you to watch me suck your clit into my mouth and push my tongue inside you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a little embarrassed by the fact that just those simple words from Collin are almost enough to make me come. It\u2019s only when he buries his face between my legs and I feel his lips and tongue wrap around my clit that I realize the words were nothing compared to the feel of him working me into his mouth.</p><p>I\u2019m only half aware of the curses flying from my mouth as his tongue circles my clit. When his hand joins his mouth between my legs and he quickly thrusts two of his long, thick fingers inside of me, the sensation becomes almost too much to bear and I have to force myself to keep my eyes open like he asked. I must admit that the sight of him sucking my clit past his lips as he fucks me roughly with his fingers is almost as hot as feeling it happen.</p><p>I bring my hands to the back of his head and pull him in closer, thrusting my hips against his face as he works me over with his lips and tongue and his fingers curl inside of me. Our eyes meet as he looks up from what he\u2019s doing, his mouth moving away from me but his fingers continuing their deep push and pull.</p><p>\u201cLee,\u201d he moans my name, the hot breath from his words tickling against my sex. \u201cYou taste so fucking sweet, baby. Like sugar and honey.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been much for dirty talk. Jordan and I were both virgins, so our initial attempts at sex were awkward and fumbling at best. Once we learned each other\u2019s bodies and figured out what worked and what didn\u2019t, we had a pretty good sex life for the better part of our marriage. I\u2019ve always been a little on the shy side, so Jordan was usually the aggressor when it came to our sex life. When he attempted a little dirty talk, it always felt weird and it never turned me on. I was satisfied with our routine and, even though we experimented here and there with different positions and toys, I\u2019m realizing now just how much I\u2019ve been missing. The strength of the response this man wrings from me with only his tongue and his fingers and a handful of words borders on cataclysmic.</p><p>As Collin dives back between my thighs, sliding his tongue inside me with his fingers, a part of me wonders if I\u2019m reacting so strongly because I\u2019m with someone new and different or because Collin instinctively knows my body like the back of his hand. Even though what\u2019s happening right now is new territory for us, he knows the exact pressure I need from his mouth and he knows the perfect way to curl his fingers inside of me as pulls them out. Even after over a decade of marriage, Jordan still needed instruction when it came to giving me pleasure. I moved his fingers when they rubbed in the wrong direction or grasped onto his hips to slow him down when he fucked me too fast. The man worshipping my pussy has no such problem. Collin works my body like he\u2019s spent years getting intimately acquainted with it.</p><p>His mouth is hot and wet on my clit and he continues the motion and pressure of his tongue as it circles me, realizing that if he changes up what he\u2019s doing too quickly the orgasm that\u2019s hovering right there, waiting for me to fall over the edge into oblivion, will slip out of my reach. He pushes his fingers so deep inside of me that I feel his knuckles pressing against the sensitive skin of my inner lips. My hips roll against his mouth, his tongue never slowing its assault on my clit and I bite my lip to keep from crying out. When the tips of his fingers brush against my g-spot seconds later, his demand to keep my eyes open is forgotten as the first wave of my orgasm washes over me. I squeeze my eyes closed, my fingers clutching so tightly to the hair on his head that I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll have bald spots when I\u2019m done as my legs shake and my hips thrust frantically against his hand. I come against his lips and tongue and he drinks me in, sucking down every last drop and prolonging my orgasm with little flicks of his tongue until my body feels like jelly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean heavily against the wall, attempting to recover as he climbs to his feet, unbuckling his jeans and pushing them down just enough to free his cock from behind the zipper. I stare down at the thick, long length of him as he glides his hand from base to tip, my eyes widening in surprise at his size. My memory is a little fuzzy, but I\u2019m certain the dick I delivered awkward handjobs and clumsy blowjobs to as a teenager was never this big.</p><p>Damn. He grew all over.</p><p>I realize I must\u2019ve said that out loud when he chuckles. I tear my eyes away from the vision of him stroking himself to gaze up at him through my lashes. \u201cI want to touch you, Collin,\u201d I whisper in deference to the intimacy of the moment, my hand inching forward to join his.</p> <p>A noise somewhere between a growl and a groan escapes his throat as he leans down until his lips are pressed against my ear. \u201cI won\u2019t last a minute if you touch me right now and I fucking need to be inside of you.\u201d</p><p>He raises his head and I nod in agreement before he bends his knees and uses his hand to guide his cock through my slit, coating the tip with my wetness. I remember the vision I had earlier of looking down between our bodies and watching as his cock disappeared inside of me, glistening with my juices. I feel another clench of arousal thrum between my legs, completely shocked that I\u2019m ready for another orgasm while I\u2019m still reeling from the aftershocks of the first one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Lee,\u201d Collin says with a groan as he continues to slide the tip of his cock up and down and around my clit. \u201cI\u2019ve never fucked anyone without a condom but I can\u2019t stand the thought of not feeling every inch of you on my cock.\u201d</p><p>If it were possible to come from words alone, that right there would have done it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill and I\u2019ve only been with him,\u201d I whisper, not wanting to say his name out loud and break the spell that\u2019s crackling in the air between us.</p> <p>\u201cI swear to fuck I\u2019m clean. I would never do anything to hurt you, you know that, right?\u201d he asks, looking up from what he\u2019s doing between us to stare into my eyes.</p><p>I realize trusting a man I hadn\u2019t spoken to in seventeen years until just a few days ago probably isn\u2019t the best idea in this day and age. I used to know everything about Collin and I trusted him wholeheartedly, but that was a long time ago and we\u2019re both different people. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been or who he\u2019s slept with, but something about the conviction in his voice and the way he looks at me lets me know I can still trust him. Even though he\u2019s not the boy I once knew and I know very little about the man he\u2019s become, I know with everything inside of me that he\u2019s telling me the truth. He would never do anything to hurt me.</p><p>Leaning towards him, I rest my forehead against his and speak the words I know to be true. \u201cI know. I trust you. Please, Collin. I need you.\u201d</p><p>With one hand still holding his cock right at my entrance, he uses his other hand to slide down my hip and grasp the back of my thigh, pulling my leg up around his waist.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to fuck you up against this wall, Finnley?\u201d he whispers, running his hand back up my thigh until he\u2019s clutching my bare ass.</p><p>I\u2019m at a loss for words when he speaks, pushing just the head of his cock into me and holding still. I try to push myself forward and bring him inside my body, but he holds himself away from me, teasing me with a swirl of his hips while he denies me the pleasure of his complete penetration.</p> <p>I clasp my hands together behind his neck, my forehead still pressed against his as I look down between us and see just how much hard length of him there is that still needs to fit inside me. I briefly wonder if it\u2019s even going to work, but Collin speaks again and all semblance of worry flees from my mind. The wetness he\u2019s creating between my thighs with his words alone is certain to ease his passage.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Finnley. Say it. I want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>He makes the tiniest of movements, easing forward just enough to push a little more of his cock into me and have me panting for all of it, begging him for more.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, Collin. Jesus, just fuck me,\u201d I whisper harshly.</p><p>He lets out a guttural groan and slams into me with one hard thrust, filling me so completely that I shout in pleasure, tossing my head back. His other hand smacks down on my ass and the sting of his palm is a surprising blend of pleasure and pain. He grips the cheeks of my ass tightly with both hands and lifts, forcing me to curl both of my legs around him and hang on for dear life. He begins a pounding rhythm against me, fucking me so hard and so deep that I hear the photos on the wall behind me rattle in their frames each time his hips slam into mine. Just like the other night at the bar, he clutches my ass and moves me against him, lifting me almost completely off his cock when he glides out and slamming me back down when he thrusts inside me.</p><p>I feel his teeth at the skin of my neck, lightly nipping as his hips piston against me over and over until I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to push both of us right through the wall. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve had back to back orgasms, a feat Jordan only accomplished with the assistance of a vibrator, so I\u2019m caught off-guard by the telltale tingle of pending release that courses through me each time Collin\u2019s groin slams against my clit.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Finnley. I need to feel you coming around my cock,\u201d Collin whispers against my neck as he picks up the pace, slamming into me so hard I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to have bruises on my back. His hands tighten on my ass, gripping almost to the point of pain as he impales me over and over again on his cock. My body goes rigid, preparing for release, at the thought of wearing the marks from this man\u2019s hands on my ass tomorrow.</p><p>Everything in the lower half of my body ignites and I hook my ankles together behind his back, using the muscles of my thighs to move against him faster and harder until I feel the rush of my second orgasm explode through my sex, shouting his name as I shatter around him.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, baby, I can feel you coming. Goddammit, you feel so good,\u201d Collin mutters, kissing his way up my neck until he gets to my lips, where he plunges his tongue inside my mouth with the same, deep thrusting motion as his cock inside me.</p><p>His thrusts lose their rhythm and his breathing becomes more erratic as he fucks me faster and faster, breaking the seal of our lips so he can draw in air. I feel his ass clench beneath my ankles as he slams deeply into me one last time, holding himself still as he comes inside of me.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m coming!\u201d he shouts against my lips as he grinds his pelvis against me. I feel his cock pulse inside me with each spurt of his release and I squeeze my kegel muscles, milking him and pulling each and every drop into my body.</p><p>His grinding abruptly ceases as his body slumps against mine and he buries his face into the side of my neck. I take a deep breath in and hold it, trying unsuccessfully to slow my racing heart. I can still feel his cock inside of me, twitching with the last remnants of his orgasm and I wait once again for guilt to overwhelm me, for the rush of shame over what I\u2019ve just done to take hold and the tears start to fall.</p><p>I\u2019ve just taken another man inside my body. I let him come inside me and it was better than anything I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. I\u2019ve only allowed one other man to do this to me and it should feel like a betrayal of everything we meant to each other. I should be ashamed that I just tarnished the one and only perfect thing that was left between us. I can no longer say that Jordan is the only man I\u2019ve ever had sex with. I can no longer hold my head up with pride knowing that, no matter what went wrong between us, there was one thing that neither of us would ever dare damage.</p><p>For reasons beyond my comprehension, the regret I\u2019ve braced myself to deal with never comes.</p><p>I feel nothing right now but exhaustion and satisfaction...</p><p>And the slow stirrings of arousal when I think about repeating what just happened between us as soon as possible.</p><p>Chapter 9\u2014Fuel the Fire</p><p>I STARE AT myself in the full-length mirror behind my bedroom door, gazing in open fascination at the flush that colors the skin that runs from my breasts up to my cheeks and the wild tangle of chestnut curls that hangs around my face. Twisting my body and turning my head to look back over my shoulder, I see red marks along my upper back, a stark reminder of the force of Collin\u2019s thrusts as he pummeled me into the wall. Dropping my gaze lower, I\u2019m confronted with further evidence of his possession in the form of his fingerprints dotting both cheeks of my ass, and I find myself unable to stop the satisfied smile that takes over my face as I recall the way he dug his fingers into me and slammed my body against him</p><p>Jordan left his mark on me only once during the course of our marriage, smacking my ass so hard that it brought tears to my eyes. After I punched him in the arm and threatened to cut off his balls, he swore he\u2019d never do it again. Rough sex is not something that ever held any appeal for me. I certainly never thought being fucked against a wall so hard it left marks would turn me on, but I find myself staring at the results of what we just did and feeling that familiar stirring between my legs again.</p><p>I hear the water shut off in the bathroom across the hall and turn away from the mirror before Collin sees that I\u2019ve been obsessively eyeing all the things he did to my body. I\u2019m not fast enough, though, and the dimple in his cheek stands out when he smirks at me as he strolls naked into the room,</p><p>\u201cChecking out my handy work?\u201d he asks, coming to stand behind me while I rummage through my dresser drawer for a pair of underwear and a tank top, trying to pretend like that wasn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d been doing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so cocky, Mr. McDaniels,\u201d I warn, glancing at him over my shoulder.</p><p>He presses his body against my back and I feel his cock, hot and hard between the cheeks of my ass.</p><p>Jesus, how in the hell is he already hard again?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I earned the right to be a little cocky,\u201d he whispers close to my ear.</p><p>I can\u2019t even think of a sufficient comeback because he\u2019s right. He definitely went above and beyond tonight and I won\u2019t deny him his right to gloat. After giving me two mind-numbing orgasms, he\u2019s certainly earned it.</p><p>The heat of his body is suddenly gone as he moves away from me, his fingertips trailing down my spine and then circling each little red mark. I close my eyes as he leans in and kisses each spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was so rough, Lee,\u201d he whispers as he squats down and presses his lips against the area on my ass that\u2019s still pink from his handprint.</p><p>He stands back up, bringing his body flush against mine again and I lean my head back against his chest as his arms wrap around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI like having your marks on my body,\u201d I tell him honestly, because it\u2019s the absolute truth.</p><p>I like that those marks will serve as a reminder of Collin\u2019s possession for days to come, but, more than that, I love what each of those marks mean. Never in my life have I experienced the absolute feminine power of having a man want me beyond all reason, the thrill of having him need me so much that he couldn\u2019t hold himself back, nor did I think I wanted to. I never had any desire to push the boundaries of sex with Jordan because deep down, I didn\u2019t really trust him. I didn\u2019t trust him enough to take care of me or explore that dark side of my sexual needs I\u2019ve kept buried inside. I also know in my heart that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to let go like that with any man other then Collin. I want it all, the dark and the sweet and everything in between, and I want it with the man standing behind me. I never felt comfortable telling Jordan what I wanted or needed from him, but I know I don\u2019t have to be afraid with Collin.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes and watch,\u201d he demands softly as he slightly turns both of our bodies.</p><p>Damn, what is it with him and making me watch?</p><p>I comply with his request and when I see that he\u2019s turned us to face the mirror, I suddenly understand why he wants me to look this time.</p><p>I watch as the palms of his hands flatten against my stomach before they move in opposite directions, one going up to cup my breast and the other going down to cup my sex.</p><p>His thumb begins to trace a circle around one hard nipple while the other thumb slowly circles my clit. I let out a gasp as I watch his middle finger slide between my folds before dipping inside of me. He holds his hand still and seeing his finger completely disappeared inside of me is the most erotic thing I\u2019ve ever seen. He continues to circle both my clit and my nipple with the same achingly slow speed all the while keeping that long, thick finger perfectly motionless inside my body.</p><p>\u201cSlide your hand down here, baby,\u201d he orders quietly. I manage to tear my eyes away from the sight of his hand cupping my sex, meeting his gaze in the mirror with a puzzled look on my face. \u201cI want you to feel this, Lee. Push your finger inside you with mine.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea who this man is saying such delicious things against my ear and I can\u2019t believe I ever worried that adult Collin\u2019s sexual skills would be a repeat of the awkward, bungling attempts of the boy I knew in high school. Seventeen-year- old Collin couldn\u2019t bring me to the edge of release with a bit of dirty talk or play my body like he owned it. He\u2019s grown up in more ways than one and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that right now.</p><p>Resting my hand on top of his forearm, I slide it down until my palm brushes over top of his hand and our fingers are almost interlaced. I can feel the knuckle of his middle finger and I move my own until I\u2019m doing as he asked and pushing it inside myself right alongside his. He pulls his hand away from me slowly, sliding both of our fingers out to the tips and holding them there until I can\u2019t take the torture any longer. I push on his hand so we both slide right back in, my wetness coating both of us.</p><p>We continue the push and pull of our fingers while his thumb brushes back and forth over my clit, his other hand still working my nipple with the exact same speed and pressure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet, Finnley. Do you like watching our fingers fuck you?\u201d he asks, staring at my face in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI like anything you do to me,\u201d I reply with a shaky breath as he picks up the speed of our fingers until the only sound in the room is the wet, sucking noise our fingers make as they sink inside me over and over.</p><p>He bends his knees behind me and I see the tip of his cock between my legs as I stare into the mirror, our fingers continuing to move in a blindingly fast pace.</p><p>In one perfectly executed move, he pulls our fingers out of my body and immediately replaces them with his cock, sliding deep inside of me with one slow push.</p><p>His hand stops its ministrations on my nipple and instead, bands tightly around my ribs right below my breasts to hold me up. Thank God for that because I\u2019m not sure how much longer I\u2019ll be able to stand on my own. As he works himself in and out of me, using two fingers to rub my clit, I reach behind me to grasp his hips, curling my nails into his flesh as he slowly fucks me. He takes his time with me, each plunge deep and precise and so completely unlike our earlier encounter. Being taken up against the wall in a rush of slapping bodies and bruised skin was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced before, but this slow burn with its sensual intensity is just as good.</p><p>The fingers circling my clit move maddeningly fast while his cock plunges into me deep and slow, the opposing sensations melting together until I\u2019m nothing but a burning pile of need. It\u2019s a struggle simply to stand here and try to help him keep my body upright when my thighs start to shake as my body hovers at the brink of orgasm. My hands clench his hips tighter and I lock down my muscles, afraid to move for fear of losing my hold on the feelings coursing through my body\u2014</p><p>The need to scream.</p><p>The need to come.</p><p>The need to keep him here so he can do this to me every single day.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>That thought should scare the hell out of me, but it doesn\u2019t. This time is impossibly better than the first and I can only imagine that it will continue to get better every single time.</p><p>My release comes swiftly and without warning, my pussy clamping down on his cock as I continue to watch what he\u2019s doing to me in the mirror, my mouth open on a silent scream of pleasure. I gasp and pant through my orgasm until my throat is so dry it feels like it will crack. As I come down from my high, Collin turns us away from the mirror, grabs my hands from his hips and places them on top of the dresser in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHold on, baby,\u201d he warns.</p><p>I have just enough time to brace myself against the smooth surface of my dresser before he pulls his cock completely out of me and immediately slams it back in to the hilt. I cry out in pleasure as he resumes the same pounding rhythm as earlier, his hips slapping into my ass as he grips my hips tightly and uses my body to find his release.</p><p>I lift myself up on my toes and arch my back, giving him easier access and allowing him to drive himself inside me, as deep as he can go, again and again. I feel the heat of him behind me and the length of him inside me and I\u2019ve never felt more completely overwhelmed. I love the sound of him losing control, growls and curses that are rough and foul and so fucking sexy that I feel my pussy tighten down on his cock in an involuntary spasm. I love that I can already tell when he\u2019s getting ready to come just by the way his movements become jerky, like he can\u2019t control what he\u2019s doing and his only thought is of coming inside me.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Lee. FUCK!\u201d he shouts, slamming deep one last time before he lets go, his hips grinding against my ass as he comes.</p><p>We both collapse on top of the dresser, my breasts flattening against the cool wood and his warm chest pressing against my back. He shifts his hips, slipping out of me and I feel his come drip down the inside of my thighs.</p><p>Collin wraps both of his arms around my waist and peppers my back with kisses while I try and catch my breath, wondering if I\u2019ll ever get enough of this man.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I can\u2019t get enough of you,\u201d he mutters against me, voicing my own thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m already thinking about fucking you again.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself as he runs his hands over the skin of my upper back.</p><p>\u201cFuck, the things I want to do to your body should be illegal.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my head, I look over my shoulder at him. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine with that. As soon as I recover, you can do anything you want to my body.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes darken and I know he\u2019s contemplating all the things he wants to do to me. I\u2019m fairly certain that most, if not all of them, will be new experiences for me and I shiver in anticipation.</p><p>The distant sound of the front door opening and slamming shut brings me out of my orgasm-induced euphoria and I jerk up from the dresser, pushing Collin away from me in the process. He gives me a strange look, clearly confused for a moment, and I realize he must not have heard what I did.</p><p>There\u2019s only one person who has a key to this house, one person who would be walking through that front door right now.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have ignored his calls. I should have acted like an adult and talked to him. I knew that going radio silent would piss him off and eventually he\u2019d ignore everything I said to him the day he left about how I couldn\u2019t stand to look at him and I never wanted to see him again.</p><p>The separation papers obviously weren\u2019t enough for him. Seeing me freshly fucked from another man and that man still in our home, a man who he\u2019s always hated for the simple fact that I dated him first, is going to be one big wake-up call for him. Part of me wants to grab Collin\u2019s hand and drag him out into the living room without a care about our nakedness and shove it right down Jordan\u2019s throat. The other part of me, the more logical, less bitchy side, wants to hide Collin in the closet and keep what we just did a secret. Not because I\u2019m ashamed, or I feel guilty, but because bringing this out in the open will make it real. Making it real means it can be taken away at any moment and I\u2019m not ready to let this go just yet. I don\u2019t know if this is rebound sex, a way to get back at Jordan sex or something more than sex. It\u2019s too new and too fresh and I haven\u2019t had time to process it yet. I\u2019m still in a little bubble of bliss and I\u2019m not ready for that bubble to be popped.</p><p>\u201cFinnley? Babe! I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>I cringe when I hear Jordan\u2019s shout. Judging by the angry look on Collin\u2019s face, my bubble of bliss just exploded and Jordan was holding the sharp pin of destruction.</p><p>Chapter 10\u2014Powderkeg</p><p>I CANNOT BELIEVE this is fucking happening right now.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just stay in here,\u201d Finnley begs for the third time as I watch her quickly throw on a short, black robe she grabs from the end of the bed.</p><p>I cross my arms in front of me, silently fuming, as she rushes towards the door. She looks back over her shoulder at me, her brown eyes filled with worry and sadness.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispers brokenly one last time before turning away and rushing down the hall, the door pulling closed behind her.</p><p>I hear her footsteps as she races down the stairs followed by the sounds of murmured voices before I finally let the anger that\u2019s been simmering just under the surface since I head him speak her fucking name boil over. Picking up a pillow from the end of the bed, I bunch it in my hands and then chuck it as hard as I can at the mirror hanging behind the door, equal parts pissed off and grateful that it wasn\u2019t something harder. Gripping my hands in my hair so tight my eyes start to water, I pace around the room while the voices down below get increasingly louder.</p><p>I should have made her tell me what the hell was going on with Jordan before I started any of this shit with her. Fuck, separated could mean anything from him staying in a hotel for a week while they worked out their problems to her getting ready to leave his ass for good. I was a complete and total dumbass for immediately assuming the latter. My thoughts had been centered on Finnley, on getting inside her sweet body with the hope of sating my curiosity and removing all traces of her from my heart and mind once and for all. I\u2019d planned on leaving here today with all traces of my infatuation with Finnley wiped from my mind and without another look back. I didn\u2019t expect for one taste of her to turn into an addiction, never imagined that fucking her would only solidify my obsession. This woman, who\u2019s spent years dominating my headspace, is suddenly under my skin and in my blood and now I can\u2019t imagine not fucking her every day for the rest of my life. I\u2019ll be damned if that fuck head Jordan Castillo is going to ruin my chances with her once again.</p><p>Snatching up my jeans and t-shirt from the foot of the bed where I\u2019d tossed them before our second round of mind-blowing sex, I quickly get dressed and walk over to the door. I quietly pull it open just a crack and crane my neck to listen, not giving a shit that I\u2019m eavesdropping right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jordan. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>The broken apology from Finnley makes my blood boil and I grip the handle of the door so hard I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t break off in my hand.</p><p>Is she taking him back? Is she forgiving him for whatever the fuck he did and taking him back when I\u2019m standing right here after she just spent the past hour and a half letting me fuck her?</p><p>My smell is still on her skin and my come is still pooling inside her body and she\u2019s taking that fucker back. This woman has completely fucked me in more ways than one. The day I let her go, the memory of her and what we had together took root and it grew and grew until she became a fantasy in my mind. I placed this perfect, amazing woman so high on a pedestal in my mind that no other woman could even come close to reaching the ideal of her, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that dreams are much better than reality. I built her up so high in my mind that there was nowhere else for her to go but crashing down.</p><p>\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T KEEP ME OUT OF MY OWN FUCKING HOUSE, YOU STUPID BITCH!\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door slams against the wall and I\u2019m racing barefoot down the stairs before I even realize what I\u2019m doing. I completely disregard the bullshit promise I made to Finnley to stay hidden in the bedroom when I hear the fury in Jordan\u2019s voice. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll sit here and hide like a little bitch while he screams at her.</p><p>I\u2019m filled with blind rage when I walk into the living room and see Jordan\u2019s hands wrapped tightly around Finnley\u2019s arms as he shakes her like a ragdoll, spit flying from his mouth as he screams at her.</p><p>I fly across the room, clutching the front of his shirt in my fists and dragging him away from Finnley, stopping when his back slams against the wall beside the door\u2014the same wall I just fucked his wife up against. I ignore Finnley\u2019s shouts from behind me as I press him as hard as I can into the wall and get right in his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever touch her or speak to her like that again,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cCollin, please!\u201d Finnley begs, her hands grabbing onto my shoulders as she tries to pull me off of Jordan.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking WHORE!\u201d Jordan screams as he looks over my shoulder at his wife.</p><p>I press my forearm into his neck, watching his eyes bulge out of their sockets and his face turn red as I cut off his air supply. \u201cCall her a whore again. Go ahead. Say something else, please. Give me a fucking reason to beat the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan claws at my arm while Finnley tugs on my shoulders and I let my anger slow to a simmer while I shoot daggers at the worthless piece of shit in front of me.</p><p>\u201cCollin, he can\u2019t breathe!\u201d</p><p>Finnley\u2019s strangled cry forces its way into my conscience and I finally ease up, pushing my forearm into this throat one last time before backing away. Jordan\u2019s hands immediately wrap around his neck as he bends over, coughing and sputtering pathetically like a Goddamn pussy.</p><p>When he can finally breathe normally again, he stands up to his full height, puffs out his chest and glares at me, his nostrils flaring like an angry bull. I can tell he\u2019s thinking about charging, that he\u2019d like nothing better than to punch me in the face. I can see it in the way his chest heaves and his hands clench and unclench into fists at his sides. Aside from the tattoos covering both of his arms from wrists to shoulders and the strung-out look in his eyes, he looks like the same punk from high school. He\u2019s taller and has a few more muscles, but I can still wipe the floor with his ass. I silently dare him to punch me. Outside of taking his wife back up to their bedroom and fucking her brains out, I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d love more than to put him on his ass. I\u2019ve always hated him, knowing he poached what should have been mine. I\u2019ve spent many years wishing I could be alone in a room with him just once so I could show him who the better man is.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would do this to me,\u201d he finally says, staring right at me, but I know his words are for Finnley.</p><p>He finally looks away from me to Finnley. I can feel the heat of her body right behind me. I can smell her skin and I can hear her breath stutter with every word he speaks, but I can\u2019t bring myself to turn around. I refuse to see the look of anguish and regret on her face that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s putting there.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen years, Finn. Seventeen years and you\u2019re going to throw it all away by sleeping with him?\u201d Jordan asks in disgust.</p><p>The fact I just came running downstairs from the bedroom and she\u2019s standing here in nothing but a robe makes what happened between us pretty obvious. She doesn\u2019t say a word to confirm or deny it, but even Jordan isn\u2019t that stupid. I want her to choose me, to tell him that even though she married him, it\u2019s always been me. I want her to tell him to leave and pick me. Pick me, dammit!</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck him in my bed?\u201d</p><p>I take a step in Jordan\u2019s direction and once again, Finnley\u2019s hand comes out and grips onto my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCollin, you need to go. Please, just go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She practically sobs the words and my heart drops all the way down to my feet, so completely removed from my chest that I could drop it on the floor and kick it across the room.</p><p>I\u2019m such a fucking idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone with him.\u201d</p><p>I speak my words with conviction even though I want nothing more than to run out of here with my tail between my legs like a wounded fucking puppy. I feel like a Goddamn kicked puppy and I have to fight the urge to rub my sternum to ease the pain in my chest. Fuck, this woman is lethal. No matter how much it hurts, though, I will NOT leave her alone and let him hurt her again.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you! She\u2019s my wife and this is our house!\u201d Jordan argues.</p><p>Finnley steps between us, placing a hand in the center of my chest to push me away from Jordan, and I finally see her face. Just like I assumed, she looks beaten down with guilt and sadness.</p><p>\u201cCollin, please. I can handle this; it\u2019s fine. I just need you to leave,\u201d she tells me softly.</p><p>I can\u2019t even stand to look at her right now, so I turn away from her and leave the house without another word.</p><p>As I drive away, I pray to God that I don\u2019t regret leaving her alone with him. Even though I\u2019m pissed and I\u2019m hurt, I would never want something bad to happen to her. I would rather die than even think about any harm coming to her, no matter how broken I feel right now.</p> <p>Instead of going home to my empty place, I head to the bar. I need to get drunk. Maybe an entire bottle of whiskey will wash away the singed ashes of my heart.</p><p>Chapter 11\u2014Eyes on Fire</p><p>I CAN\u2019T STOP crying. For over a month, I didn\u2019t shed a single tear about making Jordan leave, not one. Now, I\u2019m sitting on my couch sobbing so hard I can barely breathe while Phina passes me a box of tissues.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you, hon. He\u2019s probably just a little pissed at how it all went down,\u201d she reassures me.</p><p>The funny thing is, I can feel in my bones that Collin hates me. I should have never treated him like a dirty little secret and I should have never told him to leave, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I knew him and Jordan being in the same room together for even a minute longer would have resulted in bloodshed and I didn\u2019t want the situation to get any uglier than it already had. I didn\u2019t have time to explain to Collin my reasons for wanting him to stay in the bedroom and I didn\u2019t have time to explain to him that I would much rather Jordan leave than him. No time, there was never enough time and now I feel like there\u2019s been a shift in my universe that I\u2019m never going to be able to set right.</p><p>Everything between us happened so fast and I didn\u2019t have any time to process it before it all blew up in my face. Did I make a mistake? I jumped right into another relationship, if that\u2019s what you can call it, before the ink terminating the previous one was even dry. I took a chance, I took a leap and I did something completely out of character. It doesn\u2019t feel like a mistake and it certainly didn\u2019t feel wrong at the time. Shit, it still doesn\u2019t feel wrong. Actually, it\u2019s the most right I felt in a long time.</p> <p>\u201cGod, I feel like such an idiot. What the hell am I even doing?\u201d I ask Phina as I grab a Kleenex from the box and dry off my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking with your vagina for once instead of your head and your heart. I say it\u2019s a win all around,\u201d she says with a laugh.</p><p>I laugh right along with her but shake my head at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s not even that. I mean, the sex is... Jesus, the sex is something I can\u2019t even put into words. But it\u2019s so much more than sex and that is the insane part. I mean, I don\u2019t even know him. I used to know him. I used to know everything about him, but it\u2019s been seventeen years! Why do I feel worse about him walking away than I do about Jordan?\u201d</p><p>I let my head flop to the back of the couch and stare up at the ceiling. \u201cI feel this strange connection to Collin, like he was always meant to be in my life one way or another. I never told you this, but I\u2019ve thought about him so much over the years and seeing him again feels almost like we were never apart. We just fit so well and it feels so right, but I felt that way about Jordan for the longest time, too. He was my best friend and I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he fucked everything up and threw away your trust,\u201d Phina reminds me. \u201cTrust is the most important thing in any relationship, you know that. Do you trust Collin?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and turn my head to face her. \u201cIn some ways I do, but I don\u2019t even know him. I mean, I know his family, I know how old he was when he got into his first fight, I know he made honor roll every year in high school and I know he hated the purple cummerbund I made him wear to prom junior year. I know the basics about what he\u2019s been doing with his life since then but what about everything else? Does he still like the same junk food, is Full Metal Jacket still his favorite movie, who did he lose his virginity to and why the hell didn\u2019t he ever get married and have kids? I\u2019ve spent less than five hours with the man since I was seventeen years old and we spent most of that time fucking like rabbits. Maybe it\u2019s just the thrill of something new and exciting or a way for me to purge Jordan from my mind and my heart once and for all. The final nail in the coffin, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>Phina raises an eyebrow and stares at me. \u201cDoes it really feel like that? Did you really just have sex with the guy to step out of your comfort zone and take a new toy for a test drive? Jordan is the only man you\u2019ve ever had sex with. Ever. You have always been firm in that conviction and I really don\u2019t see you jumping into bed with the first man who comes along. Even though technically you did jump into bed with the first man who came along.\u201d</p><p>I swat at her arm when she laughs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, you\u2019re not the type of woman that has sex with some random just to get your mind off of your troubles. You stayed true to Jordan for seventeen years even though he continued to fuck everything up and fuck everything else in sight. You wouldn\u2019t have sex with someone unless there was something there and that something was much more than just hormones.\u201d</p><p>My head flies up from the couch and I feel bile churning in my stomach.</p><p>Phina\u2019s eyes widen when she realizes what she just let slip. \u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward on the couch and put my elbows on my knees and my head in my hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw up, okay? I don\u2019t do well with vomit,\u201d Phina says in a rush as she rubs her hand in circles on my back.</p><p>I\u2019ve always wondered if Jordan cheated on me. He broke every other marriage vow, so why wouldn\u2019t he have broken the most important one? He was always so proud of the fact that we\u2019d only slept with each other, always the first to brag about it when someone brought up the topic. When the lies started to outnumber the truths, though, and I began to realize just how deeply he was mired in addiction, him fucking other women didn\u2019t seem like such a stretch, but I could never bring myself to ask him about it. The simple fact is, I never really believed he would do it because I knew I would never do it.</p><p>I lift my head and look at her worried face. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw up, don\u2019t worry. I might pile the rest of his shit in the yard and light a bonfire or start chucking breakable objects, but I\u2019m definitely not going to puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I suggest starting with your wedding china? I\u2019ve always wanted to throw a few of those God awful pieces his mother picked out and watch them shatter.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at her and sigh. \u201cSo, do you know this for a fact or are you just assuming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, part of it is assumption, but most of it is rumor. I\u2019m so sorry I never told you. You were always so forgiving of him and every time I wanted to say something, you guys were always doing so well that I didn\u2019t want to ruin your life, especially if it wasn\u2019t true,\u201d she admits. \u201cEven though he pissed me off on a regular basis, I just wanted you to be happy and I wanted it to work between you two. When you finally decided to leave his ass for good a month ago, I swear I was going to tell you. I was waiting for the right time. I didn\u2019t mean to just blurt it out like an asshole.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arm around her shoulder and pull her close to me. \u201cYou\u2019re not an asshole. I\u2019m a little pissed that you didn\u2019t tell me, but I get it. You didn\u2019t know for sure and you didn\u2019t want to make things worse.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve spent too much time over the years being angry, and there\u2019s no way I could hold a grudge against my best friend for doing what she thought was best. No matter how much she hated what Jordan did to me, she stood by me without judging me for the choices I made and I know it couldn\u2019t have been easy for her to keep something like this to herself. If the tables were turned, I honestly don\u2019t know what I would have done. Her not telling me before now is actually a blessing. I hate to think that I\u2019ve been one of those women who\u2019s had her head in her ass when it comes to her husband\u2019s infidelity, but I can admit that a small part of me didn\u2019t really want to know. If I\u2019d found out something like this a year ago, it would have completely broken me and I never would have gotten over the hurt. I don\u2019t think I would have been able to move on or trust another man ever again. A year ago, I still believed Jordan could change and that he would change because he loved me enough to be the man I needed him to be. Finding this information out now, when I\u2019m stronger than I\u2019ve ever been and one hundred percent firm in my belief that our relationship is over, makes it easier to handle.</p><p>After Collin walked out the door earlier, I finally spelled it out for Jordan. He told me he was going into rehab and he told me he made arrangements for us to go to marriage counseling. I laughed in his face. It probably wasn\u2019t the best reaction, but I was still raw and upset about the look on Collin\u2019s face when I asked him to leave. I was pissed at Jordan for waltzing into the house and screwing everything up. Hearing that he\u2019s most likely been cheating on me for years, I don\u2019t feel bad at all for lashing out at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to marriage counseling, Jordan. Our marriage is over. You got the separation papers, right?\u201d</p><p>He huffed and crossed his arms in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re just pissed at me, I get it. I screwed up. We can just go up to the courthouse and tell them you made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make a mistake. For the first time in seventeen years, I did something right. I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve decided to go to rehab, but frankly, I don\u2019t give a shit, Jordan. You need to leave. If you want, I\u2019ll pack up your things and drop them off at your mom\u2019s house, but you can\u2019t just come over here whenever you want and think that it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He took a step towards me and, for a moment I wished I had never asked Collin to leave. Jordan has never physically hurt me before, but there\u2019s always a first time for everything.</p><p>\u201cNeed I remind you again that this is my house, too? You can\u2019t keep me out of my house. I already called the police and this house is half mine. I\u2019m staying here and you can fucking leave,\u201d he told me angrily.</p><p>He said those exact same words to me before, years ago when I tried to get him to leave. Like a coward, I believed his shit and I was the one that packed a bag and spent a week at a hotel. Then, just like always, he begged and pleaded and I came running back to him, the vicious cycle continuing over and over.</p><p>Until now. I finally grew a backbone and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m leaving MY house.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I told him easily. \u201cI\u2019ll leave and you can have the house. You can also pay the mortgage, the electric bill, the gas bill, the property taxes, the home owner\u2019s insurance and everything else that comes along with owning this house. In case you can\u2019t do the math, that\u2019s around twenty-five hundred dollars a month, give or take.\u201d</p><p>The cockiness on his face immediately died and he stared at me in shock, his mouth opening and closing wordlessly like a fish gasping for its last breath.</p><p>I knew he couldn\u2019t afford to pay the bills on his own. He couldn\u2019t hold a job for more than a few months. His most recent bartending job wouldn\u2019t even cover half of the mortgage alone. It was a low blow reminding him that his career potential was shot to shit but I didn\u2019t care. I\u2019d been paying the bills practically on my own for years. If he wanted the house and the responsibilities that came along with it, he could have it.</p><p>\u201cYou are making the biggest fucking mistake right now,\u201d he tried to threaten.</p><p>\u201cThe only mistake I made was trusting you. Believe me, I\u2019ve learned my lesson. Now either get out, or I\u2019m going to call the police you supposedly spoke to and have them remove your ass.\u201d</p><p>He threw in a few more idle threats about how he was never coming back if I let him walk out the door and a last ditch attempt at guilt by telling me he couldn\u2019t believe I would ruin everything we had by sleeping with someone else. Thank God I didn\u2019t let his words get to me and make me second-guess anything I had done with Collin.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do about Collin?\u201d Phina asks, bringing me back from my thoughts.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I push myself up from the couch. \u201cI have no fucking clue. There\u2019s still that little problem of me kicking him out of the house right after we had the best sex I\u2019ve ever had. Oh, and jumping into whatever this thing is between us without knowing anything about him.\u201d</p><p>Phina gets up from the couch stands next to me. \u201cSo? Get to know him. Ask him every single question you can think of until it\u2019s all out in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the look on his face when he left. He was hurt and he was angry and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to forgive me for pushing him away. He doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on with Jordan and me. For all he knows, I took Jordan back after he left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phina shrugs. \u201cWell then, put on the hottest piece of lingerie you own, storm into the fire station and explain it to him. He\u2019s a man, Finnley. Just show him your tits. That will distract him long enough for you to speak your piece.\u201d</p><p>While I work out the details of the plan brewing in my head, Phina and I go into the kitchen, filling our arms with dishes, bowls, serving platters and coffee cups before making our way outside. In the middle of my driveway at ten o\u2019clock on a Monday night, my best friend and I laugh and cheer as we break every single piece of wedding china I own. Sure, I\u2019ve got a mess to clean up when we\u2019re done, but I feel much better than I did an hour ago.</p><p>My heart is brimming with the need to discover everything there is to know about Collin and my body is burning with the desire to feel his hands on me again. I think about the black lace push-up bra, matching thong and garter belt with black lace thigh-highs that has been sitting in a Victoria\u2019s Secret bag in the back of my closet for over a year</p> <p>I think I finally found the perfect place to wear it. Hopefully, Collin lets me near him long enough to show it to him.</p><p>As I slam a salad bowl on the driveway and watch the pieces scatter, the anticipation of seeing him again, of having him inside me, is hard to ignore. I can already feel his hands sliding up my legs to unhook the garter belt and his face between my thighs, his warm breath seeping through the lace of my thong.</p><p>Please, God let this plan work.</p><p>I\u2019ve already become addicted to him and I\u2019m pretty sure there isn\u2019t a rehab facility anywhere in this world that could cure me.</p><p>Chapter 12\u2014Let the Sparks Fly</p> <p>THE LOUD, EAR-PIERCING screech of a whistle next to my ear sends a bolt of pain straight to my temples. I turn to scowl at D.J. as he smirks at me, the whistle still dangling from his lips.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Captain. Was that too loud for you?\u201d D.J. asks with an innocent look.</p><p>I should have known better than to drink the night before weekly drills at the station. As the captain of Franklin Ten House, I\u2019m not required to run the drills with my men, but most of the time I do. Under normal circumstances, I\u2019m out there with them in the bay running advancing hose drills, shoulder carries with two-hundred pound test dummies, cradle carries, ladder sprints and a multitude of other drills designed to keep the men in shape and provide a little healthy competition. Today, however, I\u2019m perfectly fine holding the stopwatch and letting D.J., our Incident Commander, run things. If he blows that whistle anywhere near me again, though, I\u2019m not going to be responsible for my actions.</p><p>\u201cAlright, boys, that\u2019s a wrap!\u201d D.J. shouts to the group of guys bent over, gasping for air after the last timed run. \u201cMartinez and Johnson, you guys had the slowest times tonight so you\u2019re on kitchen duty. Get your asses inside and make me a pot pie!\u201d</p><p>The two men groan and everyone else starts a little good-natured ribbing as they all make their way inside.</p><p>When it\u2019s just the two of us left outside, D.J. turns to me, crossing his arms over his chest and staring me down. \u201cAlright, out with it. You never drink the night before a shift and you sure as hell never give up a chance to whip everyone\u2019s ass with your stellar ladder climbing skills. What\u2019s been going on with you this week? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve been hung-over every fucking day since last Monday.\u201d</p> <p>As we slowly make our way back inside the station, I take a deep breath before coming clean with him.</p><p>\u201cI slept with Finnley.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even bat an eye at my breaking news. \u201cJesus, it\u2019s about fucking time. Now that you\u2019ve gotten THAT out of your system, can you stop being a pussy and move on?\u201d</p><p>I want to be pissed at him for his attitude where Finnley\u2019s concerned, but I can\u2019t. He knows how much I\u2019ve thought about her over the years. It was basically his fault I broke up with her in the first place, a fact that I\u2019ve never let him forget.</p><p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re seniors. We\u2019re the kings of this fucking school. Why the hell do you still want to be tied down with a girlfriend? Especially one who isn\u2019t putting out?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never wanted to punch my best friend before, but he\u2019s seriously testing my patience right now. I should have just lied and told him we finally had sex after prom night. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t try to get laid, it was prom night for fuck\u2019s sake. Everyone gets laid on prom night. But Finnley still wasn\u2019t ready and I\u2019m not the kind of asshole who pushes his girlfriend to do something she\u2019s not ready for. Even though I\u2019ve been ready since the first time I saw her covered in gunpowder in her backyard when we were fifteen years old, I don\u2019t want her to think that\u2019s the only thing I want from her. I\u2019m perfectly fine with all the other stuff we do and I\u2019ll wait as long as she wants me to. I\u2019m just getting sick and tired of being questioned about it from my best friend.</p><p>As the night wore on and I consumed a seriously unhealthy amount of beer, the things D.J. continued to spout off about started to sound pretty damn good. It didn\u2019t help that Finnley wasn\u2019t at the party with me. She had plans with her girlfriends to go to a movie. If she was here right now and I could kiss her and touch her and be physically reminded about all the reasons why I\u2019m with her, I wouldn\u2019t be having all of these stupid thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much pussy you could be getting right now if you were single? Think about it, are you really going to go off to separate colleges and plan on this working out? I\u2019ve got news for you, that shit never works,\u201d D.J. tells me, tossing me another beer.</p> <p>Finnley and I only had one conversation about college and it didn\u2019t go very well. She wants me to go to the fire academy that\u2019s close to home and the art school she plans on attending and I want to get the fuck out of dodge. I\u2019ve been in this town all of my life and I want to see new things and go to different places. I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t just go with me, but she\u2019s adamant about staying close to her family.</p><p>\u201cI love her though, man,\u201d I slur drunkenly.</p><p>\u201cYou only think you love her. She was your first girlfriend. How the hell do you even know what love is? Stop being a pussy and go out and GET some pussy!\u201d D.J. cheers before chugging an entire beer.</p><p>Shit, he\u2019s totally right. I\u2019m seventeen years old. I care about Finnley, but am I really in love with her? Sure, we\u2019ve said the words to each other plenty of times. She\u2019s sweet, smart, funny and sexy as hell. What\u2019s not to love? Aside from D.J., she\u2019s one of my best friends. My family loves her and they\u2019ve pretty much already started planning our wedding. I suddenly feel slightly nauseous and I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s the cheap beer or the idea of marriage that has my guts churning.</p><p>I\u2019m not ready for that shit.</p><p>Two years is a long time to have a girlfriend in high school. It\u2019s almost unheard of. Why the hell shouldn\u2019t I be single and finish off my senior year with a bang?</p><p>\u201cFuck, how the hell do I even break up with someone? Do I just call her and tell her it\u2019s over?\u201d I ask, popping the top on my can of beer and downing half of it in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cNo, man. You can write her a note. I\u2019ll even hand deliver it at school tomorrow so you don\u2019t have to deal with that shit. HEY! Someone get me a fucking pen and a piece of paper!\u201d D.J. yells to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t get the choice about whether or not I should move on. Her husband came home when I was there last week,\u201d I tell D.J. as he holds the door open for me and we make our way to my office at the back of the first floor of the station.</p><p>D.J. whistles and shakes his head. \u201cDamn, dude. Is she still married? I thought you said she was separated?\u201d</p><p>When we get inside my office, I close the door behind us and take a seat at my desk while D.J. flops onto the folding chair in front of it.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she was separated. Hell, she fucking invited me over to her house for the sole purpose of having sex. I don\u2019t know if it was some kind of game to her or what. I don\u2019t have a fucking clue because she kicked me out.\u201d</p><p>D.J. winces. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right in front of that piece of shit Castillo. It was bad enough I walked in the room and he had his hands on her. I get him away from her, he calls her a bitch and a whore and I\u2019m still the bad guy,\u201d I complain angrily.</p><p>Shit. Even a week and a gallon of liquor later, I\u2019m still just as pissed as I was when it happened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had seventeen years with that guy. There\u2019s a history there that you can\u2019t erase even if you do have a bigger dick than that fucker,\u201d D.J. tells me with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, I get that. I didn\u2019t expect to just waltz back into her life and obliterate everything she\u2019s been through since I last saw her. Fuck, I didn\u2019t expect to walk back into her life, period,\u201d I tell him. \u201cEven though I hate everything that dick she\u2019s married to stands for, being with him made her who she is today and that\u2019s not something I want to fuck with.\u201d</p><p>I know it\u2019s asinine and everything I\u2019m thinking right now is crazy. We spent a few hours together for the first time in seventeen years and after a week without her I already felt like I was going insane.</p><p>A loud tone suddenly sounds through the station\u2019s alarm system. A few seconds later, the crackle of the speakers wired to every room of the house cuts off the tone and we listen to the voice of dispatch.</p><p>\u201c10-41, Code 1. Engine 10. 5182 Butternut Road. I repeat, 10-41, Code 1.\u201d</p><p>D.J. and I share an annoyed look when we hear the address.</p><p>\u201cSounds like old man Wilcox fell asleep in his barn again with a lit cigarette in his mouth and a bottle of homemade moonshine in his hand,\u201d D.J. laughs with a shake of his head as he gets up from his chair.</p><p>\u201cThat dumbass is going to burn the entire county down one of these days. That\u2019s the third call this month.\u201d</p><p>I start to get up from my chair when D.J. holds up his hand. \u201cSit your ass back down, I can handle this one. You\u2019ve got that meeting with the new fire chief in an hour to give him a tour of this place. You don\u2019t want to piss him off by not being here.\u201d</p><p>Staying seated, I watch as D.J. hustles out of the room and starts shouting orders to the rest of the men. A few minutes later, the rumble of the diesel engines along with their sirens fill my ears, fading in the distance as they head out to Wilcox Farms, where they\u2019ll most likely drag a drunk Mr. Wilcox out of his barn and put out the bale of hay he accidentally set on fire.</p><p>I try to keep my mind occupied with the pile of evaluation paperwork on my desk, but after ten minutes, I realize nothing is going to take my mind off of Finnley, especially since I\u2019m currently staring at a stack of phone messages with her name scrawled across the top. She\u2019s called the station at least ten times since last Monday and I\u2019ve refused her call each time. I\u2019ve never been a coward, but I can\u2019t stand the thought of calling her back and listening to her tell me what happened between us was a mistake.</p><p>Resting my elbows on top of my desk, I run my palms over my face and hold my head in my hands. I\u2019m sitting here like an asshole thinking about a woman who might be, at this very minute, doing everything in her power to make up with her husband and apologize for her affair.</p><p>Goddammit, I hate that word. Affair, fling, quick fuck... no matter how I twist the words, they all mean the same thing\u2014a moment in time where a lapse in judgment causes a lifetime of regret. No matter how angry I am that she dismissed me so easily, I will never regret it. I will never regret touching her body, making her come so hard she screamed or finally sating the need I\u2019ve always had for her.</p><p>Too bad all I did by screwing her was royally screw myself in the process. Once wasn\u2019t enough. Twice wasn\u2019t sufficient. Every day until I die wouldn\u2019t stop the burn. All I did by taking what I\u2019ve always wanted is light a match to the pile of kindling and make it explode. Now I\u2019m stuck here with nothing but memories to keep me warm while she lives the rest of her life with someone else. Spending the last seventeen years constantly thinking about her was bad enough. Having to go another seventeen now that I\u2019ve been inside her will be damn near impossible.</p><p>\u201cYo, Captain, there\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my head away from my hands, I see Martinez standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and take him upstairs to the weight room. Might as well start the tour with the new treadmills we just got in,\u201d I tell him, grabbing the phone messages and crumpling them into a ball.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weight room, Martinez,\u201d I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, just take him to the weight room!\u201d I argue, glaring at the rookie.</p><p>The poor guy runs from the room like his ass is on fire and I toss the crumpled phone messages into the trashcan next to my desk. I\u2019ll apologize to him later. Fuck, I\u2019ll have to apologize to the entire house for my short fuse the past week.</p><p>Pushing aside all thoughts of the woman who fucked up my life, I storm out of my office and make my way upstairs to the weight room. A tour of the house and a meeting about protocol is just the distraction I need right now.</p><p>Chapter 13\u2014Hearts on Fire</p><p>STARING AT MYSELF in the wall of mirrors in the dimly lit room, I nervously fuss with my long hair, smoothing the soft layers over my shoulders as I take in my outfit. I\u2019d paired a short black miniskirt with a form fitting grey cotton shirt, an ensemble that hugs my curves and highlights my best assets. It\u2019s what I have on underneath my clothes that has butterflies flapping around in my stomach, though. The lace at the tops of the black thigh-highs is just barely hidden under the hem of the skirt. If I sit down, cross my legs, bend over or shift more than an inch, the garters and lace will peek out and make themselves known. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try not to trip in my five inch black stilettos as I turn away from the mirror and slowly walk around the room, running my hand over the exercise equipment. The guy who let me in here couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off of my legs, so I can only hope it has the same affect on Collin. I need him unfocused and seething with lust so he\u2019ll give me a chance to talk before he throws me out on my ass. Considering he hasn\u2019t returned any of my calls this week, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to take everything in my limited arsenal of seduction to get him to listen to me right now.</p><p>My plan of attack didn\u2019t really make it beyond what I would wear when I showed up at the firehouse. Everything I want to say to him is a jumbled mess in my mind and I pray to God it doesn\u2019t get even more screwed up the minute I see him again.</p><p>I can\u2019t count the number of times Collin made me trip over my words when we were teenagers. He was the cutest guy in our school, incredibly sweet, smart and funny and I never fully wrapped my head around the fact that he chose me to be his girlfriend. Two years together didn\u2019t cure me of my nerves where he was concerned. Now, after having taken him inside my body and sharing something so shockingly intimate, those nerves feels a thousand times stronger. I want him to see me as something more than the teenage girl he once knew or the woman who fucked him within days of finding him again. I want him to know me and I want him to like the person that I\u2019ve become. I know I\u2019m completely contradicting myself by coming over here with the intention of seducing him to get what I want, but I don\u2019t have it in me right now to care. There\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do to make him understand.</p> <p>I\u2019m standing in front of a speaker that\u2019s roughly the size of a coffee table, wondering about boys and their need to blast music so loud the windows rattle as they work out, when I hear the door on the other side of the room squeak open. I look up at the mirror in front of me and, just like the other day, my eyes meet Collin\u2019s in the reflection. His eyes widen in surprise when he sees me and I catch a faint glimpse of appreciation in his eyes as they roam over my legs before it\u2019s hidden behind a mask of irritation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He stops short in the doorway, stubbornly refusing to come any closer, and his voice thunders across the room. I try not to cringe at the venom in it as I slowly turn around to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t returned any of my calls.\u201d</p><p>My voice comes out raspy and shaky and I silently will my nerves to go the fuck away as I clear my throat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we have nothing to say to each other. Feel free to let yourself out,\u201d he tells me as he turns to leave.</p><p>My determination begins to wilt under his quick dismissal. Maybe this wasn\u2019t meant to be. Maybe he\u2019s decided the baggage that comes along with me is more than he\u2019s willing to take on. Maybe...</p><p>No. To hell with maybe. I\u2019ve spent seventeen years building a life on fucking maybes.</p><p>As I stand there watching him walk away from me, I huff out the breath I\u2019m holding and remember who the hell I am. I\u2019m not this woman any more, this woman who sits in silence and lets life happen all around her. I\u2019ve spent years keeping my feelings inside and not standing up for myself. I\u2019m not about to take ten steps back when I finally feel like I\u2019m right where I\u2019m supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re just going to walk away like a coward?\u201d I shout to his retreating back.</p><p>I watch as his footsteps falter and the muscles in his shoulders tighten. I hit a nerve by calling him a coward and I know it. A man who races into burning buildings on a daily basis is anything but a coward. Even back in high school Collin was courageous and strong, always the first to fight for what he believed in, and the years apart haven\u2019t changed that. If anything, following his dreams and doing what he was always meant to do only amplified the characteristics he was born with. He\u2019s a proud man who knows exactly who he is. There is no way he\u2019s going to walk out that door without trying to prove me wrong.</p> <p>He slowly turns around and stares at me. \u201cYou\u2019re calling ME a coward? That\u2019s rich coming from you.\u201d</p><p>His voice is low but filled with enough heated anger to burn this place to the ground.</p><p>I take a deep breath and place my hands on my hips, standing tall and swallowing all my pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened last week. It was a complicated situation and I needed to handle it how I saw fit. I\u2019m sorry if that hurt you or you felt like I was pushing you away.\u201d</p><p>He laughs cynically and crosses his arms across his broad chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about me, sweetheart, OR what I\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it! I DON\u2019T know anything about you!\u201d I fire back. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do? Just take a chance on something when I have no idea what\u2019s going on in your head?\u201d</p><p>He takes a few steps in my direction and stops again. \u201cDon\u2019t make this out to be more than it is. You got what you wanted: the perfect payback for your loving husband. Now you can go back to living in your perfect little home with your perfect little life and you can push me out of your mind like you have for seventeen years.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t let his words upset me, mostly because I can see the hurt written all over his face. Collin wanted me to pick him. He wanted me to throw Jordan out and choose him. He has no idea how much I wanted to do just that\u2014or how much I regret allowing fear to hold me back.</p> <p>\u201cYou think my life was perfect?\u201d I argue. \u201cIt was a mess. From almost the very beginning, it was all a lie. I did think about you. I thought about you so much it made me question everything I thought was right. I didn\u2019t ask you to leave because I didn\u2019t want more time with you. Think about it. There\u2019s no way Jordan would have listened to anything I had to say with you standing right there, ready to beat his ass if he said something wrong. You have no idea how much I wanted you to stay, how much I wanted to drag you back to my bed and forget about the outside world.\u201d</p><p>Collin\u2019s arms drop to his sides and he stalks towards me, stopping when there are only a few feet separating us.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted me so fucking much, explain why it took you five days to come here, making me wonder if it meant absolutely nothing to you. I don\u2019t like feeling like a chump, Finnley.\u201d</p><p>I reach my hands out to him and he flinches, but I don\u2019t let that bother me. I keep moving until my hands are flat against his chest and I can feel his heart beating against my palms.</p><p>\u201cI left you ten messages,\u201d I remind him. \u201cI should have come to you sooner, I know that. I didn\u2019t stay away to torture you or to make you question what we shared. I did it to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Collin narrows his eyes and bites out, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of fucking Jordan Castillo.\u201d</p><p>I manage to tamp down my irritation over his macho bullshit. \u201cI wasn\u2019t insinuating you are. Besides, this has fuck all to do with Jordan. I was trying to protect you from me.\u201d</p><p>Collin stares at me, clearly confused, so I explain. \u201cThis is all new for me. I\u2019ve slept with one man my entire life. One. I needed to get my head on straight and make sure I didn\u2019t just do it to get back at Jordan. I needed to make sure that what I felt didn\u2019t go away as soon as I wasn\u2019t in the same room with you. You cloud my judgment, Collin. You make me feel alive for the first time in years and that scares the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and I can see the fight he\u2019s waging within himself slowly start to die away.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I needed to do something I never thought I would have to do. It took a little longer than I thought it would, but it was important to do it before I came to you.\u201d</p><p>He gives me that adorably befuddled look yet again and I move closer.</p><p>\u201cGod, this is so embarrassing,\u201d I mutter, looking away from him.</p><p>I see his hand move out of the corner of my eye and, seconds later, I feel his fingers on my chin. I don\u2019t resist when he turns my face back to his, his eyes imploring me to keep going.</p><p>I rush through the most important part of my explanation in one breath. \u201cJordan and I never used condoms. I was on the pill and obviously I never thought my husband would be a cheating sack of shit. He fucked around on me, Collin, and I had to get tested before I talked to you again. I needed to be sure that I hadn\u2019t done something to hurt you. I would never be able to live with myself if I knew I put you in harm\u2019s way without even knowing it. I\u2019m clean, by the way. Phina is a phlebotomist and she was able to put a rush on the blood draw. So, aside from a complete mistrust of men and a failed marriage, at least that asshole didn\u2019t leave anything else behind when I kicked his ass to the curb.\u201d</p><p>Collin is quiet for so long that I\u2019m a little afraid I freaked him out with my babble. I had to put everything on the table, though, because he deserves to know the truth. I don\u2019t want any lies between us. I\u2019ve dealt with that enough in my life.</p><p>\u201cAre you really done with him?\u201d Collin finally asks quietly, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been done with him for more years than I care to count. I\u2019ve spent my life doing what I thought was right instead of doing what I wanted. I don\u2019t want to live like that anymore,\u201d I tell him honestly.</p><p>He leans his body into mine without touching me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Finnley?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and lay it all on the line.</p><p>\u201cYou. I just want you, but it scares the hell out of me,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He moves forward until the toes of his boots are touching the toes of my heels. Bringing his arms up, he cups my face in his large hands and I feel like I can finally breathe again. One week without him and I missed his touch, I missed his closeness.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201d</p><p>I look up into his bright blue eyes and I wonder how it\u2019s possible to feel such a strong connection with someone in such a short amount of time. Years and distance separated us for so long, but right now, being close to him, feeling his hands on my skin, makes it feel like we were never apart\u2014that my marriage with Jordan was just a dream and Collin has always been my reality.</p><p>\u201cThis, all of this,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m scared by how much I need you even though I barely know you anymore. I spent seventeen years with someone I thought I knew and look how that turned out.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles and shakes his head at me. \u201cLee, you\u2019ve always known me. You\u2019re the only one who ever really has.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head right back at him and scoff. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Collin. I might have known everything about you back then, but it\u2019s all a mystery to me now. I know your mom was a manager of Hills Department Store, your favorite Nintendo game was Super Mario Brothers, you listened to \u2018Closer\u2019 by Nine Inch Nails on repeat in your piece of shit Ford Escort and you always ordered mint chocolate chip ice cream when we went to the Dairy Twist. We\u2019re thirty-three years old and the things I knew about you are still written in the diary I kept when I was fifteen, but they really don\u2019t do much for me at this point in time. We\u2019ve spent almost two decades apart and I have no idea who you are now.\u201d</p><p>Collin leans forward, resting his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cMy mom is retired from Hills and is happy to stay home and annoy my father on a daily basis, I prefer Grand Theft Auto over Super Mario Brothers because the graphics kick ass, I still order mint chocolate chip every time I go to the Dairy Twist, I still watch Full Metal Jacket at least once a month, I root for the Seattle Seahawks now because the Cowboys turned into a bunch of showboating assholes, I drive a red Chevy Tahoe for work and a black Ford F-250 for personal use, and D.J. is still my best friend, even though he was the one who convinced me to break up with you in a note. In thirty-three years of living, Lee, that\u2019s the only fucking thing I\u2019ve ever regret.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his face back and looks down at me. \u201cI\u2019m an open book, Lee. If you want to know something, all you have to do is ask. I know this is fast and everything about it is fucking insane, but everything about it also feels right. I have thought about you every single day for seventeen years. I don\u2019t know where this thing is going with us and I know you\u2019ve got some personal shit you\u2019re working through, but I\u2019m not going anywhere. I will never lie to you, Lee. If you trust anything that I\u2019ve said, please, just trust that.\u201d</p><p>He stands here staring at me, pleading with me to trust him and I know without a shadow of a doubt that I trusted him fully from the minute he said hello at Slammers.</p><p>\u201cI just have one more question,\u201d I tell him softly, my arms sliding around his waist and pulling him closer.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m an open book. Ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>Standing up on my toes, I brush my lips against his and speak softly against his mouth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about Nine Inch Nails. I never told you this, but I got a little turned on every time you played that CD. I still get hot when I hear it.\u201d</p><p>He smirks down at me, dropping his hands from my face and moving them to my hips. Pushing lightly, he walks us backwards until the backs of my legs bump into the huge speaker on the floor right behind me.</p><p>I grab onto his forearms as he eases me down until my ass is planted on top of the speaker, my skirt inching up as I sit, displaying the tops of my lace thigh highs.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, are you wearing garters?\u201d he asks with a growl in his voice.</p><p>I answer him by leaning back on my hands and spreading my legs, forcing the material of my skirt to ride a little higher and the black garters hooked to the lace against my thighs to peek out beneath it.</p><p>I watch his Adam\u2019s apple bob in his throat as he swallows thickly while he stares down at my legs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he tells me as he starts to back away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at him questioningly and he stops moving. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Nodding my head at him, I stay completely still as he turns away and walks over to the corner of the room. The room is dark but for a few small track lights in the ceiling, so he\u2019s almost swallowed by the shadows and I can barely make out what he\u2019s doing in the corner. When I hear the door close followed by the sound of the lock being turned, I decide I don\u2019t care what he\u2019s doing. The fact that he\u2019s locked the door means he doesn\u2019t want any interruptions and that can only be a good thing.</p><p>I hear a few clicks in the quiet room and a few seconds later, the silence is filled by the low sound of music coming from the speaker right beneath me.</p><p>He walks back towards me, coming out of the shadows until he\u2019s standing right in front of me with a black remote control in his hand.</p><p>Without a word, he sets the remote down on top of the speaker next to me.</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>The one word from his mouth is spoken softly, but with conviction and I have no choice but to comply.</p><p>Without getting up from the speaker, I slide the zipper on the side of my skirt down, lifting my hips just enough to push it past my thighs until it drops to my feet and I kick it aside. I maintain eye contact as I move my hands to the hem of my shirt and slowly slide it up my body and over my head, tossing it so it lands right on top of my discarded skirt.</p><p>I look at him questioningly and watch wordlessly as he pulls his own shirt off of his body and drops it by his feet. My throat closes up and my mouth waters when I take in that deep vee by his tapered hips and the tight muscles of his abs and chest. He lowers his body to the ground until he\u2019s on his knees in front of me, sliding one hand up the smooth, silky material of my thigh high until his palm is clutching my hip.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d he orders quietly.</p><p>I do as he asks, spreading my legs until he can inch his large body between my thighs, the bare skin of his stomach pressing against the black lace of the thong covering my sex that\u2019s already wet with need for him. Leaning back on my hands again, I push my lace-covered breasts out, silently willing him to put his mouth on them.</p><p>He leans forward and my thighs clench in anticipation of his warm, wet mouth on my nipples. I feel his breath skate over my skin but I don\u2019t feel his lips on me just yet. His other hand reaches for the remote he left sitting on top of the speaker and he brings it between us.</p><p>I look down and watch as his thumb presses one of the buttons. The speaker beneath me slowly rumbles to life and the soft, faint strings of music that surrounded us begin to grow louder and louder.</p><p>He presses another button and the familiar drumbeat to the opening bars of the song \u201cCloser\u201d begin to thump through the room.</p><p>With another quick press of his thumb, the bass on the speaker is turned up until I can feel the pounding pulse of the music vibrating through my body.</p><p>I remember listening to the words of this song back in high school and thinking they were so dirty and hardcore. I remember how Trent Reznor\u2019s voice shouting \u2018I want to fuck you like an animal\u2019 made me wish I wasn\u2019t so afraid and that one day I\u2019d be brave enough to allow Collin to do just that.</p><p>Seeing him kneeling between my thighs, the heat of his body burning against mine while the beat of the song thrums through my core, I realize my silly teenage fantasies completely paled to the reality.</p><p>The look in Collin\u2019s eyes as he continues to turn up the bass tells me that he is definitely going to fuck me like an animal right now.</p><p>And he\u2019ll make me love every dirty minute of it.</p><p>Chapter 14\u2014Just a Little Heat</p><p>I CAN FEEL the beat of the music vibrating through her body as I set the remote down and grab her hips, pulling her to the edge of the speaker.</p><p>Placing one soft kiss on her lips, I move to her cheek, then to her neck and down the front of her body, leaving a wet trail with my tongue as I go. I press my palms to the inside of her thighs and push them wide apart until she has to lean slightly forward to maintain her balance. Her pussy is now pressed against the hard plastic of the subwoofer and I can tell by one look at her face that she can feel the vibrations of the music thumping against her core. She bites down on her bottom lip as I clutch tightly to her thighs, rocking her slowly back and forth, her pussy bumping against the top of the speaker with each forced tilt of her hips. I tease her, giving her a touch of the vibrating bass before rocking her back away from it, over and over.</p> <p>Using the tip of my thumb, I pull the scrap of lace, wet from her arousal, away from her body until her bare sex is on full display. Keeping my hands wrapped tightly around the tops of her thighs, I continue rocking her back and forth, reaching over and gently rub her clit with the pad of my thumb.</p><p>I move my thumb in time with the beat of the music as I drag it up and down over her clit. I continue the rocking motion with my hands, pulling the lower half of her body forward and watching as her pussy brushes against the top of the speaker. I feel the muscles of her thighs tighten beneath my hands and watch her hips begin to sway as Finnley starts rocking her lower body, helping me move her. As the momentum of the song picks up, I can feel the tremor of the bass through my tight grip on her thighs and I can only imagine how that vibration feels against her bare pussy.</p><p>I start rocking her hips harder and moving my thumb faster. Her hands come up to my shoulders and she clutches them so tightly I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to leave little crescent marks behind from her nails digging into my skin.</p><p>Leaning forward, I press my lips against hers, not kissing her, just breathing her in as she pants with need against my mouth. I watch her pupils dilate and her eyes glaze over as I push her closer and closer to the release she needs. Even through the loud blaring of music, I hear her scream when her orgasm washes through her moments later. I keep my thumb on her clit and rub out every single drop of her release until she finally eases up on the hold she has of my shoulders.</p><p>I don\u2019t give her one second to recover. Using the palm of one hand, I press it against her sternum and push her backwards until she\u2019s lying flat on top of the speaker. Her head falls off the back of it and her hands smack down to the edge to hold herself steady as I stare down at the sight before me. Her skin is flushed from her release, her chest is heaving as she tries to breathe and the lips of her pussy are plump and wet, just begging for me to take them in my mouth. It\u2019s the most beautiful fucking thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Dragging my hand down her body until it covers her sex, I use the heel of my hand to press into her. She arches her back and spreads her legs wider for me.</p><p>I\u2019m a little sad that the music blaring through the speakers drowns out her soft moans of pleasure and the sound of my name on her lips when she comes, but I let it pass because all I can think about right now is burying my face between her legs and tasting her on my lips again.</p><p>I don\u2019t even hesitate. Still keeping her thong pulled to the side with my fingers, I dive forward and wrap my mouth around her clit, sucking her hard and letting my tongue swirl around the swollen bud.</p><p>The sweet, musky taste of her explodes on my tongue and I attack her pussy like a starving man, licking and sucking every bit of her. I push my tongue inside of her, swirling it around and coating it with her arousal before sliding two of my fingers away from their hold on her thong to rub circles around her clit. Over and over, I push inside of her body, fucking her with my tongue, while my fingers massage her until her entire body is shaking, on the edge of another release.</p><p>Flattening my tongue, I slide it through her slit and continue moving up until I can suck that little jewel filled with nerve endings back into my mouth. She moves her hips frantically, fucking my face while I flick my tongue back and forth until I can feel her pulsing against my lips. I look up the length of her body and see her lift her head just enough to watch what I\u2019m doing. With her eyes boring into mine, I move my face away from her pussy just long enough to let her watch me slide two of my fingers into my mouth. Her lips part with a silent gasp when I pull them out, wet with my saliva, before immediately plunging them inside her as deep as they\u2019ll go. Her head falls back again as the tips of my fingers curl against her g-spot and I lean back in, sucking her clit into my mouth and grazing it with my teeth. Her hips come off the speaker, and remain suspended in the air as she comes for a second time. I feel a rush of liquid seep from her body as her muscles clamp down on my fingers while I continue to lap at her. I know I\u2019m not going to be able to wait a second longer to feel her tight, wet pussy squeezing around my cock like that.</p><p>I pull my mouth away from her and quickly stand, unbuttoning my pants just enough to free my erection. She lifts her head and stares at my cock through hooded eyes, licking her lips. I\u2019ve waited almost half of my life to feel her mouth wrapped around my cock again, but right now, I want to be inside of that sweet pussy more. I take a minute to stroke myself while she watches, visions of bringing myself to release with my own hand and coming on her tits clouding my thoughts until I\u2019m so sensitive I need to stop before I do just that.</p><p>Pushing that little fantasy into the back of my mind for another time, I grab onto her hands, pulling her to her feet as I switch places with her. When I\u2019m seated, she quickly slides her thong off her body and, placing one knee on either side of my thighs on top of the speaker, she straddles me, rubbing her slit against my cock while the music of Trent Reznor plays on repeat around us. I reach between us, wrapping my hand around the base of my cock as she grabs onto my shoulders and positions her body. When her wet pussy makes contact with the tip, she slowly starts to move down on me, inch by sweet inch until the torture is too much to take.</p><p>I smack my hands down on the soft globes of her ass and bring her completely down on top of me, burying my cock in her pussy in one hard pull. Her arms fly around my shoulders, the nails of one hand scraping down the skin of my back as the other slides up into my hair, clenching it roughly in her fist.</p><p>She immediately starts to move, lifting herself up on her knees until my cock slides almost completely out before slamming herself back down on top of me. Her eyes never leave mine as she continues to ride my cock so hard I almost see stars. I keep my hands on her ass and help her move faster and harder, her body taking all of me of me inside of her in a pounding rhythm until I\u2019m so lost in the warmth of her pussy that I never want to leave.</p><p>She\u2019s so tight and hot wrapped around me that all I can think about is fucking her until we both die from exhaustion. Lifting my hips to thrust up into her, our thighs smack together so hard the speaker starts to shake not only from the music blasting out of it but from the frantic fucking that is currently happening on top of it. I\u2019m never going to be able to walk into this room again without seeing her on top of this thing. I\u2019m never going to be able to run a couple of miles on the treadmill without feeling her bouncing up and down on my cock.</p><p>I keep one hand on her ass and move the other up to her head, threading my fingers in her long hair and tugging on it hard enough that she tilts her head back so her neck is right in front of my mouth. I latch my lips against her throat and bite down gently, the salty taste of her sweaty skin sliding against my tongue as I continue to pull her up and down on my cock until I feel my balls start to swell with my release.</p><p>Her thighs tighten around mine and she hugs me as close to her body as possible while I continue to suck and nip at her throat. When I feel the noises she\u2019s making vibrating against my lips and the sudden gush of fluid from her pussy, there\u2019s nothing I can do to slow down my orgasm. With one last roll of my hips, I explode inside her body, feeling the walls of her pussy lock down on me like a vise as her own orgasm takes hold, feeding off of mine. She keeps sliding up and down my cock as she comes, her body milking me and prolonging my orgasm until I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to pass out from pleasure. My cock jerks and pulses inside of her until I can feel my come spilling out of her and dripping down between our thighs.</p><p>When my release finally subsides, I flop back on top of the speaker, bringing Finnley with me until she\u2019s sprawled across me, our chests rising and falling in the same hurried tempo as we come down from our high.</p><p>After a few minutes, she shifts her body and I feel her pussy clench around my cock one last time. I grab her hips and hold her in place, afraid if she moves again I\u2019m going to lose my mind. My dick should be softening, completely satisfied by now, but I\u2019m still hard. I can\u2019t seem to get enough of her and I\u2019m pretty sure if she moves her hips in the slightest way, I\u2019m going to flip her over and start pounding into her all over again. I\u2019d like nothing more than to do just that, but we need to talk. She said her piece, and now it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>She told me she was afraid\u2014and I can only pray that what I have to say won\u2019t scare her even more.</p><p>Chapter 15\u2014Line of Fire</p><p>EVERY SINGLE MUSCLE and bone in my body has turned to jelly. Somehow I find the energy to get up off of Collin\u2019s chest, leaning down to pick up my discarded clothing while he walks over to the corner of the room and turns off the stereo.</p><p>Collin\u2019s eyes follow my every movement as I step back into my panties and slide them up my legs, stopping when I see the look of undisguised misery on his face.</p><p>Immediately concerned that he\u2019s having second thoughts about what happened between us, I feel my eyes tear up as I ask, \u201cEverything ok?\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms across his chest, shaking his head as he growls out, \u201cFuck, no, everything is not ok. Baby, it\u2019s sacrilege to cover that body up.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at him. He just spent nearly an hour working me over, but I\u2019m suddenly ready to go again. I\u2019ve never felt this sexy or wanted in my entire life and it\u2019s a heady feeling.</p><p>I\u2019ve finish getting dressed and Collin has pulled his shirt back on and buttoned his pants when I hear the faint sound of men\u2019s voices on the other side of the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit. I have to get back to work. I\u2019ve got a meeting in a few minutes,\u201d he tells me, regret heavy in his voice as he walks over and wraps me in his arms.</p><p>Reaching up, I press my lips against his quickly before pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I need to get home and start purging my house of Jordan\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>A flash of anger clouds Collin\u2019s features at the mention of Jordan\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, he\u2019s not coming back. I told him I\u2019d pack up all of his things and drop them off at his mom\u2019s house,\u201d I reassure him.</p><p>He visibly relaxes as he tightens his hold on me. \u201cI have to work the next forty-eight straight hours and then I\u2019m off for a few days. I\u2019ll probably spend the first one catching up on sleep, but after that, you\u2019re mine. Can you stop by my place then? There are some things we need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>I try to mask the worry on my face when he says this. I was under the impression that we\u2019d already hashed everything out and that he understood how I felt. I assumed after what just happened in this room that he felt the same. Maybe I misread him and he isn\u2019t ready to jump right into a relationship with me right now. I feel stupid for having these doubts, but I can\u2019t help it. He said he thought about me every single day for seventeen years. That\u2019s got to mean something, right? I hold onto that thought and refuse to let my fear ruin what we\u2019re building once again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I tell him, keeping the smile on my face as I kiss him one last time.</p><p>He grabs my hand and pulls me behind him to the door, unlocking it and moving us out into the hall. As we make our way down the stairs to the bay of the station, we pass other firemen and Collin calls out greetings and quick questions about the call they must have just got back from.</p> <p>I watch his face immediately transform from possessive lover into commanding fire captain. He\u2019s serious and all business as he talks to his men, asking questions and giving praise when needed. It reminds me again of just how much he\u2019s accomplished since we were together. I\u2019m so proud of him for following his dreams and doing what he was so obviously meant to do. I can\u2019t help but feel a sharp pang of regret that I never followed through with my own dreams.</p><p>When we finally make it outside, I start to tell Collin how proud I am of him when a loud, piercing tone begins ringing through the bay before a voice announcing a fire emergency blasts through the speakers.</p><p>\u201cCap! We\u2019re going to need you on this one.\u201d</p><p>Collin nods his head in the direction of the man who took me up to the gym when I first got here, informing him to cancel his meeting before turning back to face me.</p><p>\u201cDuty calls,\u201d he tells me with a smile as the men who haven\u2019t even had a chance to change out of their protective gear from the last call rush past us into the bay, climbing onto the rig, the rumbling roar of the engine echoing around the room so loudly that I have to shout for Collin to hear me.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I yell with a quick kiss on his cheek. \u201cBe careful. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>His face lights up at my reassurance and I watch him turn and race over to a small closed-door room right off the bay. He races back out a few seconds later with all of his bunker gear tucked under one arm. Jumping easily up onto the side of the rig and holding onto the handle bar as the vehicle slowly pulls out of the bay, he tosses his gear into the open door of the jump seats before pulling himself inside as the truck disappears from sight.</p><p>Jesus, he\u2019s so damn hot.</p><p>Just that little taste of watching him in action is enough to get my blood pumping again. I never thought I was the type of woman to get turned on by a man in the public safety industry, but now I can\u2019t shake the image of him stalking towards me wearing nothing but his insulated pants, suspenders holding them up over his bare chest, completely covered in sweat and soot from a recent call. He would be like something right out of firemen\u2019s calendar come to life.</p><p>Pushing the thought from my mind, I make my way out of the bay and over to my car, determined to get out of there before I get so lost in my fantasies that Collin comes back to find me standing in the same spot he left me.</p><p>I try not to think about the things Collin wants to discuss with me as I pull my keys out of my purse and hit the unlock button on the key fob, so lost in my thoughts that I don\u2019t even notice I\u2019m not alone in the parking lot. I jump when a feel someone push against my back, reaching around me to slam the door I was pulling open.</p><p>Turning around, I come face to face with Jordan.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d I ask in shock.</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing, whore.\u201d</p> <p>His words slur and, smelling the alcohol on his breath, I scrunch my nose up in disgust and take a step back.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing inside for so long? Fucking the entire house or just giving it up to that asshole McDaniels?\u201d he continues.</p><p>My face heats with guilt and I immediately squelch it. He has no right to be jealous and I\u2019m not about to stand out here in the middle of the street and feed into his bullshit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business what I do or who I do it with. Get away from my car and stay the hell away from me,\u201d I fire back.</p><p>He\u2019s on me in a second, his body pressed up against mine, shoving me back against the side of my car roughly. His hand quickly comes up, cupping my chin and squeezing my cheeks so hard that it makes my eyes water.</p><p>\u201cYou are still my wife. People are already starting to talk. They\u2019ve seen you with McDaniels and they all know you\u2019re fucking him. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself and you\u2019re embarrassing me,\u201d he says angrily, his nose pressed up against mine.</p><p>Bringing my hands up to his chest, I shove as hard as I can. Considering he\u2019s drunk and can barely stand, it doesn\u2019t take much to get him off me He stumbles away and I quickly glance around, hoping someone from the station is nearby and sees what\u2019s happening. Unfortunately, the bay is empty and there isn\u2019t any sign of life in the windows of the house. Everyone must have gone on the call with Collin.</p><p>\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m going to tell you this. Stay the fuck away from me, Jordan, or I\u2019m calling the cops,\u201d I threaten, refusing to let him know just how much he\u2019s scaring me right now.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been afraid of my husband physically hurting me, but right now, with the anger radiating off of him and his blood filled with alcohol, there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019s capable of.</p><p>He smirks at me as I yank open my car door and quickly get inside, hitting the automatic lock as soon as I\u2019m behind the wheel. As I start up the engine and peel away from the curb, I can hear him shout after my car through the closed windows.</p><p>\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T KEEP ME AWAY, FINNLEY!\u201d</p><p>TWO DAYS LATER, I\u2019m still a jumble of nerves every time I walk out of the house to go to work. Collin has called a couple of times a day to check on me and just the sound of his voice through the line calms me down. When he isn\u2019t out on a call, I curl up in bed with the phone propped against my ear, listening to his soft, baritone voice tell me stories about the crazy things D.J. did when they were at the fire academy and what his family has been up to since I last saw them. In turn, he listens to me ramble about my friendship with Phina, silly things we did in college and what my own family has been doing with themselves.</p><p>In the quiet of the night when he\u2019s lying in his own bunk at the station waiting for the next call to come in, he asks me about my marriage to Jordan and I tell him everything\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly. I tell him about how hard I tried to make it work, forgiving him over and over for the addictions he allowed to rule both of our lives and I admit to him that I don\u2019t even know how long ago I fell out of love with him. He listens to it all and he never judges me for the choice I made to try and stick it out for as long as possible before finally reaching my breaking point. He tells me I\u2019m amazing and that he wishes things could have been different.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how many times I wished for the same thing. I never realized it until now, but everything happens for a reason. Maybe Collin came into my life at this point in time because I was finally ready for him. If I would have run into him again years ago, we probably would have just said a polite hello and continued to go our separate ways.</p><p>He\u2019s so sweet and understanding as I explain everything to him, I just can\u2019t bring myself to tell him about what Jordan has been doing. I don\u2019t want to worry him and I certainly don\u2019t want him getting into trouble by taking matters into his own hands. Collin is the type of man who would never stand idly by and let Jordan treat me this way.</p><p>For the past two days, I\u2019ve seen Jordan\u2019s car parked outside of the house more than once. I\u2019ve seen it drive by my work when I\u2019m walking out to the parking lot and I know I\u2019ve seen it in my rearview mirror on my way home or on trips to the grocery store.</p><p>When the text messages started coming several times a day, each one telling me what a whore I am or how I\u2019m going to pay for the mistakes I\u2019ve made, I printed all of them out and put them in a file. When he sends a grainy picture of Collin and I pressed up against each other by the tree outside my office the day of the electrical fire with a particularly nasty message, I have the proof I need that he\u2019s been stalking me. I take everything to the courthouse and file for a restraining order, making sure to install new locks on the house as soon as I got home.</p><p>I know this will all blow over eventually and there\u2019s no point freaking Collin out about something that really has nothing to do with him. I decided to leave Jordan before we ever saw each other again and I don\u2019t want to drag him into this mess any more than I already have. If he wasn\u2019t in my life, I\u2019d have to handle it on my own anyway. I\u2019m a big girl and I can take care of my own problems. I know Jordan\u2019s irrational behavior is due to whatever addiction that currently has him in its clutches and, even though I don\u2019t care about what he does with his own life, I don\u2019t want him hurting anyone around him.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to his parents since right after we separated. Every time his mother called me, she reminded me about the vows I took to stand by his side through the good times and bad. She told me that a wife needs to support her husband and that pushing him away was only making things worse. I stopped answering her calls after that. It was too hard not to scream at her and ask her about the vows HE took. Even though I don\u2019t want anything to do with his family and their double standards, I did the right thing and called his mom to tell her about his behavior and the measures I was forced to take for my own safety. I was more than a little shocked to hear that Jordan only spent one week at their house before he moved out. They haven\u2019t seen or heard from him since.</p><p>I push any concern I might have for him out of my mind when I get a phone call from the court telling me the judge had a cancellation and will see me first thing in the morning. It\u2019s silly, but I know having that little slip of paper on file stating that Jordan won\u2019t be able to come within a hundred yards of me will make me feel safer.</p><p>Hopefully he\u2019ll finally get the message and he can get the help he needs so he can move forward with his own life.</p><p>Chapter 16\u2014Hot</p><p>IT TOOK EVERYTHING in me not to drive straight to Finnley\u2019s house when I left the station, but I know if I don\u2019t get some sleep, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to function. After a quick shower, I toss on a pair of boxer briefs, flop down on top of the covers in bed and dial Finnley\u2019s number.</p><p>She answers on the second ring. \u201cHow was work?\u201d</p><p>Her voice is filled with the rasp of sleep and I feel bad that I woke her up.</p><p>\u201cIt was exhausting. I\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I was dreaming about you anyway and hearing your voice is much better.\u201d</p><p>I can hear her smile and the rustle of covers through the line and my dick starts to harden just thinking about her body all warm and soft under the blankets.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re naked while you were thinking about me,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, but that can easily be arranged,\u201d she replies with a soft laugh.</p><p>My mind fills with all sorts of naughty ideas and the exhaustion of the last forty-eight hours of work quickly leaves my body.</p><p>We\u2019ve talked a lot over the last few days. We touched on important things like her shitty marriage and why she never had children, my failed relationships and our families. I have loved every second of getting to know her again, but I want to know more. She slept with one man for most of her life and I find it hard to believe he was able to fulfill all of her fantasies. From the brief conversation we had about our past sex lives, I know there are a lot of things she\u2019s never experienced. I want to know what she dreams about, I want to know what turns her on and I want to make every single one of those things come true. I\u2019ve had a pretty adventurous sex life. I\u2019ve dabbled in bondage and even experienced threesomes. Fucking two women at the same time would probably fulfill most guy\u2019s deepest, darkest desire, but nothing turns me on more than the thought of finding out what makes Finnley burn. I could tell by the excitement on her face when my palm connected with her ass that it turned her on and she wanted more, but was afraid to ask for it. I don\u2019t want her to ever be afraid to tell me what she wants.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re wearing underwear, take them off,\u201d I demand softly into the phone.</p><p>I hear her breath catch, but the rustling of fabric through the line tells me she\u2019s following my orders.</p><p>\u201cNow, put the phone on speaker and set it down on the pillow next to you,\u201d I continue.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say a word. While she situates the phone, I reach down under the covers and palm my cock.</p><p>\u201cAre we seriously going to have phone sex right now?\u201d she asks with a shaky voice before laughing softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I was there with you right now, what would you want me to do to you, Finnley?\u201d I ask quietly, cutting off her laugh.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she replies quickly.</p><p>I smile to myself and realize I\u2019m going to have to work a little harder to pull the information I want out of her.</p> <p>\u201cWould you want me to fuck you with my fingers?\u201d</p><p>She moans and my cock jerks against my palm.</p><p>\u201cYes. I want your fingers inside me, Collin.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her sighing my name has me pushing my hand inside my boxer briefs and wrapping it around my cock.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself, Finnley. You\u2019re wet, aren\u2019t you? So fucking hot and wet I bet your fingers are just slipping through your pussy,\u201d I moan as I slide my hand up and down my cock slowly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispers through the line.</p><p>I close my eyes and picture her delicate fingers circling her clit and then pushing inside of her body.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you have no idea the things I want to do to you,\u201d I mutter as I grip my cock harder and move my hand faster.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she murmurs through the line.</p><p>\u201cI want your fingers inside of you first. Close your eyes and push them inside your pussy and imagine it\u2019s my cock filling you.\u201d</p><p>She whimpers and I immediately know she\u2019s done as I ask.</p> <p>\u201cI want to tie you to the bed and fuck you so hard you scream my name,\u201d I tell her through a groan as I squeeze the tip of my cock.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathes through a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI can picture you with your arms above your head and your back arched, trying to pull free from the bindings as I slam my cock into you.\u201d</p><p>She whimpers again and I move my fist faster up and down my cock as I listen to her touch herself.</p><p>\u201cI want it all, baby. If I were there with you right now I\u2019d flip you over and fuck you from behind. I\u2019d drag my fingers through your pussy and get them nice and wet, then I\u2019d slowly push them in your ass while I fucked you.\u201d</p><p>I can tell my gut instinct about her wanting to push the boundaries of sex are spot on when she hears the words I\u2019ve spoken.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she breathes with a hitch of excitement in her throat.</p><p>My hand moves faster on my cock as I think about taking her in every way possible. I think about how tight she\u2019d be around my cock if I inched myself inside her ass.</p> <p>\u201cWould you let me take you like that, Lee? Would you let me fuck your ass with my cock instead of my fingers?\u201d</p><p>She lets out a low, throaty moan and my excitement builds when I know she\u2019s on board and just as turned on as I am.</p><p>\u201cYes, Collin. Fuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>My balls tighten with the need to come when I hear the conviction in her voice.</p><p>\u201cRub your clit, baby. Bring those wet fingers up and circle them around you,\u201d I demand.</p><p>My hips move in time with the jerk of my hand on my cock as I think about her lying in bed with her eyes closed, legs spread wide while her fingers slip through her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your pussy with my fingers while I take your ass. I\u2019m going to feel you come against my hand as I push into you, baby.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her panting and gasping for breath as she fingers herself is the hottest thing I\u2019ve ever heard and I couldn\u2019t stop my orgasm now if I tried. Every single thought in my head is filled with Finnley and the things I want to do to her.</p><p>\u201cFuck! I\u2019m gonna come, Lee. I need you to come with me,\u201d I groan, my hands gripping my cock so tight I\u2019m afraid I might rip it right off my body.</p><p>I can hear the wet sounds of her fingers thrusting into her pussy and when she shouts a moment later, my orgasm explodes out of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming! Oh fuck, Collin, I\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><p>My dick pulses and twitches in my hand and come shoots out in thick streams against my stomach as I moan Finnley\u2019s name through my release.</p><p>A few minutes later, with the phone still tightly clutched against my ear in one hand, my other hand slides out of my boxers, reaching over to the nightstand to grab a tissue and clean myself up.</p><p>\u201cI think I just died,\u201d Finnley mumbles a few seconds later.</p><p>I laugh into the line. \u201cWell, rest up. When I see you tomorrow, you\u2019re going to need your strength.\u201d</p><p>I end the call after rattling off my address and fall asleep thinking about the surprise I have in store for her when I see her again.</p><p>I want to make all of her fantasies come true.</p><p>First, I need to remind her of her dreams.</p><p>Chapter 17\u2014Explosions</p><p>\u201cSTOP BEING DIFFICULT and just keep your eyes closed,\u201d Collin laughs in my ear as he holds his hands over my eyes, walking behind me as he guides me through his house.</p><p>I wanted a tour of his four-bedroom ranch, but he covered my eyes as soon as he opened the door to me, telling me only that he had a surprise.</p><p>After what happened on the phone last night, I fully expected to be overcome with mortification the minute I laid eyes on Collin. I\u2019m willing to admit that I\u2019ve thought about anal sex many times over the years. Jordan even broached the topic once, trying to convince me to spice up our sex life. The thing is, there\u2019s an incredible amount of trust involved in the act, and I never trusted my husband enough to guide us through it. If how fast I came and how loudly I moaned last night at the very mention of him taking my ass are any indication, I have no such misgivings about Collin. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve been able to think about since the moment he smiled down at me at the front door.</p><p>I hear the swoosh of a sliding glass door and I feel the grass beneath my feet as he leads me into what must be his back yard.</p><p>He comes to a stop, turning me around as he removes his hands from my eyes. When I start to open them, he quickly scolds me.</p><p>\u201cNope, keep them closed.\u201d</p><p>I huff and cross my arms in front of me. \u201cI hate surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve mentioned that three times already. Stop being a brat,\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>I hear him rustling around with something and the slide of what sounds like plastic against concrete.</p><p>\u201cOkay, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I blink them open and see him squatting down on his patio next to a large, blue plastic tote.</p><p>Looking between him and the tote in confusion, he jerks his chin towards the covered box. \u201cGo ahead. Open it.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I bend down and lift the lid. When I see what\u2019s inside, my hands start to shake and my heart thumps erratically inside my chest.</p><p>This can\u2019t be what I think it is.</p><p>Swallowing thickly, I slowly reach my hand into the tote and wrap it around a folded piece of Japanese hemp paper and pull it out, holding my breath as I unfold the poster-size piece of paper and lift it up in front of me. My eyes fill with tears as I look at the gunpowder design I created the day Collin and I met in my parent\u2019s backyard. It\u2019s one that I had been working on for weeks and it had never come out right until that very moment. I gaze at my rendition of a Japanese pagoda in a garden, completely caught up in the past.</p><p>Shaking off my memories without a word, I set the paper down on the concrete and begin pulling out page after page of hemp paper filled with every single design I created over the two years Collin and I were together. They are the exact same ones he wallpapered his old bedroom with, the ones I always assumed he trashed after he broke up with me. I never thought I\u2019d see them again or feel this incredible sense of longing until right this moment. My fingers itch with the need to play in a pile of black powder and my heart swells with the notion that Collin kept my work for all these years.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you kept these,\u201d I whisper as a tear rolls down my cheek when I get to the bottom of the tote and pull out the one that I was most proud of. It was a silhouette of Collin standing in front of the town fire station like he\u2019d done so many times when we were together.</p><p>\u201cOf course I kept them,\u201d he says, standing up in front of me. \u201cThey\u2019re brilliant and I always expected to see ones just like them hanging in a gallery one day.\u201d</p><p>I swallow down the embarrassment I feel over never mustering the strength to follow through with my dreams like he did. When we broke up, it was just easier to push them aside. Every time I looked at the pile of hemp paper and the bucket of gunpowder my parents stored in their garage for me, it reminded me of him and I could never bring myself to create another one. A few years after Jordan and I got married, my parents brought over a truckload of my old things when they cleaned out their garage. When Jordan asked about my art supplies and I tried to explain to him how it all worked, his eyes glazed over in boredom. A week later, he had thrown everything away because it was taking up too much space in our garage.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it, Lee? Why didn\u2019t you go to art school and pursue this?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s asked me a few times about my art during the phone conversations we\u2019ve had, but I always changed the subject. I wasn\u2019t ready to look that deeply inside of myself and tell him how much of a coward I was back then. I also didn\u2019t want him to feel bad that he was one of the reasons I let that dream fade away.</p><p>\u201cBecause some jerk broke my heart when I was seventeen,\u201d I joke.</p><p>Collin stands up and takes the last piece of paper out of my hands and lets it flutter back down inside the tote. \u201cThat guy was a total asshole and had no idea what he was letting go. But that shouldn\u2019t have had any bearing on your dreams.\u201d</p><p>He rests his hands on my hips and I place my palms against his chest. \u201cWell, it kind of did. You were my fire, Collin. I lost the desire to play with it when you left.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes and sighs and I can tell he\u2019s going to start blaming himself. He needs to know that there were so many other factors that contributed to my not pursing a career in art.</p><p>\u201cI took a few art classes in college and quickly realized that my unusual skill would never pay the bills as an adult. When I took an internship at a marketing firm, I really enjoyed the work. Not as much as art, but enough. I switched majors and when I graduated, I was offered a good job with the firm in town as a marketing manager. Jordan and I were already living together by then and the bills were starting to pile up. It was good money and I couldn\u2019t turn that down regardless of the fact that I knew I wanted to be doing something else.\u201d</p><p>Collin shakes his head sadly. \u201cYou were so talented, Finnley. Didn\u2019t Jordan see that? Didn\u2019t he encourage you to do what you\u2019d always dreamed of doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to talk to him about it a few times, but he wasn\u2019t really interested in my work. He was too busy trying to become an artist himself. He always told me that he wanted one of us to have steady employment and when he was established in his own tattoo shop, it would be my turn. Since his dream never came true, he probably thought mine shouldn\u2019t either. Now that I look back on it, I think he was jealous. He\u2019d heard my parents mention how talented I was several times and I don\u2019t think he wanted to compete with me.\u201d</p><p>Collin pulls me into his body and wraps his arms around my waist, holding me tight.</p><p>\u201cI would have sacrificed everything to make your dreams come true, Lee,\u201d he tells me softly.</p><p>Another tear slides down my cheek as I rest my head against his chest, so overcome with emotion that I can\u2019t find the words to tell him how much it all means to me.</p><p>With one last tight squeeze, Collin steps back and smiles down at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, but I have one other surprise. Although, after what you just told me, you might not like it very much.\u201d</p><p>Before I can tell him that I don\u2019t need anything else from him, he grasps my shoulders and turns me around to face the backyard.</p><p>When I see the set-up at the back of his property line, my hand flies to my mouth and I let out a gasp.</p><p>There in the grass is a large sheet of blank hemp paper, held down by rocks at each corner and a few scattered through the middle. Next to the paper is the largest bucket of gunpowder I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWatching you work on one of your designs was always the most amazing thing to witness,\u201d he speaks softly behind me. \u201cYou\u2019d get this fierce look of concentration on your face and everything else around you would disappear. Considering my current profession and the way I was so obsessed with fire back then, you would think lighting the fuse and watching the explosion would have been the best part. You had so much talent, Finnley. It should never, ever have been stifled.\u201d</p><p>I look back over my shoulder at him and he uses his thumb to wipe away my tears. \u201cWill you make something for me? I want a new Finnley Morgan original to hang in my living room.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at him and turn back around to face him. \u201cWhat am I going to do with you, Collin McDaniels? You make me want things I haven\u2019t thought about in years. You make me dream things I never thought possible.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and uses the tips of his fingers to brush my bangs out of my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to live your dreams. You just have to want them enough to make them come true.\u201d</p><p>Collin takes my hand and pulls me to the edge of his yard, lifting the top off of the gunpowder and sliding the bucket closer to me before silently moving away to give me time to myself. I can feel him watching me from the other side of the yard as an image immediately takes hold in my mind and I can picture exactly what I need to do to make it come to life.</p><p>Slipping off my shoes, I sink down into the soft grass and dip my hand into the bucket, letting the soft black powder coat my hands and slide through my fingers. Dipping my fingers back inside, I bring out a handful of powder and begin sprinkling it all over the paper, working quickly as I allow the image in my mind to take shape. Art must truly be instinctual, as I feel every single trick I used seventeen years ago come back to me while I run my palms and my fingers through the black powder on the paper so fast that my hands are a blur of movement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have no idea how much time has lapsed and I\u2019m too caught up in my vision to care. I move the powder around until the design is exactly how I pictured it in my mind. When I finally finish, I stand up to admire my work, wiping a bead of sweat off my brow with the back of my wrist, careful not to get black powder all over my face.</p><p>I\u2019m almost overcome with excitement and pride as I look down at the paper. I sense Collin\u2019s presence and a spark of desire shoots through me when I feel the heat of his body. Collin being directly responsible for the release of the creative juices I\u2019ve kept bottled up for so long is almost enough to make me want to forget about finishing the project and just take him inside the house and strip hip naked.</p><p>He hands me a towel and I slowly wipe as much of the powder off of my hands as I can.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks as he holds a lighter up in front of him.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s more excited about this than I am and I can\u2019t help but smile at his exuberance. I think he might have been lying before when he said watching me work was the best part. He\u2019s like a toddler right now, bouncing back and forth on his feet waiting for me to give him the okay.</p><p>I nod my head and laugh at him. \u201cYep. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>With remnants of gunpowder still clinging to my hands and splattered across my clothes, I know I need to move as far back as possible. I walk back to the safety of the patio and watch as Collin sets up the fuse that attaches to the paper and gunpowder, holding my breath as he flicks the lighter. When the fuse ignites, he runs across the yard until he\u2019s by my side, grabbing my hand and pulling it up to his chest. He holds my hand in both of his right against his heart as we listen to the ssssssssss of the flame as it flows down the five-foot length of fuse. We both stare with wide, excited eyes as the spark gets closer and closer to the paper until the hissing suddenly stops as the fuse gathers enough energy to ignite all of the gunpowder. Two heartbeats later, a loud pop fills the air and the paper bursts into flames. Within seconds, the fire burns out and all that\u2019s left behind is a cloud of smoke and puffs of powder.</p><p>Our heads turn towards each other and I can\u2019t stop the excited grin that lights up my face when I see the same look mirrored in Collin. We take off running, his hand still clutching mine as we race across the yard laughing at how silly we\u2019re both acting.</p><p>We stop in front of the hemp paper and wait until the smoke clears. Collin doesn\u2019t say a word as he stares down at the burnt design, each piece revealing itself slowly as the smoke floats away. I start to get a little nervous that maybe it\u2019s not as good as I thought since I\u2019m so out of practice. He lets go of my hand and bends down closer to the paper, his eyes taking in every detail as I watch him.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Finnley,\u201d he whispers after a few seconds.</p><p>I finally turn away from him and look down at my creation. It\u2019s another silhouette of him, this time wearing a fireman\u2019s hat with a rolled up hose slung over one arm and a wall of fire surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cThis is absolutely fucking amazing,\u201d he mutters in awe.</p><p>Pride rushes through me with his words and my long dormant dream of doing something with my talent becomes forefront in my mind. Staring down at Collin admiring my work, I\u2019m amazed that that it\u2019s even possible to be this happy after everything I\u2019ve been through with Jordan.</p><p>Chapter 18\u2014She Keeps Me Warm</p><p>IT\u2019S STILL HARD to believe Finnley and I only found our way back to one another fifteen days ago. I\u2019ve spent fifteen days learning everything about her all over again and fifteen days discovering every inch of her body. We\u2019ve talked, we\u2019ve laughed, we\u2019ve fucked on every available surface in both of our houses and we\u2019ve only stopped long enough to order take-out before going at it again. I\u2019ve set up countless sheets of hemp paper in my backyard and sat in a chair by the house, quietly watching her work whenever inspiration hit her. It\u2019s amazing to see the passion for her art shining in her eyes with each and every new picture she creates. It\u2019s my damn house, so I\u2019m not limited to wallpapering my bedroom with Finley Morgan originals this time around. I\u2019ve hung each one of her designs on the walls in my home, much to her embarrassment. I want her to be proud of her talent and I want her to see how much pride I have in her every time she walks through my door.</p><p>I know that rediscovering her ability has lit a fire inside of her to go to art school like she always wanted to. As much as I want to tell her to quit her job and do what she wants, I know I can\u2019t do that. This is her dream and I want her to find her own strength to make it a reality.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m so full I think you\u2019re going to have to roll me into the house,\u201d Finnley jokes as I pull my truck into my driveway.</p><p>I wanted nothing more than to keep her naked and tucked away in my bed forever, but I thought it was time I took her out for a real meal. I surprised her by taking her to the Italian restaurant where we had our first date. It was kind of nice not having to bum a ride from an older friend this time since neither one of us had our driver\u2019s licenses back then.</p><p>I make my way around the front of the truck and open her door, holding her hand as she steps down from the cab. My dick has been hard since I picked her up at her house earlier and she opened the door wearing a red, wrap-around dress that hugged her curves.</p><p>Her matching red heels click against the pavement as she jumps down and the vee in the front of her dress gapes open, showing off even more of the creamy skin that I\u2019ve been staring at all night across the candlelit table.</p><p>I move our clasped hands behind her back and rest them right above her ass as I trail the fingers of my free hand down her collarbone and over the exposed skin of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI need to be inside you,\u201d I tell her softly, staring into her eyes as I move my hand lower until I\u2019m cupping one breast in my palm.</p> <p>I run my thumb back and forth over her nipple through the material of her dress, lightly pinching it after it pebbles</p><p>\u201cHow fast can you unlock that door and take your clothes off?\u201d she whispers as I kiss my way across her cheek until my lips are right by her ear.</p><p>\u201cAbout as fast as I can make you come. What\u2019s the record now, thirty-five seconds?\u201d I tease.</p><p>She laughs, swatting my hand away from her breast. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you have it in you to make it twenty.\u201d</p><p>AN HOUR LATER, I\u2019ve got her right on the edge of her third orgasm. She\u2019s sprawled across my bed, her body glistening with sweat. I\u2019m on my stomach between her thighs, pressing my dick into the mattress in an attempt to calm myself down. In my line of work, patience and control are critical, and it\u2019s taken every vestige I have of both not to drag her down the bed and fuck her so hard we both pass out, but I have something else in mind. I\u2019ve been thinking about our phone sex conversation a week ago and I want her as ready and pliant as she can be.</p><p>Pulling my fingers out of her, I slide them into my mouth and clean her wetness off them with my tongue. She\u2019s up on her elbows watching me, her hips lifting slightly in an unconscious request for more. Moving out from between her thighs, I slide up the length of her body, rolling her onto her side so I can curl myself behind her. I pull her hair away from the back of her neck and nip at the skin there while I reach back and grab the bottle of lube I bought the day before.</p><p>Placing it on the bed behind me, I slide my hand over the front of her thigh, grabbing her leg and pulling it back over my hip so she\u2019s open to me. Her head is resting on her arm and I scoot closer, lifting myself up on my elbow so I can stare down at her body.</p><p>I slowly slide my hand up the inside of her thigh and ghost my fingers through her folds, pulling the wetness pooling there up with me to circle it around her clit. She\u2019s so wet that I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ll need the lube for what I have in mind, but I\u2019m still going to use it. I want this to be as pleasurable as possible for her.</p><p>Her hips shift back and she grinds her ass against my cock as it slips between her cheeks. I move myself against her, sliding my cock through her as my fingers continue playing with her clit.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck you here, baby,\u201d I whisper in her ear, emphasizing what I mean by thrusting hard against her ass.</p><p>My fingers easily slide through her pussy as she gets even wetter at my words.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes,\u201d she mumbles, her hips moving against my fingers as I push two of them deep inside of her, my thumb flicking over her clit.</p><p>I pump my fingers in and out of her, moving my thumb faster until she\u2019s gasping and moaning with need.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m going to come. Oh, my God,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I quickly pull my fingers out of her and move my thumb away from her clit, smiling to myself when I hear her whimper.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby. You\u2019re not coming again until my cock is inside your ass.\u201d</p><p>She groans and I move my hand back between her legs, just barely skimming my fingers over her clit. She\u2019s so swollen and wet that I know just the right amount of pressure will have her exploding against my fingers, but I want to prolong this. I want her shaking with need and ready to take every inch of me inside her.</p><p>Her hand moves over top of mine and she tries to add pressure to my fingers as I slide them around and around her clit. I remove my fingers from her slit, grabbing her hand and bringing it up to rest on her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou can play with your nipples, baby, but this,\u201d I tell her as I cup her sex in my hand, \u201cis mine. Even when I\u2019m taking your ass, Lee, it\u2019ll still be my fingers fucking your pussy. You don\u2019t get to touch.\u201d</p><p>I hear her sharp intake of breath as my fingers resume the light, teasing circles around her clit and I watch in rapt fascination as she lightly tugs at her nipples. When her hips start moving faster and I know she\u2019s seconds away from coming, I quickly move my hand down and thrust three fingers inside of her, holding them as deep as they\u2019ll go as I feel her pulse around me and her orgasm slowly ebbs back down to a simmer.</p><p>Her thigh quivers around my hip and, as much as I want to continue torturing her, I can\u2019t hold off any longer. I need to be inside of her. I need her to give me that last bit of trust so I can show her I would never hurt her, that everything I do is to bring her pleasure.</p><p>Pulling my fingers out of her, I reach behind me and grab the bottle of lube. As I move my cock away from her ass, I flip the lid on the tube and squirt a generous amount of the silky gel up and down my length. Tossing the tube to the side, I, spread the lube over my cock until it\u2019s glistening.</p><p>\u201cGet up on your knees.\u201d</p><p>I palm my cock, stroking it as I watch Finnley roll to her stomach and push herself up on her hands and knees, her ass in the air waiting and ready for me. Getting up behind her, I grab the bottle of lube again and squeeze, letting it slide down the crack of her ass. Using the fingers of my left hand, I rub the slippery wetness around, pushing my fingers gently inside of her to spread the lube there, as well.</p><p>She shivers with a combination of excitement and shock at the cold feel of the lube sliding down her body and my fingers pushing inside her ass. I continue slowly pumping them in and out of her, readying her for my cock. When she starts pushing back against my fingers, I know it\u2019s time. Sliding them out of her, I grab onto her hips and pull her towards me until the tip of my cock rubs against the spot my fingers just vacated.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she mutters, dropping her head down between her shoulders.</p><p>I wrap my hand around the base of my cock, holding myself still as I push just the head inside of her. As much as I want to slide the rest of the way in with one hard thrust, I know I need to make sure she\u2019s ready.</p><p>I move my right hand away from her hip and slide it around the front of her body, between her legs, finding her clit and working it between my fingers.</p><p>Her hips start moving against my hand and I grit my teeth as the head of my cock moves in and out of her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou are way too big for this to work,\u201d she mumbles through groans as my fingers continue to slide around and around her clit.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d I whisper, sliding barely another centimeter inside of her as I move my fingers faster between her legs.</p><p>\u201cYes, I trust you,\u201d she moans immediately as I slide in a little further.</p><p>\u201cThis will work, I promise. If it doesn\u2019t, you tell me right away and I\u2019ll stop. If it doesn\u2019t feel good, promise me you\u2019ll tell me to stop, Lee.\u201d</p><p>I silently beg her not to tell me to stop. Her ass is already gripping the hell out of the tip of my cock and I\u2019m dying to push myself the rest of the way inside her.</p><p>\u201cI promise. I trust you. Fuck, keep going,\u201d she begs, pushing back against me until I slip deeper inside.</p><p>Sweat breaks out all over my body with the effort it takes to hold myself still behind her and not pound into her ass. She\u2019s so tight and hot and, with every rock of her hips against my fingers, she brings me deeper inside her all on her own.</p><p>\u201cFuck-shit-oh, my God,\u201d she whimpers incoherently as I add pressure with my fingers against her clit.</p><p>As slowly as I can, I push myself a little further inside her ass, stopping when I feel her relax around my cock as her orgasm quickly bubbles back to the surface.</p><p>Wrapping my arm around her waist, I hold her tightly to me and slowly rock against her without going deeper. I want to pull my cock completely out and slam fully inside her, but I won\u2019t do that her first time. I\u2019m perfectly content letting her dictate how little or how much she can take this time.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lee. You feel so fucking perfect,\u201d I groan as she pushes back against me.</p><p>Her ass grips me like a fist and I know I\u2019m not going to be able to last much longer.</p><p>\u201cKeep going. Fuck, keep going,\u201d she begs loudly.</p><p>I hold my breath and squeeze my eyes closed as I slowly push forward until my hips are pressed tightly against her ass. I hear her panting and whimpering as I hold myself still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay something, Lee. Tell me if this is okay,\u201d I beg.</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t immediately reply, I start to pull out of her, my concern for her greater than my need to experience this with her. Her hand flies back and grips my hip, holding me in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m okay. It hurts, but it feels good at the same time. Just give me a second.\u201d</p> <p>Letting out the breath I was holding, I\u2019m prepared to give her as much time as she needs even though all I want to do is move.</p><p>I start circling my fingers around her clit again, slowly at first and then speeding up the movement. Within seconds, her back arches and she screams as her orgasm bursts out of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming! Oh fuck, I\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><p>Her clit throbs beneath my fingers and her ass milks my cock with each pulse of her release until my own orgasm explodes out of me. I didn\u2019t even need to move in and out of her, just having my cock sheathed inside her tight hole and feeling her squeeze around me is enough to drive me right to the edge and tumble over.</p><p>My come fills her ass and my fingers continue circling her clit as another tremor wracks her body, this one smaller than the last but just as powerful going by her shouts of pleasure.</p> <p>When we\u2019re both sated and panting heavily, I pull my cock out of her and we collapse next to each other in a heap of exhaustion and sweat. With the last of my strength, I wrap my arms around her body and pull her back against my chest. The desire to tell her that I love her overwhelms me, but I bite my tongue and keep my thoughts to myself. I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m saying it because of what just happened.</p><p>With a kiss to the back of her head, I slide out of bed and make my way to the bathroom. I\u2019ve never used the Jacuzzi tub in my master bath since I bought this house a month ago and now I know why. I was waiting for the right moment and it doesn\u2019t get any more perfect than this. When the tub is filled with warm, soapy water, I head back into the bedroom to find Finnley asleep. I slide my arms under her naked body and pull her up to my chest as she yawns and opens her eyes. She leans up and kisses my chin as I walk towards the bathroom, the look on her face so sated and sexy that I feel my cock stirring below us. I step into the tub with her still in my arms, sinking down into the hot water as she sighs contentedly, twisting in my arms until she\u2019s straddling my lap.</p><p>She cups handfuls of soapy water in her hands and pours them over my chest and shoulders, running her palms over my skin as she goes. Her wet hand skims over the tattoo on my right bicep, staring at it intently. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before and I know it has a name. What\u2019s it called?\u201d</p><p>Removing my hands from the edge of the tub, I slide them into the water and glide them up her wet thighs until I\u2019m gripping her hips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a Maltese Cross. I got it the day I graduated from the fire academy.\u201d</p><p>With the tips of her fingers, she traces the design and, even with the heat of the water, I suddenly get a chill from her touch.</p> <p>\u201cIs there meaning behind it, or is it just the universal symbol for firefighters?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve heard this story so many times you would think that I\u2019d be tired of telling it, but something about explaining it to Finnley right now makes it feel like the first time. I\u2019ll never forget that first day in class at the academy when our instructor put a picture of the cross up on the chalkboard and told us its history and the meaning behind it. The blood started pumping faster in my veins and I knew, right in that moment, that I was exactly where I was supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cIt dates back to somewhere in the eleventh century. According to legend, a band of crusaders known as the Knights of St. John were fighting the Saracens for possession of the Holy Land. As the Knights advanced on the walls of the city, the Saracens used a new weapon that no one had ever used in battle before\u2014fire. They launched flaming glass bombs at the Knights, but the Knights never stopped moving forward. They were covered in fire but they kept going to save their brothers. They became the first firefighters in history.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my arm and watch her fingers continue to trace around each piece of the intricate design.</p><p>\u201cThe Maltese Cross became a symbol of protection. It means that the firefighter who wears it is willing to lay down his life for you, just like the Knights of St. John. They say that the cross is a firefighter\u2019s badge of honor, signifying that he works in courage\u2014a ladder rung away from death.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes meet mine and the intensity in them overwhelms me. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s exactly the type of mark you should have on you. You were always the most courageous person I ever knew, Collin. The fact that you put your life on the line for strangers on a daily basis doesn\u2019t come as a shock to me at all.\u201d</p><p>Tell her you love her, asshole. Tell her right now.</p><p>\u201cI have always wanted a tub like this in my house,\u201d Finnley tells me, quickly changing the subject like she knew I was one second away from making things even more serious.</p> <p>She reaches for the bar of soap sitting on the edge by the wall and I watch as she dips her hand with the soap pressed against her palm under the water, finding my cock and sliding her hand gently up and down my quickly hardening length.</p><p>It takes me a minute to answer her as she continues to run her soap-filled hand up and down my cock. \u201cWell, now you don\u2019t need one. You can use mine anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>She stares into my eyes as she pulls her hand away and drops the soap to the bottom of the tub, quickly bringing her hand back to me. I close my eyes and let my head drop to the edge of the tub, humming in approval as she tightens her fist around my cock and pumps her hand faster from base to tip.</p><p>She continues to work me over with her expert hand until I can\u2019t take it anymore. Lifting my head up, I grab onto her hips and pull her up my thighs. She leans up on her knees and positions my cock right at her entrance, keeping her eyes locked tightly to mine as she slowly lowers herself onto me. We both groan as she moves her body down onto my cock until our thighs our touching.</p><p>I sit forward in the tub and wrap my arms around her body, pulling her flush against my chest as her palms move to my cheeks and she holds my face in her hands. I press my lips to hers as she begins rocking against me, my cock slowly sliding in and out of her. She glides her tongue across my bottom lip and I immediately part my lips, pulling her tongue into my mouth. Our tongues swirl lazily around each other while our bodies move with the same unhurried speed. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever \u2018made love\u2019 before and I know for a fact I\u2019ve never even thought those words in my head. I\u2019ve always fucked and I\u2019ve fucked hard. What we\u2019re doing right now, this slow rocking against each other, is equally hot and filled with so much emotion, I can almost feel it burning a hole in my chest. Our kisses become deeper, our mouths moving faster even as our bodies continue the slow buildup. When I feel her start to clench around me and she moans into my mouth, I break our kiss, pulling back so that I can watch her. She\u2019s fucking gorgeous all the time, but I\u2019ll never get over the way she looks when she comes. When I hear her sigh my name, my cock immediately swells and my own orgasm follows quickly behind.</p><p>She opens her eyes and stares down at me, running her hands through my hair over and over. She takes her time, slowly kissing my cheeks, my chin, my nose and my forehead until the water starts to grow cold around us.</p><p>I lift her up and out of the water, drying us both off in between more kisses. When I scoop her up into my arms and carry her back into the bedroom, she laughs and I know in that moment I\u2019ve never heard a better sound. Sliding her under the covers and moving in behind her, I pull her tightly against my chest.</p><p>As her breathing slows and she drifts off to sleep in my arms, I know without a doubt that a part of me has always been in love with Finnley. Being with her these last two weeks has only amplified those feelings.</p><p>As my own eyelids grow heavy with sleep, I realize that I have plenty of time to tell her how I feel. Now that I\u2019ve found her again, I have no intention of letting her go. We have nothing but time spreading out in front of us and I have no problem waiting until I know she\u2019s ready to hear me say the words that are on the tip of my tongue.</p><p>Chapter 19\u2014Boiling Point</p><p>I\u2019VE BEEN SO busy the last two weeks with Collin that I haven\u2019t had an opportunity to pack up Jordan\u2019s things. Since Collin is working another forty-eight hour shift, I finally have the time to myself to get it done.</p><p>I still haven\u2019t told him about the restraining order, but Jordan has been unusually quiet since I filed it and I don\u2019t see the sense in bothering him about it now. All it would do is piss Collin off and I know he would hunt Jordan down and beat the hell out of him. As much as I think a good, old-fashioned ass kicking is exactly what Jordan needs, I don\u2019t want Collin getting into any trouble. For now, I\u2019m going to keep it to myself and hope Jordan isn\u2019t stupid enough to break the order.</p><p>While I busy myself pulling empty boxes from the garage and start the grueling task of packing up everything that reminds me of Jordan, I make a quick call to my mom and give her an update. I didn\u2019t want to worry her about the restraining order, either, but she\u2019s been bugging me nonstop ever since I told her I ran into Collin two weeks ago. I want her to know that things are moving quickly with him so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise when she hears it through the gossip grapevine.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised when I told her I was leaving Jordan and she didn\u2019t even bat an eye when I told her I was kind of, sort of seeing Collin so soon after I filed for a separation. My parents always loved Collin and she was thrilled to hear that we were in each other\u2019s lives again. There was no love loss between her and Jordan. Just like Phina, she never judged me for trying to stick it out and make things work, but she was more than a little overjoyed to hear that I had finally had enough and was moving on.</p><p>After letting her know that I\u2019m still alive and promising to bring Collin over to see her soon, I end the call and get busy with my task.</p><p>My plan was to just box up all of Jordan\u2019s clothes and other personal items that he didn\u2019t take with him when he moved out six weeks ago, but once that was finished, I moved on to other things that I no longer wanted in my house. Our wedding album was the first of those items. I didn\u2019t even bother to flip through the pages one last time as I tossed it into the bottom of an empty box. I didn\u2019t care to see the smiling, hopeful look on my face on what I thought was the happiest day of my life. The woman in those photos was a silly, trusting fool.</p><p>On top of the album I stack every single framed photograph of the two of us together that used to hang on the walls as well as three other photo albums filled with snapshots of us throughout the years. I pack away every gift he\u2019s ever given me, every card, every note and I shove it all away until I\u2019m standing in our bedroom surrounded by boxes. Seventeen years packed into ten boxes. Seventeen years of memories, promises and hope all hidden away in ten squares of cardboard taped tightly shut for fear they might try to sneak out and worm their way into my life again.</p><p>I carry the boxes downstairs and stack them by the front door, my body worn out and covered in sweat by the time I\u2019m finished. I look around the house at the empty nails on the walls where pictures of us used to hang and stare at the DVD case by the TV that now only holds a small handful of my favorite movies since the majority of the ones we owned were his. I sigh in relief, looking forward to dropping these boxes off at Jordan\u2019s parents house and finally having him completely out of my life. I have no idea where he\u2019s staying since his parents haven\u2019t heard from him and I don\u2019t care. I just want this stuff out of my house for good. His parents can deal with it however they want.</p><p>When I glance at the clock on the wall, I realize that three hours have passed since I last talked to Collin. He was called back into work on an emergency call and a little ball of worry ties my stomach in knots. I have no idea how long a call normally takes, but something tells me three hours is a long time for something non-serious. It occurs to me right then and there just how dangerous Collin\u2019s job is. He could be hurt at any moment. I know he\u2019s had years of training and he made captain, so he\u2019s obviously good at what he does, but that doesn\u2019t stop accidents from happening.</p><p>To take my mind off of thoughts of him being stuck in a burning building or something equally terrifying, I head upstairs and run a hot bath. When the tub is full and almost overflowing with bubbles, I strip off my clothes and sink into the warm water, resting my head against the bath pillow and closing my eyes. I think back over every time we\u2019ve had sex and how much better it gets every single time.</p><p>I think about that day at the station and how he rocked my body on top of the speaker while the bass vibrated beneath me. I never thought I\u2019d want to own a giant subwoofer, but something tells me I\u2019ll be running out to Best Buy and purchasing one as soon as possible. Running my hands up my thighs under the water, I remember how good it felt to have his tongue driving into me over and over and my fingers ghost between my legs. I picture the look on Collin\u2019s face when he sucked on his fingers before plunging them inside of me and the small tingling of desire between my legs turns into full blown need. I quickly push two of my fingers inside me and, even though they don\u2019t provide anywhere near as much pleasure as Collin\u2019s long, thick fingers, they\u2019ll do for now. Seventeen days worth of memories scroll through my mind as I pump my fingers roughly in and out a few times before dragging them through my folds to rub against my clit. I moan in the quiet room and my voice echoes off of the tiles, the house silent but for my sounds of pleasure and the sloshing of the bath water as my hand moves faster and faster between my legs.</p><p>I picture his hand wrapped around his cock that day in the weight room and the predatory look in his eyes as he stared at me while he pumped that hand up and down his hard length. I think about how much I wanted him to make himself come while he stood before me. How his face would have frozen with a look of unabashed pleasure while he palmed his cock until he came against my stomach. How I would have driven him crazy by sliding my fingers through the mess and then bringing it up to my lips, sucking his taste from my fingers until he grew hard again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think about the pleasure and pain of having him fuck my ass for the first time and I know without a doubt I\u2019ll want to repeat that experience again.</p><p>My fingers move faster and faster over my clit until my back arches and I call out Collin\u2019s name as I come.</p><p>I MUST\u2019VE DRIFTED off after I brought myself to orgasm and I wake with a start and quickly sit up, some of the now lukewarm water splashing over the edge of the tub. I figure the cold water was the cause for my sudden wake-up until I hear a thump and realize a similar noise is what jolted me out of my bath time slumber moments ago.</p> <p>Straining my ears, I wait to see if I hear anything else and when another thunk sounds from down below, I quickly pull myself out of the tub and grab the clean towel I threw on the floor. Drying myself off as fast as I can, I grab my short black robe from the back of the bathroom door and slip it on, tying the belt around my waist. I figure its Collin downstairs since I told him to just come over as soon as he got off work. In my haste to get down to him, I forget that the front door was locked and he doesn\u2019t have a key. Eager to see him again, my nose doesn\u2019t register the cloying, faintly sweet, noxious scent drifting around the corner until I\u2019m stepping into living the room and it\u2019s too late. The smell is so strong that I almost wonder why I can\u2019t see it floating in the air around me.</p><p>When my brain finally registers the scent, fear takes ahold of me like a pair of shackles around my ankles. I jerk to a stop in the doorway of the living room expecting to see a monster straight out of my nightmares standing right in front of me. When I see nothing but the empty room, hope blossoms in my chest. Maybe it\u2019s not what I think it is. The front door is standing wide-open, shards of split wood sticking out from the doorframe where it was kicked in. Twenty or so feet to freedom, to fresh air that will clear the fuzziness from my head and the exhaustion I suddenly feel. The fumes filling the room are starting to blur my vision, making the ground look like it\u2019s tilting at an awkward angle and the walls look like they\u2019re melting. I want to close my eyes to stop the room from spinning. My whole body feels weightless, and I have to fight the urge to curl up on the soft carpet at my feet and fall asleep.</p><p>A small voice inside my head starts to scream, shaking me out of the chemical high.</p><p>RUN, Finnley. RUN!</p><p>I force my feet to move, taking a few slow steps towards the door. I can see the railings of the front porch, the green grass of the yard, the sidewalk at the curb and a car parked across the street. I can make it. In just a few seconds I\u2019ll be out there where I can breathe again. I can run to the neighbor\u2019s house and call Collin.</p> <p>The thought of Collin gives me the strength I need to run. I need to get to him.</p><p>My feet stumble as the room continues to sway but I keep going. Just a little bit further and Collin will be there. He\u2019ll make all of this go away.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I look like I\u2019m drunk, tripping and veering from side to side as I hustle to freedom, but I don\u2019t care. I need to get out of this house.</p><p>Ten feet.</p><p>Five feet.</p><p>Three feet.</p> <p>I\u2019m almost there. I can feel a soft breeze blow through the door and a smile lights up my face as I pause to breathe in the fresh air.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have stopped. I should have kept going.</p><p>Two feet from freedom and a body steps out from the kitchen doorway, blocking my escape. The fist comes towards my face so fast I don\u2019t have time to block it or brace myself.</p><p>Pain explodes through my cheek, radiating up to my temple until I see nothing but blackness as I feel my body falling.</p><p>Down</p><p>Down</p><p>Down it goes until it lands on the soft carpet.</p><p>The pain in my face and head swallows all of my thoughts and I let the darkness wash over me.</p> <p>THE SMELL HITS my consciousness first. Something about it tickles my senses and reminds me that it\u2019s wrong. It shouldn\u2019t be here and I shouldn\u2019t still be breathing it, but I can\u2019t remember why.</p><p>As I blink my eyes into focus, a stabbing pain on the right side of my face has me slowly dragging my arm across the carpet and up to my cheek, cupping my face in my hand to try and stop the hurt. I can feel my heart beat thumping through the pain in my cheek and each pulse magnifies the ache and brings tears to my eyes.</p><p>I move my hand away from my face and press my palms flat against the ground, pushing myself up to my knees. As soon as I\u2019m upright, the pain in my head and on the side of my face intensifies and I whimper.</p><p>\u201cWakey, wakey, Sunshine.\u201d</p><p>The chipper voice has me jerking my head towards its sound, the blast of pain shooting up to my head making me instantly regret that quick movement.</p><p>Everything comes rushing back to me in a flash of memories. The day outside the fire station, the car following me everywhere I went, the texts, the threats, the restraining order, the unusual silence from him since I filed the restraining order and me stupidly racing down the stairs after my bath hoping the noise I heard was Collin. I should have known his silence didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d conceded and would leave me alone. I should have known he was only letting his anger fester, giving himself time to build up to the grand finale.</p><p>Standing by the front door, next to the boxes of his things, is the man responsible for the pain in my face and the deadly scent permeating the air around me. When I see the four empty red cans tossed onto their sides by the boxes, the wetness soaking against my legs finally registers.</p><p>I watch in horror as Jordan reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a small square of cardboard. My eyes sting with the smell of gas in the air and the tears burning behind my lids as I slowly start to crawl backwards.</p><p>Jordan\u2019s eyes are bloodshot and his face is flushed and I know he must be high on something. There\u2019s no other logical explanation for what he\u2019s doing right now.</p><p>\u201cDid you think you were just going to pack my shit up and put me out of your life? Move on with another man? He can\u2019t fucking have you! Do you hear me, Finn? HE CAN\u2019T FUCKING HAVE YOU!\u201d Jordan screams.</p><p>He punctuates his threat with the swipe of a match against the striker of the matchbook he holds in his shaky hands.</p><p>I\u2019m so filled with fear that I can\u2019t even find my voice to plead with him to stop. His thumb and forefinger hold the lit match out from the side of his body and the only sound I can make is another whimper.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea the number of women I\u2019ve fucked behind your back over the years? You were so trusting and gullible it was pathetic,\u201d he spits out. \u201cAll those women who fucked ten times better than you and you\u2019re the one I want. Now I\u2019m the pathetic one and it makes me SICK!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop the tremors from wracking my body but I continue to inch myself further away from him, across the carpet. This isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s all a dream. It can\u2019t end like this, not when I\u2019ve finally found what I\u2019ve been looking for and I haven\u2019t even had a chance to tell him exactly what he means to me; what he\u2019s always meant to me.</p><p>\u201cStop moving away or I swear to fuck I will drop this match right now!\u201d</p><p>I immediately halt my backward movement while he continues to shout.</p><p>\u201cYou spread your legs for another man. How in the fuck am I supposed to get those images out of my head, Finn?\u201d Jordan asks, the anguish in his voice ringing through my ears.</p><p>The fact that he\u2019s the biggest hypocrite in the world doesn\u2019t even register with him. He just admitted that he\u2019s been cheating on me our entire marriage but he\u2019s so filled with jealousy that he can\u2019t even see it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jordan, don\u2019t do this,\u201d I quietly beg, the tears escaping from my eyes and falling down my cheeks.</p><p>The match has almost burned down to his fingers and my only hope is that it will go out and I can get him to put the rest of the matches down before he does something stupid. He stares at my face and I watch as his anger starts to melt away with every tear that burns its way down my face.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about this, okay? Please, Jordan,\u201d I whisper brokenly.</p><p>Like a switch being flipped, the anger is back and his lips curl up in a sneer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finished talking, sweetheart. You\u2019re dead to me now. Might as well make it official.\u201d</p><p>The scream rips from my throat as the match drops from his fingers and flutters to the ground, the carpet in front of him bursting into flames in a whoosh of air and crackling of heat as it heads right towards me.</p><p>Chapter 20\u2014Raging Fire</p><p>GODDAMMIT ALL TO hell I\u2019m going to kill Wilcox.</p><p>After two straight days of work and only a few hours of sleep once I got home, I was called back into work because we were short handed. Of course it had to be because of that asshole Wilcox. I should be at Finnley\u2019s house right now, but instead, I\u2019m stuck in a barn filled with the smoldering ashes of the south-side wall.</p><p>As I remind him yet again about the dangers of smoking in a barn filled with dry bales of hay, the boys finish loading the hose back on the truck and I keep my temper in check until I\u2019m in the jump seat and we\u2019re pulling away from his house.</p><p>\u201cI swear to Christ I\u2019m going to just burn that fucking barn down myself and be done with it,\u201d I complain.</p><p>D.J. unbuttons his insulated coat and slides his helmet off of his head, tossing it onto the empty seat next to him. \u201cNow, now, you\u2019ll be home soon enough. I hope to God you\u2019re going to get laid tonight because this whole moody, PMS thing you\u2019ve had going on the last few days is starting to worry me.\u201d</p><p>I punch him in the arm and give him a dirty look even though he\u2019s right. I have been extra bitchy since I last saw Finnley. Being away from her is nothing short of torture. Even though we talked on the phone several times during my recent forty-eight hour shift, hearing her soft, raspy voice and knowing she was curled up in bed while she spoke to me did nothing to ease the ache I had for her. It only made me think about being inside her body and watching her beautiful brown eyes widen as her pussy clamped down on my cock. Trying to push my need for her aside during my downtime at work by lifting weights didn\u2019t help, either. Just like I predicted, every fucking time I walked in that room and looked at the subwoofer, my dick got hard and I had to lock myself in the bathroom to rub one out.</p><p>I feel myself getting worked up again, so I deliberately turn my mind towards the only thing that fires my blood as much as Finnley\u2014my absolute and total fucking hate for her soon-to-be ex-husband. I think about every conversation we\u2019ve had over the last seventeen days and it makes me want to hunt down Castillo and end his miserable excuse for a life. He had it all. He had the woman who should have been mine and he didn\u2019t even care. He treated her like garbage and he smothered her creativity. She should have gone to art school. Her gunpowder designs should be hanging in galleries all over the fucking world but instead, she was forced to take a job just to pay the bills while Castillo blew all of their money on gambling, drugs and God knows what else.</p><p>He had a beautiful, smart, sexy, talented woman and he took her for granted every day for seventeen years. I can\u2019t even believe the strong woman she\u2019s turned into after all the shit she put up with from him. Any other woman would have been beaten down and afraid to trust again, but not Finnley. She put every ounce of her trust in me and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to let her down. Finally, after several days away from her, I\u2019m going to sit her down and tell her what she means to me. What she\u2019s always meant to me every single day, even when we were apart, and just how much my feelings have grown since we got back together. I want her to know that no other woman could ever compare to her. I want her to understand that I will do whatever it takes to make her happy. We can take it slow, we can speed it up, we can do whatever the fuck she wants as long as we do it together.</p><p>As the truck pulls into the bay, I hop down and walk into the gear locker room stowing my turnout gear in my personal locker while D.J. does the same right next to me.</p><p>\u201cSo, is this going to be like high school all over again where you ditch me for a chick and I lose my wingman?\u201d he suddenly asks.</p><p>I pause in the middle of taking off my rubber boots and stare at him. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>D.J. shrugs, refusing to look at me as he shoves his helmet into the locker and toes off his own boots.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this whole you having a girlfriend thing. It makes me feel unloved and neglected,\u201d he jokes.</p><p>I shake my head at him as I finish removing the rest of my gear. \u201cYou do realize we\u2019re thirty-three years old. It\u2019s okay for one or both of us to settle down.\u201d</p><p>D.J. finally looks at me in horror. \u201cBite your tongue! There will be no settling down. Why would I settle down with one woman when I could have a multitude of women servicing my every need? The same goes for you. One pussy, forever and ever. I mean, who does that?\u201d</p><p>Sitting down on the bench right in front of the lockers, I start untying my Nikes that I chucked on the ground in my haste to change into my gear before we went out on the call a few hours ago.</p><p>\u201cI do that. I still haven\u2019t properly kicked your ass for convincing me to break up her with back in high school. I think it\u2019s way past time for me to punch you in the face for that shitty idea,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cI believe the torture I endured the rest of our senior year every damn time you saw Finnley and Jordan holding hands was punishment enough. I had to deal with your Emo, depressed ass all through finals, graduation and at every party thereafter,\u201d D.J. reminds me, holding his hand over his heart. \u201cI have done my penance and it was harsh.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at his serious tone before continuing. \u201cYou made me think it was the best idea in the history of the world to break up with her. I had a great girl by my side and, I fucked it all up. You still deserve an ass kicking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>D.J. tosses his boots in the locker and they clang against the metal. \u201cExactly. You had a great girl. You guys were just kids. Now, you have a great woman. Aren\u2019t you glad that the first time you slipped her the D you knew what you were doing? Imagine her horror if you would have tried that shit when you were seventeen? There would have been crying and screaming and it would have been all over school that you didn\u2019t know how to lay pipe. I did you a favor.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrow at him in annoyance, even though he does have a point. The sex with Finnley now that we\u2019re both adults is so hot I almost want to check my skin when we\u2019re done to look for burns. My first time having sex was a complete disaster fueled by too many shots of Goldschlager at a college party and a sorority girl who took a bet to relieve me of my virginity in the bathroom of the frat house. It was over before it even started and there were definitely tears, mostly from me since I started throwing up all the cinnamon schnapps and beer I\u2019d consumed through the night ten seconds after I came.</p><p>Which, coincidentally, is also the length of time I lasted once I got my dick in her.</p> <p>It still pains me to think that my first time wasn\u2019t with Finnley. Knowing that she ran right into Castillo\u2019s arms and slept with him after I tossed her to the side still fills me with so much jealousy and rage even after all this time. I\u2019m not angry with her, I could never be angry with her for something like that. I broke her heart and she found comfort with someone else. My anger lies solely with Jordan Castillo. That fucker knew what he was doing even back then. Just because he was new to the school doesn\u2019t mean he hadn\u2019t heard about the two of us and how long we\u2019d been together. Every time I had the unfortunate experience of walking past the two of them in the halls or seeing them together at a party, he would catch my eye and smirk, making sure my eyes were on the two of them as he grabbed her ass or kissed her right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cFine, I will concede to your point that having sex with her now when we both have experience is much better. Just don\u2019t try to get me drunk again and tell me to write her a letter. That shit isn\u2019t going to fly now,\u201d I tell him with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cCome on, that letter was genius. \u2018Dear Finnley: I\u2019m sorry, but things just aren\u2019t working out anymore. Please don\u2019t hate me. Love, Collin\u2019. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the one who deserves to do a little ass kicking for the fact that I had to give her that note and deal with her crying for a half hour afterwards. Chicks, tears and me just don\u2019t mix. I was late to English because of you and I got detention.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh when he recites the contents of that stupid fucking note. For the first time in years, thinking about it doesn\u2019t make me want to kill someone. Finnley and I found each other again and all the bullshit from the past can finally be erased. For years, I tried to lose myself in other women, but none of them compared to the memory of Finnely. I tried to find girls who made me feel even an inkling of what I felt for her, but it never worked. She made me feel ten feet tall and like I could do anything when she was by my side. Other relationships, a marriage and years apart didn\u2019t change that part of her. Even though my career consists of running into burning buildings and saving people, I\u2019ve never thought of myself as a hero. After just a few days of being with her again, I feel like I can conquer anything.</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys going to handle that one little problem of her still having a husband?\u201d D.J. asks as we finish stowing our gear and head inside.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to pressure her about that. They\u2019re legally separated and by state law she has to wait ninety-days until she can file for divorce. She\u2019s already got the paperwork filled out, so now she\u2019s just waiting for the date when it can finally be over. She\u2019s been through a lot with that asshole and I will be more than happy when he\u2019s finally out of her life for good.\u201d</p><p>D.J. is unusually quiet as we head inside the house and he busies himself in the fridge without saying a word or looking at me when we get to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the silence? I don\u2019t like it when you\u2019re quiet. It usually means you\u2019re plotting something,\u201d I tell him with a smile.</p><p>He finally turns around and lets out a deep sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t want to freak you out or anything, but I heard something about Castillo yesterday.\u201d</p><p>D.J. starts nervously cracking his knuckles and the smile dies from my face.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out. What the hell did you hear?\u201d</p> <p>He runs his hand through his short, spiky hair and I can see that he\u2019s trying to carefully choose his words.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know my Aunt Connie works as a clerk at the court house, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, making a circling motion with my hand to get him to talk faster.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I stopped by her house yesterday after my shift and she asked me if I remembered Castillo from high school. I guess there was a restraining order filed against him about a week ago. She didn\u2019t go into all the details but it has to do with stalking. Dude, Finnley filed for it.\u201d</p><p>My heart immediately starts trying to beat its way out of my chest. I know we\u2019ve spent most of our time fucking like animals the last seventeen days, but we\u2019ve also spent a lot of time talking and she never said one word about any of this. Has he been bothering her this entire time? Why the fuck wouldn\u2019t she have said anything to me?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been taken care of so don\u2019t get any stupid ideas in your head. Aunt Connie said they served him with the order and the guy apologized and said it was all a big misunderstanding. If Finnley hasn\u2019t mentioned it to you I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d D.J. reassures me.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this at all. I don\u2019t care if there\u2019s been a restraining order filed, a piece of paper isn\u2019t going to keep someone from doing something if they\u2019re pissed off enough. I experienced Jordan\u2019s anger first hand that day he first caught us together at her house. He\u2019s not the type of man to let something like this go. His actions in high school proved that he wasn\u2019t too happy about the idea that I\u2019d been with Finnley before him and, after seventeen years with her, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s like a powder keg waiting to explode, just like her artwork, knowing that I\u2019ve been with her after him.</p><p>It hurts that Finnley didn\u2019t tell me what\u2019s been going on but I have to remember that she had an entire life with the guy before I showed back up. She knows him better than anyone and she wouldn\u2019t purposefully take a chance with her life. If she didn\u2019t tell me, she must have had good reasons.</p> <p>The familiar tone of an incoming call sounds through the house and I groan in irritation. I was almost home free. I was seconds away from getting the hell out of here and finally going to see Finnley. All I can think about is making sure she\u2019s okay after this recent revelation, burying myself inside of her and finally telling her that I love her. Now I\u2019m going to have to put it off even longer to go on another call.</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill Schaffer and Bradley for calling in sick this week.</p><p>As I drag my feet back out to the bay with D.J. right on my heels, the voice from dispatch blaring through the speakers makes me stop in my tracks. The hair on the back of my neck stands up as my head whips around and I stare at the speaker hanging up by the ceiling, hoping that when dispatch repeats the information I will have heard it wrong the first time.</p><p>\u201cFranklin 10, assistance requested in the next county. All available trucks at Carlisle 3 are out on another call. Severe structure fire, possible casualties. 116 Maple Drive.\u201d</p><p>My blood runs cold and I can\u2019t make my feet move even though I need to. Every single bit of training flies out of my head and I have no idea what I should be doing or where I need to go. My hands are shaking at my sides as I watch my men race around me, getting their gear back on and shouting orders. D.J. suddenly smacks his hand against my cheek a few times and I blink my eyes into focus and stare at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cIs that...?\u201d</p><p>He lets the question hang in the air and I grab handfuls of hair on top of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s her house. It\u2019s her fucking house, D.J.!\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m shouting like a lunatic but I can\u2019t help it. One of a fireman\u2019s worst nightmares is hearing the address of one of your loved ones come in as a call. I\u2019ve never had to deal with this before. I\u2019ve never had someone I cared about this much in danger and I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do.</p><p>D.J. grabs onto my shoulders and shakes me once, getting into my face and speaking to me more professionally and calmly than I\u2019ve ever heard him speak before.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. You are going to snap out of it, grab your fucking gear and get your ass into the truck. We are going to break every single fucking speed limit to get to her house and it\u2019s going to be fine, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head numbly, doing everything I can to hold it together. I\u2019ve been in plenty of burning buildings and, even after all these years, the heat from the fire, the darkness from the smoke and the crackle of everything burning and falling down around you can fill your body with so much fear that it\u2019s hard to breathe. I think about Finnley in that same situation, stuck in her house while flames eat up the walls and trap her inside of her own personal hell and bile makes its way up from my stomach, getting trapped in my throat.</p><p>I move without conscious thought of what I\u2019m doing, on automatic pilot as I grab my gear and slide into the jump seat of the rig. The sirens are screaming as we quickly make our way to the other side of town, running red lights and taking turns so fast I think we might tip over.</p><p>D.J. takes over my job as we go, getting on the radio to call for additional help from other stations and then barking orders and a plan of attack to the six other men in the rig with us.</p><p>The fifteen-minute drive to Maple Drive is like an eternity. I try to remember what I\u2019m supposed to do in a situation like this. I know I need to assess the situation before charging inside. I know I have to make sure everyone\u2019s protective gear is buttoned up properly and the SCBA tanks are at full capacity before strapping them to the men\u2019s backs. I go through the checklist in my mind, but I forget everything I\u2019m supposed to do as soon as we come to a stop and I jump down from the vehicle, not even caring that I never put my own gear on in the truck. Even from the street, the heat from the fire that has engulfed the two-story house is enough to make me shield my face.</p><p>I frantically search the surrounding yards for any sign that Finnley isn\u2019t in the house. I hear a neighbor tell D.J. that he was walking his dog when he saw the flame shooting out of the front door and he never saw the woman who lives there come out.</p><p>When I see Finnley\u2019s car parked in front of the garage, I know in my heart that she\u2019s still inside and I forget everything I\u2019ve been taught. I bolt towards the house, leaving all of my gear inside the truck. I ignore the shouts of warning from D.J. and the other men. My only thought is of getting inside and saving the woman I have always loved.</p><p>Chapter 21\u2014Inside the Fire</p><p>THE FRONT DOOR is completely engulfed in fire and smoke and, as I run towards the house, I have to cover my face with my arm to protect it from the heat. There\u2019s no way this fire didn\u2019t have help. The place is going up faster than fucking Wilcox\u2019s barn full of dry hay. Being that it\u2019s also an older house, I know we don\u2019t have much time before the entire thing crumbles to the ground.</p><p>I hear a blood-curdling scream from inside the house as I make my way to the side yard and my heart plummets to my feet.</p><p>\u201cFINNLEY! FINNLEY!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m screaming her name until a solid band of muscle wraps around my chest from behind, pinning my arms to my sides and pulling me away from the inferno.</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE DOING? DO YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH?\u201d D.J. screams in my ear as he continues to pull me away from the house, away from Finnley.</p><p>\u201cGET THE FUCK OFF ME! GET OFF ME, GODDAMMIT SHE\u2019S IN THERE!\u201d</p><p>I struggle against his hold, clawing at D.J.\u2019s arm as I attempt to buck him off while he tries to talk some sense into me as he roughly drags me further and further away from where I need to be. He has no fucking clue. He doesn\u2019t get it. I lost every bit of sense the moment that call came into the station. I can still hear the sound of that one, painful scream ringing in my ears. I can\u2019t hear anything else but the crackle of the fire and men shouting orders from the front of the yard. Even though the sound of her tortured cry coming from somewhere in that burning house was enough to bring me to my knees, at least I know she\u2019s still alive. She\u2019s still in there waiting for me to get to her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to calm the fuck down and use your head! You\u2019re going to be no good to her if you go racing in there like a fucking idiot and get yourself killed!\u201d D.J. yells.</p><p>He gets me twenty feet away from the house before I finally get one arm free and slam my elbow back into his stomach. His hold loosens just enough that I can turn around, slamming both of my hands into his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again, D.J. Get the fuck away from me right now!\u201d I shout in his face, shoving him again.</p><p>I quickly turn and race along the side of the house, looking for another way in. I spot a large picture window about chest-high towards the back of the house and sprint to it, my legs moving so fast that I barely have time to stop. With a quick glance in the window, I see no signs of fire in the room, but it\u2019s quickly filling with smoke. Reaching down into the landscaped flowerbed right below the window, I grab a decorative rock the size of a bowling ball, heft it up over my head and send it smashing through the window.</p><p>I immediately duck down as the smoke that filled the room comes billowing out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFUCKING SON OF A BITCH! KEENER! GET THE HOSE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE! MARTINEZ, BRING AN EXTRA AIR TANK!\u201d D.J. shouts from behind me.</p><p>Pulling my long-sleeved shirt down from where it was bunched up around my elbows, I cover as much skin as possible before using my arm to swipe along the bottom of the window frame, removing as much of the glass as I can.</p><p>I hear a shout from the road about the fire hydrant not working and the blood runs cold in my veins. Being a station in a small town, our trucks are filled with very little water. We rely on the city hydrants for our supply and if that doesn\u2019t work, we have to call in a tanker from a neighboring town. If the men can\u2019t get water on this house immediately, there will be no saving it. I have to get Finnley out - fast.</p> <p>Gripping the open window ledge, I heft my body up, swinging one leg over until I\u2019m basically straddling the windowsill, hovering half in the house and half out.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Collin will you just wait?\u201d D.J. begs again, grabbing onto my arm and attempting to pull me towards him on the ground. \u201cThe tanker will be here in a matter of minutes.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his arm off of me angrily, I twist my body until my lower half is completely inside the house, my feet finding purchase on the carpeted floor.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have minutes, this house is over a hundred years old. I want you acting as the lead paramedic when she comes out, so make sure you have your shit ready. If anything happens, you make sure Finnley gets out first, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S A FUCKING ORDER, DRAKE!\u201d I shout, cutting him off.</p><p>I watch as all the argument leaves his face. D.J. always used to joke that I\u2019m like one of his parents. The only time we ever use his given name is when we\u2019re pissed at him.</p><p>Martinez comes racing up at that moment and thrusts an extra air tank into D.J.\u2019s hands. He quickly lifts it up into the window and I grab it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fucking hero, you stupid son of a bitch. If it\u2019s too bad in there, you get the fuck out, you hear me?\u201d D.J. tells me as he slowly starts to back away from the window.</p><p>\u201cYep, you got it.\u201d</p><p>We both know I\u2019m lying but at least D.J. has the sense not to call me on it right now. With one last look, we both turn and head in opposite directions.</p> <p>I immediately drop to the floor where the smoke is less dense, sliding my arms through the straps of the tank and getting it on my back so my hands are free. I army crawl across the room, poking my head out into the hall to assess the situation. From this vantage point, I can see into the living room. Well, what\u2019s left of the living room. It\u2019s one big wall of fire and almost every square inch of the floor is up in flames. When I heard Finnley scream moments ago, it sounded like it came from upstairs, so I\u2019m praying to God she isn\u2019t in that fucking living room. Luckily, the stairs aren\u2019t located right in the living room, but in a hallway a few yards away from it. As it is, I\u2019m barely going to be able to get to the stairs leading up without burning my skin off.</p><p>I keep low to the ground and move as fast as I can, pulling the neck of my shirt up over my nose and mouth, cursing myself for not using my head and grabbing my air mask. As soon as I get to the hallway, I feel the heat from the blaze like a punch to the face. It\u2019s so hot I can feel it singeing my exposed skin. It steals the breath from my lungs and my eyes, already blurry from the smoke, begin to water even more. Through the wall of fire, I can just barely make out a gaping hole in the front of the house. In an orange, hazy glow I see the guys through the hole scrambling around the front yard. The flames are quickly licking up to the second story and even if they had managed to get the attack line hooked up to the hydrant out front, I\u2019m not sure it would have helped. I watch as a support beam from the front wall comes crashing down over the opening, blocking the entrance. I cover my face and head as ash, sparks and fire shoot towards me like a blast from a firework when the burning beam smashes into the opposite wall. With a quick glance upwards, I see the fire quickly eating up part of the ceiling and I know if I don\u2019t hurry, the entire second floor above the living room will go up in flames and come crashing down.</p><p>I move as fast as my legs will allow, flying up the stairs and taking them two at a time, shouting Finnley\u2019s name as I go.</p><p>\u201cFINNLEY! FINNLEY, BABY, I\u2019M HERE! FINNLEY!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m having trouble breathing by the time I get to the top step. The smoke has filled my nose and lungs and each breath I take feels like knives are being dragged up and down my throat. I know I should stop and take a hit of the air from the tank on my back, but there\u2019s no time. I need to get to her. She\u2019s been in here longer and she\u2019s going to need it more than me. I\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ve been trained to deal with smoke inhalation, I just need to stay calm and keep going.</p><p>There are three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs and I head towards the door closest to me, coughing and spitting out smoke and ash-filled saliva as I go. Knowing that I can\u2019t touch the doorknob in case there\u2019s fire on the other side of it, I step back with one leg and prepare to kick it in. A noise directly behind me gives me pause and I pray with everything inside of me that the small thump was Finnley and she\u2019s okay.</p><p>I quickly turn and a fist connects with my eye. I hear a crunch and feel my eye immediately start to swell. I don\u2019t even bother pressing a hand to the area to try and ease the pain that\u2019s radiating right up to my skull.</p><p>Jordan laughs as I glare at him, my hands clenched into fists at my sides. As much as I want to beat the shit out of him for what he\u2019s done, I don\u2019t have time. My only concern, my only thought right now is that I need to save Finnley. I would have been perfectly fine leaving him standing here with that smug look on his face, but of course he wouldn\u2019t make it easy on me. As I turn to walk away, he grabs onto the back of my shirt, clutching the fabric in his hands to hold me in place.</p> <p>What the fuck is it with people trying to stop me? Don\u2019t they understand that NOTHING can stop me from getting to Finnley?</p><p>Without a word, I twist out of his grasp and quickly turn, the momentum of my body bringing my arm and fist flying towards his face so fast he doesn\u2019t even see it coming. With one solid punch to the side of his head, he goes down like a ton of bricks.</p><p>As much as I hate him, as much as I want to shove him down the stairs to be swallowed up by the wall of fire, I know I can\u2019t leave him out here in the hall. I\u2019m a civil servant and I took an oath, swearing to do everything I can to save every single person whether they are an innocent child or the piece of shit that started the fire in the first place. I will drag his worthless ass out of this burning building because it\u2019s my job, but I will absolutely make sure I get to Finnley first.</p><p>Figuring there\u2019s no way Jordan would have left Finnley alone, I go into the room he came out of when he confronted me, stepping over Jordan\u2019s unconscious body as I go. The smoke has gotten so thick I can barely see an inch in front of my face and with only one good, working eye, that\u2019s not a good thing. Pulling my leg back, I kick in the door to Finnley\u2019s bedroom. The smoke from the hall immediately billows into the room and I drop down on all fours to crawl inside.</p><p>\u201cFinnley! Are you in here? Please, baby, answer me!\u201d I shout as I crawl blindly through the room, moving my hands all around me in the hopes that I\u2019ll feel some part of her under my fingers.</p><p>Coughs wrack my body as I continue moving around the room, feeling my way and coming up completely empty. My heart drops as I quickly turn and make my way back out into the hall and over to the next bedroom.</p><p>With a quick glance downstairs, I see the fire has made its way down the hall and to the bottom step. Pieces of the house crash down from the ceiling and walls, completely engulfed in flames, and I know the only way we\u2019re going to be able to get out of this house is through one of these upstairs windows. Unfortunately, the fire is so strong on the first floor that my men are never going to be able to get close enough to put a ladder against the house. They won\u2019t be able to reach the second floor and we won\u2019t be able to get out. There\u2019s no way the floor up here is going to hold much longer considering how fast the fire has spread along the ceiling on the first floor. If I don\u2019t find her quick and figure a way out, we\u2019re going to come crashing down to the first floor, right in the middle of the fire.</p><p>Grabbing onto Jordan\u2019s still passed-out body, I drag him away from the stairs, deeper into the hall in case the fire makes its way up here before I can get back to him.</p><p>Bringing the neck of my shirt back up over my nose and mouth, I try to breathe in as little of the smoke-filled air as possible as I kick down the second door. Just like before, I immediately drop to my knees and start feeling around the room, shouting for Finnley.</p><p>Right when I start to lose hope and my body starts to shut down, reacting to the amount of smoke I\u2019ve inhaled and the adrenaline slowly leaving me, my hand brushes against the warm, smooth skin of a leg.</p><p>\u201cFinnley! Baby, can you hear me?\u201d I shout as I quickly move my way up her body, my hands sliding up her legs. I wince when I feel rough, blistered skin every so often along the outside of one leg and I can\u2019t stop the sob that escapes my lips knowing she suffered burns.</p><p>My hands continue moving upward, realizing she\u2019s naked and there are more burns peppering most of the skin of her upper thighs, hips and waist. I want to scream and cry for her and what she went through before I got here, but I don\u2019t have time. I have to get her out of here. I have no idea how long she\u2019s been unconscious and no idea the amount of smoke she\u2019s inhaled.</p><p>I make it up to her face when I hear a loud creak and the sound of the floor on the other side of the house caving in. I can hear muffled screams and shouts from outside and I know I need to hurry.</p><p>Ripping the air tank off of my back, I quickly unhook the mask from the side of the tank and press it down over Finnley\u2019s face. The light from the moon coming in the window right above her is enough for me to just make out the features of her face and to see that the clear plastic mask isn\u2019t fogging up with the heat from her breaths and her chest isn\u2019t moving. These air tanks are demand valve, which means the person needs to be breathing in order for the air to hit their lungs.</p><p>\u201cNo! Oh Jesus, no! Finnley!\u201d I scream through my tears as I lean down, pressing my ear against her chest to listen for her heartbeat, my own stuttering when I hear nothing but deadly silence.</p><p>Just then, the window above my head shatters. I quickly cover Finnley\u2019s face as pieces of glass rain down on top of us. I look up just as D.J. sticks his head inside the now open window.</p><p>\u201cCan you lift her to me?\u201d he shouts into the room, the sound of the house burning down around us so loud that I can barely hear him.</p><p>Getting up as fast as I can, I slide my arms under Finnley\u2019s back and legs and bring her up to my chest. I can just make out the red splotches of burned skin all over the lower half of her body as I bring her close to me and I feel something inside me break into a million pieces. I cradle the warmth of her body tightly to me, kissing the top of her head as I lift her through the broken window and into D.J.\u2019s waiting arms. He moves her up and over his shoulder to make it easier to climb down the ladder, her head and arms draped down his back with his hand clutching firmly behind her knees.</p><p>Before he disappears from the window, I turn and yank the comforter off of the top of the bed, racing to the window and draping it over Finnley\u2019s naked body.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not breathing, D.J.! Fuck! Just hurry!\u201d I yell after him as he moves down the ladder with the ease of someone who has done this a million times. I see men from two additional fire departments battle the blaze together all around the ladder now that the tanker has arrived. They\u2019re able to keep the fire away from this area for now, but I know it won\u2019t hold much longer.</p><p>DJ looks back up at me one last time before he gets to the bottom. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her Collin, just get your ass down here before the entire place blows.\u201d</p><p>Once the two of them are safely on the ground and I see D.J. racing towards the ambulance parked in the street, I turn and quickly make my way back through the room, trying not to slam into furniture since visibility in here is nil. The only thing keeping me sane right now is the knowledge that D.J. is a trained paramedic and so fucking amazing at it that I always ask him why the hell he never became a doctor. If anyone can help Finnley, it will be him.</p><p>The smoke has gotten impossibly thicker and I know I don\u2019t have much time. My lungs burn with every breath I take and I\u2019m starting to get lightheaded from not having any good, clean air in my system for so long.</p><p>Jordan is still unconscious out in the hallway and doesn\u2019t even budge as I grab both of his wrists, pull them up over his head and drag him back into the room I just came from. As soon as I get to the window and crouch down next to him to heft him up over my shoulder, his eyes suddenly pop open and he shoves me roughly away. My body is so weak that I immediately fall backwards, my ass slamming into the ground.</p><p>Jordan begins coughing violently as he crab-crawls away from me, screaming at me as he goes. \u201cSTAY AWAY FROM ME! STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!\u201d</p><p>I dive forward, grabbing onto his ankle and yank him towards me.</p><p>\u201cStop being an asshole! I\u2019m not going to hit you again. We need to get the fuck out of this house right now before it collapses.\u201d</p><p>He kicks his leg out, his foot connecting with my chest and I drop my hold on his leg while he scrambles up to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no! Leave me, just fucking leave me!\u201d he shouts.</p><p>I jump up to my feet and charge him. This motherfucker is the reason all of this happened. He started this fire, he hurt Finnley and now he won\u2019t fucking cooperate so I can get us both out of here without being killed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grab onto the front of his shirt and pull him towards me as hard as I can. He loses his footing and stumbles to the ground. I don\u2019t even bother trying to get him back up on his feet. While he screams and struggles against me, his feet digging into the carpet, I pull him towards the window using every last bit of energy left in me.</p><p>\u201cCOLLIN! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, GET DOWN THE LADDER!\u201d I hear D.J. yell from down below.</p><p>\u201cGet your sorry ass up right now!\u201d I shout down at Jordan as he continues to try and struggle away from me.</p> <p>The sound of a small explosion downstairs rattles the entire house, sending me backwards. I let go of Jordan as my ass slams into the windowsill and I have to throw my arms out to either side of the window to prevent myself from tumbling backwards out to the ground below.</p><p>Smoke curls around me as the flames from down below make it upstairs, climbing along the hallway and bursting into the doorway. Jordan turns and stares at the fire, frozen in shock as it inches it\u2019s way across the floor towards him.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to burn,\u201d Jordan mutters to himself, staring wide-eyed at the fire that\u2019s dangerously close to his legs.</p><p>I could tell as soon as I saw him out in the hallway when he first confronted me that something wasn\u2019t right with him. His eyes were unfocused and he had all the telltale signs of someone under the influence of something bad. He\u2019s not making any sense right now and, as much as I want to continue shouting at him to get the fuck out of the house, something tells me he\u2019s so far gone that he doesn\u2019t even care anymore.</p><p>I soften my tone just like I would with any other victim I encounter out on a call to do what I can to ease their fears. \u201cHey, it\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t care about any of that. Let\u2019s just get out of here, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Jordan shakes his head back and forth as he continues to stare at the flames. \u201cI wanted your heart to blister with the pain of losing her, just like mine did. I know I never deserved her, I know I fucked everything up, but she was mine. You shouldn\u2019t get to make her happy if I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The inflection in his voice has a singsong quality to it like he\u2019s reading from a children\u2019s book and that\u2019s when I know he has officially lost his fucking mind.</p><p>I want nothing more than to just turn and race down the ladder right behind me and let him burn down with the house, but my conscience won\u2019t let that happen. Everyone deserves to be saved. I push away from the window to try to grab him one more time when he speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to kill her. I never meant for any of this to happen. I deserve this. I deserve to feel the heat and the fire and let it burn every inch of me for what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>The fight leaves my body along with my good intentions. The heart that used to beat with the love and hope for the future that was finally within my grasp has been tossed into the fire right in front of me, scalding and melting with the burn of my pain.</p><p>\u201cI wanted your heart to blister with the pain of losing her.\u201d</p> <p>He won. He got what he wanted.</p><p>My body slumps backwards until my ass hits the windowsill again.</p><p>He killed her. He killed her. He killed her.</p><p>Up until this moment, I still had hope that she would be okay. I still believed she could be saved. I knew D.J. would do everything within his power to bring her back to me. My only goal was to get Jordan safely out of this house so that I could make my way to her.</p><p>This weak bastard sitting on the floor a few feet from me with the fire just inches away from his feet, he killed the only thing in my life worth living for. He couldn\u2019t handle the idea of her being happy without him, so he masterminded the ultimate revenge. He took her from this world, from this life, from me. I\u2019ll never again see her smile, hear her laugh or feel her lips against mine. I\u2019ll never get to tell her how much I love her, how much I\u2019ve loved her every single day since I was fifteen years old. All those dreams, all those plans we made for the future while I held her body against mine and felt hear heartbeat under the palm of my hand... ruined, all of it ruined. She\u2019s gone and nothing will ever be the same again.</p><p>Everything inside of me that I\u2019ve known to be true, every instinct that told me no matter what he did, I needed to save him, it all disintegrates and I can\u2019t find it in me to care. I want him to die. He deserves to die. He took the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved from me before I even had a chance to tell her.</p><p>I\u2019ve made the decision to get onto the ladder behind me, climb down to safety and leave a man behind to burn. The ethics instilled in me, the ones I\u2019ve imparted on every single man who has ever come through my firehouse, fade into nothing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>I turn my body to the side so I can swing one leg out of the open window until I\u2019m straddling the sill. I look at the back of Jordan\u2019s head one last time, knowing as soon as I get on that ladder and leave him in here that I\u2019ll never be a fireman again. By turning my back on him, ignoring every single vow I\u2019ve ever made, I\u2019m saying good-bye to the only dream I ever had until I found my way back to Finnley. It\u2019s only fitting that I lose them both in one day.</p> <p>Jordan\u2019s head suddenly whips around when he sees me exiting the window. I can tell by the wild look of fear in his eyes that he suddenly realized what was about to happen to him. He was going to be left behind; left to burn alive.</p><p>Jordan lunges for me.</p><p>The entire foundation of the house begins to shake and I hear people screaming down below. I move to get on the ladder and, all of a sudden, a hand grabs onto me and pulls. The house beings to fall and I follow right behind.</p><p>Down</p><p>Down</p><p>Down, until there is nothing more.</p><p>Chapter 22\u2014Up in Flames</p><p>IT BURNS, OH, God everything burns.</p><p>I want to scream in pain but my voice is trapped, stuck inside a throat that feels like it\u2019s been ripped to shreds and then lit on fire. Every breath I take hurts so badly that I just want to stop breathing altogether to make the pain go away. I want to open my eyes and see what the hell is going on, but every time I try to blink them open, the sting of tears blurs my vision and I quickly snap them closed.</p><p>The smell of smoke and fire is burned into my nostrils, so strong that I can\u2019t stop the vomit from traveling up from my stomach. As I heave and cough and cry, lurching to the side to expel the bile that burns its way up my raw throat, I hear the shout of an unfamiliar voice right next to me.</p><p>\u201cSHE\u2019S BREATHING! Get me seventy-five cc\u2019s of oxygen and ten milligrams of morphine.\u201d</p><p>I feel a hand rubbing circles against my upper arm as my body is lifted up and onto what feels like a stretcher. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. I want the pain to go away and I want Collin. Every time my body is jostled, I cry out in pain. The burning sensation on my legs and stomach is so painful that I\u2019m certain my body is on fire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. You\u2019re going to be okay. The medicine will kick in soon, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t recognize the voice speaking gently by my ear and I cry even harder, trying to block out the fear and the pain.</p><p>\u201cCollin, where\u2019s Collin? I need Collin,\u201d I sob, the sounds of chaos surrounding me until I want to curl up into a ball and cover my ears.</p><p>\u201cShit, she\u2019s asking for McDaniels,\u201d the voice whispers.</p><p>I feel something hard and plastic pressed over my mouth and the cold air of fresh oxygen is pushed past my lips and into my lungs. I cough against the intrusion, my throat still burning in pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie, just take it nice and slow. I know it hurts.\u201d</p><p>I want to scream at her but I don\u2019t have the energy. She has no idea how much it hurts, no idea how much I want to claw and scratch at my own skin just to ease the burning. I feel a pinch in my upper arm and, seconds later, my thoughts begin to grow hazy and even more confusing.</p><p>\u201cCollin, I need Collin,\u201d I slur as the pain in my legs and torso slowly starts to disappear.</p><p>I feel myself being lifted again and the sound of doors slamming shut, the noise and shouts of people from moments ago immediately cut off. I drift in and out of consciousness, hearing soft voices and the muffled sound of a siren every so often.</p><p>\u201c... no way he survived that fall. Did you see the way the house crumbled? I\u2019m surprised D.J. was able to walk away considering he was still on the ladder when it fell.\u201d</p><p>I try to force my mind to pay attention when I hear D.J.\u2019s name but whatever they gave me is too strong. My brain is foggy and I can feel myself slowly going under.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way McDaniels is still alive. No one could have survived a drop like that.\u201d</p><p>As the darkness pulls me further and further away from reality, the blessed relief I should feel since my skin is no longer on fire is erased by the knowledge that I\u2019ve lost him. My sweet, beautiful man is gone.</p><p>Gone before I could tell him I love him.</p><p>Gone before I could spend the rest of my life showing him just how much.</p><p>With one last sob before I let the oblivion consume me, I realize my life is over. I don\u2019t want to live one second on this earth if Collin isn\u2019t here with me. I don\u2019t care what happens to me, I don\u2019t care if the pain returns and swallows me whole. I don\u2019t care about anything but escaping from this hell and being with the man who saved me.</p><p>Chapter 23\u2014Seventeen Seconds</p><p>THE DREAM IS so vivid that I do everything I can to fight my way out of it, but nothing works. I don\u2019t want to remember. I don\u2019t want to feel the pain and fear all over again, but I can do nothing to stop it. I see it all as clearly as if I\u2019m living through it one more time.</p><p>The first time was bad enough.</p><p>The second time just might kill me.</p><p>I watched as the match in Jordan\u2019s hand fluttered to the ground, almost in slow motion. If only the fire that spread out between us as soon as the tiny little flame hit the ground moved as slow. I screamed at the top of my lungs, scrambling backwards as fast as I could. My hands and feet tangled together on the carpet and I slammed down onto my back as the fire closed the distance, the gas that coated my legs no match for the beast that latched onto me. I watched in horror as the flames rapidly swallowed my legs like the mouth of a fire-breathing dragon. I screamed in fear and agony as the heat singed my skin and scorched my flesh, the pain so intense I almost wanted to just let it take me.</p><p>Jordan stood by the door with a look of horror on his face as I ripped the robe from my body and wrapped it around my legs, smothering the fire as I kicked them across the ground and continued to scream in pain, inching across the carpet that was almost completely engulfed in flames from the gas he\u2019d dumped.</p><p>I felt the fire licking against the skin of my side and hips as my back slammed against the corner of the wall. Rolling over onto my hands and knees, I cry and sob in pain as I slither on my belly across the tile in the hallway until I make it to the stairs. I crawl up each step as fast as my burned skin will allow. I\u2019ve never felt pain like this before and it steals the breath from my lungs. I just needed to make it upstairs, up to one of the bedrooms where there was no smoke or fire. My entire body hurt so badly that I wasn\u2019t even sure if my skin was still burning or not. As soon as I got to the top step, a hand grabbed onto my hair and yanked me roughly backwards.</p><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t leave!\u201d Jordan screamed as he tried to drag me back down the stairs. \u201cThe fire will erase everything. It will make it all go away. We need to make it go away!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t go back down those stairs. If he got me back down there, I would die. I would never be able to make it out of this hell and I can\u2019t let that happen. I WON\u2019T let it happen. Collin will be here soon. The neighbors must have seen the fire by now and even though Collin\u2019s department isn\u2019t the one that will respond, he\u2019s still on his way here after his shift. Collin will be here. I just needed to hold on for Collin.</p><p>Drawing on every bit of the little strength I had left, I pulled my elbow forward and then slammed it back between Jordan\u2019s legs. He immediately released his hold on my hair and fell to his knees behind me. I let out the loudest, blood-curdling scream I could muster as I dove forward and crawled the last few feet into my spare bedroom, slamming the door closed behind me to keep the smoke out.</p><p>The burnt skin of my legs and stomach scraped across the carpet as I inched my way closer to the window. I just needed to get to the window. There was fresh air and freedom through that glass. Tears rolled down my cheeks and I bit back more screams of pain as I collapsed a few feet from the window.</p><p>It hurt so much. Everything burned. I was afraid to look down at my body, sure that my skin had melted off by now. I was in agony and the coughs wracking my body from the smoke I\u2019d inhaled amplified the pain until I felt my vision start to fade. I rolled over onto my back and stared up at the window above me, willing the pain to disappear. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I just wanted it to end.</p><p>From somewhere far away, I heard someone scream my name.</p><p>Collin. He came.</p><p>The burning of my skin engulfed me until there was nothing left but pain.</p><p>I knew he\u2019d come. I knew he\u2019d save me.</p><p>I counted my breaths, each one more painful than the last until I felt my heart begin to slow.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>It hurts, oh, God it hurts so much.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Sixteen.</p><p>My eyes slowly closed as my last breath escaped my lungs.</p><p>Seventeen.</p><p>I\u2019m screaming. The pain is so great and my voice is so loud but I can\u2019t make it stop, even when gentle hands smooth my hair away from my face and a soft voice tries to quiet me. My eyes fly open and I feel tears pouring down my cheeks as I stare frantically around the stark, white room. An oxygen mask is quickly placed over my face as I\u2019m lightly pushed back down in bed. I sob quietly as the dream comes back to me in flashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fire.</p><p>The burning.</p><p>The pain.</p> <p>The words from what must have been my ambulance ride after I\u2019d been rescued from the fire float through my mind over and over and I cry even harder.</p><p>There\u2019s no way McDaniels is still alive.</p><p>There\u2019s no way McDaniels is still alive.</p><p>There\u2019s no way McDaniels is still alive.</p><p>Maybe they were wrong. Maybe the drugs they gave me were playing with my mind and I misheard them. It can\u2019t be true.</p> <p>With a shaking hand, I reach up and move the oxygen mask away from my face as the nurse sticks a needle into my I.V. and pushes the syringe down, the pain medicine quickly making its way through the tube and spreading into my veins.</p><p>\u201cCollin, where\u2019s Collin?\u201d I ask her with a raspy voice.</p><p>She looks at me in confusion as she pulls the blankets up around my body and tucks me back in. I remember the paramedics saying something about a fall. I remember hearing him scream my name and I know that wasn\u2019t a dream. He was in the house. He came to save me.</p><p>\u201cThe man who was in the house with me. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>I watch the confusion leave her face, quickly replaced with sadness that she\u2019s unable to hide. \u201cOh, sweetie, I\u2019m so sorry. He didn\u2019t make it out.\u201d</p><p>She moves the oxygen mask back over my face and starts talking about my injuries and how long it will take me to recover. I don\u2019t even hear her words. The pain in my chest hurts greater than the throbbing of my scorched flesh. Ignoring my bandaged legs and stomach and the I.V. attached to my arm, I roll over onto my side and curl up in a ball. I never thought my heart could possibly break a second time for Collin, but it does. It shatters into a thousand little pieces when I think of his smile and his touch and how he saved me, in more ways than one. I\u2019ll never recover from this pain. I\u2019ll never be able to put my heart back together again. I squeeze my eyes closed and wish that I had died in the fire right along with him.</p> <p>Chapter 24\u2014Things We Lost in the Fire</p><p>\u201cOPEN YOUR EYES, Lee.\u201d</p><p>I hear his voice in my dream and I refuse to open my eyes. I want to stay right here in the haze of pain medication so I can hear him say my name over and over. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been asleep and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not ready for reality, but I know as soon as I open my eyes it will come crashing down around me. I feel a hand rubbing up and down my arm and I want to scream at the nurse to stop touching me. There\u2019s only one person who can ease my pain and he\u2019s gone.</p><p>I curl my body into a tighter ball and try to will the tears away, but there\u2019s no use. They stream down my face and soak the pillow under my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, baby. Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice is so real and so full of anguish that I have no choice but to crack open my eyes. When I see Collin\u2019s crystal blue eyes filled with tears just inches from my face, I can\u2019t stop the sob that flies past my lips. I jerk my body upright, shouting in pain when my bandaged legs brush roughly against the bed. I immediately push the pain away, launching myself forward and into his arms. They wrap tightly around my back as he leans into me, pulling me as close to his body as possible. It\u2019s not close enough. It will never be close enough. The tears fall faster down my cheeks as I press my face into the crook of his neck and breathe him in through my sobs.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you,\u201d he whispers brokenly as he moves his arms from around me and cups my face in his palms, pulling me away from his neck so he can stare into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, am I dreaming? Please don\u2019t let this be a dream. They told me you were dead. They told me you didn\u2019t make it,\u201d I whimper, crying so hard now that I\u2019m close to hyperventilating.</p> <p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re killing me, Lee, please don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m right here and I\u2019m okay,\u201d he reassures me, wiping away each tear that falls with his thumbs.</p><p>I try to calm down and slow my breathing as I run my hands over every inch of him that I can reach, making sure that he\u2019s real and safe and alive. I slide my hands up his arms, over his shoulders, run them across his face and then back down his arms again, feeling the warm, hard muscles and sighing in relief.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you so much,\u201d I tell him, bringing my hands up to rest over top of his on my face. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s too much too soon. I don\u2019t care about anything but not wasting another minute of our time together. I almost lost Collin without him ever knowing how I feel and I\u2019m not going to make that same mistake twice.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI thought I was too late. When I saw you lying there in that bedroom and you weren\u2019t breathing, I wanted to die. You are everything to me, Finnley, everything. I have loved you since I was fifteen years old and I\u2019m never going to stop.\u201d</p><p>The tears start all over again with his words and he quickly leans forward and presses his lips to mine. I never thought I\u2019d see him again. I never thought I\u2019d hear his voice or feel his lips against mine and it\u2019s almost too much to take. I\u2019m overwhelmed with emotion and relief that he\u2019s okay. He\u2019s here and he\u2019s alive and I can kiss and touch him whenever I want.</p><p>He moves back and that\u2019s when I finally look down and see that he\u2019s in a wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. What happened?\u201d I ask in horror as I see a hard plaster cast that goes from the tip of his left foot all the way up to his knee as well as a few bandages here and there on both of his arms that I didn\u2019t even notice when I was running my hands over them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a broken leg and a few minor burns. I\u2019ll be out of commission for a little bit but it\u2019s fine,\u201d he explains. \u201cAfter I got you out of the house and D.J. took you down the ladder so he could start working on you, I tried to get Jordan out of the house. He fought me and refused to leave. When he told me he\u2019d killed you, I stopped giving a shit if he lived or died and I was halfway out the window when the house started to collapse. Thank God D.J. never listens to a damn word I say. He passed you off to another paramedic and raced back up the ladder, grabbed onto my shirt and yanked me out of the window. He lost his hold on me when the ladder started falling with the house and I dropped two stories and landed on my leg.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen in horror as he explains what he went through, but he refuses to let me feel even a moment of guilt.</p><p>\u201cWipe that look off your face right now. It\u2019s not your fault and I\u2019m going to be just fine. I\u2019m more concerned with you. How do you feel? Are you in any pain right now?\u201d</p><p>The adrenaline that shot through my veins with the news of Collin\u2019s survival quickly fades, replaced by throbbing pain in my legs and hips where I sustained the worst burns. Collin winces when he sees the look of discomfort on my face and quickly presses the button on the side of my bed to call the nurse.</p><p>She races into the room and immediately fills my I.V. with another shot of morphine, making me lie back down in bed and strapping the oxygen mask back on my face.</p><p>Before she leaves, she narrows her eyes at Collin. \u201cYou should be in bed yourself, breathing in some of the same nice, clean oxygen Mr. McDaniels.\u201d</p><p>He gives her a heart-stopping grin as he grabs my hand and brings it up to his mouth, placing a kiss on my palm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to bring in another tank then, Stephanie, because I\u2019m not leaving my girl\u2019s side ever again.\u201d</p><p>She tsks him but can\u2019t hide the smile on her face as she leaves the room.</p><p>I can feel the medicine begin to work its magic, the numbness inching it\u2019s way up my legs and hips until there\u2019s nothing but blessed relief and my eyes grow heavy with sleep.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, baby. I\u2019m not going anywhere, even if Nurse Ratched tries to drag me out of here,\u201d Collin whispers with a laugh close to my ear as my eyelids flutter closed.</p><p>I let sleep consume me as I feel Collin\u2019s hand smooth across my forehead and down the side of my face. Everything will be okay. I know that Collin hasn\u2019t told me everything. Based on the way he quickly glossed over the fact that Jordan refused to leave the burning house, I have to assume he probably didn\u2019t make it out alive. I know now that when I asked the nurse earlier if Collin made it out of the house, she naturally assumed I was referring to Jordan. My medical records would still list him as my husband and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s who she thought I was so upset about.</p><p>I wonder if it\u2019s wrong that I don\u2019t feel even an inkling of sadness that he\u2019s gone? I built a life with that man. He picked up the pieces of my broken heart after Collin left and he was my whole world for over half of my life.</p><p>Seventeen years together.</p><p>Seventeen thousand problems.</p><p>Seventeen days with a man from my past who is now my future.</p><p>Seventeen minutes in hell as the house Jordan and I built together burned down around us.</p><p>Seventeen breaths until I took what I thought would be my last.</p><p>It turns out, this story does have a happy ending. It wasn\u2019t too late. We still have plenty of time to build a new future.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I love you, I love you,\u201d Collin repeats softly in my ear as I drift off to sleep, dreaming about the future that stretches far and wide in front of us.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>FOUR MONTHS LATER...</p><p>I watch from across the room as Finnley chats to a group of people, smiling to myself as her hand comes up and tugs on her earlobe.</p><p>Quickly making my way over to her side, I wrap my hand around hers and bring it down between us.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, you have no reason to be nervous,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>She excuses herself from the group and tugs me a few feet away until we\u2019re out of earshot of other people. \u201cHow in the hell did you know I was nervous?\u201d</p><p>I smirk down at her and shake my head. \u201cBaby, you always tug on your ear when you\u2019re nervous. You did it right before the first time I kissed you at the end of tenth grade, when I stuck my hand down your pants three months later, five seconds before you gave me my first blow job and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, smartass, you made your point,\u201d she tells me with a laugh, cutting me off. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with D.J. and Phina?\u201d</p><p>Glancing in the direction where she\u2019s looking, I see the two of them on the far side of the room, quietly arguing. Phina starts gesturing wildly with her hands and then D.J. points at her and says something that makes her face fall. I hold my breath, assuming he said something really stupid and she\u2019s probably going to smack him across the face, but it never happens. She says one more thing to him and then turns and walks away. D.J. grits his teeth, shoves his hands in his pockets angrily and then storms off in the opposite direction.</p><p>I have no idea what the hell that was all about. D.J. hasn\u2019t mentioned one word about Phina since that night at Slammers when he drunkenly made out with her at the table in front of everyone. I hope to God she doesn\u2019t have some sort of misplaced infatuation with the guy. D.J. will never settle down, no matter how hot the girl is.</p><p>\u201cShit, I better go see what that was about,\u201d Finnley states quietly, pulling away from me.</p><p>Grabbing her hand, I bring her back towards me. \u201cLeave it alone for now, babe. This is your night and I don\u2019t want anything ruining it. We\u2019ll deal with those two later.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, looking off in the direction Phina went for a few seconds before turning to face me. \u201cHave you seen all the people who showed up tonight? This is insane.\u201d</p><p>Her hand starts to move back up to her ear as she glances around the room but she quickly drops it when she realizes I\u2019m watching her with a huge grin on my face.</p><p>\u201cCan you be serious for one minute? Someone from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is here tonight. The GUGGENHEIM, Collin, the fucking Guggenheim in New York City! I think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d Finnley complains, pressing her hand to her stomach.</p><p>Wrapping my arms around her, I pull her close and kiss the top of her head. It\u2019s almost hard to believe how much has happened since I first saw her again at Slammers all those months ago. After Finnley was released from the hospital a week after the fire, she moved into my house since there was nothing left of her own. While her burns healed, my broken leg mended and she dealt with the bullshit of filing the claims for her homeowner\u2019s insurance, she poured herself into her art. She worked night and day on new pieces and, when I wasn\u2019t helping her light them up in the backyard, she was curled up next to me on my couch coming up with new ideas in sketch pads.</p><p>I kept a close eye on her and swore to myself I wouldn\u2019t let it get to me if she ever showed even an inkling of sadness about Jordan dying in the fire. Regardless of what he\u2019d done and how close he came to bringing us both down with him, I would never fault her for her grief. Seventeen years is a long time to spend with someone and, even though it didn\u2019t end well, I know she had many good years with him and a lot of memories that wouldn\u2019t just disappear over night.</p><p>Every time she woke up screaming in the middle of the night, I\u2019d kiss away her tears and hold her close. Each time she got quiet and stared off in the distance at nothing, I\u2019d kiss the top of her head, reminding her how much I loved her and that I was right here if she needed me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t agree with her decision not go to Jordan\u2019s funeral, but it was hers to make and I didn\u2019t pressure her. It\u2019s not that I expected her to go and cry over his casket, I just didn\u2019t want her to have any regrets. Even though she\u2019s angry and hurt by what he\u2019s done, I don\u2019t want her to look back ten, fifteen, twenty years down the road and wish she\u2019d said good-bye to him.</p><p>I hovered over her that entire day until she finally threw her sketchpad on the table and glared at me.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t find something to do, I\u2019m going to kick your ass. I\u2019m fine, Collin. I have no regrets about not going to his funeral, I swear to you. I don\u2019t need to go to that fucking cemetery and pretend that I\u2019m sad just because people say it will give me closure. I got my closure the day I filed for separation. I\u2019m not going to waste one minute of my life mourning someone who tried to take you away from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seeing her attitude and fiery spirit come back to life was proof enough that she was going to be okay.</p><p>The shock came a month after the fire when I brought in the mail that included Finnley\u2019s, since she had everything forwarded to my address. When I handed her an envelope with Jordan\u2019s parent\u2019s return address in the upper left hand corner, she opened it quickly and with confusion. When she pulled out the letter inside and read through it, she let out a small sob and her hand flew up to her mouth.</p><p>That was the one and only time she ever cried over Jordan Castillo and his family after he died. Even though he made her life hell off and on for seventeen years and came close to ending it with one swipe of a match and his mother did her best to make Finnley feel guilty for all of their problems, at least they did one thing right.</p> <p>Inside the envelope was a letter from Mrs. Castillo. She said she wanted to tell Finnley this information at the funeral, but she understood why Finnley didn\u2019t attend and thought it best to write to her instead of upsetting her with a phone call. The letter explained that they had filed a claim for Jordan\u2019s life insurance policy and that as soon as it came in, every single penny of the $300,000 would be Finnley\u2019s. With Jordan\u2019s never-ending cycle of unemployment, Finnley had just assumed he\u2019d stopped making the payments long ago and even if he\u2019d kept up with them, the money wouldn\u2019t go to her since she\u2019d filed for divorce before the fire and his parents would most likely do everything in their power to keep her from it.</p><p>Mrs. Castillo explained that she and Mr. Castillo had covered Jordan\u2019s payments when he couldn\u2019t make them and never let the policy lapse. Finnley was pissed at first, figuring they were only doing this out of guilt because of what their son had done and that they never took her claims of addiction seriously. When I couldn\u2019t get through to her that she should take the money, I brought in the big guns and called her mother over. It only took a few words from Finnley\u2019s mom to convince her that she should let the Castillo\u2019s do whatever they could to try and make things up to her. Losing a child would be bad enough, but knowing that he almost took several lives in the process would be pure agony. If giving her that insurance money eased some of their guilt, why shouldn\u2019t Finnley benefit from it? She\u2019d suffered enough at the hands of their son and it was time for her to live her life to the fullest.</p><p>With Finnley being off of work for so long to let her burns heal, her bills and those that Jordan left behind were quickly piling up. No matter how many times I told her not to worry about anything and that I would take care of her, she put her foot down. She spent too many years not standing up for herself and it was extremely hard for her to take any sort of handout, even if it was from me. She was fiercely independent and determined to take care of everything on her own and I can\u2019t say that it didn\u2019t make me love her even more than I already did. I just hated the fact that she was still stuck in the same place and not able to fully move forward with her life.</p><p>With that check and the chunk of change she got from her homeowner\u2019s insurance, Finnley was able to pay off every single bill, quit her job and immediately enroll in art school. After a few weeks, her teachers were so impressed with her work that they invited her to showcase some of her art tonight at a local gallery. Every time I look around the room and see one of her gunpowder designs hanging on the walls, my chest swells with pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea to get your mind off of the fact that there are fancy people looking at your art and thinking about buying it,\u201d I tell her as she turns in my arms and slides her hands around my waist. \u201cI saw an empty supply closet next to the bathroom a few minutes ago. How about we see if my twenty-second record can make it down to ten?\u201d</p> <p>She laughs in my arms and stands up on her toes to kiss my lips, peppering kisses along my cheek until she gets to my ear. She runs her tongue along my earlobe and I shiver, my dick hardening in my charcoal dress pants.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to fuck me in a supply closet, Mr. McDaniels?\u201d she whispers in my ear.</p><p>My hands tighten on her hips and I pull her closer so she can feel how much I want to do just that. Turning my head, I whisper the same words I said to her that day outside of her office by the tree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire, Lee.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step back from me, reaching for my hand and tugging me across the room, right towards the supply closet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re not afraid of a little fire then,\u201d she tells me with a smile as she backs into the dark room and pulls me in behind her, flipping on the light as soon as we get inside.</p> <p>I kick the door closed with my foot, wrap my arms around her waist and turn, pressing her back into the wall next to the door. She wraps her legs around my hips and I push myself against her.</p><p>Making quick work of the button and zipper of my pants, I free my cock and slide the thong she\u2019s wearing under her dress to the side. In one quick thrust, I\u2019m deep inside of her welcoming heat, right where I belong. She wraps her arms around my neck and locks her ankles together above my ass. As I begin a slow, pounding rhythm inside of her, my hand skims along her upper thigh. She winces in embarrassment and reaches down to try and remove my hand from her leg.</p><p>\u201cThe scars... don\u2019t, they\u2019re so ugly,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I hold myself still inside of her and look down at her thigh, puckered with scars where they took skin grafts for the patches of second-degree burns on her shins, calves and hips. Running the tips of my fingers all over the red marks on her skin, I lean forward and place a kiss on the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t ugly. Nothing about you is ugly, Lee. These scars are just proof that you\u2019re a fighter and you survived. I\u2019m never going to stop touching them and kissing them and being thankful every single day that you AND your scars are here with me, so you better get used to it.\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head and smiles at me, wrapping her hands around the back of my neck and pulling me closer. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy and I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>I immediately start moving inside of her again, doing everything I can to make her forget her anxiety over wearing a dress for the first time since the fire and the fact that people are right now looking at her art and thinking about buying it to display in their own galleries.</p><p>She has no idea that my own anxiety is threatening to overwhelm me. As I slam in and out of her and bring my hand between our bodies to rub my fingers over her clit, I try not to think about the items in the back pocket of my pants.</p> <p>As she comes hard and fast around my cock and I follow quickly behind her, I try not to allow my nerves to get the better of me.</p><p>I make sure she doesn\u2019t see the tension on my face as we right our clothes or feel how hard my hand shakes as I hold it against her lower back and lead her out the door and back into the main part of the gallery.</p><p>When we\u2019re standing in front of the first design I ever watched her create, I quickly stop and turn around to face her.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed fitting to do this right here,\u201d I tell her with a smile, tilting my head in the direction of the Japanese pagoda art piece that first brought us together so many years ago.</p><p>She looks at me in confusion as I grab both of her hands, rubbing my thumbs across the tops of them.</p><p>\u201cFire brought us together seventeen years ago and fire almost ripped us apart seventeen years later. It left behind a few burns and some scars that will never completely heal, but it didn\u2019t destroy us. Nothing can destroy us, Finnley. It\u2019s been seventeen weeks since I almost lost you. I can handle anything that life throws at me, but I can\u2019t handle even a day without you by my side.\u201d</p><p>Dropping one of her hands, I reach into my back pocket, pull out a folded piece of paper and hand it to her.</p><p>She takes it from my hands, wiping a few stray tears from her cheeks as she unfolds the paper. \u201cIf you\u2019re breaking up with me right now, this is seriously the WORST break-up in the history of break-ups.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle at her and shake my head. \u201cJust read it.\u201d</p><p>She looks away from me and stares down at the piece of paper. I can see the exact moment when she realizes what it is. Her mouth drops open and she gasps. With a little help from her parents and a lot of digging through their attic, they were able to help me put this together and do what I can to make up for the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made. When she looks back up at me, I slowly get down on one knee and hold the other item from my pocket out in front of her: a black velvet box with the lid popped open so she can see the diamond ring nestled inside.</p><p>The note flutters to the ground as Finnley\u2019s hands come up to either side of my face and she stares down at me with tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYes! Absolutely, without a doubt, yes!\u201d she exclaims with a watery laugh before she closes the distance between us and presses her lips to mine. I quickly stand and wrap my arms around her, the crowd that gathered around us erupting into cheers and applause. As I hold her close and we rock back and forth in each other\u2019s arms, I glance down at the note on the floor and smile. </p> </body></html>"]
