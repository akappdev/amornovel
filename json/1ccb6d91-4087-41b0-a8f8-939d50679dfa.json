Surrounded by darkness, two blurry forms crouched before an open safe, hidden behind a large, hinged bookcase. They breathed heavy, working at a feverish pace to find what they had searched for the past months. One of the men froze, and al movement stopped. He leaned further into the safe, using both hands to pul out a thick, leather bound book.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Dear God, that\u2019s it,\u201d Jack whispered.</p> <p>Every corner of the room held a warning. Lit only by the moonlight filtering through the blinds of a single window, antique swords and axes hung on the wal s, bordering hand-painted landscapes of war and death. The air was stale, lacking human lungs to circulate it.</p><p>I had been there many times before, but my hands stil trembled, knowing the panic would begin soon. It was coming, but I couldn\u2019t stop it. It would play over and over like I was stuck in time, in a bad dream\u2014or in Hel .</p><p>Jack\u2019s fingers ran over the branded seal in the center, and looked to his friend.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s her, Gabe?\u201d Jack replied. Gabe nodded slowly, and then Jack continued with a sigh, \u201cThen you know the answer.\u201d</p> <p>Hearing what Jack\u2019s human ears couldn\u2019t, Gabe\u2019s head jerked to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he said, his eyes twitching back and forth as he listened.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>They shoved the documents, artifacts and jewels back into the safe, and the fair-haired man effortlessly pressed the heavy bookcase flat against the wal in an attempt to conceal any evidence of their presence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that now, Gabe! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Jack growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to buy us some time!\u201d</p><p>Their shadows glided over the wooden floor as the men fled the room, and I stepped aside, watching them in silence, knowing their fate.</p> <p>Gabe ran ahead, gun in hand, accustomed to Jack fal ing behind. He waited at the end of the hal for his friend, calculating a way out.</p><p>\u201cThe roof,\u201d I whispered in his ear. \u201cYou always use the roof.\u201d</p><p>A large, warm hand reached out, and Jack was pushed against the wal .</p><p>\u201cWhat are you...?\u201d Jack began.</p><p>Gabe lifted his finger to his mouth, and then pointed to the upper floor. Jack nodded quickly, pushing his tired body from the wal . They bolted down a corridor, tightly rounded a corner, and then launched themselves up the stairs. Both men took two steps at a time, their hands gripping the banister to pul themselves along with each leap.</p><p>\u201cThe roof!\u201d Gabe call ed as many voices echoed below them, none of them human.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes widened when a terrifying shriek came from below. His stride grew longer as he streaked through another door, climbing a second stairway. He heaved a breath of relief. The narrow wal s of crumbling concrete meant the roof was just a few steps away.</p><p>Already at the top of the stairway, Gabe shouldered through an outer door, and ran across the roof to the edge. He looked down, four stories to the road below, and then at his friend. \u201cWe\u2019ve stil got two minutes, Jack. Are you sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I look ambivalent to you?\u201d he shouted, tightly grasping the book to his chest. \u201cI have to find a way to stop it!\u201d</p><p>I frowned. In the past, I had begged my father to leave the book behind. Dozens of trips to this place taught me that Jack and Gabe\u2019s plight would replay exactly the same. Each time I attempted to change the outcome, it just made the end harder to watch.</p><p>Gabe sighed in submission, and then jerked his head to the north, gauging the distance of their escape. \u201cThen it begins.\u201d</p><p>The shrieking grew louder, and Jack closed his eyes. \u201cI have to save her,\u201d he said in a low, grieved voice.</p><p>Jack\u2019s body jerked forward. His tie slapped against his neck, and the wind howled past his ears as he flew through the night sky. It seemed as if the second he had taken flight, he had landed on another roof, four building away. Jack lurched forward with the sudden stop, bending at the waist, making a loud grunting noise as the air was forced from him with the sudden impact. Gabe released him, then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get used to that,\u201d Jack smiled, smoothing out his jacket and tie.</p><p>\u201cI could have let you take the fire escape, Brother, but with those beasts on your tail, only parts of you would have made it to the street,\u201d Gabe said with a smirk. His grin quickly faded when he looked up. \u201cThey are drawn to it. We need more distance.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. A door identical to the one they had escaped from was a few yards away. He yanked open the door, and then Gabe fol owed him down the stairs. After three flights, Jack slowed his pace, and his chest heaved.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Gabe growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d Jack snapped, taking another deep breath before descending the last two flights.</p><p>Just as their exit came into view, the shrieking and snarling grew louder. Jack looked over his shoulder and saw that Gabe had stayed behind, his firearm held closely to his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it. They\u2019re too close.\u201d Gabe breathed.</p><p>\u201cGABRIEL!\u201d An animalistic hiss cried above them. It was one voice, but it was also many.</p><p>Gabe cocked his gun and narrowed his eyes. \u201cGo, Jack. I\u2019ll hold them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to save your daughter, then go!\u201d Gabe yel ed.</p><p>Jack clutched the book to his chest and made his way outside. He burst from the door, and then grasped his knees, unable to catch his breath.</p><p>He leaned against the door and lifted his face to the heavens, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGod help me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The shrieking stopped momentarily before piercing the air again.</p><p>For the first time, Jack looked into my eyes. He was afraid, something I'd never seen before. It felt strange at first, as though he shouldn\u2019t have been able to see me. I watched a familiar look of resolve paint his face. \u201cI\u2019m going to save you, Nina.\u201d</p><p>As if he\u2019d never spoken to me, Jack's eyes darted in every direction to determine the best route of escape.</p><p>Just as he had made his decision to flee, the wood splintered behind him, and dozens of long, clawed hands exploded through the door. Jack\u2019s eyes widened in terror as demons grabbed at his chest, his legs, his neck, and face. The sharp nails shredded his shirt, and sunk into his skin; blood spil ing from his open wounds.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d he screamed. His flesh ripped under the pressure of the long talons grating across it.</p><p>His arms and legs were thrust forward, and then his body bent in half and disappeared, sucked into the hel that awaited him inside.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d I screamed into the darkness.</p><p>Hands held my outreached arms and I slapped them away. \u201cNo! NO! Daddy!\u201d I wailed, trying to get away. I wasn\u2019t strong enough.</p><p>\u201cNina, stop! It\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>As reality sank in, I stopped fighting. Jared sat next to me in our bed, holding my wrists against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d he said, leaning over to flip on the lamp.</p><p>My eyes squeezed shut, rejecting the light. Sweat soaked my cotton gown, and damp hair matted against my forehead. With trembling fingers, I wiped the wet strands from my face. It always took a few moments to calm myself, but it wasn\u2019t fear this time. I was angry.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting worse,\u201d Jared said, concerned.</p><p>I had to clear my throat. \u201cThey\u2019re so real,\u201d I whispered. I could stil smell my father\u2019s cologne, and the screeching stil rang in my ears. Returning to the same place almost every night to watch my father die felt like torture. Resentment replaced the fear, and that was a good thing; I felt better equipped to handle anger then the overwhelming helplessness that normal y woke me.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>I licked the salt from my lips. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the third one this week. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re okay,\u201d Jared said, his face tense. \u201cSame one?\u201d</p><p>Reluctant, I nodded. Jared worried obsessively each time he had to wake me from a nightmare. He was tormented by the screaming, the trembling, and the inability to stop it. He watched me for a moment before pul ing me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a shrink, Jared. They\u2019re just dreams,\u201d I said, more to myself than to him.</p><p>He pul ed me with him, resting his back against the headboard. I worked to relax. My days without him the previous spring had been good practice when I didn\u2019t want to bother him with my ridiculous human fears and feelings. But I struggled after the nightmares, even after months of perfecting my talent.</p><p>I tried to think of anything but the terrifying image of my father being torn to shreds, so that I could settle down and fal asleep. Jared\u2019s feverish chest against my cheek was comforting, and I breathed in his amazing scent. Any other time I would have instantly felt at ease, but after the three- peat of the worst nightmare I\u2019d ever had, it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d I said, abruptly peeling off the blankets tucked around me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the morning, Nina. You have to get up in three hours anyway for work. Why don\u2019t you just try to sleep?\u201d</p><p>I scooted to the edge of the bed, and planted my feet on the floor with my back to Jared. \u201cHave you slept?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>After a short pause, he let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no reason for me to go back to sleep. I don\u2019t want to sleep, anyway. It\u2019s the same thing every time I close my eyes.\u201d I waited a moment, and when Jared failed to argue, I pushed myself off the bed and walked into the bathroom.</p><p>The pipes whined when I turned the shower knobs, and I stood in front of the sink waiting for the water to warm. The visions from my dream burst in short, loud scenes. The screeching, the sound of my father\u2019s shoes running up the stairs; it wouldn\u2019t stop. Closing my eyes, trying to focus, I rubbed my hands with my face and then looked in the mirror. My features had changed from when Jared and I first met. Spending much of the summer indoors while my leg healed had left my skin pale and lifeless, and I was sporting a matching pair of purple circles under my eyes.</p><p>Our near-death experience in the restaurant seemed like a lifetime away. Aside from the occasional news story about the police department\u2019s finest meeting untimely ends in bizarre and unrelated accidents, our days went by as if Grahm, and Shax, and the book had never existed.</p><p>I let my nightgown drop to the floor, and then stepped into the shower, sighing as the stream of water poured over my face.</p><p>Jared walked in, and leaned against the sink, crossing his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared shifted uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s you I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fal semester is getting ready to start. I have extra classes, and with my internship, it\u2019s probably just stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Jared said. \u201cIt\u2019s been months since any of... them have come around. This is the least I\u2019ve seen of them in my entire life, and yet you\u2019re...,\u201d Jared rubbed his neck. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for you to be having these dreams now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, people have nightmares al the time without demons present. It doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d I said, scrubbing shampoo into my hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cOh, c\u2019mon. You\u2019re blowing this out of proportion. If I promise to quit having the dreams, wil you promise to quit freaking out about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l promise to quit having the dreams,\u201d Jared repeated, his voice thick with sarcasm.</p><p>I poked my soapy head from the shower curtain, lather dripping down my face. \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t promise, but you\u2019re giving me a complex. Unless you know something I don\u2019t, they\u2019re just dreams.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled, and wiped the line of soap from my forehead, promptly kissing my lips. \u201cOkay. They\u2019re just dreams.\u201d</p><p>I nodded in approval, and then closed the curtain. \u201cI have to stop by the office today, do you mind?\u201d I asked, knowing he would.</p><p>\u201cYou mean more than any other day?\u201d</p><p>Escorting me to Titan Mercantile was just another day at work for Jared, but as often as I asked him to come in, it had become an inside joke between us. Every day I asked, and every day he politely declined. For years the hal s of Titan Mercantile were walked by Jared\u2019s father Gabe.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t talk about it, but I assumed his refusal to go in had to do with unresolved feelings concerning his father.</p><p>The hours before dawn crept by slowly, and after my shower, Jared and I spent the remaining moments of twilight at the breakfast table. When the morning sun final y poked through the blinds, I smiled at the glowing light painting rectangles against the wal s. I had spent hours staring at those wal s, waiting for my leg to heal. Beth visited infrequently, busy decorating her new apartment, Kim had taken her summer vacation on the road, and Claire was relentlessly eliminating any threat to us. Jared spent much of his time warding off loneliness, and keeping me entertained. We had grown closer, and life had been more normal than ever. The only reminder of the night I almost died was the scar on my thigh.</p><p>Jared working busily in the kitchen caught my eye, and I listened to the pan pop and sizzle with our breakfast. He placed omelets on the table along with a smal stack of mail.</p><p>\u201cAnything interesting?\u201d I asked as he thumbed through the envelopes.</p><p>Jared paused, eyes narrowing as he read over the handwritten address.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d he said, sliding it toward me.</p><p>The top left corner explained Jared\u2019s expression. It was from Ryan.</p><p>By Jared\u2019s expression, I knew it wasn\u2019t good news. \u201cYou already know, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said, pul ing out a single sheet of notebook paper.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomething you should have told me by now,\u201d I accused, scanning the letter quickly.</p><p>Dear Ni gh, I w anted y ou to hear i t from me, but don\u2019 t k now how to s ay i t, s o I\u2019 m j us t goi ng to w ri te i t.

The numbness was unexpected but welcome; I knew the guilt that would soon wash over me would be unbearable.</p><p>\u201cHe left.\u201d</p> <p>Jared touched my hand. \u201cClaire call ed. He\u2019s doing wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s gone? \u201d I wailed, standing up from my seat. Anger was always preferable to pain. Jared took a step toward me, but I stepped away from him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even let me say goodbye to her! To either of them!\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyebrows moved in. \u201cHe wanted to do this, Nina. You couldn\u2019t have stopped him, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew it was happening,\u201d I said softly. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d The lack of sleep was already wearing on me, and my body felt heavy. I didn\u2019t have the energy to be angry.</p><p>My eyes drifted to the letter on the floor. \u201cThis is my fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNina, no.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI did this. I broke his heart, and he couldn\u2019t stay here,\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI should have left him alone. He\u2019s going to die out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan made his choice,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>His dry tone was hardly convincing. He had a right to be angry, watching his fianc\u00e9 anguish over the man she was meant to be with. To Jared, Ryan being Claire\u2019s Taleh meant that I belonged to someone else, and I used that to drive Jared away when I thought being with him meant putting his family in danger. My bril iant plan had been enough to drive Ryan to join a war halfway across the world. No matter what Jared said, or how much he hated to see me upset, he wasn\u2019t sorry to see Ryan go.</p><p>Angry as I was, the only one to blame was me, and we both knew it.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI have to get going. I have to get those documents faxed by eight.\u201d</p> <p>Jared sighed. \u201cIf I had told you, what would you have done besides worry?\u201d</p><p>I pul ed my purse over my shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, pul ing out my cel phone. I scrol ed through the address book until I found Ryan\u2019s number, and then held the phone to my ear. As I expected, his voice mail immediately answered.</p><p>The sound of his voice made my insides wrench, but when the beep cued me to speak, my temper kicked in.</p><p>\u201cI need you to call me. call me right now, I mean it. I just got your letter and you can\u2019t do this. You just can\u2019t. You\u2019ve got to call me so we can figure this out. Please.\u201d</p><p>Jared took the phone from my hand and let it slowly close. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to get that message, Sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to try,\u201d I said, opening my purse for him to drop the phone inside. \u201cSomeone had to.\u201d</p><p>Jared touched my arm. \u201cHe\u2019s the safest enlisted man in the Army, Nina. He has Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is that going to work, exactly? Has Claire joined the Army?\u201d</p> <p>Jared smiled. \u201cNo. We\u2019ve talked about this. She\u2019s keeps an eye on Ryan the same way we were al owed to train. We have connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jared said, opening the door.</p><p>I didn\u2019t kiss him when I passed through the door, or when he opened the passenger side for me as he always did, or before he left me for the driver\u2019s seat. He didn\u2019t attempt to apologize, which he only did when he felt he was right. Knowing that infuriated me further.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re angry,\u201d he said.</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s lame and you know it. You didn\u2019t tel me Ryan had enlisted in the first place! You didn\u2019t let me say goodbye to Claire! Sorry I\u2019m angry....\u201d I muttered the last words and crossed my arms, settling into an unyielding foul mood. When Jared didn\u2019t reply, I peeked at him from the corner of my eye. He was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThis is not funny, Jared!\u201d</p><p>His mouth immediately flat-lined. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was, you\u2019re just,\u201d he shook his head as he pul ed to the curb of Titan Mercantile, \u201ctrying to be angry, with a series of annoyed expressions on your beautiful face; it\u2019s amusing\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being sorry, and start being...I don\u2019t know! Sorry!\u201d</p><p>A corner of Jared\u2019s mouth rebel ed and turned up slightly before he straightened it again. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door, beyond trying to have an argument with him. At times it was maddening how in love with me he was.</p><p>I took a few steps toward the building and then stop. I returned to the Escalade and sighed. Sheepish, I opened the door. \u201cAre you coming in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>Jared had spent endless hours at Titan Mercantile as a child, and it was his least favorite place to go with his father. It didn\u2019t help that the other employees stared at him as if he were a zoo animal. They couldn\u2019t figure our relationship out, although most of them knew that Jared was Gabe\u2019s son, and my security.</p><p>Seeing Gabe shadow my father was just another day at the office when my father walked the hal s, but now that it was apparent that I needed protection, who also happened to be my fianc\u00e9, it began more than one string of rumors about my family.</p><p>One of my fel ow interns in particular, Sasha, had an immediate interest in Jared. She wasted no time with the saccharine-laced pleasantries; on the contrary, she was downright hateful to me on the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo...Jared....\u201d she began as I walked into the office we shared. She eyed his Escalade from the window as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to do, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe protects you?\u201d When I didn\u2019t answer, she walked over to stand in front of my desk, tapping on it until I looked up. \u201cFrom what?\u201d she said, dubious.</p><p>I glared at her long nails clicking against the wood, and then up at her. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s your boyfriend, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she said, her voice an octave higher.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that, you know, a conflict of interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real y,\u201d I said, thumbing through a stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it. I mean,\u201d she puffed an airy laugh, \u201cI realize you\u2019re the princess of Titan Mercantile, but don\u2019t you feel a little ridiculous when you stand next to him? You\u2019re such an odd couple.\u201d</p><p>Recognizing what she meant, my head jerked up, and my eyes narrowed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Sasha shrugged then, running her finger along the edge of my desk as she slithered around me. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you self-conscious? Women must be throwing themselves at him al the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real y, no,\u201d I snapped as she walked toward the door.</p><p>Sasha smirked, backing away from my glare. \u201cHmm. Very interesting.\u201d Her long, red ponytail flicked as she turned the corner, and I felt the heat radiate from my face.</p><p>On cue, my phone rang.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Jared asked on the other end of the line.</p><p>I covered my eyes with my hand, attempting to calm myself before I spoke. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s...Sasha was just here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That explains it. Is she leaving her coffee mug on your papers, again?\u201d Jared chuckled. For whatever reason, it amused him that the woman got under my skin in such a way that I couldn\u2019t think straight.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNo. She\u2019s...I can\u2019t say what I want to, so I just won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do own the company, you know. You don\u2019t have to work with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m an intern, Jared. And...,\u201d I sighed again, watching her flirt with the human resources manager, \u201cdon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you could slip away a bit early today?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first day back to Brown tomorrow. I thought we could get on the bike and head to the Oak tree, have some lunch....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oak tree...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one I\u2019ve wanted to take you to...where my father took my mother.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThat sounds fantastic, but I have a meeting, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jared said, pretending he\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>I straightened my skirt at the waist, and then pressed the button for the third floor. My entire last day of freedom could have been spent with Jared, but Mr. Patocka asked that the interns come in for one last meeting before school began. Some of them were leaving, and he needed to redistribute responsibilities. I had looked forward to this meeting al week, only because it was Sasha\u2019s last day. That alone was cause to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cInterns,\u201d Mr. Patocka began, looking through the papers in his hand. He always said interns as if it left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnna, Brad and Evan wil be leaving us, leaving Shannon, John, Nina and Sasha with new responsibilities. I would like to say...\u201d</p><p>Mr. Patocka\u2019s words blurred together after I realized he\u2019d put Sasha in the wrong category.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Patocka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Grey?\u201d he said, obviously irritated. I was wel aware that had any other intern interrupted him they would have been promptly asked to leave the meeting, but everyone knew, including Mr. Patocka, that I wasn\u2019t just an intern.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve made a mistake. Sasha isn\u2019t staying,\u201d I said as professional y as I could manage.</p><p>\u201cStil not paying attention to your briefs,\u201d Sasha snapped. \u201cI\u2019m staying on through the school year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, my tone more disgusted than I\u2019d meant. I looked to Mr. Patocka, who nodded while looking incredibly bored with the turn the conversation had taken.</p><p>\u201cI...she....\u201d I stumbled over my words, trying to think of a way to save face after I\u2019d made it so clear that I was shocked and dismayed at the news.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nina. We stil get to be office mates,\u201d Sasha purred. Her smile was that of a cat being polite to the bird just before she ate it.</p><p>\u201cMoving on,\u201d Mr. Patocka continued. \u201cSasha, you\u2019l be taking over Brad\u2019s duties, Shannon, you\u2019l be taking over Anna\u2019s duties, and John wil be taking over Evan\u2019s. I expect those departing to make sure those staying behind have exact instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Nina?\u201d Sasha said, glaring back at me over her shoulder.</p><p>Mr. Patocka sighed. \u201cNina wil be training with Grant during the school year, Sasha. Try not to make me feel as though I\u2019m babysitting more than I already do, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Grant?\u201d Sasha groused.</p><p>Grant was second in command at Titan. When Jack died, he assumed the management responsibilities until I was ready to take over. Working with him was not something I looked forward to; I had spent my teenage years watching Grant suck up to my father and, to Jack\u2019s amusement, shamelessly flirt with me.</p><p>Jack saw something in Grant that I couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014see. Not only did he give Grant promotion after promotion, he tirelessly tried to persuade me to go out with his up and coming, incredibly intel igent, star employee.</p><p>While being within five feet of Grant usual y made me a bit nauseous, Sasha had been scheming to land a job as his assistant since her first day.</p><p>Mr. Patocka\u2019s decision to place me in the very position she\u2019d been working for al summer would no doubt push her beyond any irritation she\u2019d had for me before.</p><p>I smiled at the thought. This would mean an al -out war.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, Sasha?\u201d I asked, trying to preserve a bit of respect from my future employees.</p><p>\u201cProblem? Not at al ,\u201d Sasha said with the sickeningly sweet laugh that liberated her from most awkward situations she\u2019d created for herself. \u201cI apologize, Nina. I didn\u2019t realize you were so sensitive,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>I looked to Mr. Patocka. \u201cAre we finished here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished with the meeting, but I need you to come to Grant\u2019s office with me, Nina. He needs to brief you on a few things before you start back next week.\u201d</p><p>The other interns filed out of the room, shaking hands and saying their goodbyes. I nodded to each of them as they made a bee-line to the elevator, but not before meeting Sasha\u2019s cheap grin with one of my own.</p><p>Mr. Patocka escorted me down the hal and into the elevator, punching button four, where my father\u2019s office stil resided. Grant\u2019s office was on the opposite side of the floor, paral el to Jack's. Half of his wal s were covered in degrees and pictures of polo ponies, and the other half al owing the sunshine to pour in from large windows that overlooked Fleet Rink.</p><p>Mr. Patocka knocked on Grant\u2019s half-opened door. \u201cEr...Mr. Bristol? Nina\u2019s here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her in.\u201d</p><p>I walked into his office, sitting in a puffy green chair, feeling amiable for a change. Grant had worked for my father for ten years, and like every clich\u00e9 rise-to-the-top story, Grant started at entry level. The only thing that would have made his story any more boring would be if he\u2019d began in the mail-sorting trenches, had we kept a mail room. But Grant didn\u2019t begin his days at Titan as a mail boy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He began as an intern.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Grant greeted me over his thin, square glasses.</p><p>\u201cGrant,\u201d I acknowledged with a nod.</p><p>Grant looked at Mr. Patocka and smiled politely. \u201cThank you, Eugene.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Patocka ducked from the door and shut it behind him. Even though I saw Grant as somewhat of a weasel, the rest of the employees regarded him as their personal savior.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s with al the formalities, Grant?\u201d I said, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Peanut,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>He sat in his chair, leisurely crossing his ankles on top of his desk. I frowned at his ridiculous argyle socks. They resembled the very thing I hated about Grant Bristol. He was handsome in an annoying, maddening way. His light, brown hair and clean-shaven baby face made most women at our office swoon. He was wel dressed and wel spoken, and I suppose he was even funny at times. Al of which made me want to plant my fist straight into his square chin. He reminded me of the token soap opera star. His words were fake, his smile was fake, and his very presence affected me like nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>\u201cUgh...you know I hate it when you call me that,\u201d I groaned. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to work together you\u2019re going to have to stop that, Grant. I mean it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything you say.\u201d He smiled with his too-straight, too-white teeth. \u201cI want you here when you\u2019re not in class. If I could do it, you can do it. No excuses.\u201d</p><p>Attempting to keep my temper in check, I stood and offered a smal grin. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing...,\u201d Grant said. I turned and waited. \u201cNice skirt, Peanut.\u201d</p><p>I stomped out of Grant\u2019s office, trying not to kick anything on my way out. When I pushed through the front door, I saw Jared\u2019s Escalade parked against the curb across the street as usual, only this time he stood against his door looking extremely uncomfortable while Sasha leaned against his car on her shoulder, not six inches from him. I could see that he was trying to be polite as he kept his arms crossed, careful not to react to her flirtation, but my eyes zeroed in on Sasha giggling and touching his shirt, chest and arms with every other word.</p><p>\u201cNina! Hi, Sweetheart.\u201d Jared said, my interruption a relief. He pul ed me into his arms and made a show of planting a kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nina,\u201d Sasha gushed. \u201cI was just tel ing Jared that we should double date sometime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped, my patience far beyond its limit. Jared walked me to the passenger side and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI can get into the car on my own,\u201d I said acerbical y.</p><p>\u201cNina....\u201d Jared smiled, amused at my mood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Nina me,\u201d I said, looking straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d Sasha call ed from the other side of the SUV, raising her eyebrows. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you on Monday. It was nice to final y have a chance to talk, Jared.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Sasha\u2019s final attempt for his attention, Jared watched me for a moment, trying to decipher my emotions. Final y, he walked around to his side, and slid in beside me. He watched Sasha trot across the street and then shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t honestly think I was\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think you were flirting with her,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Jared pul ed away from the curb and nodded. \u201cGood, because that is completely ridiculous. Not only am I madly in love with you....she\u2019s....\u201d</p> <p>Jared shook his head, making a series of disgusted faces as he tried to think of the correct description. \u201cShe\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a word for it,\u201d I said, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cHow was your meeting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept tabs, but it was difficult to get the details with Sasha two inches from my face. Is Grant stil a jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jared paused a moment and then his eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Jared said, trying not to smile.</p><p>I shook my head, watching the trees pass by the window. Eli had once told us that when we made a commitment in a physical way, Jared\u2019s senses concerning me would be heightened. I stil wasn\u2019t sure what that entailed. Jared never let on that anything had changed, but when his former urgent curiosity about the motives behind my moods or feelings had al but disappeared, I knew something was different. I cornered him on more than one occasion to explain his new attunement, but he always seemed to maneuver his way out of the conversation with an efficient and irresistible diversion.</p><p>\u201cDo we stil have lunch plans?\u201d I asked, my attention stil focused on the passing landscape outside the window.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I have a surprise for you,\u201d Jared said, taking my hand and pul ing it to his mouth.</p><p>My mood quickly changed as the warmth from his lips shot up my arm. \u201cI love surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said against my skin.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Gone</p><p>\u201cCarved your name. In a tree? That\u2019s so sweet!\u201d Beth squealed.</p><p>\u201cYes, in a tired, done-three-bil ion-times kind of way,\u201d Kim droned, unimpressed.</p><p>I ignored her, smiling at Beth. \u201cHe brought me to a field that had a lone Oak tree in the center. We rol ed out a blanket for the picnic lunch he packed. It was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d Kim said, elbowing me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, briefly glancing to the menu hanging from the ceiling. \u201cLarge coffee. Black.\u201d The girl behind the counter nodded, and punched the buttons on the register, waiting for my check card. I nudged Beth. \u201cDid you want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not today.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cSHe\u2019ll have a Large Skinny Mochachino, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I didn\u2019t want anything,\u201d Beth said, feigning annoyance. \u201cAnd since when do you drink your coffee black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have our morning coffee talk on the first day of school without coffee,\u201d I said, \u201cI know things are tight for you and Chad right now. Moving is expensive. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a mooch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthern hospitality. Isn\u2019t that what you call it?\u201d I winked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Yankee,\u201d Beth muttered.</p><p>The girl turned to make our drinks, and Beth leaned in. \u201cSo the tree....\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThe carving was amazing. Bril iantly detailed. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. He walks me to the other side, and his parents initials were carved there, too, from like...years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Beth shrieked. She looked around, settling down before her next question. \u201cSo have you guys set a date? For the wedding?\u201d</p><p>I looked down. \u201cEr...no. But it was a nice lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nice lunch?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWel , that\u2019s a first,\u201d Beth teased.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to guess why Jared\u2019s questions about a wedding date had tapered off\u2014he was worried about the nightmares, and he didn\u2019t want to make them worse. I knew Jared wanted to set a date. As the weeks passed and I was stil reluctant to discuss it, he had begun to get anxious.</p><p>Once the sleepless nights began, the wedding was the farthest thing from his mind.</p><p>We took a spot by the window, and updated each other on our summers. Beth and Chad had cut back on their hours at their jobs because of the fal semester. Money was scarce, but they were enjoying playing house. Kim had traveled to see family, but returned early.</p><p>\u201cMy dorm room missed me,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get them to let you in?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cI have the gift of persuasion,\u201d Kim said, rubbing her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cSo you traveled most of the summer, didn\u2019t work, and you had enough money to bribe the powers that be at Brown University?\u201d I asked. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cI robbed two banks and a liquor store on the way to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d I said, taking another sip.</p><p>\u201cSo Ryan\u2019s in the Army?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cKim, Jesus,\u201d Beth said, shaking her head.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWrote me a letter, and just popped in the mail on his way to war. Like it was nothing. Like a freakin\u2019 birthday card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a post card,\u201d Kim added.</p><p>\u201cWith soldiers on it,\u201d Beth said. She looked down, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cWith green and black faces, and big guns,\u201d Kim smiled.</p><p>Beth waited a moment, and then spoke again. \u201cIn camo speedos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying on a hammock on the beach, with \u2018Greetings from War\u2019 in big, yel ow, bubble letters,\u201d I frowned.</p><p>Beth giggled before making a poor attempt at a straight face. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely my fault. I should have stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s smile disappeared. She touched my arm. \u201cNigh, you didn\u2019t know to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I sure didn\u2019t,\u201d I said under my breath, knowing Jared could hear.</p><p>We tossed our empty cups into the trash before making our way to campus. The walk seemed longer than the years before. I remembered walking down the same street, wondering if I would run into Jared, hoping I could steal another moment with him. A smile touched my mouth as I looked behind us. The Escalade was parked across the street, half a block away.</p><p>So much had changed since I sat on the park bench. Life had gone from bad to worse, to wonderful to unbelievable, and now my days were as mundane as any other col ege sophomore. If only I could close my eyes without seeing my father, but that was asking for too much.</p><p>Beth would steal a peek at me now and then. Final y my curiosity outweighed my aversion to her lengthy explanations.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Beth. Do I have something on my face?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA booger,\u201d Kim said without expression, pointing to my nose.</p><p>\u201cI have a booger on my nose?\u201d I gasped, my hand flying up to cover it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Beth smiled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve had much sleep, is al .\u201d</p><p>My hand didn\u2019t leave my face without wiping my nose a few times, and then I made a face at Kim. \u201cI haven\u2019t, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d Beth persisted.</p><p>\u201cBad dreams,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cJust a guess. What are they about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly Jack.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s mouth slipped to the side, and then she frowned at Kim with disapproval. Kim didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d Kim said.</p><p>I scratched my head and watched for traffic\u2014stal ing, of course, uncomfortable with the direction the conversation had turned.</p><p>\u201cJust the way he died. But it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d Kim prodded.</p><p>Beth stopped mid-step. \u201cGeez, Kim! Knock it off already!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes talking about it can help, Nina,\u201d Kim said, ignoring Beth.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d I said, looking up the aged brick of the business building, \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys at lunch.\u201d</p><p>Class was endless. My mind fil ed with thoughts of Sasha, Jared, and Claire waiting in the unforgiving desert sun to save Ryan from himself. As time wound down, I felt more and more angry. Guilt fol owed me everywhere I went, and the lack of sleep left me irritated. By the time class dismissed, I pushed through the door, paying no attention to the flabbergasted looks of the students I shoved past.</p><p>Kim stopped me in my tracks. \u201cWhoa!\u201d</p><p>A few breaths were necessary before I could speak. \u201cSorry...I was...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClass was that bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I said, rubbing my temple where it had met with Kim\u2019s bony shoulder.</p><p>Kim looked down the hal , and then back at me. \u201cOkay. What\u2019s going on with you? You\u2019re not yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired,\u201d I said, sliding by her to escape down the stairs.</p><p>On the Greens, the closest bench took the brunt of my anger when I slammed my backpack into it before sitting down in a slump. My next class was in ten minutes, and I had no motivation to listen to the monotonous rules and itinerary.</p><p>The students passed, chuckling and chattering with the energy expected on the first day of school. The summer sun was already too warm for the early hour, and with no breeze, I could feel the beads of sweat forming between my clothes and the wood. Campus didn\u2019t feel like home, anymore. I felt years from the giggles and laughter I shared with my friends, sitting at lunch, and coffee shops, and the pub. My mood grew worse, and I refused to budge from my bench.</p><p>And then he sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cWarm day, huh?\u201d he asked without looking in my direction.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the bus?\u201d he asked, peeking at me from the corner of his eye.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI let it drive away so the love of my life could save me with a cab ride.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to make this okay, Baby. Ryan...the dreams...we\u2019re going to figure this out.\u201d He took me under his arm, and then pressed his lips to my forehead. I let myself melt into his body, and the anger gradual y slipped away. Backpack in hand, he gently tugged my fingers. \u201cMay I walk you to class?\u201d</p><p>A quick nod from me prompted a slow pace across campus. We walked in silence, but he squeezed my hand intermittently to encourage me along. It didn\u2019t feel right to be there without Ryan\u2019s smiling face. The thought of nights at the pub or study group only being a reminder to everyone of his absence\u2014and why he left\u2014was discomforting to say the least.</p><p>The day was long, but I muddled through it. Jared drove me to the office after classes, and dealing with Grant, mountains of paperwork, and training took my mind off darker thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re moving you today,\u201d Grant said with his bright smile and deep dimples.</p><p>\u201cMoving where?\u201d I asked, wondering what else I could possibly train for. I had been in every department of the company, and had just begun the managerial training. In truth, I had mastered everything Grant could do long before my internship, and could do it better. I had excel ent rapport with the clients, and because of my hard work over the summer, the employees had embraced me. Short from sending me overseas, there was nothing I hadn\u2019t seen.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d Grant nodded.</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn around. I knew where he was gesturing. He was moving me to my father\u2019s office, the one space in the entire building I had avoided.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to do that, yet,\u201d I said, trying to mask my unease.</p><p>\u201cNina, you\u2019re the CEO of this company. It\u2019s time you took the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hurry, Grant? Are you looking to retire?\u201d I asked, fidgeting with my blouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to run the company, but you can\u2019t gain respect from the staff filing downstairs with the interns. Solidify your position with your employees before you graduate and take over.\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened and Sasha appeared, gliding a tube of lip gloss over her too-bright lip stick. \u201cGrant, a package for you was sent to our office by mistake,\u201d she said, handing him the large, paper envelope. \u201cI saw a shirt exactly like that on a homeless woman this morning,\u201d she said, staring at me with repugnance. \u201cThere are better places to shop than the community thrift store, Nina, real y....\u201d</p> <p>I looked down and then back at her, suddenly open to the idea of changing offices. \u201cSasha, glad you\u2019re here. Grant wants me to take my father\u2019s office. I\u2019ll leave you in charge of transferring my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...?\u201d Sasha looked to Grant for indemnity, but he raised his eyebrows expectantly. Her expression scrol ed through several emotions ranging from shock, anger, to defeat, then final y turned on her heels. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that right away,\u201d she said through her teeth.</p><p>Had I slept the night before, my mood would have soared, but I simply looked at the door of my father\u2019s office and sighed.</p><p>Grant patted my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned it, Peanut. And if it makes you feel better...I like the shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, sliding from his touch.</p><p>Carl from maintenance exited the elevator, and passed by with a tool bag, a bucket, and a squeegee. He stopped at my father\u2019s office door and peered at the black block letters on the glass.</p> <p>Jack Grey CEO He pul ed a box knife from his pocket, and began scratching at the letters.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d I yel ed. Carl froze, and I hurried to the door, smoothing out the Y of my father\u2019s name. \u201cLeave it,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019m,\u201d Carl said, clearly rattled. He shot a glance to Grant, and then left the way he came.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I assumed you\u2019d want your name on your door. I thought you\u2019d like it,\u201d Grant said.</p><p>\u201cThey can both fit,\u201d I said. \u201cJust put my name under his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d Grant said, his expression matching his tone.</p><p>I pressed the button to the first floor, and then leaned against the back wal of the elevator. \u201cToo much for one day,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Above the door, the number one lit in a soft glow, accompanied by a pleasant dinging sound. The double doors spread open, and I squinted from the sunlight penetrating through the glass wal s of the lobby. To my surprise, Jared stood at the revolving door.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a lot for you today. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, remembering my whispers in the elevator.</p><p>He let me lean against him as we walked to the Escalade hand in hand. The gul s seemed particularly loud, call ing to each other along the harbor.</p><p>The breeze brought in the sweet stench of fish and motor oil. The sounds and smell s surrounding Titan always reminded me of my father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder I\u2019m having the dreams,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat dreams?\u201d Jared teased.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cComing here everyday, being around everything that embodies what I remember about Jack. It\u2019s not some supernatural mystery. I\u2019m just surrounded by him.\u201d</p><p>Jared replied only with a thoughtful nod. He was careful to avoid the subject during the ride home, sticking to the weather and happenings at Brown. Once we reached the loft, he was al to eager to start preparing dinner, so I left him to his thoughts and ran a bath in the downstairs tub.</p><p>After lingering far too long in the cooling water, I wrapped my towel around me and opened the door, noticing only one plate of food. Jared was in the corner, dripping with sweat.</p><p>\u201cYou ate without me?\u201d I asked, sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cI didn't want to disturb you,\u201d Jared said, grunting with the massive amount of weight above him.</p><p>Jared was hiding something, and his behavior told me it was probably something I didn't want to know.</p><p>I finished my dinner and started the dishwasher, and then made my way up the stairs. I slipped on my night gown and crawled into bed beside Jared. He was reading, and put his book down long enough to kiss my forehead. I relaxed, trying to think peaceful thoughts. Wondering if I would wake up screaming wouldn\u2019t help to keep the dreams away, so I forced my mind in the direction of Jared and our Oak Tree.</p><p>\u201cNo studying tonight?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cTest is Monday. I\u2019m too tired tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cMom call ed today. Bex\u2019s coming home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>A yawn interrupted my response, but I spoke in spite of it. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited him over for dinner. I thought I could whip up a pot roast.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, drifting off. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Just as Jared kissed me goodnight, I fel , dropping thousands of feet to a dusty, wooden floor. Landing face down, my palms flat to the ground, I hesitated to move until I was sure of my surroundings. It was dark and quiet, except for the subtle disruption of the rustling of papers. I turned my head, struggling to focus two shadows on the floor; two hunched figures desperately searching.</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not moving,\u201d I said, bal ing my hands into fists. \u201cI won\u2019t watch.\u201d</p><p>The rustling stopped, and Gabe whispered the warning to my father. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t watch you die tonight,\u201d I said, gritting my teeth.</p><p>Jack and Gabe escaped with their book, and I sat on my knees. The shrieking echoed through the hal s, and my heart beat faster. I stood, determined to stay, focused on the room I was in, trying to ignore the fiendish and frightening noises growing louder as they closed in. It was my dream. I would stay.</p><p>The room blurred, and time pul ed me away. My stomach tugged, and then I was gone, violently thrust to the roof. Gabe took my father in his arms and leaped with transcendental strength to the site of my father\u2019s brutal end. Once again I refused to move, locking my knees in place. The tugging began, but my feet remained on the ground.</p><p>Just then, countless shadows swept past, traveling with such momentum that my hair blew forward, as if two trains were passing at ful speed on each side of me. The sounds that came from the shadows were indescribable, so loud that my hands automatical y cupped over my ears. I screamed aloud to try to drown out the evil that saturated the space around me.</p><p>Then it was gone.</p><p>I waited. Sounds from the street below replaced the deafening roar of Shax and his minions, and my knees buckled, letting my body fal to the ground.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d I whispered, knowing no one could hear.</p><p>My breathing accelerated. The air seemed too thin, and the tugging began again. \u201cNo,\u201d I pleaded, just as a hole opened up beneath me. I fel , landing on the wet cement of the al ey.</p><p>A pair of familiar shoes stood before me, and I fol owed the tailored suit with my eyes to the face of my frightened father. His hands were wrapped around the book, his knuckles white. I closed my eyes, waiting for what would come next. The sounds of hands exploding through the door, and the audible shredding of Jack\u2019s clothing and skin were much more vivid when I refused to watch. The bones of his spine snapped as demons yanked him through the hole in the door, and into the building to his brutal death.</p><p>I cried out. Not so much a scream, as a low, guttural moaning, sobbing for my father. The al eyway quaked, as if the earth below was trembling in the presence of such evil. Dark turned to dim light, and I focused as Jared\u2019s warm hands shook me awake.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d he said, holding my cheeks in his hands, waiting for me to look him in the eye.</p><p>Once again soaked in my own sweat, I tore my nails from my palms, stil clenched from trying to force myself to stay in one place. Jared looked down, and then left for only a moment, bringing back two rags.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Nina,\u201d he choked out.</p><p>The white towels hid the four tiny, half-moon gouges in each hand, but quickly revealed the damage as they began to turn red.</p><p>Jared placed another rag, this one wet and cold, on my forehead, wiping away the sweat and tears. My eyes felt swol en and tight. Although the dream was over, I couldn\u2019t stop crying. Jared\u2019s expression was heart breaking. It was the same expression he had when he let go of my hand in the emergency room, as if I were dying before his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fix this,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping,\u201d I said, my voice raspy and faint. I left the bloody rag on the blanket, and touched my hand to his face. Too tired to hold up my own arm, it fel to the mattress. Streaks of blood marked Jared\u2019s cheek, prompting me to turn my hand palm-up to see the oozing tears in my flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that,\u201d Jared said, reaching under the bed to fetch the first aid kit.</p><p>My head rested against the headboard as he tended to my wounds, kissing my fingers when he finished each hand.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sweetheart?\u201d he said, thick with agony.</p><p>\u201cWould you make some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>He left me alone, rushing down stairs. I looked down to my red-stained hands, and then to the clock. It read three-thirty. Rubbing my eyes, I struggled to block out the shrieking that stil rang in my ears.</p><p>Jared returned with a steaming mug of dark, bitter caffeine. He sat beside me on the bed with renewed hope. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, careful y passing the cup to me, \u201clet\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d My answer caught him off guard. It took him a moment to recoup. \u201cNina, there has to be a reason for this.\u201d</p><p>I took a sip and sighed. \u201cI told you. I\u2019m at Titan every day. I\u2019m surrounded by Jack and memories for hours at a time. Think about it. The dreams didn\u2019t start long after I started my internship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t add up, Nina. You should be comfortable being there by now. The dreams should lessen, not get worse.\u201d</p><p>An attempt at rational thought proved futile. My mind was clouded by fatigue, and it didn\u2019t take long grow frustrated and give up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted. But, let me try. Tel me about the dream.\u201d Jared smiled when I conceded with a sigh. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was different this time. I tried to control it and let it happen without me being there to watch, but it kept pul ing me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pul ed you back?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The dream? I would stand stil and concentrate on staying in place, and then I would get pushed to the next scene. But once...I stayed for a while. I saw something I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked, anxious to find answers.</p><p>\u201cThe d\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared said, firmly interrupting me.</p><p>Nodding with understanding, I continued, \u201cI stayed behind. Gabe and Jack jumped to the next building like they always do, but this time I stayed on the roof, and the Others, they surrounded me. Dozens of them, hundreds of them\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014they surged past me.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, stil waiting for an epiphany.</p><p>\u201c...and then I fel through a hole, and I landed in the al ey. I didn\u2019t watch this time. I kept my eyes shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe noises were just as bad.\u201d</p><p>He waited for something to come to him. Thoughts were clearly racing through his mind as he methodical y checked off each scenario, each possible explanation, and then went on to the next. Frustration scrol ed across his face and he stood, walking to the railing that ran along the edge of our bedroom. He looked down to the lower level, squeezing the metal bar so tightly it complained as he twisted his hands back and forth.</p><p>Coffee final y made its way through my body, rushing through my veins. I kicked the covers away and planted my bare feet on the cold floor.</p><p>\u201cMovie?\u201d I asked, but he was lost in thought. In the subdued light, I could see his mouth moving, but he made no sound. \u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>His lips continued to move, and the metal stil whined under his grip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to break the railing,\u201d I said, walking the few steps to reach him.</p><p>He stiffened under my touch. \u201cThey won\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli. Samuel. Anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, his shoulders fal ing. \u201cI can feel how exhausted you are, Nina. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re stil functioning. I can feel the way your body tenses and panics when you\u2019re having the dreams. I don\u2019t want to frighten you, but this is...if you want to believe it\u2019s Titan, okay. But I need to figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m call ing Bex. I\u2019m going to have him come in for a few days while I try to find some answers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a few days, Sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his shirt, panic tightening my throat. We hadn\u2019t been apart for so long, the thought of even a few days without him frightened me. I would feel naked...vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cBut you promised. You promised you\u2019d never have to go away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did. I\u2019m not going away,\u201d he said, touching my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m a phone call away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No...send Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex doesn\u2019t have my connections, Nina. Not yet. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s looking for, he doesn\u2019t know the right questions to ask. I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my weight to one leg, trying to relax and play off my fears. \u201cYou can\u2019t go...you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jared touched the thin skin under my eyes with his thumbs, silently pointing out the darkened circles. Without another word, Jared pul ed his cel phone from his back pocket and dialed.</p> <p>\u201cBex. I need you to stay with Nina for a while.\u201d He snapped his phone shut, keeping his eyes on mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Jared tucked my hair behind my ears. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a few days.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t find anything, I\u2019ll just come back. Forty-eight hours, and I\u2019m right back here. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised you\u2019d never leave me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at my stubbornness. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you. I\u2019m going to work.\u201d</p><p>One side of my mouth turned up and I sighed. Jared leaned in, kissing my forehead with his warm, soft lips.</p><p>The engine of a speeding motorcycle grew closer to the loft, stopping just outside. Within seconds of its silence, a quiet knock came from the door. My smile melted away, and Jared threw a few things in a duffel bag as Bex sprawled out on the couch downstairs.</p><p>\u201cMom wants you to call ,\u201d Bex said, holding the remote in front of him, flipping on the television.</p><p>\u201cKeep it down, Bex. Nina\u2019s going to try to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, angry that he refused to compromise. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep without you. You think I\u2019m exhausted now? Forty-eight hours from now I\u2019m going to lapse into a coma.\u201d</p> <p>His arms encircled me, kissing me once more. \u201cAt least you\u2019l get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to keep the mood of his departure light. Jared didn\u2019t enjoy leaving me anymore than I, but he felt strongly enough about my recurring nightmares to break a promise. That realization only left me more unsettled.</p><p>Jared gently pul ed each of my fingers from his shirt. Imprints of where I had crumpled it between my fingers remained in the fabric, and I hastily ironed it out with the palm of my hands.</p><p>\u201cCome home soon,\u201d I whispered, trying to keep my voice from breaking.</p><p>Jared touched his lips to mine, and then looked to his brother. \u201cBex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot this,\u201d Bex said, lifting his thumb in the air.</p><p>Before my eyes finished blinking, he was down the stairs and out the door.</p><p>For a few moments I felt nothing, but the second air fil ed my lungs, an overwhelming sense of sadness came over me. Jared hadn\u2019t been more than a block away from me since I came to my senses and begged him back last May.</p><p>The bed seemed miles away, but I slowly made my way to it. The moment my backside sunk into the mattress, I heard purposeful stomping up the stairs. Bex ran at me ful speed, jumping up and taking flight, landing precisely one inch away.</p><p>I didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bex said, elbowing me. \u201cDeath Jungle is on. Come watch it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jared going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno...come on,\u201d he said. His voice was already deeper, and he had been tal er than me for several months. If I didn\u2019t know he was stil a kid, I would have thought he was a fel ow col ege co-ed. He stil hadn\u2019t quite fil ed out \u2013the only thing that gave him away.</p><p>He tugged on me to fol ow him downstairs, and I reluctantly agreed, resting my head on the arm of the sofa.</p><p>A ridiculous array of mutilation and mayhem fil ed the screen. Bex watched with unyielding focus, but my eyes struggled to stay open. Shifting to find a comfortable spot, I settled in and let my mind drift into oblivion. In the darkness, with the screams of dying jungle wanderers in the back ground, I somehow stayed away from the dark building and my father.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Four Feet</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Bex asked, holding open the passenger-side door.</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cFine. Don\u2019t tel your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d he said. He took my backpack and threw it in the back as I col apsed into the seat. Within seconds he was beside me, starting the engine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cool,\u201d he said with a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I\u2019m letting you drive is because you completed your driving course at Cleet. If you can out-drive cops, I\u2019m assuming you won\u2019t wreck the only thing I have left of Jack.\u201d</p><p>Bex frowned. \u201cBuzz kil .\u201d</p><p>He pul ed away from the loft, using his blinker and obeying every traffic law along the way. I watched the trees pass, the reds and oranges signaling the arrival of Fal . Jared\u2019s whereabouts lingered in the forefront of my mind, but the wal I had learned to form around my feelings had long been routine. I didn\u2019t want Jared to make a mistake. or get injured because he sensed my anxiety.</p><p>\u201cCoffee shop, Oh-seven-hundred,\u201d Bex reported, pul ing behind Kim\u2019s dilapidated Sentra.</p><p>I shot him a look of disbelief. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared said you were to meet with friends Kim and Beth, to be prompt, and keep watch one block north, with front door in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Bex. Don\u2019t act like a military robot. It creeps me out.\u201d</p><p>Bex smiled. \u201cI just want to do this right.\u201d</p><p>I returned his smile and gave him a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d I said before stepping out onto the sidewalk.</p><p>Shoving my hands in my pockets to ward off the frosty morning air, I walked toward the front door of our favorite coffee place. The green door swung open and shut with patrons coming and going several times before I reached the handle. Just as I walked in, someone ran into me from behind, nearly sending me to the floor.</p><p>A familiar giggle tittered behind me. \u201cGeez, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Beth said, undoubtedly putting forth every bit of her southern charm. \u201cI was trying to catch you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>My brows turned in. \u201cOkay...why?\u201d</p><p>She shoved a piece of notebook paper at me. \u201cThis. Josh got this in the mail yesterday, and he gave it to Chad. It\u2019s from Ryan.\u201d</p><p>I ripped it out of her hand and scanned it. Everything seemed to be fine. He had completed boot camp, and was now in specialized training; something about explosives and being a weapons expert.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s doing wel ! He seems okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, returning the paper.</p><p>Kim shoved me from behind. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you two today?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI saw Beth do it. Looked fun. Can I kick you later?\u201d Kim said, her expression void of humor.</p><p>\u201cNo, you most certainly can not.\u201d I turned to order, craning my neck once more at Kim to prove I was not in the mood for her antics.</p><p>We settled in at our usual table, grumbling about upcoming tests and papers. Beth shared Ryan\u2019s letter with Kim, and complained about cutting back more hours at work, making their cupboards more bare than usual. As Kim and Beth discussed Chad\u2019s foul mood due to his feeling that his man-of-the-house status was at risk, I had an epiphany.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting paid now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBeans,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cWel ...I am the CEO of Titan Mercantile. I need an assistant.\u201d</p><p>Beth immediately perked up. \u201cWhat are the hours? My classes are at quirky times, ya know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I nodded. \u201cIf you can swing at least an hour a day, whenever you can get in, I\u2019ll match the pay you were making this summer. You had a little breathing room then, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s robbery!\u201d Beth squeaked.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Kim snapped. \u201cNina has money to burn. She doesn\u2019t even get paid to work there,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d I interceded.</p><p>Kim continued,\u201cShe\u2019s your rich friend, Oklahoma, take advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have interns for that stuff....\u201d Beth said, shaking her head dismissively.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>After a short moment of thought, Beth\u2019s mouth spread into a wide smile. \u201cReal y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y.\u201d</p><p>She threw herself across the table, wrapping her arms around my neck. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tel Chad! I\u2019m sorry...I have to go!\u201d she picked up her things and took a few steps, turning on her heels. \u201cWhen do I start?\u201d</p><p>I smiled patiently. \u201cWhen can you start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you Monday.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s already broad smile stretched to its limit. She pul ed the door open, walking with renewed energy in her step.</p><p>\u201cPublic displays of generosity make me a little queasy,\u201d Kim deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I did it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d she said, winking. \u201cSo, what do you think about Ryan\u2019s note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wrote Josh and didn\u2019t write me, that\u2019s what I think,\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cNigh....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know. You thought he\u2019d stick around, pine for you for years until he\u2019d final y moved to the mountains, vowing to be a hermit until he died of a broken heart. He was in love with you; he did something drastic. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want him to pine for me. I don\u2019t want him dying because I hurt him, either!\u201d</p><p>Kim watched me for a moment, unaffected by my anger. \u201cYou don\u2019t look as tired today. Did the dreams go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cBut you slept last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Jared left town, and it\u2019s like I fel into a coma or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Kim said. I turned to look at her, but she was staring out the window as if she were searching for something.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, turning to face me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Kim said in her unapologetic way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s no different than any other day.\u201d</p><p>We gathered our things, and then Kim offered to drive me to campus. I nodded in Bex\u2019s direction as subtly as I could, and then yanked on the passenger door of the Sentra. It opened just a crack, and then it was stuck.</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I complained.</p><p>Kim patiently walked around the front of the car, shooing me out of the way. With a light tug, she opened the door without effort, and then returned to her side. We both fel into our seats, and I waited for Kim to go through her routine of a fake Catholic prayer before she started the engine.</p><p>\u201cHow this car stil runs is beyond me. How did it survive your summer road trip?\u201d</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cShe stayed behind. I rented a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? That far? Pretty expensive. How\u2019d you afford it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Kim slowed at a red light, and waited before answering. \u201cI told you, I robbed a few liquor stores on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you,\u201d Kim said, stoic.</p><p>\u201cYou robbed a liquor store. Like with a gun,\u201d I said, dubious.</p><p>\u201cAnd pantyhose.\u201d</p><p>The light turned green, and we rode in silence until we reached campus. Kim helped me with the door, and then we walked together, our first class being in the same building. As we walked, I felt a burning question bubble up inside of me. The answer was potential y something I would forever regret knowing. Regardless, I had to know.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t real y rob a liquor store, did you, Kim?\u201d I said, feeling ridiculous for asking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, turning in the direction of her class.</p><p>I waited in the hal , watching her walk away. I had been so preoccupied with my dreams, I failed to realize Kim\u2019s stories hadn\u2019t added up, and I didn\u2019t catch that she was using her sarcasm to hide something. But hide what? That was al I needed: Something new to obsess about.</p><p>Bex was waiting for me when I walked out to the parking lot, in the same spot the Escalade usual y sat. I was stil twenty feet away when Bex relieved me of my backpack, and escorted me the remainder of the way to the BMW. He watched me for a moment, with his big, blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, opening the passenger door.</p><p>A large, boyish grin radiated from one side of his mouth to the other, and he enthusiastical y commandeered the driver\u2019s seat once more. \u201cJared cal ed, but you were in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted you to be updated the second you were finished. He hasn\u2019t had much luck. A few leads, he\u2019s carrying them out today, and He\u2019ll be home tomorrow night as promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he call me himself?\u201d I asked, unable to clear the venom from my voice. The anger stemmed from the pain of missing him. Ironical y, letting an emotion slip now and then made it easier to control them.</p><p>Bex sighed. \u201cHe misses you. He was afraid hearing your voice would make it worse. He didn\u2019t want you to talk him into coming home.\u201d</p><p>One corner of my mouth turned up, but I quickly subdued it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stop by the office for a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Bex nodded, turning in the direction of Titan.</p><p>The evening consisted of homework and dinner. Bex proved to be an accomplished cook, no doubt learning from Lil ian as Jared did. He whipped up an amazing Pasta Chick Pea Salad, fol owed by Peppered Shrimp Alfredo. I was so ful by the time he served dessert that I didn\u2019t have enough room to ful y appreciate the smal slice of cheesecake he placed in front of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiling me,\u201d I said, leaning back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cI happened to know Jared cooks for you al the time. I\u2019m just trying to continue the lifestyle in which you\u2019ve become accustomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so....\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cAnd I like to cook,\u201d he smiled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder I haven\u2019t gained fifty pounds living with Jared,\u201d I said, taking my plate to the sink.</p><p>\u201cI got these. Go rest,\u201d Bex said, pul ing the plate from my hands.</p><p>\u201cQuit it. It\u2019s fifty-fifty around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can do them faster,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I said, yawning.</p> <p>I trudged up the stairs. Gluttony, in addition to weeks without a proper night\u2019s sleep, left me nearly debilitated. My sluggish arms struggled with the pink striped pajamas I\u2019d managed to pul from the drawer, and once my body col apsed to the mattress, I was unable to open my eyes.</p><p>And then it was morning.</p><p>No Jack, no Gabe, no Shax. I had slept an entire night without a single dream, much less a nightmare. I remembered nothing. A ful night of sleep was less than a memory, and it was strange to feel rested.</p><p>The smell of bacon grease fil ed the air. I bounced out of bed, and trotted to the railing.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep?\u201d I asked Bex, who was bouncing to a tune in his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he call ed. \u201cI was al prepared to tend to your early morning psychotic episodes Jared keeps talkin\u2019 about. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWel , I\u2019m not,\u201d I said, retreating to the shower.</p><p>A night without the dream didn\u2019t make sense. We had been by the office; I had even spoken briefly to Kim about the dreams, and...nothing.</p><p>Whatever it was, I had to believe the nightmares were over. Sleeping al night in Jared\u2019s arms without waking up screaming and soaking the sheets with my own sweat was definitely something to look forward to. I was even more excited for him to come home.</p><p>\u201cDid he call ?\u201d I asked, tightening my belt as I descended the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Cynthia did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Did she say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Nina. Maybe because you haven\u2019t spoken to her in three weeks? She starts noticing when she runs out of charity events to keep her busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said, picking up my phone.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Darling,\u201d Cynthia said before the first ring finished.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy, busy. Why don\u2019t you come over for dinner tonight? I haven\u2019t seen you in...you know I don\u2019t remember? How ridiculous. Come to dinner. Six o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then, Dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was quick,\u201d Bex said, sliding two eggs from the spatula onto my plate.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And it always is. She\u2019s not one for lengthy phone conversations.\u201d</p><p>Bex replied with a nod. He was becoming so much like Jared\u2014not one for many words, but it was obvious what he was thinking just by the slightest change in his eyes. Not that a child of Lil ian\u2019s would be any different, but I was so proud of the man Bex was quickly turning into. He made me feel just as safe as Jared or Claire, and he was one of the kindest people I knew.</p><p>Bex was a constant reminder of the night Shax\u2019s henchmen tried to capture me in Lil ian's home, and the subsequent months I spent without Jared. Every time Bex was around, each time someone mentioned his name, the sound of Harry Crenshaw's vertebrae snapping resonated in my mind. Bex kil ing anyone seemed so impossible, but I knew better than anyone that impossible didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>The ride to Brown was long. Each passing minute of each class was an eternity. Even lunch seemed to drag on. The clock demanded my attention within minutes of the last time I had looked at it. Normal y the irritation surrounding me would be unbearable, but catching up on lost sleep seemed to help.</p><p>\u201cIs that a no?\u201d Beth asked, nudging me.</p><p>\u201cHuh? I said, realizing I had missed a large chunk of the table conversation. We sat in our usual spot at the Ratty, with one chair remaining empty in honor of Ryan\u2019s absence. It was then I noticed a second chair was also empty.</p><p>\u201cI said have you heard from Kim? She wasn\u2019t in American Public\u2019s class. She\u2019s not here. I tried her cel , but got her voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said, glancing around the Ratty. \u201cNot since this morning.\u201d</p><p>Beth frowned, leaning against Chad, as she always did when she was unsettled. \u201cShe never misses class.\u201d</p><p>Our lunch table was relatively quiet after that, making the minutes pass even more slowly, if that were possible.</p><p>The afternoon seemed like an eternity, and by the time Bex dropped me off at the front entrance of Titan, I was crawling out of my skin.</p><p>Sasha seemed the likely target to vent my frustration, but she wasn\u2019t in. Annoyed, I rode the elevator to the third floor, settling on Grant as a second choice.</p><p>\u201cAfternoon, Peanut,\u201d Grant call ed from his office.</p><p>\u201cPiss off.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, I felt better.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t own the company, I would fire you for insubordination,\u201d he said with an amused grin.</p><p>\u201cInsubordination requires disregard of a command. I simply responded to your greeting,\u201d I said, stopping abruptly at my office door.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you had in mind?\u201d Grant asked, shoving his hands in his pockets, oozing with pride.</p><p>\u201cI....\u201d I stumbled over the words, reading the letters once more.</p><p>Nina Grey Acting CEO Jack Grey CEO \u201cIt\u2019s barely dry,\u201d Grant said, teetering back and forth.</p><p>I looked out the closest window, and anywhere else in the room other than the door to hide my expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, pushing past him, and shutting the door before he could speak again.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I let my body melt into the door. The office stil smell ed of mahogany, wood polish and the slightest hint of tobacco. It was as if the room had frozen in time the second he died. I could almost hear him talking loud and authoritative on the telephone.</p><p>I walked across the room slowly, noting the pictures of him with members of Congress, plaques, a coat of arms, and degrees adorned the wal s.</p><p>To my disgust, the large painting of my mother and me stil hung between the two large windows over-looking Fleet Rink.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to have to go,\u201d I said, col apsing into Jack's large, black leather chair.</p><p>The stack of unopened envelopes was my first order of business, and then I read my company emails. Bored as I was, at least it kept my mind from Jared and the time. Just as the sun began to set, my cel phone chirped.</p><p>\u201cHey Bex,\u201d I said through a yawn, \u201calmost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel that\u2019s good news, Sweetheart,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I said, my voice far too high to feign anything but elation. In reaction, I leaned over to look out the window to the street. No black Escalade.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming home tonight, are you?\u201d I said, deflated.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. I wil be home at ten. Is that too late for dinner?\u201d</p><p>The road noise should have given it away, but I had expected to be disappointed. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the road,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cDo I need security clearance for that answer?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll tel you al about it when I get home. Bex tel s me you had a good night\u2019s sleep last night. Is this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. No bad dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to watching you sleep the whole night through, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>My steps were light as I made my way out of the building, and I couldn\u2019t contain my smile when I sat in the passenger seat of the BMW.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Jared,\u201d Bex said with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming home,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe better go move his stuff around and hide his home gym,\u201d Bex smiled, pul ing away from the curb. \u201cHe\u2019ll hate that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of the home gym. I\u2019ll mix up the forks and spoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it covered,\u201d Bex said with an mischievous grin. \u201cYou have dinner plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right,\u201d I said, sinking into the sink with a huff.</p><p>Bex sped to Cynthia\u2019s faster and with more precision than any television car chase I\u2019d ever seen, much less been a part of. He jerked the wheel, and let the Beemer slide, counter-clockwise, into the loft\u2019s paral el parking spot.</p><p>\u201cOne of you wil get pul ed over one of these days, and I\u2019m going to laugh,\u201d I said, trying to steady myself once my feet hit the pavement.</p><p>\u201cOur boss has plenty of money to bail us out,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bail you out. I\u2019ll laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it was Jared?\u201d Bex said, escorting me up the iron steps.</p><p>\u201cEspecial y if it was Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. And if Claire found out about it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019d bail you out,\u201d I nodded.</p><p>I changed clothes quickly, and then fol owed Bex to the Beemer once again, letting him drive like a control ed maniac to my parents' home.</p><p>Arriving within minutes, Bex jumped out of the driver's side to open my door. We traded smal talk as he walked with me up the concrete steps, both of us hoping it would be one of our shorter visits. Just as I reached for the handle, Cynthia opened the door, startling me.</p><p>\u201cMother....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgatha is il today. I\u2019ve barely been able to tend to dinner. Of al days for her to get sick....\u201d Cynthia said, looking uncharacteristical y disheveled.</p><p>Her eyes targeted Bex.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mrs. Grey,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>She nodded politely. \u201cWil you be joining us, Bex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am. Simply covering a shift.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s cold eyes narrowed at him as she held out her arm to usher me into the house.</p><p>\u201cI'l wait here,\u201d Bex whispered.</p><p>\u201cProbably safer,\u201d I mouthed.</p><p>She wasted no time. \u201cAnd where is Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...resting,\u201d I said, cringing at my words. Surely I would be better at lying on the spot by now.</p><p>\u201cHmm....\u201d she said, clearly unconvinced. She didn\u2019t press the issue, I assumed it was because of the fact that I was safe. Beyond that she didn\u2019t bother to question.</p><p>The table had been set, but I helped bring out the soup and salad, and entr\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I always have to ask,\u201d I said, waiting for her infamous scowl.</p><p>\u201cYou're predictable,\u201d she snapped. Her expression soon smoothed as she scanned the table. \u201cI thought I would try something different. Chicken Coconut Soup, and wild mushroom fricassee over Polenta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever that is,\u201d I said, overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cNina, real y. You act as though you were fed take-out your entire life. I have always enjoyed cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never cease to surprise me,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask about Jared\u2019s whereabouts again. We stumbled over the smal talk, and politely discussed the weather. Cynthia hadn\u2019t mentioned my father since I returned home from the hospital. I wondered if she ever would. The residual circles under my eyes were a brief topic of conversation, and then I helped her clean the dinner dishes before saying goodbye.</p><p>\u201cDinner was uneventful?\u201d Bex asked, holding the passenger door of the Beemer open.</p><p>My eyes narrowed at my former home. \u201cShe\u2019s up to something. You\u2019re sure she hasn\u2019t call ed or talked to Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard a word,\u201d Bex shrugged.</p><p>At the loft, I found myself struggling to stay awake to witness Jared\u2019s homecoming. Reality television kept my attention for a while, but I final y trudged up the stairs in defeat.</p><p>\u201cAw...but they\u2019re going to get in the hot tub in a second. The girls get in a cat fight, its funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake me when he gets home,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, El Capitan,\u201d he responded.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to speak foreign languages to me,\u201d I grumbled, fal ing into the bed with my clothes on. My voice wasn\u2019t loud enough to travel to the first level, but Bex could hear, regardless.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t...never mind,\u201d Bex said, too involved in the hot tub disco party to argue.</p><p>Just as I closed my eyes, they popped open again. The alarm clock on Jared\u2019s side read nine-thirty.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Nina?\u201d Bex call ed up. \u201cBad dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. Just that minuscule bit of effort was al I could manage. I hadn\u2019t realized I was so tired, and it was so much easier to fal asleep without the fear of screaming myself awake.</p><p>Ice was beneath me, and my bare toes wiggled against the smooth, shiny whiteness below. That was the only way I was aware it was dream\u2014my feet were warm and comfortable. My father\u2019s office window came into view above me. I was standing alone in the middle of Fleet Rink. Soon my naked feet were adorned with a pair of new ice skates, and Jack stood in the window, smiling down at me. A crowd of people, young and old, circled the space where I stood. Sporting matching red noses, their misty breath puffed out with each word or laugh.</p><p>I waved to him, and he waved back. Pushing forward, I could hear the blade of my skate scratching the surface of the ice. Looking up again, I noticed Jack was no longer smiling. Instead he bobbed in and out of visibility, pacing back and forth in his office, and then I saw Gabe.</p><p>They were arguing.</p><p>Oh no, I thought, feeling the tugging feeling again. No!</p><p>Back in the dusty, stale office, I landed on al fours again. Anger surged through me. My nights were just returning to normal. I wanted to sleep al night in Jared\u2019s arms. I wanted him to see that things were getting better, that I was getting better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this again!\u201d I yel ed, storming Jack and Gabe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They ignored me, repeating the same scripted dialogue from before.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this, Jack?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>My mouth formed around each of Jack\u2019s words. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s her, Gabe?\u201d He paused for Gabe\u2019s answer, and then continued, \u201cThen you know the answer.\u201d I shook my head from side to side as I spoke along with him, copying him like a toddler, angry and snide.</p> <p>A ferocious rage overtook me, and I grabbed the book from Jack\u2019s hands.</p><p>Time stopped. Several times before, I had attempted to physical y interrupt, and failed. Jack, Gabe, and the book were always very real, but when I tried to interfere, they were the consistency of a hologram. This time the book was in my hands.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s head turned up in quick motion to face me, his eyes a solid black. \u201cArs Notoria,\u201d he whispered in a voice not his own.</p><p>The change of events frightened me. I stumbled back, away from my father and his friend. They were frozen in time like everything else in the room. Even the moonlit dust motes were hanging motionless in the air, but I could hear the screeches of the demons as they approached.</p><p>The dimensions of the room stretched, and the wood groaned and creaked. As I worked to keep my feet beneath me, I gripped the book tighter in my hands. The possibility of taking it back with me crossed my mind. It was the only reason I would be able to take it from Gabe.</p> <p>I looked to the large window and closed my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dream,\u201d I said softly, confident the fal would wake me up. Opening my eyes with the Naissance de Demoniac in my hands wouldn\u2019t be the most impossible thing that had ever happened to me.</p><p>In a ful sprint, I bound for the window, bracing myself to leap through the glass and into the night, but before I could, a searing pain spread throughout my hands. I abruptly stopped and threw the book to the ground. Although the leather no longer touched my skin, the parts of my fingers and palms that had been in direct contact with the binding were charred and smoldering. My hands shook violently as the burns traveled up my arms, and I wailed at the intense heat spreading throughout my body; it was as if I were on fire. The sensation was unlike anything I had experienced before, but I couldn\u2019t imagine anything more excruciating.</p><p>The sound emanating from my throat didn\u2019t sound like my own as I protested the torture consuming me. Any moment the demons would come, and I would beg them for death.</p><p>A hole opened up beneath me and I fel . In that instant the pain was gone, and a soft, cool mattress was beneath me. Jerking to a sitting position, I held my arms in front of me. They were peach and unblemished.</p><p>Jared and Bex stood next to the bed with terror in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe was at least four feet above the bed!\u201d Bex said, his eyes wide. \u201cHas that happened before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, his expression exponential y more intense than the agonized look I had been accustomed to waking up to. He was afraid.</p><p>\u201cAbove the bed?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>Bex sat on the bed and watched me for a moment, then took the sheet and wiped the sweat from my hairline. \u201cYou were seriously hovering! It was something straight out of the Exorcist!\u201d</p><p>I hoped for one moment that Bex was being Bex, trying to make light of the situation. Gauging the storms in Jared\u2019s eyes, it was true.</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible? What does that mean?\u201d I said, frightened.</p><p>Jared looked away.</p><p>Bex tugged lightly on my shirt. \u201cSame dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cI was angry...so angry that I took the book from them. It was in my hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried that before and your hands went right through it.\u201d Jared said, his eyes on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNot this time. I was so damn mad that I screamed at them, and then grabbed the book. And then Gabe...he looked at me.\u201d</p><p>Jared knelt beside me, then. I touched his face. He was desperate for guidance from his father. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him,\u201d I warned. \u201cHis eyes were solid black. Like Shax\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Bex shook his head. \u201cHow can that be? If it were d\u2014 them I would have known. The whole time you were stretched out...suspended...there were none.</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d Jared warned.</p><p>\u201cNot a single one,\u201d Bex continued, lost in thought. \u201cThey crowd Mom\u2019s house more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone?\u201d Jared asked. Bex nodded and Jared stood up again, and then began to pace. Final y, he spoke, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can feel them, too,\u201d I said to Jared. His question to Bex puzzled me.</p><p>\u201cI can. Bex is more tuned-in to their presence\u2014more so than any hybrid. His sensitivity to them rivals Samuel\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can tel when they\u2019re even thinking about coming around,\u201d Bex added.</p><p>Bex\u2019s frown instantly alarmed me. My mind raced over every second of the dream, trying to think of something that might help. I wasn\u2019t sure why they were so disturbed, but for Bex in particular, uncertainty was not something they handled wel .</p><p>\u201cArs Notes something,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face transformed from worry to anger. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I searched my memories again. \u201cGabe said \u2018Ars Notary\u2019 or \u2018Ars Notes\u2019...something like that.\u201d</p><p>Bex looked to his older brother. \u201cArs Notoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d I said. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>Jared sat on the edge of the bed and tenderly touched the sides of my jaw, looking into my eyes. \u201cIt means we\u2019re going to have to get a Naissance de Demoniac. And not just any bible. Shax\u2019s. My father is trying to tel us something.\u201d</p><p>My brows pushed together. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not demons doing this to you,\u201d Bex said, seeming vexed.</p><p>\u201cThat leaves one thing,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s Gabe,\u201d I said, horrified.</p><p>Jared pul ed me closer, and then leaned his cheek against my hair. \u201cWe need that book.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Exhaustion</p><p>Coffee shop meetings stopped. Attending bal games ceased. My chair at study group had been fil ed due to my persistent absences. The only friend from school that I kept in contact with was Beth, and that was only because she was my assistant at Titan.</p><p>Fielding her constant questions about my behavior was exasperating, but her help had become indispensable. The dreams were a nightly event, and the sleep deprivation wore on me so much that half of the time I needed Beth to remind me what day it was.</p><p>The nightmares were also wearing on Jared, who left me with Bex every day to search for Shax\u2019s bible. It didn\u2019t take him long to figure out that the second he closed his eyes my nightmares would begin, and minutes later screams would echo throughout the loft.</p><p>A new semester had begun, and stil the dreams came. By Spring Break, Jared grew desperate. Everyday he sought Eli, asked Samuel for help, he\u2019d even taunted Gabriel for an answer, and every time he came home frustrated and empty-handed.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Jared asked, his voice tired.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Once again, our day began at three-eleven A.M. I worked on a few papers, and studied while the coffee stil kept my brain functional. Once the heaviness set in, Jared brewed another pot.</p><p>\u201cAt some point, this has got to be bad for you,\u201d Jared frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t get anyone to tel me anything. I don\u2019t know how our fathers found where Shax kept the book in the first place. Word gets around. They must know what we\u2019re up to. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I had to travel to Hel to get it.\u201d</p><p>Weary of the same dialogue, I rubbed my eyes and nodded.</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m frustrated, and with al the caffeine in your system, it makes me feel a little anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh...I forget about that,\u201d I said, setting my mug on the table.</p><p>The morning sun cast an amber tone against the wal s. Summer was just around the corner. My friends at school were discussing tropical vacations and family reunions, and I was too tired to think about the next hour.</p><p>My cel phone rang, and I fished in my purse to answer. \u201cHey Beth,\u201d I sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim and I are meeting for coffee. Again. Like we do every morning. And you\u2019re invited. Again. Like every morning. Are you going to flake out? Again? Like you do every morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019ve already had a pot of coffee this morning. I\u2019ll see you in class.\u201d</p><p>Beth paused. I could hear a muffled, irritated voice in the back ground. Beth was obviously covering the phone with her hand. \u201cEr...Kim says... Kim wants you to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that\u2019s not what she said,\u201d I frowned.</p><p>After the sound of a scuffle, Kim spoke into the phone. \u201cWe are going to be at the coffee shop in thirty minutes. And you are going to be there, too, or me and the Sentra wil come get you, and you wil ride al the way there strapped to the roof like a freakin\u2019 Christmas tree, you got me?\u201d</p><p>I held the phone away from my ear as she yel ed, and then cautiously held it within talking distance. \u201cI got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Kim said, satisfied.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Beth whispered before ending the call .</p><p>\u201cSounds like your friends miss you,\u201d Jared grinned.</p><p>\u201cThey probably just want to yel at me and ask me questions,\u201d I said, stuffing books into my bag.</p><p>\u201cYou should tel them the truth. They\u2019l just think you\u2019re crazy and let it go.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou have a point. It\u2019s the one time I can be honest with them and not worry about them believing me.\u201d</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t believe you, anyway,\u201d Jared said, kissing the top of my head. \u201cI can take you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know better than to think you\u2019ve given up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m stil working,\u201d he said, keys in hand.</p><p>Beth and Kim sat with me at our usual table. They both watched me, until I began to feel like a zoo animal. An interrogation was immanent. Beth\u2019s expression was unsure, nervous\u2014Kim seemed just the opposite. She was ready to pounce.</p><p>Beth looked to Kim before she spoke. \u201cHow\u2019s Ryan?\u201d</p><p>Her question took me off guard. I had expected more questions about the circles under my eyes, or the gal ons of caffeinated drinks I\u2019d consumed during the day.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t write much anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about him anymore,\u201d Beth said without pause.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jared?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...fine. Why?\u201d</p><p>Kim crossed her arms. \u201cWhat does he think about the fact that you\u2019re a zombie these days?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe wants to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>Too tired for tough questions, my words were more acerbic than I\u2019d intended. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy, Kim. Guys want to fix everything.\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cIf a hammer and nails could solve it al ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing to fix it?\u201d Kim prodded.</p><p>\u201cResearch,\u201d I said blinking away the urge to let my eyes close.</p><p>Beth frowned in reaction. \u201cNina, you fel asleep on your desk yesterday. Grant is gril ing me about what\u2019s going on with you. I don\u2019t even know what the truth is so I can keep from tel ing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t accidental y tel him, I promise,\u201d I grumbled as I sipped from the plastic lid of my coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is that far-fetched?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>My stomach began to complain from both the amount of hot liquid swirling inside it, and the irritating predicament I was in. Being impatient and upset so often due to the lack of sleep took a tol on my appetite, and the over abundance of coffee in my system made me feel il on a regular basis.</p><p>I stood. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sick, Nina?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. My nausea was not what she was referring to.</p><p>\u201cDo you have some disease you\u2019re not tel ing us about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould Jared be poisoning you?\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>I laughed once, shocked. \u201cIs that why you two brought me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two into something we don\u2019t know about? Voodoo-Witchcraft- Satanist crap?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat would even make you say that?\u201dI said, my patience thin.</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question,\u201d Kim said flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not being haunted by demons if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, Kim.\u201d A part of me wondered if that\u2019s what she was asking. She always seemed to be right on the edge of the truth, and had the habit of asking al the right questions. Beth being there was just a cover. She knew something.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask if you were,\u201d Kim said. For the first time since I\u2019d met her, she was uncomfortable. I watched her for a moment before she pul ed on her coat and grabbed her keys from the table. \u201cClass starts in ten.\u201d</p><p>Beth and Kim watched me with concern as I waved them away and walked to class. It was on the top floor, and the decision to take the stairs was regretful by the second flight. My body felt ten years older. Two or three hours of sleep a night had begun to wear on my muscles, my train of thought, and my patience.</p><p>My reflection in a trophy case in the hal way caught my eye, and I stood there, amazed. The purplish circles had deepened under my eyes, and my skin was too tired to stay in place. The corners of my mouth hung lazily, and the light in my eyes was gone.</p><p>Class was just a few steps away, but my body felt too drained to make the trip. I leaned against the wal . The professor had already begun class, and I listened as intently as I could from the hal way. His words blurred together as he went over the last week\u2019s test, and then lectured for what seemed like an eternity. The reading assignment was discussed in brief before class let out early. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even as the other students passed, I let the wal support my weight. The walk to campus from the coffee shop, coupled with the energy I\u2019d exerted taking the stairs, had taken everything out of me. Standing upright was the only thing I was capable of.</p><p>After watching the last of my classmates leave for other venues, I focused on the elevator. It was half way down the hal , but would take less effort than taking the stairs. I took a deep breath and pushed myself away from the wal . My feet felt like they had been soaking in cement, and towing fifty- pound blocks with each step. My knees began to wobble, and I could feel beads of sweat form on my forehead. Stopping to rest was not an option.</p><p>If I paused for even a moment, I would have passed out in the hal way.</p><p>Final y reaching the elevator, I pushed the button and took a deep, ragged breath. Even breathing took effort. The door opened, and Jared stood before me.</p> <p>Knowing better than to pretend everything was normal, I reached for his arm and let him support my weight as I took the few steps to stand next to him.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he said quietly into my ear, \u201cI think it\u2019s time\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to find someone.\u201d</p><p>He walked with me for a while, but once we were in the parking lot, my legs gave way. Jared lifted me into his arms, and carried me the remaining distance to the Escalade. My eyes shut and would not open.</p><p>I didn\u2019t wake when Jared carried me inside the loft, nor did I feel the mattress beneath me when he lowered me into it and covered me with blankets. It wasn\u2019t until the sun broke through the blinds that I realized I had been tucked in and slept sixteen hours straight.</p> <p>\u201cJared?\u201d I call ed, my voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cNope, it\u2019s just me,\u201d Bex said. He sat on the bed, seeming vexed.</p><p>\u201cWhat wrong? And where\u2019s Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been gone since yesterday evening. He caught a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d I asked, sitting up against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cNot for Jared. This makes the third time you\u2019ve slept solid when he\u2019s been gone al night. Can\u2019t be a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cAre you saying he\u2019s causing the dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s a possibility the dreams go away when he\u2019s not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I sneered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably right,\u201d Bex said, his teenage confidence overriding his usual politeness. In that moment, he was more Claire than Jared. \u201cAnd Jared\u2019s going to take it hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo he\u2019s not, because you\u2019re not going to tel him,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cNina...I have to tel him, you know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy sleep was interrupted by my annoying, incessant screaming at three-eleven A.M. just like every other morning. That\u2019s the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think He\u2019ll know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been distracted. It could work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex! At least try!\u201d</p><p>Bex stood up and crossed his arms. \u201cHe\u2019ll know, and then he won\u2019t trust me ever again because I helped you lie to him. Do you know how imperative it is that we trust each other? You real y have gone crazy.\u201d</p><p>He walked down the stairs in a huff, and I blew my bangs from my face, aggravated. Even in his disgust, Bex began making breakfast, and after a shower I joined him at the table.</p><p>\u201cSomething came for you yesterday,\u201d Bex said, tossing an envelope on the table.</p><p>It was from Ryan.</p><p>I tore it open and scanned it over for signs of sadness or danger, and then I reread his words more slowly. I went over them again in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been accepted into the Special Forces.\u201d</p><p>Bex laughed. \u201cAre you serious? That little butt nugget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Bex! This is...did you know? Has Claire call ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and no,\u201d Bex said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cDid Jared say anything?\u201d I said, grabbing for my cel .</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Bex said, holding my wrists gently, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a miscommunication. Ryan hasn\u2019t been in the Army long enough to get into the Special Forces. That\u2019s unheard of. I don\u2019t see him cutting it, anyway. If my sister can incapacitate him, I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s a big weenie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire is a Hybrid, Bex! That\u2019s an unfair basis for comparison and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Bex giggled. The little boy in him was showing. \u201cYou\u2019re much more fun when you\u2019ve had some sleep. I can\u2019t pass up a chance to give you a hard time when you\u2019re coherent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good time, Bex,\u201d I said, staring at my plate. The one day I could have eaten, and Ryan\u2019s letter eliminated any appetite I might have had.</p><p>\u201cYou real y think it\u2019s a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bex said. \u201cNo way could that happen. It would take at least three years for someone like him...no education, no connections.\u201d</p><p>Jared opened the door with an apologetic smile. \u201cHi, Baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a note?\u201d I asked, wadding up the letter in my hand and tossing it in his general direction.</p><p>He playful y ducked, as if it were possible that I could have hit him. \u201cBex was here. What\u2019s up? I\u2019m three blocks away, and I\u2019m getting al this irritation from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know about Ryan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stil alive, I know that,\u201d Jared said, peeling off his coat. He hung it on the rack, and then walked to me, kneeling beside me on the floor. \u201cYou read the letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s going into the Special Forces.\u201d</p><p>Jared thought for a moment, and then shook his head. \u201cNo, the shortest time anyone has been accepted is eighteen months in. That can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told her, but she doesn\u2019t believe me,\u201d Bex said, rol ing his eyes. He walked over to the wadded letter and reopened it, scanning the words. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it says. Maybe he\u2019s trying to impress her.\u201d</p><p>Jared immediately pul ed out his phone and dialed Claire\u2019s number. Her angry tone carried into the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a maniac!\u201d Claire yel ed. \u201cHe has zero respect for his limited lifespan and tries to throw himself on grenades for his buddies every other day,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cClaire...keep your voice down,\u201d Jared chuckled nervously. He noticed my horrified expression, and turned his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exaggerating, but not by much. The grenade part is true, but that was just once.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around my waist and walked over to Bex, waiting for more bad news. Bex put his arm around me with a light hug.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s saved every man in his company in one way or another. He walks around with explosives on his back while the enemy is shooting at us.</p><p>You thought your detail was bad, this is impossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said, throwing my arms up and letting them slap to my sides.</p><p>\u201cIt stil doesn\u2019t explain how he made sergeant in an impossible amount of time,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>The other end of the phone was silent, and Jared nodded, whispering something so quickly I could barely discern his reply at al . \u201cOkay. Watch your six,\u201d Jared said, flipping his phone shut. He watched me for a moment, and then sighed. \u201cHe stil has Claire, Nina. You know her...it\u2019s like he\u2019s in military day care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get sergeant so quickly?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared peered at Bex for a moment before speaking. \u201cIt appears Colonel Brand pul ed some strings. The Special Forces guys are more familiar with how we do things, and it made it easier for Claire to protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSending Ryan on more dangerous missions wil protect him,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWel , since everyone has bad news....\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cBex, don\u2019t,\u201d I said through my teeth, but it was too late.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked, his eyes bouncing between the two of us.</p><p>\u201cNina slept al night. She didn\u2019t budge until seven this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jared let his words sink in. It was several moments before he moved, and then nodded. His hand searched for the closest chair to pul beneath him. He fel into it, and stared at the floor. \u201cSo that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, that doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d I said, reaching for him.</p><p>He looked to his younger brother. \u201cNow we just have to see how far away I have to be to keep the dreams away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened three times, that isn\u2019t a definitive trial by anyone\u2019s standards!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019l test the theory,\u201d Jared said. \u201cStarting tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cAbsolutely not. I didn\u2019t move in with you to have to sleep alone every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just until we figure this out,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared said, his tone final.</p><p>The air was knocked out of me. I couldn\u2019t believe what he was saying, but I was too tired to argue. Tears wel ed up in my eyes, and I looked away from him.</p><p>\u201cNina....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it...it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just try it. See if it works. I\u2019ll start out just outside town, and then come a bit closer every half hour. If you have the dream, we\u2019l know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d I said. \u201cHow are you going to find the damn book if you\u2019re experimenting with my dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cI have to know.\u201d</p><p>We tested his theory. The first night, I lay in bed for what seemed like an eternity, waiting to fal asleep. Being alone in our bed felt so cold and depressing. My fingers traced the wrinkles in the sheets, remembering the first time I woke in his bed. That perfect morning, after the night he told me who\u2014and what\u2014he real y was, seemed like light years away. A tear formed in the corner of my eye, and slipped over the bridge of my nose to the white fabric beneath me.</p><p>Jared began just on the outskirts of Providence. When he felt I was asleep, he made his way to the loft, a block at a time, every ten minutes or so.</p><p>He was just over two blocks away when he felt my anxiety. In Shax\u2019s building, it was apparent the moment Jared backed off, because my surroundings blurred away, forming into the hal s of my old high school.</p><p>The alarm bleated, and my eyes peeled open. Two ful nights of sleep. My body felt a bit closer to normal. Jared walked in the front door, trotted up the stairs, and crawled into bed beside me, wrapping his warm arms snugly around me. We didn\u2019t speak, we were just stil , letting reality sink in.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Dad do this? It doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d Bex said from the first floor.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t answer. He simply pressed his forehead against my temple and sighed.</p><p>Night after night, I slept alone. Jared used that time to harass every connection he had, and pursue every lead to learn the location of the book.</p><p>Seconds after I woke in the mornings, he was at my side.</p><p>The days slowly returned to normal. Lectures in class were written down, and my hours at Titan were used for work instead of naps. Beth gladly decreased the number of times she fetched coffee, and excuses to Grant.</p><p>One afternoon she brought me a file and sat in the plump, green leather chair in front of my desk. She had bought new clothes, and her auburn hair had a new shape to it. Stil short, but different. Embarrassed that I had no idea how long it had been that way, I took the file from her and sat it to the side.</p><p>\u201cI love the shoes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, picking one foot off the floor to bring the yel ow stilettos into view. They boasted a big bow on the side, and the heel, sole and strap were black. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to dress for work when you have money. Thanks again, Nina. Things at home have been a lot better since you hired me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t mind. You\u2019ve been a huge help around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings seem to be better for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Ryan? No one\u2019s heard from him since he joined that special thing.\u201d</p><p>My mouth turned to the side. Most of the time I tried not to think of Ryan, the sand, or the bul ets flying every where while he carried his his pipe bomb backpack.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>Beth nodded. The desk phone rang and she stood, pushing Line One and answering without hesitation. \u201cNina Grey\u2019s office...no, that file is in the...oh Lord, Sasha, I\u2019ll just come find it for you. How long have you worked here?\u201d</p><p>Beth hung up the phone, and I smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t let her take advantage of you. Do you want me to say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I do plenty of that,\u201d Beth said, winking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading home. Wil you lock up for me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI always do,\u201d she said, waving behind her.</p><p>Jared stood beside his SUV with a smile, waiting with arms wide. He had let me fal asleep in his arms the last few weeks and then left sometime after. Jack and Gabe stayed out of my head, and I slept through the night, never realizing Jared was gone. He was getting so good at pinpointing when I would rouse he usual y slid next to me just before I awoke. Once again, life was semi-normal.</p><p>His hand slid over mind as it rested on the console of the Escalade. \u201cSomething came for you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter?\u201d I asked, nervous.</p><p>Jared let go of my hand, pul ing an envelope from his jacket pocket. Ryan had final y written again.</p><p>Nigh, I s ti l l thi nk about y ou ev ery day. S ometi mes w hether I w ant to or not. Thi ngs hav e been pretty bus y.

She call ed home frequently to complain of Ryan\u2019s lack of self- preservation, which helped to get him accepted so quickly into the Special Forces in the first place. Claire\u2019s phone call s were reason to fear; for Ryan and for her. I chewed my thumbnail each time Jared answered the phone, waiting for him to assure me that Ryan\u2019s commando behavior hadn\u2019t gotten him kil ed.</p><p>As our smal , but close group of friends waved goodbye on the last day of our sophomore year at Brown, Ryan came to the forefront of my mind.</p><p>\u201cHe should be here,\u201d I said to Beth.</p><p>She held my arm as we walked to the parking lot. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s in the middle of nowhere, prone on a sand dune, trying not to get shot so he didn\u2019t have to watch me be with Jared. It\u2019s not fair. He should be here with us.\u201d</p> <p>Josh and Tucker were heading to their dorm to pack and head home, and Kim walked with them, punching Josh in the arm. The opening of Summer Break was bittersweet, and we al knew why.</p><p>Beth walked me to the Escalade, and after a warm embrace, left me to find Chad. They would al meet at the Pub that night to celebrate, and I would stay at home. It didn\u2019t feel right to have fun when Ryan was fighting for his life.</p><p>Jared was unhappy with my mood. He didn\u2019t ask what it was, but I assumed he knew. I didn\u2019t enjoy talking to him about Ryan. It was unfair to him, and didn\u2019t make me feel any better, so I didn\u2019t see a point.</p><p>The loft was immaculate, and the summer sun lit the beige wal s, making every corner of the room glow. It had been nearly a year since Shax had been in our living room, since Jared threw the book at him that Gabe so desperately wanted us to have. It had been almost a year since I was shot. I rubbed my thigh where the scar stil remained.</p><p>Jared flipped through the mail at the kitchen table. \u201cWhat do you want for dinner, Sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to get better,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cWe can redecorate, and fil the bul et holes in the wal s, and pretend life is normal... but you\u2019re gone every night, and we aren\u2019t any closer to getting the book, and Ryan is gone. It\u2019s been a year and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s gotten better.</p> <p>We\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p><p>Jared raised an eyebrow. \u201cBad day?\u201d</p><p>I sat on the arm of the couch. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get kil ed. Every day that he\u2019s out there, Claire is in danger. We should bring him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that we go to the Middle East and abscond with a member of the Special Forces?\u201d</p><p>I puffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just letting the guilt eat you alive. You have to let it go, Nina. You have to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d I said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me having feelings for him. Maybe it is about guilt, but I can\u2019t stand it anymore...how Josh and Tucker and everyone else look at me. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t hang out with them, anymore. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t go to study group. I have been sleeping through the night for months, and I can\u2019t go back. The looks on their faces\u2014they blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blame you,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said, pul ing his cel phone from his pocket. He dialed numbers, and then held the receiver to his ear.</p> <p>After several moments, a grin touched his mouth. \u201cClaire. How is everything? I see. I have someone here that would like to speak to you. You got a minute?\u201d</p><p>Jared handed me the phone. \u201cHel o?\u201d I said, unsure of her reaction.</p><p>\u201cIt is hot as hel here,\u201d Claire snapped. \u201cI have sand in places no woman should experience. It\u2019s in my hair, my eyes, the seat of my Jeep. There\u2019s no getting rid of it, even when I get the occasional shower. And my hair looks like crap. So...how are things?\u201d</p><p>I managed a quiet laugh. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too,\u201d she sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Nina. I\u2019m taking care of him. He\u2019s a cowboy, and likes to pretend he\u2019s invincible, but despite his best efforts, I\u2019m keeping him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the wind whipping against the phone, and she spoke loudly to compensate. I imagined her standing alone in a sea of sand, big sunglasses, and light camouflage clothes blending in with her platinum hair.</p><p>\u201cRyan doesn\u2019t want you to feel guilty. He wants you to be happy. He\u2019s just trying to get on with his life. He\u2019s happy with his choice. Be happy with yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. I just...everything feels wrong here. I feel lost.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cTry driving around with identical sand dunes as your guide...then you can talk to me about feeling lost. It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m fluent in Farsi, or I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with him. How\u2019s Jared?\u201d</p><p>I peeked up at him, his blue-grey eyes comforted that his idea had worked. \u201cHe\u2019s Jared. He\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to take care of him for me, okay? I\u2019m kicking ass over here, so you can rest easy. Just concentrate on school, and work, and being happy, and I\u2019ll get the cowboy home safe. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over me. \u201cDeal. See you soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I can. Gotta go, they\u2019re moving,\u201d she said. The phone silenced, and I handed it to Jared.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a step toward me and enveloped me in his arms, touching his forehead to mine. \u201cI would do anything, go anywhere, suffer anything to make you happy. You know that, right? That\u2019s al I want.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin to kiss his lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. I\u2019m going to run you a bath, and you can soak until your hands get al pruny, and I\u2019ll have dinner waiting for you when you get out. Then we can turn in early.\u201d</p><p>I buried my face into his warm chest. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Landstuhl</p><p>The first day of Summer Break, I took the day off from Titan, and Jared and I went to our Oak Tree. I lazily traced the details of the carving of our names, and let the sweet, summer air sweep over my skin. Lunch was served on the blanket he had given me as a graduation gift\u2014before I knew him\u2014and we playful y wrestled and chased each other barefoot in the grass.</p><p>Jared was working overtime to prove to me that our lives could be as normal as anyone else. Even with the bad dreams keeping us apart at night, he had figured out how to get around them and made it seem that nothing was different.</p><p>The air smell ed of fresh grass and sunshine, and coupled with Jared\u2019s scent, it felt a little like Heaven. Summer soaked into my every pore, and I could see that Jared was enjoying my mood. He sat next to me, waiting for me to catch my breath from chasing him.</p><p>\u201cHaving a better day?\u201d he asked, running his finger lightly across my wrist.</p><p>\u201cExponential y,\u201d I said, digging my toes into the grass. \u201cI feel like I did at Little Corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that...have you given any more thought to returning to that perfect little chapel we came across there?\u201d Jared said the words casual y, but he was fidgeting with the hem of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWedding date,\u201d I said, nodding. I should have seen the topic coming. Jared never broached anything important lightly, and always insisted on the perfect back drop. \u201cDoes Claire know when she\u2019s coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, frowning. The hem of his jeans seemed to be irritating him, but I knew it was the direction of our conversation.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t get married without Claire. I\u2019m going to make her wear something hideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready have your Bridesmaids picked out?\u201d he said with a contrived smile.</p><p>\u201cBeth, Kim and Claire. What about your groomsmen? Can\u2019t exactly have Samuel and Eli stand in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I could. I don\u2019t think they would do it, but I could ask.\u201d I laughed, and his smile relaxed. \u201cBex, obviously. Maybe I could ask Ryan. It would help Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d I said, ripping out a handful of grass, and then throwing it at him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNothing says I have to have as many as you.\u201d</p><p>I had never considered that the smal details of a wedding would be so difficult for him. He had siblings, and contacts within the system to make things easier, but no friends. Barely any family. His side of the church would be pitiful y bare.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just have Beth and Claire, and Bex can escort both of them,\u201d I said, hoping to relieve him of part of what he perceived as a problem.</p><p>I had insisted for so long that our lives be as close to normal as a Hybrid and his Taleh could get, that Jared was bordering on obsession about giving that to me. I knew that if something were as important to him, I would be equal y determined to make it happen, but I didn't want our wedding to be a source of disappointment; for either of us.</p><p>His eyes turned soft. \u201cYou can have as many as you want, Sweetheart. I\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said, leaning toward me. His lips touched my cheek bone lightly, and then brushed along the edge of my jaw line.</p><p>His touch had always had an immediate effect on me, but being alone, shaded from the summer sun by our Oak Tree, I lost al in inhibitions. I pul ed his mouth to mine and returned his kiss, letting him know by the way my tongue eagerly danced with his. I let myself fal slowly against the blanket, and held his shoulders, bringing him with me. His lips planted tiny kisses from my ear to my col ar bone, and I melted against the ground, feeling wonderful y overwhelmed. His mouth was so warm, and every time his lips lifted away from my skin, little goose bumps formed in reaction to the sudden change in temperature.</p><p>My fingers reached up the underside of his shirt, feeling the lean muscles of his back under his tan skin. His attraction to me had always confused me, but I was never ungrateful. There was no doubt that I was lucky. Jared being so close made that fact al too real.</p><p>I lifted his shirt over his head, and watched as his muscles stretched with each movement. A smile broke out across my face, and his expression mirrored mine, his senses tuning into my emotions, giving me away.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you today how incredibly beautiful you are?\u201d he asked, his nose tracing a line from my chin to my nose, where he stopped to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cIf I haven\u2019t, I deeply apologize. That\u2019s something that should be recognized on a daily basis.\u201d He easily unfastened the first button of my blouse, moving to the second.</p><p>\u201cYou can say it however often you like, as long as you\u2019re doing that while you\u2019re saying it,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>His cel phone rang, and we both sighed.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said.</p><p>He rol ed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld habits die hard.\u201d</p><p>He flipped it open. \u201cRyel.\u201d</p><p>A stream of words I couldn\u2019t understand blurred in different tones. Jared\u2019s expression caused me to panic.</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019re headed to the airport, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe airport?\u201d I said, watching Jared dial again.</p><p>\u201cI need to charter a jet to Ramstein. No, not Frankfurt-Hahn. Yes, the Air force Base. It\u2019s the closest airport to Landstuhl. I\u2019ll take care of it, Frank, just get it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Germany?\u201d I said in disbelief. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jared ignored me, dialing again. He spoke in German this time. The only thing I understood was Landstuhl. It was the largest military hospital outside the United States, near Ramstein, Germany. The hospital was mentioned in the news frequently because the majority of wounded soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan were flown there.</p><p>In that moment of understanding, I shoved al of our things into the backpack, frantical y pul ing on my motorcycle helmet. Jared immediately climbed onto his bike, and I jumped on behind him, gripping his jacket as he took off at ful speed.</p><p>Everything I had feared since the moment I learned of Ryan's decision to join the Army had happened: Ryan had been injured, and Claire was alone, waiting to die.</p><p>We stopped at the loft long enough to grab money and passports, but we left everything else behind. Jared was quiet, and the way he was rushing to get to the airport made me fear the worst. He led me through the terminal so quickly that I had to jog to keep up with his long strides.</p><p>The plane was ready and waiting when we walked onto the tarmac, escorted by only a handful of the jet's employees. Jared spoke quick instructions to the pilot, and then we rushed up the stairs, barely greeting the flight attendant as we passed.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t speak during take-off. His fingers were on his lips as his mind processed the situation, and the consequences. I left him alone with his thoughts. Just as worried as he was, I wondered about call ing Beth, or Kim, or even Josh. Tel ing them what I knew would only welcome questions, and explaining how I knew before Ryan\u2019s mother, or his best friends would be far beyond my lying capabilites.</p><p>Two hours into the flight, I fought with my eye lids to stay open. After the fourth time of jerking myself awake, I final y broke the silence. \u201cThis is ridiculous. How could I possible be sleepy right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try to sleep,\u201d Jared said without looking at me.</p><p>I nodded, settling into my seat. My leg jerked, and my eyes popped open again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDreaming?\u201d Jared asked with an amused smile.</p><p>\u201cI think I was riding a bike to Germany,\u201d I mumbled, leaning against his shoulder.</p><p>Sinking back into oblivion, my breaths grew even. It didn\u2019t take long to let the airplane noise fade into the background.</p><p>The lights were dim in the fuselage. My eyes were blurry, and with the poor light, it was hard to focus. Jared had left his seat. I wondered how long we had been en route, and looked behind me to the restrooms.</p> <p>\u201cJared?\u201d I call ed back.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I stumbled to the back of the plane, and knocked on the lavatory door. When he didn\u2019t answer, I opened it.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>My eyes strained to see in the darkness, but I could vaguely make out the top of Jared\u2019s head. He was back in his seat, patiently waiting for me.</p> <p>\u201cThirty-thousand feet in the air with nowhere to hide and you stil keep me guessing,\u201d I said, fal ing into my chair.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Jared. Sitting next to me was Gabe Ryel.</p><p>I recoiled, the arm rest digging into my back as I leaned away from him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dreaming, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I said, perturbed. Knowing Gabe was behind my sleepless nights and the reason why Jared could no longer be within two blocks while I slept mustered up suppressed resentment, resulting in a bit more guts than I usual y had.</p><p>\u201cTalk Jared into turning back, Nina. We don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTime for what? Why do you insist on being so theatrical? Just tel me what we need to do and we\u2019l do it.\u201d</p><p>Gabe didn\u2019t react. \u201cTurn back, Nina.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were black again. It made me more than just uncomfortable. His ice-blue eyes replaced by glass bal s in his sockets was downright disturbing.</p><p>\u201cNo. Claire needs us.\u201d</p><p>Gabe didn\u2019t react to my insolence. He simply looked down at his intertwined fingers sitting atop his lap. He wore an expensive suit, the same I remembered when seeing him shadow my father, but his fingers were dirty and worn, as if he\u2019d been digging in soil.</p><p>\u201cFind the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Jared has talked to Eli, Samuel...no one wil tel us anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis fight is not Jared's. It's yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. More riddles,\u201d I said, crossing my arms. My muscles relaxed, thinking about the situation at hand. I looked to Gabe. Even with his shark eyes, he was stil someone from my childhood that I loved. \u201cIs Claire going to die?\u201d</p><p>The plane hit turbulence, and a bit of bouncing evolved into what felt like a several-hundred-foot drop. As I gripped the arm rest, Gabe turned to me once again.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t listen if there\u2019s nothing to hear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>The plane fel again, causing the overhead storage bins to vomit various items, and the already dim lights flickered violently until they surrendered, and the fuselage turned dark.</p><p>I jerked awake, and Jared sat where Gabe had been. The lights were on, and the floors were clear of debris.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d I said, relieved.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with a confused smile, \u201cwho did you think it would be?\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, I shook my head. \u201cNo one. Just forgot where I was for a second.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, and then rested his hand on my knee. \u201cWe\u2019l be there in two hours.\u201d</p><p>He spent the remainder of our flight on his cel phone. He made arrangements for a car to pick us up at the airport, and for a friend, Colonel Jason Brand to meet us at Landstuhl with visitor identification.</p><p>Upon arrival, the pace accelerated. The second the plane came to a stop, Jared had the few things we brought with us in hand, and he held out my jacket.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chil y,\u201d he said, helping me twist into the sleeves.</p><p>Descending the stairs of the plane, it was clear why Jared had to make so many phone call s. Pilots walked to and from their jets, crew chiefs were parking and marshel ing out jets, while others were busy with flight inspections. Jet engines screamed as they prepared for takeoff.</p><p>We had landed at Ramstein air base. Jared\u2019s connections spanned farther than I had imagined.</p><p>We rushed off the tarmac to the waiting car. The driver was a stranger to me. He spoke fluent German to Jared, so I was unsure if he was just a local or someone Jared had met before. He looked about Jared\u2019s age. Light blonde hair peeked from his dark green bal cap, but his eyes were hidden behind dark sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cWarum gehen Sie nach Landstuhl?\u201d the driver said.</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s Taleh ist verletzt worden,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>The driver\u2019s eyebrows pul ed in. He was a friend. Jared mentioning Claire\u2019s Taleh could even mean that he was a Hybrid, and by the features I could see, he was.</p><p>\u201cGutes Gl\u00fcck zu Ihnen, Freund,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDanke,\u201d Jared frowned. He leaned toward me, then. \u201cHe was asking why we\u2019re here. I told him, and he wished us luck,\u201d he whispered against my cheek.</p><p>Nodding, I hugged Jared\u2019s arm to me. Landstuhl was just three miles from the West Gate of the base. The soldier guarding the gate seemed to know the driver, and after checking out his identification, let us through quickly.</p><p>An officer in a blue decorated dress uniform waited at the front entrance of the hospital.</p><p>\u201cColonel,\u201d Jared said, shaking his hand. He was definitely not a hybrid, with his dark hair and eyes. \u201cNina, this is Colonel Jason Brand,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shook his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot at al . Claire\u2019s pretty famous around here. We\u2019ve al trained with her at some point,\u201d Jason said with a smal grin. \u201cJared, we\u2019ve got good news coming from the surgeon,\u201d he said as we fol owed him inside. His voice was firm and no-nonsense. It reminded me of the way my father spoke. \u201cClaire is in the waiting room on the third floor. They know you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. He kept me by his side as we walked to the elevator. The space was quiet, and despite Jason\u2019s positive comment earlier, Jared was on-edge. He rubbed his thumb compulsively against the top of my hand as he held it a bit too tight in his.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do,\u201d I asked, touching his arm with my free hand.</p><p>One corner of Jared's mouth turned up in an appreciative half-smile. \u201cYou're here with me. That's al I need.\u201d</p><p>The door opened to a bustling hal way. The wal s were devoid of anything but white paint, and the hal s were ful of equipment and people.</p><p>Medical personnel attended to the wounded wearing either utility attire or green scrubs. Soldiers past by in wheelchairs, accompanied by their attentive wives or mothers. A few were trying on their new prosthesis and learning to walk again.</p><p>My stomach instantly felt sick, wondering what was waiting for us in Ryan\u2019s room.</p><p>Jared pushed through a set of double doors and stopped. Claire, tiny and alone, stood at the end of the hal . She was looking down an adjacent hal , but the second she felt Jared\u2019s presence, she slowly turned to face him. His stoic disposition deteriorated as he looked into the eyes of his little sister, and a smal sound escaped from his throat.</p><p>Claire ran down the hal at ful speed, and crashed into Jared, wrapping her arms around him. She had run so hard, and hit him with such force, it made a clapping sound that echoed through the hal s as if a door had slammed. Even with Claire\u2019s incredible strength, Jared didn\u2019t budge. He lifted her off the floor, taking her into his long arms and squeezed her tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come, stupid!\u201d she said. Her voice was muffled against Jared\u2019s shoulder. When she pul ed back to look at him, tears blurred her round, ice-blue eyes. \u201cBut, I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>She reached for me, and hooked her arm around my neck, adding me to their embrace. We stood there in silence for a long while, knowing once we let go, reality would set in.</p><p>Time was not on our side, and too quickly the reunion was over. We walked to the waiting room, dazed and emotional y exhausted. Jared sat beside me on the sofa, and Claire took a chair adjacent to us.</p><p>Jared cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to apologize in advance, Claire. This is hard for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\u201d she said in understanding.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose with his forefinger and thumb.</p><p>\u201cYou mean me,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t meet my eyes; he simply nodded as he stared at the floor. I had tried to imagine many times what he went through while waiting to hear whether I would live or die after the shoot out in the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Claire said with a far-off look in her eyes. \u201cMom was there. Bex was stuck in Dubai with Amir.\u201d She spoke low and slow, looking to Jared with weary eyes. \u201cYou sat on that horrible, fake leather chair until you couldn\u2019t stand it, and then you paced the length of the room until we couldn\u2019t stand it. It was harder to watch than when Daddy slipped away. Then Samuel came, and Eli....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were there?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cThey appeared after I call ed for Gabriel. I begged him to take me the second...I didn\u2019t want to know what it would feel like when you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be painful?\u201d I asked, touching his arm.</p><p>Jared breathed a heavy sigh. \u201cMy father described it as weakness, growing so debilitating that eventual y every system in our bodies stop.\u201d He looked into my eyes. \u201cWe literal y need our Taleh\u2019s to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Claire watched us for a moment before speaking. \u201cI had to restrain Jared several times. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of you lying on a table without him, letting strangers\u2014humans\u2014try to save you. He wanted to force his way into the O.R. I\u2019d never seen him so unreasonable.\u201d Claire\u2019s icy eyes melted when she looked at her brother. \u201cSeeing Jared feel so helpless and desperate\u2014Mom waiting to hear if she would lose you and her son\u2014the col ective pain in that room wil be burned into my memory forever. Just like yesterday wil .\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay. Just like Ryan wil be.\u201d</p><p>Claire wore what used to be a white tank top, now more of a grey-brown, and khaki utility pants with heavy, lace-up boots. A blood-stained hijab sat bunched up in the chair next to her. Her moist eyes and smeared mascara had mixed with the desert sand, but only around her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid Ryan recognize you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cI should have pul ed us out earlier. He looked up at me, but he was pretty out of it. And with the hijab...he could only see my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jared placed his hand on ours. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that you\u2019re both alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan's company was conducting a raid to extract two contractors that had been missing for a few days. I made a lot of mistakes today, Jared.</p><p>They were ambushed. I should have seen it coming. I should have heard the snipers get into position, but my mind was ful of complaints and resentment.\u201d She stared at the floor, deep in thought. \u201cThey always raid at night. Everything was off, and I missed it.\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed Claire's jaw in his hands. \u201cYou know better than to beat yourself up about this. What were you tel ing me in the waiting room in Providence? He\u2019s alive, Claire. No one else could have gotten him here with a chance.\u201d</p><p>She pul ed away from him, and looked out the window. In her mind, she was stil on that street corner, watching the extermination of Ryan's company in real time. \u201cIt was like Shock and Awe out there\u2014one explosion after another,\u201d she snapped her eyes shut. The memory replayed in her mind. \u201cI could hear him, but I couldn\u2019t see,\u201d her eyebrows pul ed in, \u201cI couldn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open, and she immediately wiped away her tears. \u201cMy first glimpse of Ryan didn\u2019t surprise me: He was sprinting from the debris cloud with Tommy on his back.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOf course it would be Tommy. Ryan's only saved his hide three times already.\u201d Her smiled faded. \u201cThey were close. Closer than the others. Ryan felt responsible for him.\u201d</p><p>Jared stood, and walked to the other side of the room. He rubbed the back of his neck; the worry and memories were clearly overwhelming him.</p><p>\u201cThat was when I decided to move in,\u201d\u201d Claire explained, \u201cbut a sniper clicked on his sights.\u201d Claire laughed once. \u201cThe jerkface got one off after I severed his brain stem with one bul et, Jared. That shit only happens in the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Ryan was hit?\u201d I prodded. My mind raced with where the story would end. I had no idea what injuries Ryan had sustained, and with the vivid detail of bombs and bul ets, I needed her to get to the point.</p><p>\u201cTwice. A bul et ricocheted off a rock, and clipped his right lung; the other blew straight through his shoulder. It was fate. Both injuries are going to send him packing.\u201d</p><p>Jared glanced at me, and then returned to his seat. He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. \u201cThat was when you evac\u2019d?\u201d</p><p>Claire sniffed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let Tommy go. I had to pry al ten of his fingers from the guy\u2019s flak jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Jared grumbled.</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s whole unit was wiped out in three seconds. He needed to save one of them. It didn\u2019t matter that Tommy was dead ten meters from the explosions...Ryan was going to carry him home.\u201d</p><p>Tears wel ed up in my eyes and overflowed. \u201cCan we see him?\u201d</p><p>Jared hugged me to his side. \u201cHe can\u2019t know you were ever here. We can\u2019t take that chance.\u201d</p><p>Jared's reasoning made sense. Explaining Ryan\u2019s memories of me at his bedside in Landstuhl would be too difficult to explain away to our friends at Brown.</p><p>Claire looked at her dirty hands. \u201cI hauled him to an empty shack off the path, stayed the night until Morning Prayer, and then back-tracked East to my Jeep.\u201d</p><p>Colonel Brand knocked on the door jamb. Jared and Claire immediately stood, and Jared pul ed me with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cColonel,\u201d Jared and Claire said in unison, both nodding.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out of the woods for now. Doctor Vanhooser is closing, and He\u2019ll be in to speak with you shortly. He has been informed that Sergeant Scott is to be kept unaware of your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jason,\u201d Claire said, letting out a big sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cThere is something you should know,\u201d Colonel Brand said. \u201cRyan is going to need substantial physical therapy, and after losing his entire unit, his debriefing wil be substantial.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean for Ryan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSergeant Scott\u2019s chances to return to active duty are slim,\u201d Colonel Brand said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>I was ashamed of the relief the Colonel\u2019s words brought me. Ryan would be devastated, and I could only think of myself. Thoughts of Ryan returning to Brown on the military\u2019s dime, and his empty seat at the Ratty being fil ed peppered my mind, and I had to cover my smile with my hand.</p><p>Jared glanced at me. He knew how Colonel Brand\u2019s prediction had made me feel, and his eyes tightened. I sunk back into my seat, crimson splashing across my cheeks.</p><p>Claire took a walk down the colorless hal way, giving Jared the perfect chance to scold me. Before he could get the chance, my cel phone buzzed in my jacket pocket.</p> <p>\u201cHel o?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant is out sick, you\u2019re gone, and the Japan firm is on line two asking questions I don\u2019t know the answers to,\u201d Beth barked in her southern accent. \u201cI don\u2019t understand half of what he says, Nina. Is there some way to patch you through?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cJust tel him I\u2019m out of town, and I wil call him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s been waiting on a return phone call from Grant for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can wait one more day,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? I only have a bil ion documents for you to sign, and the bil ing on the Peterman account is messed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsk an intern. They know the software better than the accountants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNigh,\u201d she sighed.\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking on an old friend,\u201d I said. \u201cI have to go, Beth. Oh, and...don\u2019t ask Sasha for help. It wil give her the mistaken impression that she\u2019s needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe friend wouldn\u2019t be Kim, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s MIA, too. Again,\u201d Beth grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou can wing it until I get back. I have faith in you,\u201d I said, hanging up the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared asked.</p> <p>\u201cBeth said Kim hasn\u2019t been around. She doesn\u2019t know where she is. Kim\u2019s been doing that a lot lately,\u201d I said with a frown.</p><p>Jared squirmed in his seat, and then looked away.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I asked in an accusatory tone. He didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cDo you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t meet my eyes for several moments, and then final y turned to face me. After a long puff of air, he took a deep breath, and then intertwined his fingers. His expression was exactly as it as the night he told me the truth.</p><p>I looked at him from under my brows. \u201cIs it bad?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. I won\u2019t lie to you, so please let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Kim, right? Lanky, goofy Kim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Nina.\u201d</p><p>My knee bounced up and down as I made the decision, but it had already been made. I was only stal ing. Jared looked away again with a sigh, knowing what would happen next.</p><p>He closed his eyes, and with one last effort he begged. \u201cDon\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>My knuckles turned white as I gripped the edge of my seat, preparing myself for what he would say. Jared had told me more unbelievable truths in the last two years than even I could believe, and I had seen most of it with my own eyes. Regardless, Kim had been keeping something from me\u2014 something Jared knew, and I didn't\u2014I had to ask.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d He stiffened the second I uttered his name. Although knowing the truth had never been comforting before, I couldn\u2019t stop myself. \u201cWhat do you know about Kim?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Witch</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not actual y his secret to tel ,\u201d Kim said, strol ing into the waiting room.</p><p>It took me a moment to process that she was real y there, and that I hadn\u2019t conjured her from my wild imagination.</p><p>Kim paused for a moment to acknowledge Jared. When he nodded in her direction, she took a seat next to me. She was in a white t-shirt and jeans, sporting black and white checkered Vans, and smell ed of cigarettes. Her big, brown eyes didn\u2019t falter. She didn\u2019t seem nervous or out of place at al .</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing here, Kim?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI could ask you the same question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go ahead. You seem to know al the right questions to ask, anyway,\u201d I said, defiant.</p><p>\u201cKim\u2019s just here to help,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cHelp how? How did she know?\u201d I looked at Kim, then. \u201cHow did you know to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asked. She was purposeful y goading me, and I wanted to reach out, lace my fingers around her long neck and shake her with the tightest grip I could muster.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Kim grinned, clearly enjoying the fact that she had me in such a tizzy. \u201cNo, but you are.\u201d</p><p>I stood up, crossing my arms. If she wouldn\u2019t cooperate, I would corner Jared. I pointed at Kim. \u201cHow did she know Ryan was hurt, Jared? How did she get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlane,\u201d Kim answered flatly.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I growled.</p><p>The corners of Jared\u2019s mouth turned up slightly, but when he felt my temper rising, he straightened his expression. \u201cKim is helping us. Final y,\u201d he said, shooting an annoyed glance in her direction.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Kim said without emotion, chewing her thumb nail.</p><p>His jaws flitted under his skin. \u201cShe has been keeping an eye on our situation...what?\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for you to make sense.\u201d</p><p>Jared returned my expression, and Kim laughed once. \u201cWelcome to my world. He\u2019s one big riddle book, isn\u2019t he? He just does it to make himself feel important. He wants you to drag it out of him.\u201d</p><p>Claire walked in, and stopped in her tracks. \u201cWhat is the witch doing here?\u201d she said with venom in her voice.</p><p>Kim smiled slightly, but her eyes were devoid of emotion. \u201cBlessed Be. Heard about what happened. Good job, G.I. Barbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove aside, Nina,\u201d Claire said in a frightening, low tone. I was too afraid to move, seeing that she was poised to pounce.</p><p>Tension in the room had soared to a new level. The waiting room we occupied was in a wing separate from the main hal , so it would be very easy for Claire to let some of her pent up aggression go in Kim\u2019s general direction. Kim didn\u2019t seem phased in the slightest.</p><p>Jared stood. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Claire glanced at her brother. \u201cDoes she have to be here?\u201d</p><p>The longer they spoke as if I knew what was going on, the angrier I became. \u201cWhat in the hel is going on?\u201d I yel ed.</p><p>\u201cSssh!\u201d Claire hissed.</p><p>\u201cAre you human?\u201d I asked Kim.</p><p>Kim paused in thought. \u201cSome days it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but yes.\u201d</p><p>Jared sat, pul ing me to the sofa with him. Claire sat in the seat next to us, fidgeting with her hijab. Kim looked at her watch, and then settled into her chair. Suddenly the air felt very easy, the opposite of just a few moments before, but it was forced, unnatural.</p><p>\u201cYou know those that are aware of demons attract them.\u201d Kim said this matter-of-factly, making my reality feel twisted. Jared told me a few specifics about the Others during the talk we had on our first date\u2014the moment we affectionately dubbed, \u2018The Conversation That Changed Everything\u2019. Kim was the other side; someone I couldn\u2019t tel . I hadn\u2019t shared our secrets from that night with anyone, and Kim repeating part of it verbatim disconcerted me.</p><p>\u201cStay calm, Nina,\u201d Jared said, quiet and smooth. He placed his hand on mine. \u201cThey feed on aggression and fear.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s body language was casual, but deliberately so. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is going to bring them here, Nigh. The more upset you are, the more access they wil have to this situation, so just take it al in. Don\u2019t try to analyze it, just listen and accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen and accept,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. I looked to Jared, who offered a smal , comforting grin. I returned my attention to Kim. \u201cOkay.</p><p>Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s mouth turned up infinitesimal y. \u201cWhen I was sixteen I was possessed by a demon.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to concentrate. Months of perfecting the art of keeping my emotions under control was the only advantage I had, and I was determined to keep my cool. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>Kim continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this short if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and Kim rol ed her eyes. \u201cThe story bores me, so to get to the point, the Pol ocks, my family, descend from Crusade Knights. Those Crusade Knights used the Holy Sepulchre as an end point of their pilgrimages...you okay?\u201d Kim asked, pausing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said casual y. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what the hel you\u2019re talking about!\u201d I yel ed.</p><p>Jared held my hands in my lap, and lowered his chin, looking directly into my eyes. \u201cYou need to stay calm. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>I looked back to Kim. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Kim dismissed my apology. \u201cWhatever. You remember learning about the Crusades, Nigh. English knights...Robin Hood...King Richard?\u201d I nodded. \u201cIt has nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, and Jared jerked his head to the side in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed once and looked down. \u201cI'm sorry. I just can't describe to you how much I hate tel ing this story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d Jared seethed.</p><p>Kim looked to me. \u201cTemplar Knights took their crusades to a very holy place in Jerusalem. It\u2019s call ed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was once the temple of Aphrodite. Christians refer to it as Golgotha...the place where Christ was crucified.</p><p>\u201cThe First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. This is where it gets a little hairy. During my great-great times infinity grandfather\u2019s pilgrimage, he came upon something under the basilica of the Holy Sepulchre. It was a book. A Bible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Bible savers?\u201d I looked at Jared in disbelief. \u201cCool? I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the Holy Bible, here, Nigh,\u201d Kim said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShax\u2019s bible?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Kim nodded. \u201cIt was kept safely hidden away in the cistern under the basilica, which is where it was rumored that the mother of Hadrian found the true cross and the tomb of Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that pretty much sacrilegious? The Bible of Hel being kept under what was thought to be the tomb of Jesus Christ?\u201d I said.</p><p>Kim rubbed her temples. I had clearly asked a question she\u2019d answered a thousand times. \u201cThe Holy presence there kept Shax and his legions from finding it. My grandfather didn\u2019t know that. He removed the book, and after learning of its importance, he vowed to keep it safe. That vow, and the book, has cursed our family for generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurses seem to be the popular thing around here,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Kim glanced at Jared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, laughing without humor, \u201cthis is al a little far-fetched. Even for me, and I\u2019ve seen Shax.\u201d</p><p>The room grew cold, and Jared and Claire immediately extended their necks, looking to the ceiling. Jared pul ed me closer to him, and Claire sat on the other side of me, lightly touching my knee.</p><p>The lights flickered, and even with Jared\u2019s and Claire\u2019s warm bodies on each side of me, I shook from the cold. The dim fluorescent lights created an eerie glow to the air we exhaled, now warmer than the air in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor the fiftieth time, Nina, stay calm,\u201d Claire said, her voice even. \u201cNothing wil happen to you while we\u2019re here. This is just what happens when there\u2019s a higher concentration of them than normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigher concentration?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Kim looked above her. \u201cOh there\u2019s probably an army or two around...or one real y strong one.\u201d</p><p>I shivered. \u201cWhich is worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Claire whispered, her eyes unfocused. She was relying on her senses, creating a thoughtful, confused expression on her face.</p><p>Kim returned her attention to me. Her demeanor was baffling. She had always been relaxed, and at times aloof, but it was hard to believe she could remain that way with so many Others around. Every part of me wanted to run screaming down the hal .</p><p>\u201cAnyone who\u2019s made the trip to return the book to the Sulpulchre never came back. We thought Jack and Gabe stealing the book from my uncle was the best thing that could have happened to our family, until Shax held us personal y responsible. That\u2019s when I got sick...or that\u2019s what we thought it was.\u201d</p><p>Even with the drop in temperature and the knowledge that a mil ion demons might have been hovering over us, I sat hunched over, with my chin resting on my fist, suddenly unimpressed. \u201cYou were possessed. Like priests and green pea soup possessed? C\u2019mon, Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember most of it. I just know that my father spared no expense to bring in the best of the best, and when Father Gary and Father Carmine were finished...I was different.\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cWhen humans are overtaken in that way, they are often left weak for the rest of their lives. Kim kept something with her when Father Carmine final y extracted the demons. And they wouldn\u2019t have left behind power voluntarily. She took it from them, and because of that, they fear her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat kind of power?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe al -knowing, understanding dead languages blah, blah, blah. I also know when they move, when they approach, when they leave, and why they\u2019re doing it. And I think I can take their power at wil , but none of them have gotten close enough for me to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Kim is an asset,\u201d Claire said, sul en. \u201cShe affects them in ways no one understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...you....\u201d A mil ion questions swirled in my head, but the most upsetting revelation was that nothing was separate, now. My normal life just had a head-on col ision with my life with Jared.</p> <p>The air around me felt thick and ful of static. An end table next to one of the chairs shook for a moment, and then slid across the floor a few inches.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d I said.</p><p>The table vibrated again, and then shot to the wal , the legs squealing as they grated across the tile.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Jared warned.</p><p>My fingers worked in smal circles against my temple. \u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered. I worked to release any negativity that the demons could use to fuel their power. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d Kim said, uncharacteristical y sympathetic. \u201cI can help you find the book, Nigh. They\u2019l tel me. They have to.\u201d</p><p>Al expression fel from my face. \u201cSo you\u2019re like...you\u2019re like the demon whisperer. My wacky friend Kim. That\u2019s just great.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded, unaffected by my jab.</p><p>\u201cYou never said why you\u2019re here,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to check on Ryan. I also have news.\u201d</p><p>News was usual y the job of Samuel, and I wondered why Kim had been sent instead. The more I knew, the less any of it made sense\u2014which was annoyingly typical.</p> <p>Claire crossed her legs, settling in her chair. \u201cWel ? Tel us already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared and his covert operation tipped them off. He\u2019s asked too many questions, and they know what he's after. The book has been moved six times in as many days. We\u2019ve got some work to do when we get home.\u201d</p><p>Jared glared at Kim, annoyed. \u201cI have to look it over before we take it back. There are things within those pages that could help Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the deal, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Kim replied.</p><p>Jared nodded, and then looked to his sister. \u201cNow that Ryan\u2019s stable, we should head back. Did the Colonel say how long you\u2019d be here?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged. \u201cAt least until he\u2019s stable enough to ship state-side, and then we\u2019l probably be at a VA rehab until he\u2019s functional. I\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the smal table that had slid across the floor. Two hundred or so demons had been swirling about, and they were already onto the next subject. The air had returned to its normal temperature, but watching an inanimate object glide across the room left me uneasy\u2014not that I had felt anything close to composed since Gabe had infiltrated my dream on the plane. Life was spinning out of control again, but this time there was no normal life to escape to.</p><p>One-third of my anchor to normal was lying in a hospital bed, and another sitting beside me, talking about things so opposite of the realm of ordinary, it was difficult to remember she was part of my other life at al .</p> <p>Anger consumed me. I felt I'd been lied to. \u201cWhat deal are you two talking about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYour man is going to help me return the book to the Sepulchre if I help him get it from Shax,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cWere you going to tel me about any of this?\u201d I said to Jared.</p><p>Jared took my hands in his. \u201cWe talked about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that you would omit things that didn't directly me, but first Ryan, and now Kim? They were my friends, Jared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stil are,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>I ignored Kim. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t see Ryan?\u201d I asked Claire. She shook her head with an apologetic expression. \u201cIt was good to see you again,\u201d I said to Claire, hugging her. \u201cKim....\u201d I trailed off, unable to find anything nice to say.</p><p>Kim had betrayed me; sneaking her mystical bul shit in the back door, and sucker punching me with her possession-crusades-basilica sob story.</p><p>Now she was supposed to help us find the book because of her Oh So Spooky to the Demons powers. I didn\u2019t care! She was supposed to be my normal, and she had ripped it right out from under me.</p><p>Gabe had wanted us to turn back, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about Kim. Could Gabe\u2019s appearance be mundane as a paternal need to protect me again, or was it something different? Maybe Kim wasn\u2019t supposed to help us? Maybe she was working for the other side.</p><p>I had almost reached the elevator when Jared call ed my name. Soon, his hand was in mine. He stopped mid-step, causing me to jerk backward.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d I said, tugging him down the hal .</p><p>Jared stopped me again. \u201cWould you please tel me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped, smacking the button to the elevator. \u201cThat would require me tel ing you the whole truth...and that's not real y how our relationship works.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and I pul ed Jared inside. We were alone, and for the first time I felt I could breathe. I leaned against the wal and sighed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t happening? Nina, talk to me,\u201d Jared said, putting his hands on the wal at each side of my head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, Jared! She was on the other side, the side that kept me grounded...sometimes kept me sane, and now it\u2019s gone! It\u2019s al gone!\u201d</p><p>Jared cupped my face. \u201cShe\u2019s stil your friend. You\u2019re life at Brown is no different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not different? It\u2019s disappeared!\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cLet\u2019s think of this as a positive thing. You have someone to talk to about this, now. Someone on the other side that understands.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cI needed them, Jared...so I wouldn\u2019t get lost in al of the heaven/hel fiasco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s human, Nina. She may handle it differently, but she knows how you feel. She knows what it\u2019s like to know things, and be different because of it. Embrace it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbrace it,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my hand and kissed my fingers. \u201cThis is a good thing. With her help, we can find the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I said as the doors opened to the main floor. \u201cLet\u2019s find the damn thing and get rid of it! Take it back to the church, I\u2019ll stop having the dreams, Kim can be Kim again, and I can get my life back!\u201d</p><p>Colonel Brand waited next to the car that would take us to the base. Jared and I remained silent during the trip, but once the plane took off from the runway, he began again.</p><p>\u201cNina, we can\u2019t just take the book back. We have to read it; find out why Jack stole it from Kim\u2019s uncle in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Jack was crazy, that\u2019s why,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Jared sighed with frustration. \u201cThey\u2019ve been tel ing us why. In your dreams.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment, recal ing Jack\u2019s words on the roof. He had to save her. I could think of only two women in the world my father would risk his life for. The inscription on my ring leading to a deposit box only Jared and I could access...he had stolen the book to save me.</p><p>But from what?</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cAre you insinuating that I'm keeping something from you? Because that would be just...total y and completely hypocritical.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cNo. But we need to find someone that can interpret what your dreams mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would know, Jared? Besides Eli or Samuel. They wouldn\u2019t tel us, anyway, right? Who would know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking them again wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. Kim said they\u2019re already onto us. It\u2019s impossible to keep a secret in that realm. We need a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human isn't going to be able to make sense of my dreams, Jared, unless it's someone that already knows. One of Graham\u2019s men, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, deep in thought. \u201cClaire didn\u2019t leave any of them alive. Anyone that might have known anything about it is long gone.\u201d</p><p>An idea popped into my head, instantly creating a sinking feeling in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked, concerned.</p><p>My mind instantly searched for other options. I was desperate to make the name stuck in my throat a last resort, but she was our only choice. \u201cMy mother,\u201d I whispered. \u201cCynthia would know.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows pul ed in for a moment. \u201cJack left her in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t real y believe that, do you?\u201d I asked, incredulous.</p><p>He peeked over at me, and then relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. How to get her to tel us anything is the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSHe\u2019ll tel us,\u201d I said, determined.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The Perfect Storm</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a surprise,\u201d Cynthia said, fussing with her hair. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the Komen fundraiser, Nina dear. We\u2019l have lunch tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I side-stepped, guarding the front door. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia laughed once, unamused. \u201cNot more important than breast cancer, I assure you.\u201d When I didn\u2019t move, she cocked her head. The expression she used for immediate intimidation lit her face. \u201cYou wil let me pass this instant, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, I obeyed. Seeing that she was in no mood for antics, I decided to try the blindside approach.</p><p>\u201cDaddy stole a book from someone a few years ago. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times, my words clearly unsettling to her. \u201cYour father was in shipping, Nina. What interest would he have in a book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did it, Mother. I\u2019ve seen the book myself. Jared\u2019s held it in his hands.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s cold eyes darted to Jared, and then narrowed. \u201cI must ask at this point, Jared. Are you trying to get Nina kil ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said emphatical y, taking a step toward her. \u201cNo, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We need to know why Jack took the book. What was inside that he was hoping to find?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia relaxed, lifting her chin. \u201cNina, you\u2019l find that if you ignore things...they tend to go away. Now, I real y must be going....\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s jaw flitted, and then he took an obstinate step in front of the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Grey, but I can\u2019t al ow you to leave until you tel us what you know.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia stood unaffected, as if she could brush past Jared if she chose, but she was simply too much of a lady to shove her way through.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I know anything?\u201d she asked, a tiny smirk on her face.</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cBecause you know everything, Mother.\u201d</p><p>A smal grin of satisfaction crept across Cynthia\u2019s face. \u201cYour father underestimated that particular talent of mine for years. It\u2019s nice that someone noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need your help, Cynthia,\u201d Jared said. \u201cWhy did Jack think Shax\u2019s book could save Nina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth wil only hurt you, Dear,\u201d Cynthia said. Her words were meant to be empathetic, but her eyes were devoid of emotion.</p><p>I pressed my lips together in hard line, taking her warning very seriously. Before I could make a decision, Jared spoke.</p><p>\u201cI'm only going to ask you one more time, Cynthia. What do you know about Jack's reasons for taking the book?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia chuckled. \u201cEmpty threats rarely compel me to comply.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned against the door. \u201cI have al night, Cynthia. How important is this fundraiser to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery wel , then,\u201d Cynthia said. She shifted her weight, clearly irritated. \u201cYour father never wanted children. I wasn\u2019t exactly...maternal...so I never questioned him. But when you came along, Nina, it changed him. He seemed to watch you as if he were waiting for something. I asked him, once, why he stared at you that way. His expression was both disgust and shame, but he didn't answer. He simply walked away.\u201d</p><p>Her words cut so deeply that I felt physical pain in my chest, as if a thousand needles were boring their way to the center.</p><p>Jared took my hand. \u201cJack adored Nina. He died trying to save her life.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia laughed without humor. \u201cYou misunderstand. The first time Jack held Nina in his arms, nothing else mattered. There was nothing more precious in his eyes,\u201d she paused. \u201cBut he was afraid.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to swal ow the lump that had developed in my throat. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, I suppose,\u201d Cynthia shrugged. Her eyes switched to Jared, then, resentful and accusing. \u201cWhen your father recognized that you were in love with Nina, he shared a story with Jack. It was a story within the last passages of the book you're so desperate to acquire. About a human woman giving birth to a son of God, and that child would disturb The Balance.\u201d</p><p>My face twisted. \u201cYou mean the story of the virgin Mary and Jesus? What could that possibly have to do with me and Jared?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia sighed. \u201cNo, Dear. Sons of God are angels. Hel believes a human woman wil give birth to an angel; a powerful angel that wil threaten their power here.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why Nina, then? Human women have been giving birth to Half-breeds for centuries. And even if Nina and I had a child, the baby would have just a quarter of divine blood in its veins. Nothing for Hel to be concerned about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human woman gave birth to Jesus Christ, Jared,\u201d Cynthia retorted.</p><p>\u201cHe was human,\u201d I said.</p><p>Cynthia raised an eyebrow. \u201cA mortal man who performs miracles and rises from the dead? That\u2019s some human...now if you'l excuse me....\u201d</p><p>Jared didn't budge, stil unsatisfied. \u201cGabe and Jack believed Nina to be the woman in the prophecy, and they stole the book to try to figure out a way to stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey stole it twice,\u201d Cynthia corrected. \u201cFirst, from a family...the Pol ocks. They had spent lifetimes protecting it. Shax and his men alerted the Pol ocks somehow, and your fathers were detected. While they and the Pol ock men were distracted with one another, Shax absconded with his book. It was several months before Gabe located the book again and was able to successful y retrieve it. That\u2019s when it al began.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMother,\u201d I said, impatient. \u201cWhen what began?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit, and she raised her hands, her fingers flared. \u201cThis, Nina! This! When protecting you and your father became difficult for the Ryel\u2019s, when dark things began surrounding our home on a daily basis...his death. Honestly, Nina! What else could I mean?\u201d she said, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay, I'm sorry,\u201d I said to calm her.</p><p>She relaxed, and then smoothed her expression. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I real y must be going,\u201d she said, brushing past Jared.</p> <p>Jared\u2019s features tightened, instantly metamorphosing to anger. \u201cI\u2019m trying to save Nina\u2019s life, and you\u2019re worried about being on time for a party?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia looked back at me with a sad expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a mother\u2019s duty to protect her child. But sometimes, we must let them save themselves.\u201d</p><p>Her words stung me. Our relationship was never what one may call close, but when the occasion call ed for it, she extended some emotion. She had never been cruel or unkind, but at that moment, I felt like an orphan.</p><p>My mother walked to the waiting car quickly, disappearing when Robert closed the door behind her.</p><p>Jared pul ed me into his arms, and I let my cheek burn against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you must feel right now,\u201d Jared whispered against the top of my hair. \u201cBut I want you to remember two things: Cynthia feels helpless, and that\u2019s not a feeling she deals wel with, and I want to remind you that I love you, and that love is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt before. If she makes you feel unworthy or unwanted in any way...know that every breath you take is precious to me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to thank him for the words I didn\u2019t even know myself that I needed to hear.</p><p>We walked to the large staircase, and I slumped to the first step. \u201cI don\u2019t want to...I can\u2019t think about her anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded once. \u201cSo let\u2019s think about what she said.\u201d</p><p>A smal laugh escaped my throat. \u201cThat I\u2019m the woman in Hel \u2019s prophecy? I\u2019ve been told several things in the last twenty-four hours that are, quite frankly, ridiculous, and Cynthia\u2019s story gets the prize.\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t smile. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s true? It\u2019s not like Cynthia is the most creative person on the planet. Why would she lie?\u201d</p> <p>I craned my neck, looking at him in disbelief. \u201cJared? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re fal ing for her nonsense! My father never wanted children? That\u2019s absurd! Jack was the best father anyone could ever hope for. You\u2019ve said it yourself...he worshiped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t like children. I took it as he hoped to prevent something. We need to do a little digging in your ancestry.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cWild goose chase. You\u2019re wasting time even discussing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about your family?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about your family?\u201d I retorted.</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows moved in. \u201cI have an uncle in South Dakota. My grandparents are gone, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are mine. My parents were only children, Jared. I have no family to speak of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we start with the grandparents on Jack\u2019s side,\u201d he said, standing. \u201cWhere does Cynthia keep stuff like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStuff like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily albums, newspaper cut outs...a family tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cJack has a coat of arms in his office. You can\u2019t tel me family wasn\u2019t important to him.\u201d</p><p>I cupped my chin in my hand and thought for a moment. Cynthia\u2019s words replayed in my head. Kim\u2019s story and Cynthia\u2019s were now meshed together\u2014 intertwined because of the prophecy, and the book it came from. Somehow life was even less normal than when a demon stood in my apartment. I felt like a freak.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s office...\u201d I trailed off.</p><p>\u201cYou thought of something?\u201d Jared said, pul ing me to my feet.</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cLast year, when I was in Jack\u2019s office for the Port of Providence file, one of his cabinets were locked. I never found the keys to it. When I found the file I was looking for, I sort of forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed me to my feet, quickly climbing the stairs. I tugged on the drawers of the row of file cabinets until I found one that wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said. \u201cThe keys in the desk don\u2019t work. I\u2019ve tried them.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked around the room, and then casual y yanked the drawer. It made a loud popping noise, but it opened easily enough\u2014for Jared.</p><p>\u201cWel , that\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>Jared fingered through each of the papers. \u201cYou start with the bottom drawer. We\u2019l meet in the middle.\u201d</p><p>I sat on my knees, pul ing open my designated drawer. Old pictures, bank accounts overseas, but nothing about family. The familiar frustration from the last time I had spent rummaging through his office for clues clouded my brain.</p><p>Jared powered through three drawers before I finished one, but when he reached the fourth, he stopped. He held a paper in front of his face, and then looked beyond it to the adjacent wal .</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked. Before he could answer, I noted that it was drawing of a coat of arms, similar to the one hanging from the wal .</p><p>\u201cDoes the Franks mean anything to you, Nina?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shook my head, pushing myself to my feet. \u201cNo. Should it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Irish, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So?\u201d Some days I had patience for his step-by-step approach of getting to the truth. This was not one of those days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common misconception. Surely Jack wouldn\u2019t display something that didn\u2019t specifical y belong to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost me,\u201d I said, hoping he would get to the point.</p><p>\u201cCoats Of Arms were designed to designate a knight whose face would\u2019ve been covered during battle. They are inherited from father to son, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to have a \u2018Grey\u2019 coat of arms for an entire family or last name. Jack wasn\u2019t the type to buy into that nonsense, so this must be the original, passed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Jared scanned the drawing. \u201cThis is similar, but it\u2019s not the same. And it\u2019s unlike any crest or coat of arms I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Jared handed the paper to me, and I recoiled at the misshapen beast. It had the body of a large cat, perhaps a panther or leopard, and large paws, I guessed to be the paws of a bear. Seven heads ascended from its body, with horns, and crowns sitting atop those horns. It was grotesque.</p><p>\u201cThis is our family\u2019s coat of arms? Sick,\u201d I said, handing the drawing back to Jared. \u201cNo wonder Jack changed it. He couldn\u2019t hang something that monstrous on the wal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is very similar to the creature in Revelations,\u201d Jared said, staring at the twisted black lines on the paper. The heads, the horns, the crowns....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat creature?\u201d I said, wary.</p><p>Jared made a face, and then pored over the other files in the drawer. He stopped for a moment, and then leaned in closer to the document he had paused on. His shoulders slumped. \u201cAgh...no,\u201d he whispered, his head fal ing forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said, afraid of what he might say.</p><p>He nervously rubbed the back of his neck, pul ing the paper from the drawer. He looked once more, and then shut his eyes tight.</p><p>I fidgeted. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes slowly opened, and the twin storms of his irises sent panic throughout my body. He glanced at the coat of arms on the wal . \u201cI promise you, Nina. You don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have to know at this point,\u201d I said, pul ing the paper from his hand.</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI can stil figure out how to save you without you knowing everything. We\u2019ve talked about that before. Trust me when I say that you don\u2019t want to know this.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my eyes to the paper. It was a list of names, similar to a family tree, but it only fol owed one line. My name was at the bottom. Higher on the list, names like Dagobert the third, and Clovis the first. The name at the top, Merovius, had two fathers: King Clodian; the other name caused my legs to disappear, and I dropped the paper to the floor.</p><p>Jared supported my weight. \u201cSweetheart?\u201d he said, pul ing my chin up so that he could see into my eyes. He lifted me into his arms and carried me to Jack\u2019s desk chair, kneeling before me.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what does that mean? What the hel is a Beast of the Sea?\u201d I wailed.</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a story, Nina, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared\u2019s jaws fluttered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d</p><p>A smal smile touched Jared\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re human. You just have some pretty potent blood running through your veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know,\u201d I said, touching his cheek with my fingertips.</p><p>Jared seemed just as horrified as I was. In the beginning, he had tortured himself over bringing me into his world, stealing away my mundane life forever. Now it was I that regretted involving him in my life\u2014we were both spiraling into a nightmare that didn't seem to end.</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cMerovingians. You\u2019re a Merovingian, Nina. A very long time ago, your family ruled with divine power, under the belief that they are direct descendants of Jesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus didn\u2019t have children,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cThey myth is that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, and their children are the ancestors of the Merovingian blood line. It\u2019s known in less human circles that the story was perpetuated to keep the Merovingians in power. There are people even today that believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not true? That's a relief. I'm at least somewhat less of a freak.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked away, cautiously choosing his next words. \u201cHave you heard of the Nephilim, Nina?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, dreading where his story would go.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cHave you heard of the story of David and Goliath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I sniffed, \u201cThe skinny kid that threw a rock at a giant\u2019s head and kil ed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoliath was not one of a kind. He had family, people...Antediluvian Giants. Some call ed them Anakim, other refer to them as Nephilim. They had many tribes, and their remains have been found, measuring anywhere from nine and a half feet to fourteen feet. Some have two ful rows of teeth.</p><p>They were different; not completely human. The Holy Bible acknowledges their origin in Genesis: \u2018That the sons of God saw the daughters of men were fair, and they took them wives of all which they chose. The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also after, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children unto them.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSons of God? Like the ones Cynthia was talking about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know the whole Bible by heart?\u201d I asked, attempting to detour the frightening thought swirling in my mind.</p><p>\u201cMost of it,\u201d he said, a corner of his mouth slightly turning up. It vanished as quickly as it appeared. \u201cGod wiped out the Nephilim with the great flood because their blood was contaminated. He needed a direct line from Adam to Abraham, because that is the blood line that was prophesied to bring the Messiah. Noah was his way to decontaminate the blood line, and assure the prophecy would come about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brain hurts,\u201d I complained, rubbing my head.</p><p>Jared kissed my hair, wrapping his arms around me. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m tel ing you?\u201d he whispered softly. \u201cJack didn\u2019t want children because he knew he carried Nephilim blood, and the Merovingians are part of the prophecy in the Naissance de Demoniac. He knew when I fel in love with you, that you and I would meet al of the requirements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat requirements?\u201d My voice was muffled from pushing my face into his chest.</p><p>\u201cA prophecy requires certain elements to come together in order to come to fruition, Nina. A descendant of the Nephilim procreating with a Hybrid...it\u2019s the perfect storm. Remember when Eli told us that only seven other human/hybrid cases had happened since the dawn of time? How many of those humans do you think were Merovingian? Jack knew you were the woman in the book because he knew what he was...and what I was. Once he knew I was in love with you, he made the decision to steal Shax\u2019s book to try to find a way to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d I cringed. I kept asking questions I didn\u2019t want the answers to.</p><p>He lifted my chin to face him. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need the book. I need to find out what interest they might have in a child we might have. I don\u2019t know if they want it to happen, or they wil fight to prevent it. It depends on what that scenario means for Hel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait...,\u201d I said, my mind final y focusing enough to form coherent thoughts, \u201cyou said the Nephilim were wiped out in the big flood. So how can I be related to them?\u201d</p><p>Jared raised his eyebrows once, sighing. \u201cThat was a tactic used to keep Jesus\u2019 blood line pure. That doesn\u2019t mean fal en angels taking human women didn\u2019t happen after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, deflated. \u201cI\u2019m five-feet-four, Jared. How is it even possible I could have even an ounce of giant blood in me?\u201d</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re Irish, too. Makes me wonder how you\u2019re Merovingian. They were leaders of the Franks...early German and French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , now I know Jack was wrong. I couldn\u2019t be French. The language is lost on me.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s face turned grave. \u201cWe should take this seriously, Nina. We\u2019re in the middle of a war. If I could leave you, that would be one thing, but I can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth flew open. \u201cWhy would you even say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it's the right thing to do...disappear from your life to keep you safe. As long as we're together, you're in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won't let you,\u201d I said, grabbing his shirt,. The thought of being without him terrified me. \u201cIf I can't be with you, I don't care what happens to me.\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed my hands. \u201cI know. That's why I won't leave you. And now that we know what you are, we need to find out who it\u2019s a threat to. And as frightening as it is...threatening Hel is the better option.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Valediction</p><p>An unexpected knock on the door revealed Bex standing on the landing, holding a half-eaten apple. A backpack hung from his shoulder, signaling that he would be staying the night.</p><p>\u201cYou call ed him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I accused Jared, crossing my arms.</p><p>Jared slipped on his jacket, preparing to leave. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long forty-eight hours. You need sleep.\u201d He hugged me then, squeezing a bit too tight.</p> <p>Bex shifted his weight nervously, holding the door open with one hand, holding his apple with the other.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Nina. You\u2019re going to give me a complex,\u201d Bex said. \u201cI brought doves to put in the oven.\u201d A sweet, hopeful smile lit his face, and I relaxed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said with a half-grin.</p><p>Jared patted Bex's arm as he passed, but just as he stepped out onto the landing, I grabbed his jacket. \u201cWait. What if it\u2019s different? What if he needs to tel me something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jared asked, his attention focused.</p><p>\u201cGabe. Or Jack. We\u2019ve learned a lot today, maybe the dream wil change.\u201d</p> <p>Jared and Bex traded glances, and then Jared sighed. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think we have time to spare,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t, but....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right. You know I'm right. So stay,\u201d I said, pul ing him into the loft.</p><p>Jared pointed at his brother. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Bex shook his head, and then shut the door behind us. \u201cNo way...I wanna see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, now I\u2019m a circus freak,\u201d I said, making my way to the table. Jared pul ed out my chair and I sat, taking his hand and kissing his palm in appreciation. We had spent the last two days together, yet I felt I hadn\u2019t seen him at al .</p><p>Jared sat across from me with a smile. \u201cYou are far from a circus freak. You\u2019re amazing. Big difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWatching me float and scream is not amazing,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou only floated once,\u201d Bex pointed out, unwrapping the dove and seasoning it before shoving the baking dish into the oven.</p><p>We discussed the possibilities for over an hour: how I could do things in my sleep that I couldn't do in a conscious state.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn't matter how. What is important is why,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cYou're going to overcook your birds,\u201d Jared said, nodding to the oven.</p><p>Bex jumped up, tending to dinner. He placed our plates of tender, steaming dove and mixed vegetables in front of us, and then returned quickly with his own. \u201cI\u2019ve got to figure out how to do that. If she can do it, we have to be able to do it, right?\u201d he said to Jared, shoveling meat into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not doing it, Bex,\u201d Jared said. His eyes darted from me to Bex in warning. It was clear he didn\u2019t want to dwel on the subject during dinner.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right,\u201d Bex said, chewing.</p><p>After I finished the diner dishes, I retreated to the downstairs tub, lingering long enough to let my fingers transform to dried raisins, and then I wrapped myself in my favorite terry cloth robe, making my way to the bed. Jared was waiting for me, his hair stil wet from the shower. I crawled under the sheet next to him, relaxing my cheek against his bare chest.</p><p>I breathed him in, focusing on the moment we were in, bathing in the gift of peace and stil ness. No one spoke of Others or giants. Just us, in our quiet space in time. It was in those moments that I found Heaven, and he was there with me, I could tel , as he pul ed me in closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d he breathed. \u201cNothing bad wil happen to you, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear,\u201d I grinned, my eyes growing heavy. That heaviness rested over my entire body, warm and inviting. Jared\u2019s skin felt like a silky electric blanket against mine, and I let myself sink into it. Any light that seeped through my eyelids extinguished, letting the darkness take me deeper into oblivion.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d a voice said somewhere in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve real y done it this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d I said, sitting up. I was in my old bedroom. Jack sat at the foot of my bed. He was as I remembered him, his salt and pepper hair perfectly in place, his dark, no-nonsense eyes looking softly upon me, clean-shaven and in his favorite gray suit.</p><p>He smiled, but his eyes were sad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I failed you. You\u2019l have to save yourself, now.\u201d</p><p>My lower lip quivered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tel me?\u201d</p><p>Jack placed his thick hand on my ankle, his expression pained. \u201cI tried, many times. I couldn\u2019t bear to see those sweet eyes sad. I wanted you to have everything, Nina; most of al a normal life.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI hope it\u2019s nice where you are,\u201d I said, my eyes burning from the salty tears lining my lower lashes.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing missing is you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once, and looked down to my hands. \u201cI wish you were real y here. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind the book, Nina,\u201d Jack said. The change of his voice made me look up. His chin was lowered, and he looked at me from under his brow\u2014 the way he always had when he wanted me to listen.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d I said, seeing movement behind him, slowly approaching us from the darkness.</p><p>Shax strol ed into the light. His black eyes hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up, Nina,\u201d Jack said with an apologetic expression.</p><p>I glowered at Shax. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, anger bursting from every pore in my skin.</p><p>Shax\u2019s head cocked to the side like an animal. \u201cWhat is she to us, Jack? Why do you protect her so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s my daughter,\u201d Jack said firmly, standing. He walked to the bedroom door, and then turned to face Shax, his hand on the knob.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve underestimated my family many times, Beast. This time may be your last.\u201d</p><p>Shax waved him away, and a loud noise forced me to cover my ears. Misshapen arms exploded through the door, throwing splintered wood onto the floor and my covers. Before I could recover from the noise, Jack was pul ed through the door. Only traces of his blood on the door jamb and carpet had been left behind.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed, reaching out from my bed.</p><p>Shax took a step closer, and I recoiled.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d I said, looking around the room for something to use to defend myself.</p><p>Shax lurched forward, his wild, black eyes and sharp features inches from my face. I scampered back, first against the head of my bead.</p><p>Panicked, I continued to crawl backward away from him, and found myself half- way up the wal .</p><p>Shax stood, looking up at me. He smiled with his crooked mouth and perfectly white teeth. \u201cRunning wil get you nowhere, Precious. We know what you are.\u201d</p><p>He jumped, landing on al fours on the wal . My arms and legs couldn\u2019t move fast enough as I climbed backward up the remainder of the wal .</p><p>Shax's arms and legs made quick, jerking movements as he moved slowly toward me. His body looked twisted and unnatural.</p><p>When I realized I was on the ceiling, looking down at my bed, I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWake me up, Jared! Wake me up!\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, and I was back at the loft. Jared, Bex, and the bed were al twelve feet below me.</p><p>\u201cAgh!\u201d I screamed as I fel face-down onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta learn how to do that!\u201d Bex said, jumping once with excitement.</p><p>Jared immediately turned me onto my back. \u201cNina?\u201d he said, brushing my hair from my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, angry.</p><p>\u201cThat...was creepy,\u201d Jared said, scanning me with his dark-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe was like Spiderman! That was freakin\u2019 incredible!\u201d Bex said. \u201cI bet I can do that. I\u2019m going to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t float or climb wal s,\u201d Jared said through his teeth. The skin around his eyes was tight with worry.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s human! Even if she\u2019s influenced, if she can do it, we must be able to!\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows pul ed in. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I took a breath. \u201cJack was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Shax came. He said he knew what I was. Jack said that Shax had underestimated our family before. He said to get the book.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he meant now,\u201d I said, feeling a sense of urgency.</p><p>Jared looked to Bex, who was looking around the loft, listening.</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Bex nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe al need to pack a few things,\u201d Jared said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be gone for a couple of days. I want to be in the car and ready to go in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jared's and Bex's forms turned obscure as they raced around the room at impossible speed, and I immediately pul ed on a hooded sweatshirt and jeans, and then shoved my bare feet into sneakers. Jared held the door open for me as I pul ed my hair back into a ponytail. The iron steps knocked and echoed with my footsteps alone, although Bex was in front of me, with Jared fol owing behind.</p><p>Bex threw our bags into the back of the Escalade, and then froze. He looked into the air, waiting for something.</p><p>\u201cAre they coming?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared paused, and then took a step toward the loft. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Bex shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Jared left me, then. My eyes barely kept up with his blurry form sprinting into the loft.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d I said. Bex moved in front of me in a protective stance, and then gasped.</p><p>The building exploded. Multiple bal s of fire rol ed into the sky. Debris shot toward Bex and me, and he turned his back to the explosion, shielding my body from the blast. I crawled out from under him, seeing the bright orange glow of heat and smoke that used to be our home.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I wailed, reaching over Bex. I knew trying to escape from him grip was futile, but the explosion had happened less than a second after Jared had reached the stairs, and I was desperate to get to him.</p><p>I looked up to Jared\u2019s little brother. His eyes were wide. He clearly didn\u2019t know what to think. We waited there, and even though the fire roared before us, everything was silent.</p><p>I waited for Jared to emerge from the rubble. Every second that passed seemed like an eternity, and panic began to overwhelm any rational thought I tried to have.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jared,\u201d Bex said, his grip on my arms a bit tighter.</p><p>\u201cGo get him,\u201d I demanded, my voice broken and shaking.</p><p>\u201cI have to stay here with you,\u201d Bex said. He seemed confused and in shock.</p><p>I pushed at Bex. \u201cHe\u2019s in there somewhere! Go get him!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Bex grabbed each side of my face, looking deep into my eyes. \u201cThey are here, Nina. They\u2019re al around us. I can\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood kid,\u201d Jared said from behind us. His hair and clothes were singed, his face covered in soot, and the skin on his cheek bone was scraped and bleeding, but he was alive.</p><p>He held up two dusty picture frames; one with the black and white picture of me he took the day he fel in love with me, the other of us playing at the beach in Little Corn.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that to me ever again!\u201d I yel ed, bal ing up my fists, and landing them straight into Jared\u2019s chest.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me tightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I realized what was about to happen, and I had to go. These pictures were the only things in the loft I couldn\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>We turned to watch at our home fal in defeat to the fire. The beams creaked as they gave way, and glowing ash was thrown into the sky, floating al around us. My eyes poured out rivers of tears. I\u2019d never realized how much I loved the loft until I witnessed it dying in front of me. Memories of our first date, listening to our song for the first time, cooking together, laughing, watching Claire and Bex grow a little more each time they entered the front door. It was al gone; reduced to cinders.</p><p>Sirens sounded in the distance.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Jared said, gently escorting me to the passenger side of the Escalade.</p><p>As he pul ed away, I watched the flames and glowing smoke until I couldn\u2019t see them anymore, and then turned to face forward. Jared placed his hand over mine, and then Bex put his hand over ours.</p><p>\u201cIt had to be Donovan,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. Claire took care of al the humans that might be a threat to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Donovan,\u201d Jared said. His knuckles turned white against the steering wheel.</p><p>Bex leaned back in the seat. \u201cHe\u2019s the closest human to Shax. Claire left him alive because he's the Taleh of a Half-breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, looking to Jared for confirmation.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIsaac. Very fast, very strong, but emotional. He's been known to make mistakes, but he's stil dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, processing what Jared had said. \u201cSo to kil Donovan we\u2019d have to kil a Hybrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any Hybrid,\u201d Bex said. \u201cThe son of Michael. An angel in the Holy Army. A warrior of God. At His word, they would exterminate entire blood lines, entire kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, pul ing the Escalade down a road leading us out of town. \u201cMichael belongs to a family of angels that embodies God's Wrath, and if harm came to his son, that would be an act of war against Heaven. That is the only reason Donovan is stil alive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Escalade bounced over the uneven gravel road, and Jared came to a stop just outside a familiar chain-link fence. We walked hand-in-hand to the Warehouse where I met Eli. Jared pushed the button and we waited. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said he wouldn\u2019t speak to you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared stood silent, patient, and calm. Twenty long minutes passed, and then we were final y buzzed in. The breath Jared had silently held, he released. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Bex led the way through the dusty, cement hal . My footsteps echoed throughout the capacious room the hal opened up to, encased by a hundred dirty windows.</p> <p>As before, we waited in the center.</p><p>Jared\u2019s and Bex\u2019s faces were marked by soot from the fire. Their expressions were composed, waiting for Eli to decide to show himself.</p><p>An hour passed, and stil we waited. Jared slid his arms from his jacket and hung it on my shoulders. I hadn\u2019t even noticed the cold, but once the added heat was around me, I shivered.</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d Jared said. His words could have been directed at me or at Bex, I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>After another hour, the columns of glass were ignited by the rising sun. Rays of white pierced through, il uminating the elegantly floating dust motes in its path. Glowing yel ow squares infringed upon the shadows, and soon the entire floor glowed and warmed with the glorious grace of morning light.</p> <p>\u201cNina,\u201d a voice call ed from across the room. Eli walked toward us, his eyes focused only on me. He was dressed in the same attire he wore the last time we met: The crisp, white shirt, the jeans and sandals, and the spiky blonde hair. He made a click noise with his tongue. \u201cYou aren\u2019t getting enough rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew that,\u201d I smiled sleepily.</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up, but it wasn\u2019t quite a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cupcake. I haven\u2019t been much help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you help us now?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cWe would love to, Jared. We\u2019ve been instructed not to,\u201d Eli said. Compassion was in his eyes, but not apology.</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d Bex asked, genuinely confused.</p> <p>Jared watched Eli for a moment, and then frowned. \u201cThey won\u2019t intervene unless The Balance is disturbed.\u201d</p><p>Eli reached his hand to me, and I took it. He pul ed me into him gently. He towered over me, and I felt like a child wrapped in his arms. Emotion overwhelmed me, and I let myself tremble and weep unreservedly in the quiet sanctuary of his embrace. Jared\u2019s hand touched my shoulder; Bex\u2019s smal er hand touched my back. A sob that had been hiding somewhere deep within me found its way to the surface.</p><p>It felt good to cry. I had just seen my father for the first time since his death. The pressure and horror of being the center of a story Hel took very seriously, and now hearing that Heaven was unwil ing to help, hope was dwindling. Crying was a sweet release, and in Eli\u2019s arms, it was natural, much like a tearful moment in my father\u2019s lap when I was hurt or frightened.</p><p>Eli released me, and tenderly grasped a lock of my hair. \u201cYou have grieved for your former life, Nina Grey. It is time to rise up as the woman you are: Strong, determined,\u201d he smiled, \u201cand stubborn.\u201d He walked away from us, looking at the sky through the windows. \u201cHumans see life as so precious when it\u2019s fleeting. Add in the defensive instincts of a mother, and you\u2019re nearly unstoppable, even in your fragile shel . It\u2019s more inspiring each time I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s not pregnant,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d Eli said, turning with a knowing smile. \u201cLet us visit again when the time is right. At the time when you have no more questions to ask but one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat question is that?\u201d I asked, but he was gone. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get Nina back,\u201d Jared said.</p> <p>\u201cBack to where, Jared? Did you forget your house is toast?\u201d Bex said.</p><p>I shook my head, stil in disbelief. Jared enveloped me in his arms, warmer and even more inviting than Eli\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou have three choices, Nina: Cynthia\u2019s, Lil ian\u2019s, or Kim\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim\u2019s?\u201d I sneered. \u201cEven if I did stil consider her my friend, I have no desire to live in the dorms again.\u201d</p><p>Jared grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s the safest, option, Nina, and yes, she\u2019s stil your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she the safest?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Bex grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t mess with her. She\u2019s like bug spray.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cShe would hate that if she heard you.\u201d</p><p>Bex pul ed a gun from the back of his jeans and scratched his head with the barrel. \u201cOkay. Where to, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stil have things at Cynthia\u2019s. We\u2019l go there,\u201d I said, taking in a deep breath. Luckily, Cynthia was consistently busy with charities, so she would be out and about more often than not.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go there,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>My mouth fel open. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without you. You told me once you couldn\u2019t go back to that, again. What happened to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my first choice, I assure you,\u201d he said, an uncomfortable grin twisting his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my house, Jared. You\u2019re coming,\u201d I said. I looked at Bex, then. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a room for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a room, thanks,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared began.</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cIf you make me go to that house alone, I wil spend al of my time in Jack\u2019s office. I'l move my bed in there. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>Jared had once told me that Jack's office was the only room in my parents' home that wasn't wired with microphones or cameras. Jared could stil hear me, of course, but having to guess what I was doing drove him crazy.</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t swear at Him. We need Him on our side.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cCynthia\u2019s it is, then.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Kil ing the Messenger</p><p>Nothing goes as planned. People say goodbye. Buildings burn, and the impossibility of moving back in with Cynthia Grey after the age of eighteen can actual y happen.</p><p>As I stood before the colossal home my father left to me after his death, I felt a bit nauseous at the prospect of walking its hal s everyday again.</p><p>Some of my best and worst memories happened within those wal s: Jack chasing me down the hal s, cooking my first meal, my father dying before my eyes, and everything I thought he was slipping away as I read a hidden file on the second floor.</p><p>But it was stil home.</p><p>The gravel crunched beneath my feet as Jared walked me up the steps to the front door. The sun had hidden behind the thick clouds that were quickly moving in, and the air smell ed like a mixture of winter and spring.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out as the wind blew the blonde strands of my hair against my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going to get unpacked and organized. I have to go into Titan before they think I\u2019ve defected.\u201d</p><p>Jared tossed the keys to Bex. \u201cUpdate Mom and Claire. I need you back here at six thirty.\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded once. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>The smell of freshly brewed coffee fil ed the air as we walked in, and Cynthia's heals signaled her approach. She stopped suddenly in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cOh! You startled me. Real y, Nina, you could at least call if you\u2019re going to visit so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not visiting. We\u2019re moving in,\u201d I said, making my way up the stairs.</p><p>Cynthia rushed to the first step, looking up at us. \u201cWhat on earth are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to face her. \u201cDonovan set explosives in the loft. Everything except what\u2019s in our bags is gone.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia paused for a moment, a common tactic of hers to calm her voice before she spoke when she was angry or taken off-guard. \u201cWel . I\u2019m glad Nina\u2019s safe. How long wil you be staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndefinitely,\u201d I said.</p><p>I had reached the top before she spoke again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re filthy,\u201d she snapped, her heels clicking to the kitchen.</p><p>I smiled. She was always snippy when she didn\u2019t want to show emotion\u2014the soft sort.</p><p>Trying to find a professional ensemble from my high school wardrobe was nothing short of frustrating. It was then that it hit me that al of my belongings were gone. Everything Jared and I had purchased together, the bed we shared...the downstairs tub. Different items in the loft flickered through my mind. It was strange how each of them, however insignificant they used to seem, were attached to a memory.</p><p>Tears pooled in my eyes and escaped down my cheek. I wiped them away and groaned. \u201cI have nothing to wear! What was I thinking buying this crap?\u201d I yel ed. \u201cNot a single pair of pumps matches anything in my closet!\u201d</p><p>Jared sat on the end of bed, letting me express my anger and frustration with an understanding expression. After the rage-fueled tirade to find the right pair of shoes, I rode with Jared to Titan Mercantile.</p><p>We didn't speak for most of the trip. Jared kept his eyes on the road, no doubt formulating a plan for the next step in finding the book. I was too tired to initiate conversation, or to try to find out piece by piece what plan of action he was considering.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Jared smiled.</p><p>I kissed his cheek, and then stepped out onto the curb, looking back once more before pushing through the entrance doors.</p><p>Beth waited me for me in my office, already organizing my call list in order of importance.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the conference with the Japanese firm at nine,\u201d she said, her head down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you a mil ion times, Beth. Yawatahama. It\u2019s not that hard if you practice.\u201d</p><p>Beth raised her hands in frustration and then dropped them, letting the papers in her hands slap her thighs. \u201cI sound ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cSasha laughs at me every time I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, to hel with Sasha. Ask her to say something German. She sounds like a bloated mule.\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed out loud, surprised at my mood. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping again, are you?\u201d</p><p>Two quick knocks, and then Grant opened my office door wide, keeping his hand on the knob. \u201cThe prodigal daughter returns! How was your trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Grant. I\u2019m busy, what do you need?\u201d I said, putting the phone to my ear.</p><p>His expression screwed, his nose wrinkling in disgust. \u201cThe Bainbridge group wil be here in twenty minutes, Nina. Why didn\u2019t you just wear pajamas?\u201d</p><p>From col arbone to scalp, the burn of infuriation ignited my face in what I was sure was a beautiful shade of tomato red. My outstretched arm, with a rigid, pointed finger at the end, silently warned Grant to leave.</p><p>\u201cBack away slowly, Mr. Bristol. No sudden movements,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>Grant nodded, stepping backward until he was out of sight.</p><p>Beth placed a smal bag on my desk. \u201cFoundation, blush, mascara and gloss. Get it on. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs in fifteen.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door softly behind her, and I took a deep breath. Just get through the day, I thought.</p><p>My cel phone rang once. \u201cNot now, Jared,\u201d I said aloud, knowing he could hear. The second ring cut short. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered. I opened the compact from Beth\u2019s bag, and looked at myself in the mirror. \u201cHoly Banshee, Nina! Get yourself together!\u201d I said to myself.</p><p>Sasha stood next to the coffeemaker in the meeting room. \u201cMiss Grey,\u201d she said handing me a fresh, steaming mug.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, frowning with confusion at her polar disposition. Wondering what she was up to was not on my agenda for the morning, not to mention I didn\u2019t have the time or patience for it. That wouldn\u2019t stop me from finding out, however.</p><p>The meeting went smoothly, and then I returned to my office, opening the door long enough for Beth to fol ow me through. I turned to see Grant and Sasha just behind her, but I shut the door. \u201cNot now,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Nina. Total y unprofessional,\u201d Sasha said, half laughing, half surprised.</p><p>Beth watched the door for a moment in shock, and then turned to me. \u201cWhat the heck\u2019s going on with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that smell ? Have you been...camping?\u201d she said, sniffing once.</p><p>I puffed, blowing my bangs from my face. \u201cNo. The loft is gone. Burned to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Beth yelped.</p><p>\u201cKeep it down. I don\u2019t need a bunch of sympathetic wel wishers in and out of my office al day. Do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Honey, anything.\u201d</p><p>I pul ed a black credit card from my purse and handed it to her. \u201cGo shopping for me. I need work clothes mainly, and undergarments, and a new briefcase. Makeup. You know what I use. And,\u201d I looked down, \u201cI want a pair of those,\u201d I said, nodding to her pink satin pumps. Even in my foul mood, I couldn\u2019t stop admiring the black lace col ar and bow at the toe.</p><p>Beth smiled. \u201cYes Ma\u2019am. You need a place to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes,\u201d Beth said, her mouth pul ing to one side.</p><p>\u201cTel me about it. And, Beth? If you can find anything to get the smoke out of my hair...get it. I don\u2019t care how much it costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemon juice,\u201d she said. \u201cThen wash it out with shampoo. That\u2019s what I do after I visit my Uncle.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Beth shut the door, and then I heard a scuffle.</p><p>\u201cI said no!\u201d Beth said, stumbling back against the door.</p><p>Sasha pushed her way through, and then smiled, smoothing her blazer and hair. \u201cNina. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Beth stared at Sasha as if she\u2019d gone insane.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Sasha said with a smile, breathing hard from her scuffle with Beth. \u201cIt wil just take a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Beth,\u201d I said, motioning for Sasha to sit.</p><p>Beth narrowed her eyes. \u201cMaybe for you, but if I wasn\u2019t at work I would have kicked her bony little ass,\u201d she said through her teeth, slamming the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWel ,\u201d Sasha said, settling in the seat. \u201cSo much for southerners having manners.</p><p>\u201cKeep in mind Beth holds grudges,\u201d I said, thumbing through papers on my desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? She\u2019s... southern.\u201d She said the word with disdain. I could see in her eyes that at least five generations of Eastern audacity had blinded her to how tacky she sounded.</p><p>I looked up. \u201cYes, wel ...they\u2019re polite. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make an enemy out of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sasha said, looking back to the door nervously. \u201cI...er...Grant wanted me to ask you about the Christmas party.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cI have faxes coming out of my ears, and you\u2019re shoving your way into my office to talk about finger foods? Don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no....\u201d she fidgeted. \u201cI wanted your permission to chair it this year. I was hoping we could make it into more of a bal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bal ,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>Sasha smiled widely. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I waved her away. \u201cCheck with Jessica on the second floor about the budget. Stay within parameters, and personal y, Sasha, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s strained smile barely lasted until she reached the hal .</p><p>The rest of the day passed without event, or maybe it was because no one dared to approach with me with anything less urgent than my office being on fire. The consequential spunk the insufficient sleep had graced me with was working. I hadn\u2019t enjoyed Titan that much since I moved into Jack\u2019s office.</p><p>By the time five o'clock rol ed around, I trudged to the elevator and welcomed Jared\u2019s arm when he offered it. The sluggish, heavy feeling over my body was familiar. I was reverting back to my former zombie days.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re getting sleep tonight. Bex wil be there at seven.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I\u2019d said anything aloud, but didn\u2019t have enough energy to ask. Just sitting in the passenger seat, watching trees and pedestrians move past my window was exhausting. If I was coherent, I would feel ridiculous for the permanent shocked expression on my face as I tried to keep both upper lids away from the lowers by pushing my eyebrows as high as they would go\u2014but I wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Jared wrapped his arm around my waist, leading me into the house. When the old, heavy door closed behind us, Jared stopped.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Cynthia call ed, appearing from the hal way. \u201cYou have a guest waiting for you in the Great Room.\u201d</p><p>I puffed.</p><p>\u201cLet me take your things, Love,\u201d Agatha said, pul ing my make-shift brief case from my hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I mumbled. I walked down the main hal , into the Great Room, blinking to focus once I recognized that it was Kim sitting alone on our large, green sofa. She sat on the edge of her seat; her hands bal ed tightly together atop her knees. I sat across from her in my mother\u2019s favorite Italian occasional chair.</p><p>It was then that I noticed Jared hadn\u2019t joined us, but had gone upstairs to prepare for a night away, instead.</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d I said, blinking slowly.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you need a nap,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNightmares.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked to the floor, nodding. \u201cNigh, you don\u2019t get to hate me. I would understand if the demonic voodoo stuff gave you the heebie-jeebies, but you\u2019re just mad because you think I lied to you.\u201d</p><p>The rankling produced a second wind. \u201cYou did lie to me. I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>Her head popped up. \u201cAnd I know you? Jared\u2019s half-angel, and you\u2019re not exactly your run-of-the-mil Brown co-ed yourself, Miss Merovingian.</p><p>Have they told you what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told me,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cSo, I just came to tel you that we\u2019re stil friends. And you can like it, and let me piss you off like I used to without worrying if you\u2019re real y pissed.</p><p>Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I\u2019m pooped,\u201d I said, pushing myself from the chair.</p><p>\u201cReal y? We\u2019re good?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I turned, and seeing her expectant eyes, I smiled. \u201cYeah, Kim. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Kim stood, and then held out both of her arms, jutting her lip out. \u201cHugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit it.\u201d</p><p>She let her hands fal to her thighs with a slap. \u201cWel , thought I\u2019d try.\u201d</p><p>I walked her to the door, and she leaned close to my ear. \u201cI\u2019m going with Jared tonight. I\u2019ll try not to make out with him while we\u2019re hunting down your book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cKiss noise,\u201d Kim said, jogging down the drive to her Sentra. How had I missed that horrid thing? I was more tired than I thought.</p><p>Jared met me at the bottom of the staircase. He held my arm for a few steps, and then gave up, lifting me in his arms, and carrying me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared lowered me to the overstuffed mattress in my room. \u201cIn the morning. Bex is here. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>I'm not sure when I fel asleep, or how long Jared stayed, because I was unconscious the moment my head hit the pil ow. The nightmares stayed away, even after my previous nightmare of Shax being in that very room. I was so tired, and slept so hard, that I didn\u2019t dream at al .</p><p>I peeled my eyes open to see Bex standing at the end of the bed. \u201cJust so you know, that\u2019s creepy,\u201d I said, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot as scary as your hair,\u201d he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re grumpy this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia doesn\u2019t trust me in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Three knocks at the door, and Cynthia backed in to my room, a tray in her hands. \u201cGood morning. I thought I would bring you breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Agatha have the day off?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s downstairs. Why?\u201d Cynthia asked.</p><p>I watched my mother for a moment in disbelief, and then shook my head. \u201cNothing. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia left as quickly as she came in. \u201cMind the coffee, Dear, it\u2019s hot,\u201d she call ed back as her heels clicked down the hal .</p><p>Bex\u2019s eyebrows were nearly touching as his frown deepened. He had never been to my parents\u2019 home, to my knowledge, and he wasn\u2019t enjoying it at al .</p><p>\u201cShe warms up,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hop in the shower. Has Jared call ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, picking up the remote control, switching on the television. \u201cBut he\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a moment, and decided I already knew the answer. They could sense each other, and Bex was the most in-tune out of the three Hybrid siblings.</p><p>My morning routine finished without event, including Jared's return home. \u201cI thought you said he was coming,\u201d I said, tightening my robe.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Bex said, his eyes stationary on the screen.</p><p>\u201cNina, Love?\u201d Agatha call ed from the hal .</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I said, opening the door. Agatha was holding several bags, and Beth stood behind her, her arms ful of bags as wel .</p><p>\u201cYou said you lost everything,\u201d Beth said, brushing past me to the closet. She disappeared into my walk in, hanging the plastic-covered clothing on the nearly-empty iron rods.</p><p>I opened the door, watching her pul shoes boxes from one of the large sacks. Once she was finished, she looked at her watch. \u201cCrap! I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, whipping around.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. That was so fun. I think I went a little overboard.\u201d</p><p>She waved, and then rushed back the way she came, her legs moving a thousand miles per hour. I shut the closet door behind me, and pul ed the first outfit I touched off its hanger. When I walked out into the bedroom, I froze in my tracks.</p><p>Jared stood in the center of my room, covered in dirt, blood, and his was face scraped and blotchy.</p><p>\u201cOh my...oh my God!\u201d I yel ed, rushing over to him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Kim walked in behind Jared, untouched. \u201cI told him not to go without me, but he\u2019s faster than I am.\u201d</p><p>I touched Jared\u2019s face. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThe book was in my hand. I had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d I said, helping him pul off his jacket. He was stiff, and cringed with pain.</p><p>Kim\u2019s usual y stoic expression twisted as she watched me pul his t-shirt up and over his head. \u201cWarwick,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got the book, but Donovan was there.\u201d</p><p>Six raw, bloody and swol en bul et holes dotted different areas of Jared\u2019s torso, accompanied by a large gash along his shoulder blade.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Bex left without a word.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I call ed after him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find something to pul the fragments out.\u201d</p><p>I helped him to the bed, and then took a deep breath. It didn\u2019t help. Tears wel ed up in my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, right?\u201d</p><p>Jared managed a smile. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll be good as new this time tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Bex returned with a towel ful of different items. \u201cIsaac too much for you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaac.\u201d Jared scoffed, rol ing his eyes. Donovan and his Glock. And I plowed through approximately eighty demons before I got to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would have waited for me to catch up with you, you wouldn\u2019t have had to waste your time with them,\u201d Kim snapped. She looked to me, \u201cThe second he learned the location of the book, he took off. I was twenty minutes behind him.\u201d</p><p>I glared at Jared. \u201cThat\u2019s not like you to be so impulsive and reckless. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cThat I wanted this to end.\u201d</p><p>Jared cringed, and then I heard a plink from behind him as Bex dropped bul et remnants into a bowl.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t watch,\u201d I said, covering my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go anywhere until we\u2019re finished here. Then I\u2019ll take you to work,\u201d Bex said, pul ing out another bul et.</p><p>\u201cWatch the blood. Don\u2019t get any on her sheets,\u201d Jared said, cringing again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get new sheets,\u201d I moaned. I took Jared\u2019s hand in both of mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019l try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hopeful y not be so stupid about it this time,\u201d Kim said from the door way.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I care about that? I don\u2019t want you near that book ever again!\u201d I said, my voice higher with each word.</p><p>\u201cOkay...okay,\u201d Jared said. \u201cDon\u2019t get upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be upset? My boyfriend comes home looking like he just escaped from a horror movie.\u201d I took one of the wet cloths Bex had brought upstairs and used it to wipe a deep cut above his eye. \u201cTel me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe details aren\u2019t important,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cThe bottom line is, I failed,\u201d Jared said, his teeth clinched.</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cWe know who\u2019s guarding it, what they\u2019re capable of, and every angle of their defense, Jared. I wouldn\u2019t call that failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s Isaac like?\u201d Bex said, dropping more fragments into the plate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s highly trained,\u201d Jared answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd psychotic,\u201d Kim said. \u201cYou should have seen them. It was like a scene from Rambo. Neither of them would quit, and they\u2019re both Hybrids, so it was like a never-ending fight scene. One punch here, knife wound there, elbow, face punch, and then one of them goes flying across the room.</p><p>Lather. Rinse. Repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>My stomach wrenched at her words. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go back. Not until Bex or Claire can go with you.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t handle it on my own, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He frowned, apology in his eyes. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cKim\u2019s right. We did learn a lot last night. The problem is, Claire\u2019s not here, and Bex has to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about someone else? Another Hybrid?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Bex laughed once. \u201cIf it comes down to it, we\u2019l have to take Donovan down. No one is going to help us down another Hybrid without good reason.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at Jared\u2019s bloodied hands, and then back to his stormy blue-grey eyes. \u201cAnd saving me isn\u2019t good enough for them.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cWe have to persuade them that something big is coming, and to do that we need the book.\u201d</p><p>Kim knocked on the door jamb. \u201cNow that\u2019s irony. C\u2019mon, Nigh. I\u2019ll take you to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d I asked Jared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you wait,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Kim said. She pul ed up her shirt, revealing a handgun stuffed half-way into her jeans. \u201cI\u2019m packin\u2019, demons run when they see me coming, and as Donovan learned last night...my right hook is wicked accurate.\u201d</p><p>The glance Jared and I traded turned into involuntary smiles.</p><p>\u201cBex wil be right behind you,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I kissed his cheek. \u201cMaybe I should stay home today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing. You should see the other guys,\u201d Jared said with a wink. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>Kim lifted my briefcase off the floor, and held it out. I rushed to the bathroom, washed the blood from my hands, and then fol owed her down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take my car,\u201d I said.</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>As promised, the ride to work was safe and uneventful, and Bex pul ed into the parking lot on his new, barely-street legal Ducati Streetfighter just as I stepped out of the car. Kim stayed behind as I rushed into Titan, thankful that being the CEO sort-of-in-training granted me a spot on the elevator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said to my co-workers as the doors slid closed.</p><p>Riding in close proximity to so many proved not so lucky after al . The thought of everyone breathing in such a confined space made me a bit claustrophobic.</p><p>When the elevator doors opened, I pushed my way out, taking a deep breath when my heels hit the carpet. \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d</p><p>Grant's door was open, and his ankles were crossed on top of his desk, and he was lazily leaned back in his chair. My momentary relief from the elevator was short-lived, and my face screwed in disgust.</p> <p>I made a bee-line for my office, hoping Grant would be too comfortable to get out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cHey Peanut,\u201d Grant said just as I sat down.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Beth said, walking in with her head down. She was biting on the end of her pencil, concentrating on her notebook planner. \u201cThe meeting with Yawa...Yaw...the Japanese is on Thursday, but the Wel ington\u2019s wil be in town, and hoped to squeeze in some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake time. I\u2019d love to steal them away from Donaldson,\u201d I said tapping a pen against my desk.</p><p>\u201cSounds like it\u2019s a better day,\u201d Grant said, nodding. He bowed out without another word.</p> <p>\u201cNow it is,\u201d I said, noting Beth\u2019s smile as she stifled a giggle.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, forcing her smile to fade. \u201cChad\u2019s been asking. Have you heard from Ryan lately? Or at al ?\u201d</p><p>I no longer had to fight a smile, my face immediately fel . \u201cNo. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cI hope he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t, we would find out, right?\u201d I said to reassure her.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and nodded. \u201cRight. I\u2019ve gotta make some copies. You want coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Once Beth was off doing other things, Grant returned.</p><p>\u201cI actual y had a point to coming in here. I needed to talk to you about Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Grant flashed his mil ion-dol ar smile, and I had to physical y restrain myself from recoiling.</p><p>\u201cPeanut, I realize she\u2019s your friend, but it\u2019s not exactly cost-efficient to keep her on-board during the school year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I fire her?\u201d I said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Grant sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking at this objectively. You\u2019re in the office, yes, but technical y you\u2019re stil an intern until you graduate. Why would I pay someone to assist an intern?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I told you to.\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, Grant smiled, wider than before. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do just fine here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Grant. That wil be al .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, chuckling to himself as he left the way he came.</p><p>Buried under a few stacks of documents, Beth brought me back to reality with her chirpy voice. \u201cTime to go home, Nigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked at my watch, and then smiled. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>I haphazardly stuffed a few files into my brief case before rushing down the hal , and then pressed the button. As soon as the doors opened, I hopped inside, fidgeting the entire trip to the first floor. The doors slid open, revealing the bril iant late-afternoon sun gleaming through the lobby glass. Jared was waiting by the Escalade, a contrived smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, after greeting him with a quick kiss. My excitement to see him was infiltrated by a sense of dread. The two didn't settle wel , and I instantly fel nauseous.</p><p>He raised a pair of my sneakers. \u201cI thought we could check out what\u2019s left of the loft. See if anything\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>I could only nod, dreading the sight of our home reduce to a heap of ash.</p><p>\u201cPut these on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt'l be hard enough sifting through everything, let alone in heels.\u201d</p><p>I took the shoes in my hand, and then sat on the curb. Jared handed me a pair of socks, and I tugged those on, fol owed by the sneakers. He watched me in silence, a residual forced grin on his face. He wasn't looking forward to the aftermath anymore than I.</p><p>The drive seemed to take an eternity, yet it stil wasn\u2019t long enough for me to prepare. When Jared pul ed to the curb, I stumbled from the Escalade, each side of my hair bunched in my fists. \u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared mil ed about the charred remnants, bending down once in a while to inspect something not-quite destroyed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a few boxes in the back,\u201d Jared said. \u201cWould you grab one?\u201d</p><p>I took wide steps and hopped until I was clear of the debris, and then went to the Escalade, opening the back door. I brought back a large, cardboard box. There were two more, but it was overly optimistic to bother with them, we couldn\u2019t fil up the first one. Silverware, a few brittle-edged pictures, and the monitor of my laptop were among partial y intact documents, and a set of throwing knives. Yel ow tape surrounded most of the carnage.</p><p>My hands turned black as I dug slowly, but surely through the black mess under our feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking so ambitiously for?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping we\u2019d find at least pieces of your journal, but I haven\u2019t even seen the binding. Have you come across it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI keep it in the Escalade. It\u2019s safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, overwhelmed at the mountain of rubble.</p><p>\u201cWe should go. The Fire Marshal has already interviewed me twice. If anyone sees us poking around, it\u2019s going to attract attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I stood up from my squatted position, throwing down a charred piece of the frame that the last picture of my father was in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI should have tried to get that out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. They did this to get a reaction, to see if we\u2019d retaliate, or if it would cause dissension between us. The last thing I\u2019m going to do is give them what they want. It\u2019s just stuff.\u201d</p><p>Jared walked over to me, tenderly wiping my face. \u201cYou\u2019re covered in soot. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not home, Jared. This was home, and it's gone.\u201d I was surprised at the tears that wel ed up in my eyes. Crying hadn't crossed my mind until that very moment.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should start looking for a place?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cSo they can torch it again? No, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression was pained. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d I said, tugging on his hand, leading him to the Escalade. \u201cWe have no idea what they\u2019l do next.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>New</p><p>Summer wound down, and Beth and I undertook the process of delegation. Our schedule at Brown would make it impossible to maintain the hours we\u2019d been keeping at Titan.</p><p>Jared made frequent call s to Claire to check on Ryan\u2019s progress, which steadily improved. At times faster than Claire would have liked. To al of our surprise, Ryan wasn't fighting the decision to decommission him. He was focused on getting wel and getting back to the States\u2014something none of us had anticipated.</p><p>As promised, Jared didn\u2019t try another ambush on Shax, or Donovan and Isaac. Instead, he became obsessed with constructing a fail-safe plan, one that included a Plan B, and help. He refused to let the book get away from him a second time.</p><p>Bex grew two more inches, which was a good thing. His inflated ego needed al the room he could give it.</p><p>Jared and I spent my last day of Summer Break at our Oak Tree. We stretched out across a blanket Jared had spread over the grass, just inside the shade of the tree. I kept my eyes closed, quiet and lazy, listening to the bugs buzzing and the grass dancing in the wind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re official y a col ege junior tomorrow,\u201d he said with a proud smile, brushing the petals of a wildflower down the line of my jaw.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I said. \u201cAnother summer gone by. Just one more left before I graduate.\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand, turning his attention to the carving above us. \u201cHmmm...where do you see yourself this time next year?\u201d</p><p>I breathed out a laugh. \u201cI have no idea. Why don\u2019t we make this an annual event? We spend the day at our Oak tree the last day of Summer Break next year, too.\u201d Jared grimaced, and my expression mimicked his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He worked to smooth out the deepening line between his brows. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d I warned. I became impatient very quickly when he kept things from me, and he seemed to be taking that risk more frequently.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI was hoping your answer would be different, that\u2019s al .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping that you would say you saw yourself married this time next year,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, sheepish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying very hard to be patient about this,\u201d he said, his voice suddenly strained. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re putting it off.\u201d He chuckled nervously. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be married by now.\u201d His eyes were stil bright, but I could hear the edge of worry in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this, Jared. A lot. I don\u2019t have time to plan a wedding right now. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m putting it off, I\u2019ve just got a lot on my plate is al ,\u201d I said, twisting my ring around my finger.</p><p>Jared rested his hand on mine. \u201cI know you do. But it doesn\u2019t have to be an elaborate event. We\u2019re engaged, we\u2019re living together...is there a problem I should be aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI just need a little more time.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s contrived smile didn\u2019t hide the heavy disappointment in his eyes, but I pretended not to notice. I wanted to marry him more than anything, but I wanted to do it right. I certainly didn\u2019t want to feel rushed to get home from our honeymoon because of chapters to study, papers to write, or learning how to run another department of Jack\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cA year is a reasonable engagement. Two years is....\u201d he trailed off, clearly vexed by the idea of waiting another year.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have a two year engagement, Jared,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to settle on a date sometime this year?\u201d he asked, hopeful. The look in his eyes made it impossible to say anything but yes.</p><p>\u201cI wil . I just have to find time to plan a wedding between twenty hours of school and Titan.\u201d I felt my expression compress as I thought about the ramifications of my statement.</p><p>Jared looked ahead, his eyes tightening with focus. \u201cI wil find time. I wil create time if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , you do have Divine connections. I\u2019m sure you could make that happen,\u201d I teased. I peered up the giant tree, squinting from the sunshine poking through the leaves. The branches swayed with the breeze, and I smiled. \u201cI love it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so amazing that Gabe brought Lil ian to this exact spot.\u201d My eyes lingered on the rudimentary heart and initials of Jared\u2019s parents, and then on the elegant details of the vines and leaves inside the heart with our initials inside. I looked back to Jared\u2019s glowing blue-grey eyes. \u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get my fianc\u00e9 to actual y marry me,\u201d he said, winking.</p><p>I pressed my lips together into a tight line. \u201cI said I\u2019d set a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d Jared said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIs that a chal enge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever works,\u201d Jared grinned.</p><p>\u201cI promise. I\u2019ll set a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin the next ten years?\u201d he asked playful y.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set a date for this year,\u201d I said, stubbornly raising my chin.</p><p>\u201cThis year,\u201d Jared repeated, dubious.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I was kidding when I said yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just didn\u2019t realize when you said yes that you meant someday.\u201d His tone was lighthearted, but I felt a twinge of guilt in my chest. Jared immediately reacted. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, sweetheart,\u201d he said, tucking my hair behind my ear. Instead of the ends of my hair wrapping around the bottom of my ear like it used to, it brushed against my shoulder.</p><p>I looked down, picking at my fingernails. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s true. You didn\u2019t expect a long engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I assumed maybe a year with everything happening so fast. But when the year came and went and you never so much as mentioned it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You think it\u2019s not important to me,\u201d I said, my face feeling hot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he quickly backpedaled.</p><p>I looked up at him under my lashes. \u201cBut that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d he hesitated, \u201cyou do tend to insinuate that there are other things you\u2019d rather focus on. I understand, but I can\u2019t help but be a little disappointed. It was my idea after al ,\u201d he grinned, kissing my forehead.</p><p>I slowly crawled into his lap. \u201cI love you, Jared Ryel. There is nothing I want more than to be your wife. I promise to get right to work on that date, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jared beamed. \u201cThank you.\u201d His lips traveled to mine, but quickly pul ed away. \u201cYou\u2019d better keep this to yourself. I think mom has final y accepted that no amount of encouragement on her part is going to produce a wedding. It\u2019s probably best to let her think you have other things on your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d I said, leaning him back against the blanket.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSpeaking of Lil ian...she invited us to dinner. Apparently, she has a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise....\u201d I trailed off. \u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my watch. \u201cWe\u2019d better get going if we\u2019re going to wash up and make dinner.\u201d</p><p>Jared stood up and brought me with him. We rol ed the blanket and I fastened it to the back of Jared's motorcycle, and then we made a quick stop at the loft, trading the bike for the Escalade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a quick stop at Cynthia\u2019s, Jared drove us to his mother\u2019s. We had been to Lil ian\u2019s more than enough times for me to get past the night of the invasion, but no matter how many times we made a visit, an overwhelming sick feeling stil came over me as we pul ed into the drive.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be nervous,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s post-traumatic stress,\u201d I said with a half-smile.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t share my humor over the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said as he opened the passenger door.</p> <p>We walked to the house, and Jared stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, scanning his face.</p><p>He was working far too hard to mask an emotion. \u201cNothing. Everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d I said as we walked. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>The closer we got to the door, the harder my heart throbbed against my chest. Jared reached out with one finger to press the doorbel .</p><p>The door swung open, and I gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel that\u2019s a hel of a reception. I missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d I squealed, wrapping my arms around her neck.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hug me back, but stood with her hands on her hips. \u201cYou confuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d I said, breathless. \u201cI just...I wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p> <p>Lil ian walked to Claire\u2019s side, casual y crossing her arms. \u201cSurprise,\u201d she said with her warm, sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, my eyes darting to everyone. \u201cDoes this mean that Ryan is...?\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s at the Providence VA Hospital to finish his rehabilitation.\u201d</p><p>My hands flew up to my mouth, and then I hugged her again. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home,\u201d I whispered into her ear.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Claire smiled.</p><p>We sat at the table for dinner. The symphony of our laughter fil ed every inch of the house. I cleared the dessert dishes, and listened to them talk and giggle. I waited in the kitchen, smiling to myself as I soaked in the sound of love Bex, Claire, Lil ian and Jared exchanged, even in their teasing.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared call ed.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d I said, starting the dishwasher.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Nina wants to hear more about her friend,\u201d Lil ian said.</p><p>Jared's expression changed so slightly, that I was sure no one at the table noticed but me. The skin around his eyes tightened as the corners of his mouth turned up\u2014something he always did when he tried too hard to cover how he was feeling. I took his hand in mine and squeezed. He seemed to relax an infinitesimal amount, and I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cTonight is about Claire,\u201d I said.</p><p>Claire touched the napkin to her mouth and rol ed her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a machine. He\u2019s been working like crazy trying to get wel . His psych analysis wasn\u2019t exactly...he told them about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saw you?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>An awkward pause sent tension into the air. \u201cHe thinks he did,\u201d Claire said. \u201cMy face was covered with the hijab, so he only remembers my eyes, but they\u2019re questioning how a woman with the smal frame he described could have carried him out.\u201d</p><p>Bex chuckled. \u201cWhat a pinhead. Did he real y think they would believe him?\u201d</p><p>Claire stared at the table. \u201cHe told them I was American. He told Colonel Brand he thinks he knows who it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire looked up. \u201cBut he only told the Colonel. No one else. After they gave him the results of his psych eval, he insisted he be placed in Providence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to go, Claire. You blew your cover,\u201d Bex smiled.</p><p>Jared leaned his elbows on the table. \u201cThis is serious. You need to stay out of sight, Claire. Lay low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Claire grumbled, her eyes returning to one spot on the tablecloth. \u201cI could say the same thing to you, you know. No one\u2019s torching my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lil ian said, her eyes darting to Jared.</p><p>He glared at Claire for moment, and then looked to Lil ian. \u201cThere was a smal ...fire. Everyone is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fire?\u201d Bex said. \u201cThey set explosives at the loft. Everything\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s they?\u201d Lil ian asked. She was concerned, but not in the way a typical mother might be. She didn\u2019t seem overly worried about Jared\u2019s wel - being. It was clear she was years ahead of me as far as experience with Hybrids. She knew exactly what her children were capable of, and I wondered if I would ever have that same peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cDonovan,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Lil ian said, thoughtful y. \u201cHow do you plan to resolve that, Son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need help that won\u2019t come,\u201d Jared replied, clearly frustrated with his own words.</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou talked to Samuel?\u201d Jared nodded, and she continued, \u201cEli?\u201d When Jared nodded again, she shook her head in disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli talked about a balance,\u201d I said. \u201cThey won\u2019t get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Claire said, leaning forward in her seat. \u201cIf it gets to that point...we could force them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat better be one frightening, desperate point,\u201d Bex said. \u201cThat would mean war.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian held up her hand. \u201cThat would be a last resort.\u201d She stood, making her way to me. \u201cNina, what I\u2019m about to ask you wil be very difficult, but I need the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I stuttered, worried what she was going to ask.</p><p>Lil ian lowered her chin. \u201cWhat did Gabe say to you on the plane?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about? He didn\u2019t come to her on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActual y....\u201d I said, trailing off.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tel me?\u201d he said, noticeably angry. Before I could answer, he began again, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that everything is important, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d I said, embarrassed, \u201che said to go home. He said not to see Claire. I knew you wouldn\u2019t leave her there alone until you knew she was al right.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked to Claire, and then to Lil ian. \u201cDoes he talk to you?\u201d</p><p>His mother smiled. \u201cAt night. Only if it\u2019s important. She knows about Kim now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared answered.</p><p>Lil ian\u2019s mouth pul ed to the side, disappointed. \u201cThat was a mistake. Your main focus should be the book. It\u2019s vital y important that you have it in- hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim and I made a deal,\u201d Jared explained. \u201cShe wil help us obtain the book if we help her return it to Jeruselum, under the Sepulchre where her ancestor found it. She wants to free her family of it.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian's eyes flitted about as she thought. \u201cIf she is helping you, why would your father try to keep Nina away from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from Kim?\u201d I asked. \u201cShe's harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d Claire snipped.</p><p>\u201cDad is wrong this time. We need her,\u201d Jared said, clearly uncomfortable. Gabe was the foundation of their family, a fal en angel from Heaven, pure-blooded. The thought of him making a mistake was a hard pil to swal ow, and even Jared wasn't convinced of his own words.</p><p>Everyone at the table sat silently, processing the situation. Final y, Bex spoke. \u201cWe\u2019re al here. Let\u2019s go get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a plan,\u201d Jared said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t leave Nina unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Bex watches Ryan and Nina, and you and I go,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve already tried. I\u2019m tel ing you, we need a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went there and didn\u2019t leave with the book?\u201d Claire said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHe had it in his hands,\u201d Bex said, chuckling. Jared shot Bex a sharp look, and the boy's smug expression immediately vanished. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI was a little outnumbered,\u201d Jared explained. \u201cBy eighty or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Claire said, unimpressed.</p><p>Jared huffed. \u201cWe\u2019l talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>The ride home was long, and the air in the cab of the Escalade was thick with tension. I didn\u2019t dare talk first. Jared\u2019s jaw was tight, and his knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel. He drove closer to Bex\u2019s typical speed, impatient with the stop lights and traffic.</p><p>Jared parked in the drive, and then appeared at the passenger door. Without a word, he helped me to the ground. I wrapped my arm around his, and we walked in quiet understanding.</p><p>After a long shower, I set out clothes for Fal classes the next day. Jared waited for me, sitting on the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying,\u201d I said, more of a statement than a question.</p><p>He stood. \u201cBex wil be outside. I won\u2019t be far.\u201d He tightened the belt of my robe, and then encompassed me in his arms, leaning down just inches from my face. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d he said, pressing his warm lips softly against mine.</p><p>He intended the kiss goodbye to be quick, but his lips lingered on mine. I ran my hands over the perfection of his chest and stomach, and then made my way to the bottom of his shirt, reaching underneath the fabric to touch his soft, feverish skin.</p><p>\u201cYou could stay,\u201d I whispered, smiling against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he said, his voice strained.</p><p>\u201cJust for a little while? I won't keep you long,\u201d I began to raise his shirt, but he gently restrained me by the wrists.</p><p>\u201cBex is downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I said with a grimace. My hands fel to my sides, and I blew my bangs from my face in a huff.</p><p>Jared left me alone, and I ambled to the bed. Once my head hit the pil ow, I was surprised the yearning for his warm body beside me, or thoughts of Ryan, or Jack, or the upcoming day of tedious bombardment of syl abi and introductory never crossed my mind. Heaviness came upon me, and I gladly succumbed.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Beth shouted from the end of the hal . She rushed to catch up, and then threw her arms around my neck. \u201cCan you believe we\u2019re back already?\u201d She looked around, scanning faces of passing students.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, grinning at her endearing over-enthusiasm for everything.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother bringing my laptop; every class would be the same. Beth fil ed me in on the last few details she\u2019d taken care of at Titan, and we discussed the monstrosity that was Sasha and the fact that she would be staying on.</p><p>\u201cHow far does she think sHe\u2019ll go in that company, now that she\u2019s made an enemy of you?\u201d she asked, rol ing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou make the mistake of believing she thinks. She did take on the Christmas party. Makes me wonder what she has up her sleeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopeful y breath spray,\u201d Beth said, covering her mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that.\u201d Beth giggled, and I shook my head.</p><p>My attention diverted to a group of boys that walked through the door. Josh led the group. As Ryan\u2019s best friend, he wasn\u2019t a fan of mine, and made it quite clear that he\u2019d rather not be around me. Chad admitted that Josh accused me of being the reason Ryan left. Beth came to my defense, of course, but that didn\u2019t make him wrong.</p><p>Once Josh caught a glimpse of me, his eyes became unfocused. He looked right through me before pretending to be deeply engrossed in whatever his friends were saying.</p><p>Beth glared at him as he found his seat. \u201cHe real y needs to get over himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just being the same kind of friend to Ryan that you are to me,\u201d I mumbled, fiddling with my pen.</p><p>\u201cGuess I can\u2019t fault him for that.\u201d</p><p>I found myself fighting the urge to tel her that Ryan was not only back, but just a few minutes away. Not being able to see him when he was so close was bad enough; even though I had thought a several different scenarios where I could happen across that information, I couldn't tel Beth until Claire gave me the green-light.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d the professor said, passing out the intro packet for the class.</p><p>I sighed when Beth handed me a stack of papers, and I took my own, passing on the rest. I didn't bother thumbing through the pages like the other students, but settled into my seat, making a valid effort to pay attention. The mundane pieces of my life used to be what I was so desperate to hold on to. In the last month, it was al I could do to make an active effort to be a participant. Col ege seemed trivial compared to the other part of my life.</p><p>After classes, I smiled at the sight of Jared\u2019s Escalade waiting in its usual spot. He had warned me that morning that I wouldn\u2019t see him at lunch; he said to give me time to catch up with the girls. Something about \u2018holding on to a shred of normal\u2019...I was too busy being offended to hear.</p><p>He quickly opened my door for me, and I wrapped my arms around his middle.</p><p>\u201cWel , hel o,\u201d he said, amused at my eager affection.</p><p>\u201cOh, like you didn\u2019t miss me, too,\u201d I said, smiling up at him.</p><p>He raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d He watched me settle into my seat, and then sighed. \u201cI thought I should tel you. Claire call ed.</p><p>Ryan should be released soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see him, yet?\u201d I said, a bit more enthusiastic than was appropriate.</p><p>Jared tried to hide his disappointment at my words. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t told anyone he\u2019s here. How would you explain your visit?\u201d</p><p>The tightness around his eyes gave him away. He was stil worried. Now that Ryan had been wounded, and was home after such a long time away, I imagined his concern was at a new level.</p><p>\u201cRyan and I are different people, now. Everything has changed,\u201d I said, touching Jared\u2019s cheek with my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cAs long as Ryan is in love with you, I wil always have reason to worry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned in to to kiss him. \u201cHow can I convince you?\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed away from me, shifting uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get mad...,\u201d he began.</p> <p>I crossed my arms. \u201cA disclaimer? This should be good.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cUntil we find the book, and figure out a way to keep you one-hundred percent safe, I think the intimacy should be kept to a minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God, not this again,\u201d I said, rol ing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt happens al the time, Nina. We can\u2019t risk it,\u201d he said, covering my hand with his.</p><p>I smirked. \u201cYou can\u2019t use your Abra Cadabra to figure it out?\u201d I leaned in to kiss his neck. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of the rhythm method? We\u2019l put our own spin on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would consider myself an intel igent person, but no, can\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just figure out when I\u2019m ovulating, and we abstain for those few days. Voil\u00e0! Birth control. We have the Hybrid edge.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s nose wrinkled in disdain. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like a solution to me.\u201d He leaned away from my kisses, and I crossed my arms in a pout.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than your proposal,\u201d I frowned. \u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I can?\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cEli said once we were intimate, your senses would change. You\u2019ve never once mentioned how, or even if they have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat discussion is better left alone,\u201d he said, maneuvering out of my embrace. He faced forward, clearly unwil ing to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cTel me I\u2019m wrong,\u201d I said, lifting my chin in defiance.</p><p>Jared quickly commandeered the drivers seat, shoved the gear shift into drive, and pul ed into the street. \u201cNina, I shouldn\u2019t have to tel you this, but I wil : I love you more than anything on this earth; more than anything in the universe. I love you more than life, more than my family, and I love you more than I love being with you in that way. Your safety is, and wil always be my first priority. This isn\u2019t the kind of risk I took sitting beside you on that bench the night we met, or tel ing you what I am. Making a mistake concerning an accidental pregnancy wil mean an al out war, because that is exactly what wil have to happen to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>The smile or wink I was hoping for never came. He had always been careful to protect me from the truth without tel ing a lie, but the seriousness of the situation warranted a bluntness Jared usual y avoided.</p><p>It took a long time for me to reply. My initial reaction was to complain, but Eli's words echoed in my mind. He had told me it was time to break away from being the victim. He was very clear that my time to feel sorry for myself was over.</p><p>That gave me an idea.</p><p>I attempted a smal smile. \u201cI understand you know better than me what wil happen. You know exactly what consequences to expect when a choice is made\u2014especial y if it\u2019s the wrong one. I\u2019m human, Jared. But that doesn\u2019t make me frail. You have to give me more credit than that. It\u2019s time you teach me some of what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Jared said, dubious.</p> <p>\u201cHow to shoot a gun, for instance...and basic self-defense wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Jared pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cA gun isn\u2019t going to help you in this particular situation, Sweetheart, much less a solid knee to the groin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you need to when you have me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re busy?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou mean too busy to do my job? The one that includes protecting the love of my life from certain death?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to scare me, but I stood my ground, determined to prove my case. \u201cDo I have to remind you of the night at the restaurant? Claire stayed behind while you took care of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. I would\u2019ve never left you if Claire hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had known how to shoot a gun I could have helped. That\u2019s al I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching you just enough to make you dangerous is not helping. It gives you the impression that you\u2019re capable of more than you actual y are.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fel open. \u201cNow that\u2019s just insulting. Do you real y see me as helpless?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once, amused. \u201cNo. Definitely not, but we\u2019re not dealing with Graham, anymore, Nina. Others are an enemy you don\u2019t want to piss off by shooting at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, a fake smile tightening my face. \u201cI\u2019ll have Bex or Claire teach me. She\u2019s offered before.\u201d</p><p>Jared clenched his teeth. \u201cNeither of them wil do it without my explicit permission, and if they do, you\u2019re going to start something you can\u2019t take back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d I said, ful y recognizing the whine in my tone. I waited until my voice could sound calmer, and then spoke again, \u201cI happen to know there\u2019s a gun club in Cranston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this go, are you?\u201d Jared said, slowing as he pul ed into the drive.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, no,\u201d I said. Jared huffed in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I...it\u2019s suffocating being in your shadow. According to you, my life is constantly in danger, and I have to wait for you to save me. It would be nice to know if for whatever reason I\u2019m alone, I can do something to protect myself.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes met mine, and then he nodded once. \u201cOkay. We\u2019l start Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Favor</p><p>Jared lessons were not easy. Where I caught a break from him, Bex pushed me further. When I wasn\u2019t at school or Titan, the three of us were in the field by the Oak Tree, aiming, punching, blocking, ducking, attacking and subduing. It was mentioned more than once that I was a fast learner, and Bex said that I was a natural with any gun they put in my hand.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t agree. He thought I was clumsy, slow, and impatient.</p><p>Sleep came more easily than ever. Every night, I fel into bed, my muscles screaming for rest. Dreams of Jack were replaced with calculated moves and steps I would take to get the upper hand in hand-to-hand combat. Jared would tend to my sore spots. Regardless of his efforts, the area would inevitably be a series of purple splotches in the morning.</p><p>The weeks passed, and once the trees shed their leaves, Winter wasted no time covering the debris of Fal with a blanket of white. Ignoring Cynthia\u2019s protests, the boys moved the furniture in the Great Room to transform it to a sparring ring.</p><p>The target practice, weight training, and sparring was nearly a daily ritual. Jared and Bex were always present. Once Claire caught wind of our new hobby, she came when she could. I always looked forward to the days she would join us.</p><p>Claire was more than capable to do everything her brothers could, but I related to her with the knowledge that she had to work that much harder to prove herself. I would never be as fast or as strong as the Hybrids, but I earned their respect with my stubborn refusal to quit or rest. Claire understood my resolve, and when she looked at me, she assumed strength when the boys assumed weakness.</p><p>The mirror was proof of not only my mistakes from the bruises, but my hard work. My arms weren\u2019t nearly as tight as Claire\u2019s, but they were taking on a toned look that I was proud of.</p><p>The day before Thanksgiving, Jared final y offered his first word of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he said with an emotionless nod.</p><p>That single word gave me the determination to continue. I was only human, but if I could keep up with Jared, Claire, and Bex, I could hold my own with Donovan, or Shax\u2019s other human minions. At least I could try.</p><p>Thanksgiving Day arrived. Cynthia attended the Macy\u2019s Day parade in New York with some of her charity chums, and I helped Claire and Lil ian in the kitchen while the boys set the table and kept the dishes washed.</p><p>Every one of my favorite spices and herbs permeated the air. Laughter was the background music to the busy atmosphere. Lil ian noticed a difference in me right away, and wanted to discuss my training. She took a keen interest in it, wishing she had thought of it as wel .</p><p>Bex set the turkey on the table, and sat beside his mother. Claire grabbed one of my hands, Jared took the other.</p><p>\u201cOur Lord in Heaven,\u201d Lil ian began. \u201cThank you for our many blessings. The wonderful food on the table, the health and safety of our family, and that we are al sitting together on this day of thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Jared said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cAye Men!\u201d Bex said, digging into the various dishes on the table.</p><p>Part-way through dinner, I noticed Claire was quiet, thoughtful y chewing and smiling at the appropriate times in conversation. Jared of course noticed when I did, and he watched his sister.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes, but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Lil ian smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Let her be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good ladies,\u201d Bex said, his mouth ful of food.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Son,\u201d Lil ian said. \u201cJared? Would it be a good time to ask how much longer you\u2019l be engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, shaking his head with a smile. \u201cI just got her to agree to set a date, Mom. Don\u2019t ruin my hard work.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cShe has a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d Jared said, surprised.</p><p>I patted his knee. \u201cMy parents\u2019 anniversary is on a Saturday this year.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cOh, it is! How wonderful! June first, then?\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to me, cautious. \u201cJune first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an easy date to remember,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOf this year?\u201d Jared asked, cautiously hopeful.</p><p>Lil ian and I shared the same boisterous laugh. \u201cYes, Honey. Seven months from now.\u201d</p><p>The smile that crept across Jared\u2019s face was slow, but it spanned from one side to the other. \u201cJune first.\u201d</p><p>The conversation was monopolized by wedding plans after that, and the afternoon was fil ed with excitement and anticipation.</p><p>We said our goodbyes with kisses and hugs to Bex, Claire and Lil ian, and then Jared led me to the Escalade by the hand. Once inside, he leaned over the console, took my face gingerly in his hands, and pressed his lips against mine.</p><p>When he final y pul ed away, I felt a bit dizzy. A smal twinge of guilt settled in. It was so easy to make him happy, and I had grossly procrastinated something so simple.</p><p>Jared drove slowly to the house, brushing my hand with his thumb as he held it. A storm had rol ed in, and it fed into the new energy that almost crackled in the air between us, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to get home. He intertwined his fingers in mine, kissing each of my fingers. \u201cI feel like you said yes al over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I would set a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said. His mouth widened to a broad grin. \u201cMan! I feel like I want to stand on a rooftop and scream! This is one of the best days of my life!\u201d</p><p>I giggled, nearly manic from the emanation of Jared\u2019s mood. Just as the moment peaked, it fizzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I said. He slowed the Escalade to a stop. \u201cYou\u2019re not real y going climb onto a rooftop, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his smile fading fast. \u201cI spoke to soon.\u201d</p><p>It was then that I noticed the blue and red lights dancing al around us. \u201cWe\u2019re being pul ed over? But, you weren\u2019t speeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what he wants.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Jared\u2019s hand, seeing the dark silhouette of the police officer. The windshield wipers knocked back and forth as we waited for his approach. He knocked on Jared\u2019s window with the butt of his flashlight.</p><p>\u201cOfficer,\u201d Jared said, pressing the button for the window. The dark glass buzzed as it lowered and then disappeared, revealing a face I had longed to see again.</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d I yelped. My mouth fel open in utter shock.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Nina. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna have to ask you to step out of the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass. It\u2019s raining,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Ryan nodded. \u201cJust accompany me to the cruiser, Ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, sounding very professional and detached.</p><p>I nodded, looking to Jared. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I kissed him, and then scrambled to open the door. I tried to be calm, to preserve Jared\u2019s feelings, but Ryan was just a few feet away. I had been so desperate to see him, and waited so long, any false composure at that moment was impossible.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared call ed after me, but the tires sloshing through the wet pavement as cars passed by drowned out the fol owing words.</p><p>It was wrong, but in my haste to speak to Ryan again, I ignored Jared and ran to the cruiser at ful speed, paying no attention to the rain.</p><p>The air was biting, and the rain instantly dampened my clothes. I yanked open the passenger-side door, assuming it would be as cozy as the Escalade.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cCheese and rice!\u201d I said, crossing my arms and bending at the waist. \u201cYou could hang meat in here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Ryan said, turning up the heat. \u201cI keep it cool so I can wear my coat. Can\u2019t real y waste time putting it on before I make a stop.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cA cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled and looked down. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess this means you\u2019re not coming back to Brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks that way,\u201d he said without humor.</p><p>He was thicker than I remembered, but his face was thin. Lean was probably a better word. A hardened expression replaced his sweet smile. He appeared older; a long, weary line of disappointment and horrendous experiences no man should ever have to encounter reflected in his once bright, green eyes.</p><p>By his hesitation alone, I could tel the effort to pul me over wasn\u2019t due to the anticipation of a happy reunion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou stopped writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI used to sit on a dune and watch the sun set, thinking about you...writing half of what I wanted. That was my nightly routine for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy postman has some explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only sent a few of them. I was in love with you for a long time, Nina.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, trying the swal ow the lump that had formed in my throat. It was pointless to apologize after what I had done to him, but the words fel out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not the first guy to go war after my heart got broken. Half of my buddies wrote home to girls that didn\u2019t love them back. Some of them had girls that quit waiting. I was one of the lucky ones, even though your smile haunted me for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d I said, wrinkling my nose.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. \u201cAfter leaving, going half-way across the world, I stil missed you. I didn\u2019t think it would ever go away. But something changed, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>Ryan smiled. \u201cI quit loving you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my feelings conflicted. A smal part of me was hurt, and maybe a bit jealous that he had final y gotten over me. The rest of me was overjoyed. \u201cThat\u2019s...good? I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s wrong. I stil love you. I wil always love you as my friend. But I\u2019m in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>A grin streaked across my face for a fleeting moment. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting. Do I know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActual y...I think you do. And I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. I sort of owe you, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>Ryan sighed, nodding. \u201cThat\u2019s where I was going with this.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cYou ever get the feeling you\u2019re never alone? I mean, even when you are.\u201d</p><p>His words spoke to every moment of my life, but I remained quiet.</p><p>Ryan ignored my silence. \u201cDo you remember the night Jared came into the bar? And the last night we were together?\u201d</p><p>My heart began to pound. I didn\u2019t know what direction the conversation had taken, but I felt instantly uncomfortable. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember three things about both of those nights: Jared\u2019s sister, how strong she was, and those crazy blue eyes. Everyone else says I\u2019m crazy, Nina...but you...you I know wil understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d I said, feigning bewilderment.</p><p>Ryan huffed, frustrated. \u201cThe night in your father\u2019s office. You said I couldn\u2019t tel anyone about our plan because Jared would find out. I thought he was in the F.B.I. or something, but it\u2019s bigger than that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I touched his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing someone professional, right? About what happened to you over there?\u201d The words had to be said to protect those I loved, but the guilt was overwhelming. Ryan didn\u2019t deserve that from me\u2014he had come to me for a reason: because he trusted me to believe him. If the consequences were different, I would have been the friend he\u2019d always been to me, but my choice was clear.</p> <p>He paused. Anger made the skin around his eye twitch. \u201cWhat makes you think anything happened to me over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uh...,\u201d I swal owed. \u201cI real y should be going,\u201d I said, reaching for the door handle.</p><p>Ryan grabbed my arm. \u201cI saw her eyes. The day she saved my life, I saw her. No one has eyes like her, and no woman that size could have carried me out of there. Tel me where Claire is, Nina.\u201d</p><p>My door flew open, and Jared pul ed me to my feet. Ryan scrambled out of his cruiser, desperate. \u201cI just want to talk to her,\u201d he yel ed over the rain. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know how she did it. I just...need to see her again.\u201d</p><p>Jared glanced at me, and then back to Ryan. \u201cUnless you\u2019re charging us with something, we\u2019re leaving. Good to see you again, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy!\u201d Ryan said, desperate. The rain was more of a downpour, but he was unfazed.</p><p>My steps were smal and quick, trying to keep up with Jared as he led me by the arm to the Escalade. Once inside, I turned around, holding the seat with both hands as I watched the stand off between the two men I loved in such opposite ways. Ryan, in his puffy, standard-issue policeman\u2019s coat simply watched Jared glower at him. It was a new side of him, as I half-expected a nasty exchange of words.</p><p>Jared slammed the car door behind him before shoving the shifter into gear. The speedometer passed the point of speeding before we were out of Ryan\u2019s radar range, as if Jared dared him to stop us again.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Jared? Jared!\u201d I said, fumbling with my seat belt.</p><p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly seems that way,\u201d I said, bracing myself as Jared weaved through the traffic. \u201cClaire wil lay low for a while like you said to. It wil be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard him, Nina. He\u2019s been holding onto this for months. He\u2019s not going to let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...so we figure it out. It\u2019s not the worst thing that could happen right now. You told me, and the world didn\u2019t come to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours did.\u201d</p><p>I winced. Jared feeling that way had never occurred to me. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I said, shaking my head. I rested my hand on his. \u201cEverything before that night was make-believe. This is what\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed into the drive of my parent\u2019s home, and then waited for the garage door to open. \u201cYou don\u2019t work for the police department, Nina.</p><p>The same one that Claire meticulously picked off a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wants to know why he saw her in the desert, Jared. It has nothing to do with Graham.\u201d</p><p>Jared closed his eyes, exasperated. \u201cMaybe not to Ryan, but for someone that can\u2019t pass his psych eval and is stil in physical therapy, he was accepted into the the Providence P.D. without a hitch. It wouldn\u2019t be hard for someone to connect Ryan to you, and anyone who could pose a problem knows you are a direct connection to me, and Claire...and Graham. This is not an innocent oops, Nina. This is a potential threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is a potential threat to you people,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou people? Since when are we not on the same side?\u201d Jared said, taken aback. He shook his head, and then headed to the house without waiting.</p><p>I fol owed in silence, cursing myself. An hour before, we had set the date of our wedding. Now I was getting the cold shoulder.</p><p>Bex sat the top of the stairs, cleaning his fingernails with a large knife, nodding to us as we passed. He was less of the boy I knew, and more like his older sister. Even Lil ian\u2019s unparal eled goodness couldn\u2019t prevent Bex from losing his innocence.</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll er...I\u2019ll see you in the morning. I\u2019ve got some things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to find Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I nodded, wrapping my arms around him. He shifted, uncomfortable in my arms. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I suppose I\u2019m just surprised at your reaction. He\u2019s not in love with me, anymore. I thought you\u2019d be relieved.\u201d</p><p>I gripped his t-shirt in my fists, bracing for him to pul away. Instead, he paused in thought, considering my words. \u201cThat means Ryan being Claire\u2019s Taleh means something else, and we don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, irritated at his negativity. \u201cMaybe it just means that they are supposed to be together. Like us.\u201d</p><p>Several emotions scrol ed across Jared\u2019s face, final y settling on a mixture of relief and delight. He tightened his arms around my back. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other explanation is there?\u201d</p><p>A wide grin spread across Jared\u2019s face. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I like that one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>The One</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cop?\u201d Beth said, her voice raised an octave.</p><p>\u201cOne of Providence\u2019s finest,\u201d I replied.</p><p>She took a sip of coffee, and then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Chad hasn\u2019t said a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan hasn\u2019t told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. An explanation consisting of Claire, explosions, and the ice blue eyes in Ryan\u2019s memory would take the conversation to an unfavorable end, so I kept it simple.\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The bel above the coffee ship door chimed, and we both looked up, waiting for Kim.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Beth asked, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cLate.\u201d I knew she was with Jared, but I couldn\u2019t exactly share that with Beth. She was the last bit of normal I had left, and I wasn\u2019t going to share her with the crazy part of my life\u2014even if that meant lying.</p><p>\u201cWas Jared just pissed beyond belief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...kind of. I guess. But not about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he pul ed us over for no reason, I suppose.\u201d I lied again. For a moment I silently counted how many non-truths I had told her in the span of just a few minutes, and wondered how many more I would have to tel . Beth was my best friend, but it was for her own good. If there was a lesson to be learned in the chaos of my life, ignorance was bliss.</p><p>Beth and I chatted about upcoming papers to write, meetings at work, the upcoming Christmas party that Sasha had been obsessing over, and of course, Ryan.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get going,\u201d Beth said, glancing at her watch.</p><p>\u201cThe wind is terrible today,\u201d I said, pul ing on my coat, hat and scarf. The snow was fal ing in large chunks, and the street had already turned into a gray, slushy mess.</p><p>\u201cI know, it sucks,\u201d Beth said. \u201cFal is non-existent here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. You don\u2019t get much snow in Oklahoma, do you?\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed once in disbelief. \u201cYes we get snow. Sometimes a foot or so. It\u2019s just on top of an inch of ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...it\u2019s a southern state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Beth said, waiting for more crazy to come out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>We walked to the Beemer together, trying to navigate the patches of snow that hadn\u2019t been cleared.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d a deep voice said, greeting us.</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d Beth said, throwing her arms around our friend.</p><p>He was in plain clothes, leaning against my car nonchalantly. He didn\u2019t seem nervous or out of place at al , until Beth smacked him, hard, on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ryan said, defending his head with his hands from another blow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you? Taking off on al of us like that, going off to war, and not letting us know you\u2019re okay, or that you\u2019re back in town? We\u2019ve all been worried sick! Chad is gonna be pissed!</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Ryan said, bracing for another assault. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Beth relaxed. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t call ed him by the time I get home tonight, I\u2019m tel ing him. And you are so going to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him. I\u2019ll call everyone, I\u2019ve just been kinda...I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, \u2018I\u2019m home.\u2019\u201d Beth crossed her arms, unimpressed with his wounded expression.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, Beth,\u201d I said. \u201cHe just needed to come back on his own terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Ryan nodded, thankful for my explanation. \u201cI came to ask you to dinner. We have some talking to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO...Okay,\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cJared\u2019s not going to like that,\u201d Beth lilted.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I pick you up? Jared\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sort of burned down,\u201d I said, shifting.</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cOkay, so where, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at Cynthia\u2019s for now.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes were always the windows to his thoughts. That was one thing that his experiences hadn\u2019t taken away from him. He was planning something.</p><p>\u201cSeven o\u2019clock?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow about I meet you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Wherever you\u2019re wanting to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided, yet. I\u2019ll just pick you up.\u201d</p><p>I sighed in frustration. \u201cSee you at seven, then.\u201d</p><p>Ryan walked away like a robot accepting a command. He offered no smile, or any other expression, too preoccupied with his next move.</p><p>\u201cThat was weird,\u201d Beth said, pul ing on the handle. \u201cOpen up, already, it\u2019s freaking freezing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I said, rol ing my eyes and clicking the keyless entry.</p><p>Throughout the day, I waited for Jared\u2019s call . He hadn\u2019t come home that morning, passing on the message via Bex that he and Kim were in Woonsocket, just south of the Massachusetts line. Bex assured me that it was to speak with the priests of St. Anne\u2019s, and he wouldn\u2019t be engaging the enemy.</p><p>At lunch, I call ed Bex. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he call ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll call ,\u201d Bex said, bored.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Kim go if they\u2019re just going to a church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a guess, but maybe she knows the contact their questioning.\u201d</p><p>I blew my bangs from my face, frustrated. \u201cYou two are being very secretive these days.\u201d</p><p>Bex sighed. \u201cGo be a co-ed, Nina. I\u2019ll talk to you later when you call to ask if Jared\u2019s call ed again.\u201d</p><p>I looked to Beth. \u201cThat little...he hung up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a teenager. You remember being a teenager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got al these feelings, and emotions...and didn\u2019t you say he was home-schooled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s only thirteen. He\u2019s barely a teenager.\u201d</p><p>Beth stared at me. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no way that kid is thirteen! He\u2019s a mammoth! He looks at least sixteen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It runs in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give birth to a toddler. Think about that,\u201d Beth said, giggling to herself.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not...,\u201d I trailed off. I waited, hoping Beth wouldn\u2019t take it further. Any such hopes were lost when her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what? Going to have kids?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, trying to play it off. \u201cWe haven\u2019t real y talked about it, but it\u2019s not something either of us would die to experience. I\u2019m an only child.</p><p>Babies...kids...real y aren\u2019t my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I just didn\u2019t know you felt that way. I bet Jared would be an amazing father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe would be,\u201d I nodded. Her words stung me, something I hadn't expected.</p><p>The afternoon was long. Bex hadn\u2019t call ed with news of Jared, and the wait was making me grumpy. Jared always call ed, unless he was in trouble, and because he knew that I knew that, he should call . A lot.</p><p>After my last class, my feet couldn\u2019t move fast enough to the Beemer. I pul ed out my cel phone and dialed, the same time searching my purse for keys.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t call ed,\u201d Bex answered.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Have you talked to Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Nothing\u2019s wrong; he\u2019s just busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen he would have call ed!\u201d I said. Just as I slammed the phone shut, the Beemer and Bex came into view.</p><p>\u201cGet in, we\u2019re going to Woonsocket.\u201d</p><p>Bex laughed without humor. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Jared said to take you to Titan, and then home. We\u2019re to wait for him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I don\u2019t work for Jared, nor am I trying to earn the big brother approval, so get in the car or move.\u201d</p><p>Bex did neither. \u201cI have orders, Nina.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t as easy to persuade as Jared, because he wasn\u2019t worried about making me angry. I had to try a different approach. He might look like a man, but he was stil a thirteen year old boy.</p><p>\u201cBex Gabriel Ryel, if you move a finger to keep me here, so help me, I wil call your mother and tel her you used your Hybridness to restrain me against my wil !\u201d</p><p>His stoic expression wavered as he considered the consequences. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, his entire body relaxing. \u201cGet in the car, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p> <p>I pushed up on the bal s of my feet to kiss his cheek. \u201cThanks, Bexster!\u201d</p><p>His face screwed into disgust as he wiped the place where my lips touched his cheek. \u201cYuck!\u201d</p><p>With Bex driving his typical speed, the trip took less than twenty minutes. He sat in silence; pouting, and no doubt planning the excuses he would offer Jared.</p><p>When we arrived, I gasped. St. Anne\u2019s was a work of art, looming with both authority and elegance over the quiet town. As beautiful as was the outside, the interior was breathtaking.</p><p>Meticulously detailed murals of angels and saints adorned the wal s and ceilings, with a larger one as the focal point. The painting was of Jesus, his arms outstretched, surrounded in light, and rows of angels, who basked in his glory. The entire room was inspirational, and a strange feeling came over me as I walked down the center aisle.</p><p>Row after row of wooden pews bordered our way to the alter anchored at front of the church, where Jared and Kim stood with a priest.</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t surprised or confused. He glanced once in my direction, and then continued his conversation. Jared\u2019s clear disregard only served to exacerbate my growing impatience with him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Father,\u201d I said, interrupting him. I pul ed Jared a few steps away, purposeful y glaring at Kim as I did so.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this right now, Nina, I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was your job? You know it worries me to death when you don\u2019t call . Do you do it on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t concentrate in my classes, checked my phone every five seconds, hoping you would at least send a one word text...something! It would take just a moment of your time to set my mind at ease. You spend half of your life incessantly protecting me from everything, and the other making me crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChild....\u201d the Father began. The Priests\u2019 words had a hidden accent behind them, possibly British, diluted by years of service in America. His plea was cut short when each of the hundreds of candles glowing around us were extinguished in succession, from one side of the stage to the other.</p><p>The priest watched me warily, and Jared took my hand. \u201cThis is her, Father Francis. She is the one.\u201d</p><p>The priest held his trembling hands to his mouth, and then reached out to me. He grabbed my free hand with both of his, and held it tightly. \u201cThe Mother,\u201d he whispered, his eyes scanning my face with adoration.</p><p>Bex lifted his chin. His eyes closed, but not before his lashes flickered as his eyes rol ed back into his head. He took a deep breath, as if he were feeling the air around us, reaching with invisible tentacles to a different plane. \u201cJared,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>A loud, repetitious banging echoed throughout the cathedral, and Father Francis dropped my hand, rushing to the large doors of the entrance.</p><p>\u201cYou should stop him,\u201d Kim said to Jared.</p><p>\u201cFather, wait,\u201d Jared call ed. He grabbed my hand, fol owing quickly behind the priest.</p><p>The banging persisted, so loudly that I released Jared\u2019s hand to cover my ears. The large doors vibrated with each blow.</p><p>\u201cMake it stop,\u201d I said, closing my eyes.</p><p>Kim and Bex were at my side, and Kim touched my shoulder before taking a few steps forward.</p><p>The banging grew louder, and the door threatened to give way to the hammering from outside.</p><p>\u201cMake it stop!\u201d I yel ed over the noise.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Kim said, gently moving him to the side. She reached out with both hands, laying her palms flat against each door.</p><p>I grabbed Jared\u2019s arm, then a quiet settled upon us; seeming more ominous than the banging.</p><p>Father Francis pushed open the doors, and we al stood in horror of the sight before us.</p><p>\u201cLord in Heaven,\u201d Father Francis said, making a quick the sign of the cross.</p><p>\u201cThey....\u201d I began, unable to finish.</p><p>\u201cCrows. Nice touch,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Hundreds of lifeless, black birds littered the steps and sidewalk. The doors were covered in bloody splotches.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d A smal girl screamed and pointed as her mother rushed her to their parked car across the street.</p><p>Pedestrians stopped and stared at the unbelievable sight, pointing to the church, and to the smal , horrified group hovering in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cLet us get inside,\u201d Father Francis said, shooing us backward into the church. He pul ed the doors shut, shaking his head. \u201cThis was a warning.</p><p>They know what she is, and they\u2019re aren\u2019t happy she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerovingian?\u201d I said, a sudden feeling of desperation evident in my voice.</p><p>The priest\u2019s face twisted in disgust. \u201cMerovingian. Bah,\u201d he grunted, shaking his head. \u201cNephilim,\u201d he said, his voice returning to its soft tone. He touched each side of my face gently. His skin was tired and wilted, making it nearly impossible to see the kindness in his eyes...but it was there.</p><p>\u201cTel me,\u201d I said, a weak smile grazing my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou are the woman clothed with the sun,\u201d Father Francis said, in awe.</p><p>I looked to Jared. His expression was pained, but he offered no explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat...,\u201d I shook my head, \u201cPardon me, Father, but what the hel does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He took my hand, and gestured for me to sit in the nearest pew. He sat with me, my hand in both of his. Kim, Bex, and Jared al took a seat as wel , scattered around us.</p><p>\u201cIn Revelations, the Bible speaks of a woman. Clothed in the sun, with the moon at her feet, and she is with child in arduous times. She brings forth a man child who is to rule al nations. It speaks of the Holy Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But, what does that have to do with me?\u201d I said, frustrated and confused.</p><p>\u201cA woman of the same description is also the center of a prophecy of the Naissance de Demoniac. The main prophecy speaks of a woman, clothed in the sun, the moon at her feet, the crown of ten stars on her head\u2014a daughter of the Nephilim. She brings forth a son of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The child disturbs the balance, blah, blah, blah.\u201d I looked to Jared. \u201cYou had to come to Woonsocket to hear something we already know?\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned his elbows onto the ridge of the pew, touching my hair with his thumb. \u201cFather Francis is a scholar. He has studied the writings of the Naissance de Demoniac. I came here to ask for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he knows what it says, we don\u2019t need the book,\u201d I said, excited. \u201cCan\u2019t you just tel us what we need to know?\u201d</p><p>Father Francis squeezed my hand. \u201cThese prophecies are not in the stars, or in the dreams of old men. Our world is a story that has already been written. The human-born angel wil disturb the delicate balance of Heaven and Hel . It wil be a new angel, not created in the dawn of time as al the others.\u201d He smiled, bit it didn't give me peace the way he had surely meant for it to. \u201cDemons fear the unknown as humans do. Possibly even more so, because of the limited truth they do not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can\u2019t stop it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut that won\u2019t stop Hel from trying,\u201d the priest said, his voice grave.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here. I have to go,\u201d I said, jumping to my feet. I ran out the front door, stopping when I felt the carcasses of birds under my feet. My hands flew to my eyes, overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jared whispered in my ear, sweeping me into his arms. He carried me across the street, and then careful y set me in the passenger seat of the Beemer. His warm hand brushed the bangs from my face. \u201cGet her home, Bex.\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded, turned the ignition, and slammed the shifter into gear. It took us half the drive time to reach Cynthia\u2019s that it took to get to St. Anne\u2019s.</p><p>Bex parked in the garage, and helped me up the stairs to my room. His normal y playful, innocent eyes offered sympathy and concern wel beyond his years.</p><p>\u201cWe'l figure this out, Nina. We're not going to let anything happen to you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't want anything to happen to you, \u201d I said softly. I patted his shoulder, and then walked into the bathroom, removing my clothes slowly, feeling numb.</p><p>The steam floated up from behind the shower curtain and spil ed over, fil ing the room with a thick, hazy warmth in minutes. I stood under the water, as hot as I could stand it, and tried to remember what Eli had said about being strong. I couldn't cry. Frivolous emotion would help nothing.</p><p>Stil , a heavy, portentous feeling settled over my entire body, weighing me down so much that the tile below my feet seemed to dig into my skin.</p><p>The more we learned, the worse it was. Preventing the prophecy was useless, because even if we succeeded, Hel wouldn\u2019t al ow the possibility.</p><p>The shower knobs complained when I turned them off, strangling the pipes. I towel-dried my hair, and then wrapped my robe around me. When I pushed the door open, a ghostly cloud of steam fol owed me as I walked across my bedroom floor.</p><p>I sat at my vanity, raking a comb through my damp, messy hair. The sea of black birds at the church haunted my thoughts, and the crunching sound their bodies made as Jared carried me across the street replayed over and over in my mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget about dinner with Ryan tonight,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be here until seven,\u201d I said, glancing at the clock. I stil had an hour left.</p><p>The main entrance door slammed in the lower level, and I heard not one, but two pairs of light footsteps ascending the stairs.</p><p>Jared stopped in the doorway of my bedroom. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said. I kept my back to him, but met his eyes in the mirror.</p><p>Claire appeared beside him. \u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>The overly ceremonious door bel chimed throughout the house. Moments later, Agatha joined Jared and Claire in the doorway of my room. \u201cIt\u2019s a gentleman, Love. A Mr. Scott to see you.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s early.\u201d I stood, tightening the belt of my robe, and then stormed through the path Claire and Jared made for me as they pressed their backs to the wal .</p><p>My bare feet tapped against the stairs as I quickly made my way to the spot where Ryan stood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d I said, crossing my arms.</p><p>Ryan smiled, his eyes scanning every corner of the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgatha?\u201d I call ed. When she didn\u2019t answer, I gestured for Ryan to fol ow me. \u201cI\u2019ll show you to the Great Room,\u201d I said. Too late I remembered we had rearranged the furniture for our sparring matches.</p><p>\u201cRedecorating?\u201d Ryan asked, shoving his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded, and I jogged up the stairs. Jared and his siblings stood in the center of my room when I returned, seeming nervous and out of place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Ryan,\u201d I said. Once the words came out of my mouth, Claire\u2019s eyes widened, and she shoved me aside, pushing my bedroom door shut.</p><p>Her finger touched her lips, and she waited, keeping her hand against the door.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Ryan call ed, knocking twice.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I said, shrugging to Claire.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice the Lotus Exige you have parked out front. New car?\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes squeezed shut, and then she looked at me again, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cEr...no...? I believe my mother has company this evening. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was silent for a few moments, but then Ryan knocked on the door again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d I said, unable to hide the irritation in my voice. I glanced back at Jared, hoping he would give a sign as to what I should do.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same car Claire drove the night we first saw her at the pub?\u201d</p><p>When Jared held out his arms and shrugged, I sighed. \u201cI...can\u2019t remember, Ryan. Do you want me to get ready or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d he said, his voice just on the other side of the door, \u201cI ran the plates, and it\u2019s registered to Claire Ryel.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time, Claire looked nervous. She rubbed the back of her neck the way her brother rubbed his when things between us were tense. It struck me as funny, and a smile forced its way to the surface.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d Claire mouthed silently. When I covered my mouth with my hand, a smile crept across her face as wel .</p><p>\u201cUh....\u201d I said, turning once again to Jared. He rol ed his eyes, gesturing for us to somehow fix the mess we\u2019d made. \u201cShe was here. She was here earlier helping me...er...pick out a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she walked home?\u201d Ryan said from the hal .</p><p>\u201cNo. No, she didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, stal ing.</p> <p>Claire desperately pointed at Jared.</p><p>\u201cJared took her home!\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan puffed. \u201cOkay, but the Escalade is parked behind the Lotus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I whispered, interlocking my fingers on top of my head. \u201cHe...took her home on his motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>Claire gave me a thumb\u2019s up, and I relaxed a bit, hoping Ryan would accept my story.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cCould I talk to Claire for a minute? Just...just for one minute.\u201d The door handle moved, and Claire\u2019s hand instantly gripped around it, refusing to let it budge a mil imeter more.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here, Ryan. I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you that way before.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned, and I laughed once. \u201cIt\u2019s different, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cCan I talk to you? Please? I won\u2019t take up much of your time, I swear. I just need to, uh...wow,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cI feel real y stupid right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, since she\u2019s not here,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cClaire. Please?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Claire leaned her forehead silently against the door. She bit her lip and sighed. \u201cGo away, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Ryan said, his voice excited. \u201cPlease open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina told me what you said. It\u2019s sweet, but...,\u201d she cringed, \u201cyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw,\u201d Ryan said, his tone notably less enthusiastic than before. \u201cI know you were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I was in Afghanistan or wherever, sniping Al Qaeda, and carrying you over my back for miles. Sounds like me,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI just want to see you,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI need to see you to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, and Claire\u2019s expression grew impatient. \u201cBeat it, Ryan,\u201d she said.</p><p>After a short pause, Ryan hit the door with the side of his fist. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Claire yel ed, taking a step away from the door. \u201cWave your shiny badge around and impress us to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the door!\u201d Ryan demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m not giving up on you.\u201d</p><p>He stomped down the stairs and slammed the door.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Lesson</p><p>\u201cI need the keys to your bike,\u201d Claire said, holding out her hand to Bex.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to fol ow him, and he knows my freaking car! Give me your keys!\u201d she said, jerking her hand toward Bex, impatient.</p><p>In one swift movement, Bex handed his motorcycle keys to his big, little sister. She wheeled around, sprinting down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the helmet,\u201d he call ed after her.</p><p>\u201cShove it!\u201d she yel ed before slamming the door.</p><p>I walked to my vanity, sitting hard onto the delicate pink cushion of the bench. \u201cThis is bad.\u201d</p><p>Jared took slow steps to stand beside me. \u201cRyan is the least of our worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me feel much better,\u201d I said.</p><p>Bex left us alone to sit on the stairs, and Jared pul ed me from the bench to sit beside him on the bed. He didn\u2019t speak for a long time, lightly brushing the skin of my arm, from wrist to elbow, with his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what could happen?\u201d he said softly, his eyes stil focused on my arm.</p><p>After a short pause, I took a breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He meant my death. Dying at the hands of the most inhumane, cruel beings on three planes wasn\u2019t peaceful, in my sleep as I had planned, but it was an end. I wondered what would take place in that moment, and what ways Jared would suffer in the days fol owing my death.</p><p>His eyes were dark, the skin around them tight, but tired. The helpless feeling surrounding us was suffocating.</p><p>\u201cI know what Father Francis said,\u201d Jared said, his voice breaking. \u201cBut, I can\u2019t believe that. I have to see the book for myself to be sure. There has to be a reason our father\u2019s wanted it so badly. Gabe must have known there was a way to stop it.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cJust for a while. Just until I fal asleep?\u201d</p><p>Jared met my eyes, and I could see that he would let me win.</p><p>We lay together above the sheets, silent and thoughtful. I imagined Jared was careful y plotting a way around Donovan and Isaac in his mind, praying for a conclusion. Shax had stayed one step ahead of Jared\u2014even Kim, his secret weapon\u2014and he was frustrated.</p><p>Jared\u2019s arms tensed. Bex\u2019s light footsteps rushed down the stairs, and the door opened. After a few moments, another set, heavier, returned with him, and Kim appeared in the doorway, out of breath and wide-eyed.</p><p>Jared sprung from the bed, pul ing on his jacket. \u201cStay with her, Bex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Knowing they were going to try to capture the book, I jumped from the bed, pul ing on a pair of sneakers. \u201cHe should go. I\u2019ll go, too, and if anything happens, Bex can help.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned while he made his decision. \u201cNina....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for a lecture,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know you have a better chance if Bex is there.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, clearly conflicted. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The streets were filthy, lined with mounds of dirty snow. The Escalade flew at three times the speed limit, racing against the moment Shax realized we\u2019d found him.</p><p>Jared slammed on the breaks in front of an old apartment building on the outskirts of town, and he and Kim rushed in. Bex was stoic, waiting patiently for a signal. My knees bounced nervously as I bit at my thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Bex said, pul ing a handgun from the back of his pants. \u201cIf I go in, keep this with you. The safety\u2019s on, so\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it off before I fire, I know.\u201d</p><p>Bex smiled. \u201cYou\u2019l be fine. Just don\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><p>The waiting was excruciating. The night was too quiet; the building too dark. I had expected immediate flashes of gun fire, and Jared and Kim to run out, with snarling, misshapen beasts in pursuit.</p><p>Bex picked at his nails, seeming bored, but patient. I checked my handgun again, making sure it was loaded and ready.</p><p>\u201cWe real y need Claire here. We have to figure out how to get the three of us in the same room with Shax and keep you protected at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just itching to get one in on him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cOn Shax?\u201d Bex said. \u201cJared\u2019s fought a hundred of \u2018em. They react to me the same way they do Kim. They won\u2019t come near me. It\u2019s irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it better not be because of my age, or anything like that. I\u2019m ready,\u201d he sniffed.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d I said, my voice absent of sarcasm.</p><p>Bex turned to me with a smal smile, reminding me of his innocence. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. How much time have we spent together, with Jared nowhere in sight? I\u2019m the hardest Taleh case there is: dirty cops and demons after me day and night, and I don\u2019t have a scratch. Maybe they stay away because they\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded, satisfied. \u201cYeah. Probably so.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Jared and Kim appeared, walking slowly from the back of the building.</p><p>\u201cNo go?\u201d Bex asked as Jared slammed his body into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cThey were already gone,\u201d he seethed, his jaw muscles flitting under his skin.</p><p>\u201cShax is playing games with us,\u201d Kim said. \u201cOtherwise he\u2019d move it out of town...or out of the country. He wants you to doubt your judgment, and he\u2019s using me to bait you...wear you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be another way,\u201d Jared said, slamming the shifter into gear. \u201cWe\u2019re making the same mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they al the same?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared, Kim, and Bex turned in my direction.</p><p>\u201cThe books. Are they al the same? You said there were others. Is there another one we can get to? One that belongs to a demon that doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re coming?\u201d</p><p>Jared and Kim traded glances.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cWaste of time,\u201d Bex replied.</p><p>\u201cNigh, Shax\u2019s book is the only one that we know of that has been brought to this plane. The others...we\u2019d have to go to Hel to get,\u201d Kim explained.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s out,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cUnless,\u201d Bex began.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d I said, touching Bex\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWe could talk someone with access in to getting one.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cNo one is going to do that, Bex, it would start a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel would.\u201d A smal , amused smile touched Bex\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Jared said, pul ing into Cynthia\u2019s driveway.</p><p>Kim stretched, and then patted my back side. \u201cSee you in class tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief. She was so unaffected by it al .</p><p>The headlight of Bex\u2019s motorcycle shuttered as Claire pul ed into the drive. She was noticeably upset.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, watching her place the bike on its kickstand.</p><p>She fidgeted, and then put her hands on her hips, looking down. Her long bangs fel into her eyes as she procrastinated. \u201cI missed one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cKit Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wil be a problem,\u201d Jared replied.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s Kit Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s partner,\u201d Claire said, combing her hair back with her fingers, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Bex asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cRyan went to his house tonight,\u201d Claire said. \u201cDonovan call ed while he was there. Anderson was only on the phone for a moment, but it was Donovan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>They al craned their necks at me.</p><p>Claire made a face. \u201cWhat do you think, Nina? I\u2019ve got to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fel open. \u201cBut it\u2019s Ryan\u2019s partner. He just lost his whole unit. You\u2019re going to kil his partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than you,\u201d Bex said, climbing onto his bike.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cHome. I need to check on Mom, make some call s.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, and then looked at me. \u201cLet\u2019s get you inside. You\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my ensemble: a coat over my robe, and tennis shoes. I\u2019d been in such a hurry to ride along, I\u2019d barely dressed. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, fol owing him inside. Jared had told me over a year ago that he could sense my feelings, but I would never get used to him noticing them before I did.</p><p>In my bedroom, I kicked off my sneakers and peeled off my coat, fal ing into the bed. Jared crawled into bed beside me, outlining my body with his. Sleep came quickly, despite the excitement of chasing after Shax.</p><p>It felt as if the moment I closed my eyes, I jerked awake, covered in sweat, screaming for my father. Jared held me, this time silent. There was nothing left to say that hadn\u2019t been said already. Reassuring me that it was just a bad dream was pointless.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, pul ing on his shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Just...stay,\u201d I said between breaths.</p><p>He kissed my forehead, whispering sweet comfort in French in my ear. I didn\u2019t know what the words meant, but it was so soft and soothing, I was relaxed against his chest in moments.</p><p>I took in a deep breath, inhaling his incredible scent. A tingling traveled the length of my body, and I extended my neck to kiss the lobe of his ear.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d I said, kissing tiny sections of his skin until I reached his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good time for us to\u2014,\u201d he began, but I kissed him, cutting off yet another lecture.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I said, tears fil ing my eyes, \u201cI need to forget. Just for a little while. Help me forget.\u201d</p><p>Jared returned my kiss, cautiously giving in. His soft, ful lips worked against mine, but not in the way I wanted.</p><p>I pul ed his t-shirt over his head, but when I tugged at the belt of my robe, he gently held my wrist. \u201cSweetheart....\u201d</p><p>The frustration and fear final y boiled over, and I fel flat against his body, face down. My tears pooled between his chest and my cheeks.</p><p>Jared sat up, bringing me with him. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cPlease don\u2019t....\u201d he trailed off, sighing at the messy sight of me. Final y he kissed me, leaning me tenderly against the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shamelessly took advantage of his moment of weakness before it passed. For the first time in months, we lost ourselves in each other. Not a single moment did I worry or regret, and neither did Jared...until it was over.</p><p>Peaceful against his skin, my head rose and fel with his deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to say anything,\u201d Jared said, kissing my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the Christmas party is next weekend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he smiled, beginning to relax.</p><p>I stretched. \u201cI assume you\u2019ve bought a suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a dress,\u201d I said, my brows pul ing together.</p><p>Jared laughed, momentarily forgetting about anything but the mundane details of our normal life.</p> <p>We giggled and snuggled until the sun filtered through the curtains, and then Jared walked across the room to dress. I turned on my side to watch him, propping my head with my hand. Knowing how many bul ets and wounds he\u2019d sustained in the last few years, his skin was flawless. Every inch of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you plotting over there?\u201d Jared asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing, I\u2019m simply appreciating your form.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed a pair of light blue boxer briefs up his legs and over his bare backside. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>I pul ed the sheet across the room with me, hunting for something casual to wear to Brown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair at al . I should be al owed to appreciate as wel ,\u201d he smiled. That smile quickly faded as he pul ed me behind him.</p> <p>Bex knocked twice before walking in. \u201cGeez! Real y?\u201d he yel ed, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cKnocking doesn\u2019t count if you just walk in!\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>I backed into the closet, mortified.</p><p>The door opened again, and Jared sighed. \u201cWe are al owed privacy,\u201d he said, his voice low and angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it al before,\u201d Claire said. \u201cHey,\u201d she smiled, poking her head into the closet. \u201cYou wanna hang out today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Jared warned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s learning, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Claire snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s got to see it sometime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not learning that,\u201d Jared said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got business today, anyway,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Kim walked in, confused by the number of people in the room coupled with our lack of clothing. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Jared glared at Bex, and then at Claire. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need her for a distraction in case Ryan shows up,\u201d Claire said, irritated that she had to explain.</p><p>\u201cSo now she\u2019s bait?\u201d Jared seethed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tel me what\u2019s going on and let me make the decision?\u201d I said. Being spoken about as if I weren\u2019t in the room was quickly becoming my least favorite thing.</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s going to take out Anderson,\u201d Jared said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kil him?\u201d I asked. Claire nodded. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>She watched me, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cBut, I have class,\u201d I said, completely aware of how ridiculous the words sounded.</p><p>Jared pushed Claire and Bex backward. \u201cThat settles it. Out.\u201d</p><p>Claire ducked under her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cIf Ryan shows up, you could help. Otherwise it could get bad. He might try to protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared froze, and then turned to face me. \u201cThis is a bad idea. We can figure something else out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim has class, too,\u201d Claire said, her voice smooth and persuading. \u201cJared needs her help today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t go to class half the time, anyway, and stil has a four-point-oh,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cWatch you take a man\u2019s life?\u201d I said, unsure.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d C.aire said. \u201cAnd to help if Ryan shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I shut the closet door to dress.</p><p>I put on black jeans, a black turtleneck and pul ed my hair back into a low bun. When I emerged, Claire\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cI have boots that would look amazing with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear stilettos on a hit,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>Claire wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhy not? I do it al the time.\u201d</p><p>With that, we al made our way down the stairs and out to the drive. Jared and Kim took the Escalade, and Bex, Claire and I piled into the Lotus.</p><p>She drove us to North Providence, and turned on Mineral Spring Avenue, parking in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot, not a block from the red brick building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. It\u2019s seven in the morning! You\u2019re going to gun down a cop in broad daylight?\u201d I said in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWil you pretend I know what I\u2019m doing for two seconds?\u201d Claire snapped. She slipped on her large glasses and nodded to an officer walking out to a cruiser.</p><p>\u201cAnderson?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Claire said, waiting a beat after Anderson pul ed out onto the road before she turned the wheel and pressed on the gas to fol ow.</p><p>She stayed so far behind the black and white that I thought a few times we\u2019d lost him. Claire\u2019s eyes were focused, however, and what I couldn\u2019t see, she saw as if it were right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, slowing by the curb. \u201cLet\u2019s set up shop,\u201d she said to her brother.</p><p>Bex nodded once, pul ing a hot pink duffel bag from the back seat.</p><p>I eyed the bag, and then smiled at Bex.</p><p>He rol ed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to get her to bring black ones. Or even brown or green. She won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be an assassin, but I\u2019m stil a girl,\u201d she said, popping a stick of gum in her mouth.</p><p>We kept a low profile; climbing over fences, dodging dogs on chains and play equipment, and final y sneaking into a two-story building. The stairs were unusable, the bottom half lay on the floor, and the top half hung by only a few debilitated boards.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Bex threw me over his shoulder, and then hopped from the wal , to a beam, to the next floor. Even from my angle, he looked like Spiderman. I couldn't imagine why he thought he needed to float\u2014and he could climb wal s easily enough.</p><p>Claire took a single leap, grabbing the landing where the stairs met the second floor, and then swung herself to our position.</p><p>\u201cYou can put me down, now, Bex,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, taking a running jump to the half-exposed rafters. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, helping me balance. We were sitting on a few beams lined together that formed what used to be the attic floor.</p><p>Claire lay on her stomach beside me, clicking the pieces of her rifle together. \u201cThey\u2019re going to meet here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>Anderson is very paranoid. That\u2019s how he\u2019s made it this far. If you tip him off, it wil be a while before we get a chance like this again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, watching Bex pul his own rifle from the l bag. He didn\u2019t set it on its stand in front of him; instead, he set it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cJust look through the sights. Don\u2019t take the shot, even if you have one. It\u2019s just for practice,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>I began to whisper affirmation, but voices below startled me. Claire slowly put her hand on the barrel of my rifle, and then let go, situating herself to aim.</p><p>\u201cLook through your sights,\u201d she whispered. I did so, and three men in suits came into view, along with a man in uniform. \u201cCount them. How many do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d I said.</p><p>Bex leaned in beside my ear. \u201cLook by the entrance.\u201d</p><p>I slowly moved my rifle in the direction he referred to, spotted two more. To my surprise, the men were not in uniform, but in suits. Their broad shoulders and extra-large frames reminded me of old movies about the Mob.</p><p>\u201cBodyguards,\u201d Bex said. \u201cLook closer at their jackets. You see the slight bulging on each side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re armed,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>With one finger, Claire tuned the tiny adjustment on her rifle. The tiny click sound it made seemed as loud as a jet engine to me, but the noise was so insignificant, it was inaudible to the men below.</p><p>Bex touched my elbow with the back of his finger. \u201cShe\u2019s going to account for crosswind and range-to-target, but this is an easy shot. Once the gun goes off, try to relax. I\u2019ll get you down and out of here, and by the time you blink twice, we\u2019l be on our way home in the Lotus.\u201d His low, even tone reminded me of an emcee for a televised golf tournament, or the narrator for an African Lion documentary...minus the accent.</p><p>Claire held her breath, peering into the scope. She bit her lip, and began to squeeze the trigger.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cRyan just pul ed up. He\u2019s a block north. You and Nina intercept him, I\u2019ll meet you in twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014,\u201d I began, but before I could protest, Bex lifted me off the wooden beams and climbed out the broken slats of an old vent, dropping more than thirty feet below. He landed smoothly, and tugged on my hand. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, keeping his voice to a whisper.</p><p>We ran down an al ey as fast as my legs could move, slowing only when we reached the next street down.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Bex said, leading me by the hand across the street, this time at a reasonable pace.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d a voice call ed.</p><p>I turned to see Ryan walking toward us; confused, but happy to see me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I forced my best smile, trying to control my breathing. \u201cClocked-in already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he smiled, flicking his badge. \u201cWhat are you doing this far north?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made her drive me to my girlfriend\u2019s house,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Ryan blinked, and then scanned Bex from top to bottom. \u201cOh. I thought you were Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d he said, offering his hand to Ryan. \u201cJared\u2019s little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2019m supposed to meet my partner. I\u2019ll call you tonight, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet your partner?\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Work stuff.\u201d</p><p>Bex and I traded glances, and then Bex tugged on my coat. \u201cWel ...don\u2019t want to keep Mandy waiting.\u201d</p><p>Ryan smiled. \u201cNo man, you probably don\u2019t. See you guys around.\u201d</p><p>We walked at a forced pace until Ryan was out of sight, and then Bex pul ed on me again. He was barely at a jog, while I was sprinting ful speed until we reached the next block over, where Claire waited in the Lotus.</p><p>\u201cIt was a trap,\u201d I said, breathless. \u201cThey were waiting for Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Claire said, her eyes focused and menacing.</p><p>She raced down the street, weaving in and out of traffic until we reached Brown University. \u201cWhat about Ryan?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Bex wil wait here until Jared\u2019s finished. I have some things to wrap up.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and then watched from the curb as she sped away.</p><p>\u201cTel me,\u201d I said, turning to Bex.</p><p>\u201cI only heard a little as we were leaving to cut off Ryan, but Donovan sent those men to col ect him. They were going to see what he knew about you...and us. Mainly Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now Ryan\u2019s a target,\u201d I said, unhappy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re al targets,\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>It's Your Funeral</p><p>\u201cI was right,\u201d I said, letting Jared take my coat. \u201cIt looks like Christmas threw up on the conference room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right. And how ridiculous, when you\u2019re decoration enough,\u201d Jared said, kissing my cheek.</p><p>Loud, obnoxious music made it necessary to talk loudly to each other. Red, green and gold tinsel draped every surface in the room, and the employees, with their dates, loitered in a perfect half-moon around the DJ, careful not to cross the boundary of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tel the DJ to turn it down a notch or ten,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared nodded, watching with amusement as I walked with purpose across the wooden floor.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said. The DJ bobbed his head, concentrating on the computer screen in front of him. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d I yel ed, tapping him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he yel ed back.</p><p>\u201cCan you turn it down? I\u2019d like for the guests to hear each other.\u201d</p><p>The DJ frowned. \u201cMs. Bankovic asked that I keep it at party level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha?\u201d I confirmed. \u201cThis is a business party, not a frat party,\u201d I said over the music. \u201cTurn it down.\u201d</p><p>The DJ grudgingly complied, and I walked away, thoroughly satisfied. That warm, fuzzy feeling from my smal victory didn't last long. Sasha had Jared cornered a few feet from the punch bowl. He looked boredd and uncomfortable; she was giggling, gesturing to the mistletoe above them.</p><p>\u201cHi, Baby,\u201d Jared said emphatical y, pul ing me to his side.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Sasha said, surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I raised an eyebrow. \u201cI mean...where have you been?\u201d she hedged.</p><p>\u201cWith the DJ, insisting he lower the music to an acceptable decibel. Now, if you\u2019re finished flirting, I\u2019ll save my fianc\u00e9 from beneath the mistletoe so you no longer have a reason to threaten him with your dry, clumpy lipstick.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s mouth fel open, but I didn\u2019t give her enough time to fire back a reply. A slow song came over the speakers, and I pul ed Jared to the center of the dance floor.</p><p>His fingers pressed into my skin, eager and anxious. \u201cWould it be redundant of me to say that I enjoy it very much when you\u2019re jealous and mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but say it anyway,\u201d I smiled, wrapping my arms around his neck. Before long, more couples joined us, and we were lost in a sea of lovers swaying to the music.</p><p>When the song ended, Jared left for the punch bowl line, and I stayed behind to greet co-workers and guests. Some were retirees, men and woman that had been with my Titan since the beginning. Seeing them brought back hundreds of memories, and it was soon a relief to welcome the new faces of the company. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be standing around when there\u2019s a slow song, Peanut,\u201d Grant said. He undoubtedly wore his most charming smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with Jared, Grant,\u201d I sneered.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon,\u201d Grant grinned. \u201cJust one dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and shook his head. \u201cYou look,\u201d he gave me a once-over, \u201cincredible. Red is...wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, looking in every direction but his.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2014,\u201d he said, trailing off. \u201cJared! Nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>The pleasant expression on Jared\u2019s face as he handed me the smal , plastic cup faded abruptly when he turned to Grant. \u201cI wish I could concur,\u201d</p><p>Jared said, noticeably restrained. \u201cYou might have better luck with the interns,\u201d he nodded to a dark corner of the room, \u201cwho are spiking their punch, and might be more susceptible to your persistence.\u201d</p> <p>Grant\u2019s smile didn\u2019t budge. \u201cHappy Holidays to you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>The people around us were beginning to stare, so I looked to the floor, attempting to downplay the spectacle Jared had made.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you?\u201d I said, trying to keep my head down.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be under the impression that I liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made your point. Now, can you please be the reserved, control ed Jared I know and love? I need to earn the respect of the people here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jared said, kissing my hair.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d a voice call ed from across the room. I winced at the horrid sound, and then turned to see Sasha barreling toward me with someone in tow.</p><p>\u201cPractice what you preach,\u201d Jared said with a contrived smile.</p><p>Sasha's annoying smirk twisted her face in a way that made her already sharp features seem cartoon-like. She gestured to the brawny, dark- headed man behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like for you to meet my date, Ryan Scott. Ryan, this is a fel ow intern of mine, Nina Grey.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hide the instant shock and dismay that came over me.</p><p>Ryan held out his hand. \u201cIntern? Doesn\u2019t she run the company?\u201d he winked.</p><p>Sasha laughed once, caught. \u201cEr...not yet.\u201d</p> <p>I took Ryan\u2019s hand. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Sasha said, genuinely intrigued.</p><p>Ryan glanced at Jared, and then back at me. \u201cCould I...steal you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said without pause.</p><p>I chuckled nervously, and then peered up at Jared from under my lashes. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned, but he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cWel ,\u201d Sasha said to Jared in her high-pitched, irritating voice, \u201cI guess it\u2019s just you and me, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said, staring directly at Sasha.</p><p>Ryan held me by the arm, quickly stopping in a quiet corner. \u201cI thought we had a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA deal?\u201d I hissed. \u201cI agreed that I owed you for helping me fool Jared. I didn\u2019t say I would help you talk to Claire. Ambushing her is not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWel , I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate right now. My partner was murdered, and I think it has something to do with the other police deaths over the last year. I think they\u2019re al connected. I need to talk to her before I can get my head on straight enough to investigate this. It\u2019s big, Nina.</p><p>Real y big, and I can\u2019t focus on it if my mind is always on Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re investigating the police murders?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s features were so stern I was suddenly nervous. \u201cNot official y. Anderson and I were both on the case before he was kil ed. I wasn\u2019t sure before that they were connected, but now that Kit\u2019s dead...I know. Even the one\u2019s that appeared to be accidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen\u2014,\u201d I began, but Ryan cut me off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen. I\u2019m in a lot of trouble. No one else at the station knows what we were up to, and if they did, they\u2019re not going to let a rookie take the case. They kil ed my partner, Nina. It\u2019s personal. But, if I don\u2019t figure this out soon, you can kiss my ass goodbye. This is serious, and I need to be focused, and Claire\u2019s eyes above me in that hel hole is al I can think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you finished?\u201d I said, irritated.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cAnd, just so you know: I\u2019m real y, real y sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I said, returning his expression.</p><p>Ryan grabbed each side of my face, and kissed me. Not just any kiss; his tongue was inside my mouth, and he kissed me so passionately, it was beyond obscene in front of everyone I worked with, not to mention my fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Before the embarrassment soaked in, Ryan was thrown across the room, and slid on his side along the dance floor, stopping just before he crashed into the DJ station.</p><p>The music abruptly cut off, clearing the air for the screams and audible panic.</p><p>\u201cJared, stop!\u201d I shouted, watching him charge.</p><p>I ran across the wooden floor, hoping to stop any bloodshed, but before I reached Ryan, Claire appeared in front of him, in a protective stance, facing her brother.</p><p>Jared stood motionless, breathing heavily from the angry adrenaline running through his veins. \u201cHe did it...on purpose,\u201d Jared huffed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you played right into his plan,\u201d Claire said, livid. She turned to Ryan. \u201cKissing my sister? That\u2019s how you planned to get my attention?\u201d she said, pul ing him up by his tie.</p><p>Ryan choked a bit before loosening up the knot around his neck, and then smiled. \u201cI did what I had to,\u201d he said to Claire, and then looked to Jared, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you\u2019re reasons are, don\u2019t ever touch Nina like that again. I can\u2019t kil you, but I\u2019ll make you wish you were dead.\u201d Jared grabbed my hand, and then led me from the party, down two flights of stairs, and out to the parking lot.</p><p>When we reached the Escalade, I covered my mouth with one hand. Jared was stil angry, but when he looked at me, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cHe so got you,\u201d I said, trying not to laugh out loud.</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cHe did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>We both laughed aloud, uncontrol ably, more than we had ever done before. By the time we were finished, I was breathless, and the muscles in my stomach were sore and tight.</p><p>We drove home, hand in hand, smiling at one another at each stoplight. Ryan final y getting face time with Claire should have been a disaster, but a sense of relief surrounded us, as if our group was final y complete. I had no idea what Claire would tel Ryan\u2014how much truth she would real y share\u2014but Ryan being Claire\u2019s Taleh, and the fact that he was now in love with her, was proof that we were supposed to be in each others lives.</p><p>Jared\u2019s prediction was wide of the mark, but he had never looked so happy to be wrong since we\u2019d met.</p><p>The next day, I awoke to large flakes of snow fal ing graceful y from the sky. Each fluffy white piece drifted downward as if it were orchestrating its own symphony. Looking out the window, the ground was already covered in at least two feet of snow, and the gray clouds above didn\u2019t foretel anything but more of the same.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been like that since four A.M.,\u201d Bex said from the hal way.</p><p>I tightened my robe around me, and opened the door.</p><p>Bex stood before me, bored and holding a half-eaten apple. He took another bite, crunching loudly. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, leaving him to head for the bathroom.</p><p>Steam from the shower quickly surrounded me, but before I rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I heard the door open.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Claire said, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>I peered through the fuzzy glass, barely able to make out her tiny frame. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been up al night with Ryan. We talked a lot. We fought more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what he saw in the desert, and if I was there or not. He knows the men that stabbed him last year were cops. He knows a lot more than we thought. Final y...,\u201d she sighed, \u201cfinal y I just told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything? You confessed about the other cops, and the commissioner? About Anderson, and...and about what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you explain without tel ing him everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised I would explain later.\u201d She frowned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to tel him, Nina. We were raised on the belief that this secret kept our family safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t tel him until it feels right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it never feels right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, turning off the water. A towel flew up and over the shower door, landing on my head. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Claire said, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>By the time I was dressed and ready, Claire, Jared and Bex were downstairs in the kitchen, discussing Ryan. Just by entering the room, it was obvious it was not a constructive conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a hypocrite!\u201d Claire growled.</p><p>Jared slammed the side of his fist on the table. \u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a different scenario!\u201d Jared glanced in my direction, and then took a breath, attempting a calmer tone. \u201cYou said it yourself. It doesn\u2019t feel right to tel him.\u201d</p><p>I sat down, scanning the siblings with my eyes before speaking. Outwardly, Claire was angry. But her eyes were begging for understanding.</p><p>Tel ing Ryan anything was a huge step for her, and just as Jared struggled with it two years before, Claire was now fighting with her conflicting feelings. She needed her brothers to support her I took a seat across from Jared, and next to Claire. The choice was meaningful, and I hoped that they would notice. \u201cMaybe Claire is looking for your blessing, Jared,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOr just some understanding,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Bex stood up, and walked across the kitchen, picking up a plate, and then setting in front of me. It was an omelet, loaded with ham, green onion, mushrooms, and cheese.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Bex nodded, and then touched his sister's shoulder. \u201cClaire, I love you. But if you\u2019d take a step back and think about this. Ryan is a cop. He\u2019s investigating murders you committed. What do you think he\u2019s going to do when you tel him you murdered his partner? You think he's going to forgive you because he saw your eyes in the desert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe partner that orchestrated his kidnapping and ultimate demise,\u201d Claire said. \u201cListen,\u201d she sighed, \u201cI know how it looks on paper. I may not be in love with Ryan, but he says he\u2019s in love with me. If he listens to what I have to say, and I approach it careful y, I think he could be an asset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t take that chance,\u201d Jared said, finality in his voice.</p><p>Claire stood, her palms flat on the table. \u201cYou took the same chance when you told Nina, and she wasn\u2019t even an asset! Her life has spun out of control since the second you revealed yourself to her, Jared. At least let me make my own decision, like you did!\u201d</p><p>Jared's nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cYou were on me for months about Nina, Claire! How quickly you forget the hours I spent listening to your lectures on doing the right thing. Keep the secret. Keep the secret! That's been your mantra for years!\u201d</p><p>Tears fil ed Claire\u2019s eyes as her face turned red. \u201cComing from you!\u201d she screamed. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to have no one, and you know what it\u2019s like to final y be free of the burden of what we are; to have someone else besides your mother, or your brothers to confide in! I have no one, Jared! You\u2019ve lived it, and you stil deny me the liberation you insisted on?\u201d</p><p>Jared shifted in his seat, but I could see in his eyes he would not yield. Claire saw it, too.</p><p>\u201cGo to hel !\u201d she shrieked before storming out of the house. She slammed the door with such force that the surrounding painting and pictures on the wal fel from their nails, and crashed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d I said, meeting Jared\u2019s obstinate stare. \u201cClaire, wait!\u201d I yel ed, hoping she would hear it before she sped away. I ran outside, stopping at the Lotus.</p><p>Claire wiped her eyes. \u201cSorry. I cry when I\u2019m mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d I said, offering an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to go to Anderson\u2019s funeral.\u201d Claire focused her eyes straight forward, too emotional to make eye contact.</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a good enough reason when he asked, but I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s ice blue eyes darted up in surprise. \u201cYou wil ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an hour,\u201d she said, attempting to mask her hopeful expression.</p><p>I looked at my watch. \u201cOkay. Give me a minute to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned as I slipped on a demure black dress. I sat down on the bed to pul up my black stockings, and he sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cThis is inappropriate on so many levels,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cKind of like you sitting next to the reason your father lost his life on the night he died?\u201d I said, slipping on my heels. Jared helped me with my coat, and then I poked a pearl earring into each of my ears. I turned, cupping his jaw with my hands. \u201cYour point is justifiable, but it is her choice, Jared, just like it was yours. Trust Claire to make her own decision. She\u2019s never let you down before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never wanted to tel before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s your answer,\u201d I said, kissing his soft, warm lips. His mouth lingered on mine, and then I pul ed away, knowing Claire was anxiously waiting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I returned to the Lotus alone, slipping into the passenger seat. Claire pul ed on her large, dark sunglasses, and then shoved the gear into first, soaring down the drive, and fish-tailing when she hit the street.</p><p>Saints Peter and Paul cathedral was surrounded by dozens of police cruisers, and even more civilian vehicles. The line at the entrance was already backed up to the next block by sniffling mourners.</p><p>\u201cWe should have come earlier,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here at al ,\u201d Claire said quietly. \u201cShit.\u201d</p> <p>A knock on her window prompted Claire to rol it down, revealing Ryan in his dress blues. \u201cYou made it,\u201d he said with a reserved grin. He opened the door for Claire, and then jogged around the front of her car, opening the door for me. \u201cThanks for coming. It means a lot.\u201d</p><p>I simply nodded, walking behind Ryan as he escorted Claire to the front steps, bypassing the endless line of weeping friends and family. As we passed them, some recognized Ryan and shook his hand. Seeing him seemed to upset some of the women, and even some of the men fought back tears as Ryan traded quiet words during a short hug. Once they acknowledged Ryan, their expressions changed to curiosity, evaluating the smal young lady in the black, leather dress with pointed-toe stilettos.</p><p>Each person we passed offered a pained expression for Ryan, and then regarded Claire with bewilderment. Claire\u2019s dress was long-sleeved, with a respectable crew-neck line. Her skirt was short, but an inch longer than mid-thigh. Maybe it was her beauty that struck them, or the black stilettos that shot up from the ground, turning into a slithering snake with a shiny, turquoise eye on the stainless steel heel of her shoe.</p><p>The ensemble was something only Claire would dare wear to a funeral, but the look fit her. Ryan didn\u2019t seem to mind. Before we reached the doorway, Ryan took Claire\u2019s hand in his, and led her down the aisle. She glanced back at me, unsure of how to react.</p><p>We walked to the front of the sanctuary, seated behind the family, but on the first row of police officers that served with Kit Anderson. Ryan sat between Claire and me, making the situation even more uncomfortable. The pianist worked the keys, and a solemn song echoed throughout the church. Two rows ahead, in the center of the pew, two smal children sat on each side of a woman. A man sitting in front of Claire reached forward to touch her shoulder. She patted his hand, and then squeezed her young son closer.</p> <p>My fingers touched my lips. \u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryan said, leaning into my ear. \u201cThat\u2019s his wife, and his two kids. His little girl is three. His son is seven.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hide the horror in my eyes as I looked to Claire. She was impervious, lowering her chin as a gesture for me to remain calm. Each second after that moment was an eternity. The eulogy, the service, the songs. Once the prayer began, I scrambled from my seat, ignoring those I forced to stand or slide their legs over while I side-stepped to escape.</p><p>The doors pushed open, and the brisk air in my lungs felt like the first time I\u2019d breathed in over an hour. The railing was the only thing keeping me erect while I struggled to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cNina, Jesus!\u201d Claire said. She grabbed my arm, steadying my weak knees. \u201cYou just ran\u2014not walked\u2014 ran out of the funeral of a murdered Providence police officer! Why don\u2019t you just tape a target to your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had babies! A family!\u201d I cried.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a family, too,\u201d Claire said. \u201cWe just happen to have better aim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have talked to him. Given him a chance to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Claire grabbed my shoulders. \u201cKit Anderson was a father and a husband, but if I hadn\u2019t taken him out, he would have handed Ryan over to Donovan\u2019s men, and Ryan would be dead right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. Why would they need Ryan? Donovan knows everything there is to know about Hybrids from Isaac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeverage,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Ryan call ed, running down the steps to the sidewalk. He lifted my chin. \u201cWhat happened back there, Nigh?\u201d He looked to the church, and then back to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to a funeral since Jack....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course, I didn\u2019t realize,\u201d Ryan said, hugging me for a brief moment. \u201cMaybe some food might make you feel better? Have you eaten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, actual y,\u201d I said, just realizing that fact for myself.</p><p>\u201cThe wives are cooking for the guys at the station...taking some over to the family, too. Let\u2019s stop by there before you two head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina has some things to do,\u201d Claire said, slipping on her sunglasses.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes met mine. His expression told me this was the moment of reparation.</p><p>\u201cI should eat,\u201d I said.</p><p>Even through her dark glasses, I could see Claire\u2019s big eyes zero in on mine, an indication of the retribution I would receive once we were alone.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s smile spanned from one side of his face to the other. \u201cOkay, then. You wanna ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said without pause. If I was lucky, I could postpone my punishment until Jared was around. As much as I loved Claire, she was stil intimidating.</p><p>The ride to the North Providence police station was ful of tension, although Ryan babbled like a nervous teenager on his first date. Few people had left the church by the time we\u2019d arrived, but within the half-hour, the smal space quickly overflowed.</p><p>Ryan, Claire, and I retreated to a smal er room where the officers on duty were watching television and playing cards, and two in the corner were arm wrestling.</p><p>\u201cScotty Dog!\u201d one of the officers said. \u201cWhich one's the ex, and which one's your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStow it, McCarty,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cClaire, Nina...this is Matt, and that\u2019s Pat.\u201d He gestured to the officer wrestling Matt\u2019s hand to the table. Final y, Pat succeeded.</p><p>\u201cI was distracted!\u201d Matt said.</p><p>Ryan laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a baby, McCarty. Take the loss like a man.\u201d</p><p>Matt tapped the table. \u201cCome on, then, Scotty. Put your money where your mouth is.\u201d</p><p>Ryan watched Matt pul out a fifty-dol ar bil , slamming it on the table. Claire\u2019s body language was notably different. She raised her hand to her mouth, subtly trying to cover the slight grin that touched the corners of her mouth.</p><p>Ryan saw Claire's expression as wel , prompting him to sit, and then rol up his sleeves. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Their hands and arms shook as they pushed against the other. Matt\u2019s face was red, and a vein had popped out on his forehead like a pulsating worm slithering under his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna let the rookie beat you, McCarty?\u201d Pat said, smiling at the spectacle.</p><p>A few moments later, Ryan slammed Matt\u2019s hand to the table. \u201cYeah!\u201d he grunted, standing up in celebration.</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Claire said, rol ing her eyes. \u201cI thought you invited us to lunch, not a pissing contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna stab at it?\u201d Ryan asked, returning to his seat.</p><p>Claire stiffened. She was competitive, and being forced to lose to Ryan to protect her identity was not something she would handle wel .</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be easy on you just because you\u2019re a girl,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Matt laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s got some eggs on her arms.\u201d</p><p>By the look on his face, Ryan knew exactly what he was doing. He had experienced her strength before, and he was going to test his theory.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d she said, uninterested. \u201cYou\u2019re stil healing.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged. \u201cThen I\u2019ll use the other arm. I\u2019ll stil beat you.\u201d</p><p>Claire sat in the open chair.</p><p>\u201cClaire, no,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan held up his hand, and Claire took it. She lowered her chin, glaring into Ryan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s feisty,\u201d Matt said, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cShut up, McCarty,\u201d Pat said.</p><p>\u201cSay go, Nina,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid....\u201d I said, attempting a last chance to avoid the only two products of their ridiculous stand-off\u2014neither of them good.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Matt yel ed.</p><p>Their arms turned rigid, and then their hands began to tremble. I knew the shaking was on Ryan\u2019s part; Claire looked bored. After fifteen seconds, the officers around the table began harass Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you wouldn\u2019t go easy on her, Scotty Dog?\u201d McCarty smirked.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Scotty. Quit foolin\u2019 around,\u201d Pat said.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face turned several shades of red, and then beads of sweat formed on his brow.</p><p>Claire raised an eyebrow, and then pushed a bit, leaning Ryan\u2019s hand closer to the table.</p><p>McCarty laughed out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna beat him! Scotty\u2019s gonna get beat by a girl!\u201d</p><p>Ryan took a deep breath, and then pressed his lips together, holding his breath and straining so hard, I thought he might pass out.</p><p>Claire looked at Matt, and then back at Ryan. She rol ed her eyes, and the slight tension in her arm gave way. Ryan slammed her hand to the table.</p><p>The officers al cheered, and Ryan stood, rubbing his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Matt said, doubtful.</p><p>Claire patted the empty table space in front of her and smiled. \u201cHave a seat, Sweet Pea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bad, bad idea,\u201d I said. \u201cClaire, it\u2019s time for us to go.\u201d</p><p>Matt put up his hand, and Claire took it.</p><p>I turned to Ryan. \u201cDon\u2019t let her do this. It\u2019s going to draw attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d he asked, focused on my eyes.</p><p>I recoiled from his stare. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Pat said.</p><p>Matt\u2019s arm stiffened against Claire\u2019s. Before long, his face was as red as Ryan\u2019s had been just moments before.</p><p>\u201cHoly, God, you\u2019re strong!\u201d Matt grunted.</p><p>\u201cClaire, please,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, slamming his hand to the table, immediately bringing it back to the start position. \u201cOfficers...,\u201d she nodded.</p><p>It was hard not to sprint to the car. Jared\u2019s reaction was at the forefront of my mind. \u201cStupid! That was so....!\u201d I wheeled around, stopping Claire in her tracks. \u201cStupid!\u201d</p><p>Claire kissed my nose. \u201cNo, it was fun. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The Truth in Sixty Seconds</p><p>Jared shut the curtains, al owing me to relax a bit. The morning sun hurt my eyes, and the ache in my head throbbed every time my heart beat. I turned another page of my textbook, trying to catch up to classmates that hadn\u2019t missed the last two days.</p><p>I pressed my fingers against the skin between my eyebrows. \u201cThe computer guy didn\u2019t know what he was talking about,\u201d I said. \u201cI said simple.</p><p>This laptop is impossible.\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed my back. \u201cNot impossible. You just have to adapt to change.\u201d</p><p>I slammed my book shut. \u201cThat\u2019s al I do, Jared: Adapt to change. The only thing that is constant is the fact that everything keeps changing.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled, kissing my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone to finish your paper, and then we\u2019re going to get out of the house for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I grumbled, opening my book again.</p><p>My eyes passed over the words, but nothing sunk in. Wedding plans, Kit Anderson's children, Ryan being in danger, dead birds and the whereabouts of the book danced around in my mind. Each thought lingered only for a few seconds and then I flipped to the next one like the channels of late-night television. When I caught myself wandering from the topic of my paper, I would force my focus back to reality. Each time that happened, I grew more frustrated.</p><p>Two hours and six pages later, I pul ed on my boots and met Jared outside. The crisp air surrounded me as I walked down the drive, and I buttoned my coat to ward off the cold.</p><p>The Escalade was left running so I wouldn't have to shiver while the cab warmed to a tolerable temperature. Jared helped me inside with a smile, kissing my red nose before shutting the door, and then we made a new set of tracks down the street. The sky had dropped another six inches of snow on the ground, but only after a few hours of sleet had laid down a solid bed for the snow to stick to.</p><p>Jared had no trouble navigating through the ice and powder, but red and blue lights lit the inside of the cab, and the Escalade came to a stop next to a nine foot snow drift.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t he just call?\u201d Jared said, gripping the steering wheel.</p><p>Ryan knocked on the window, and Jared lowered it. Ryan began to speak, but Jared let his finger off the button, stopping the window half-way.</p><p>Ryan waited patiently, and then Jared lowered the window again. When it was at chin level, Ryan addressed me, but Jared, once again, let his finger off the button.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Claire? I haven\u2019t heard from her today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible she\u2019s not going to pick up the phone every time you call , Ryan,\u201d Jared said, amused.</p><p>Ryan's eyes focused on me. \u201cHave you seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today. If she\u2019s not answering, then she must be busy.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cIf you pul me over every time you can\u2019t get Claire on the phone, we\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cI just came across some information I wanted to share with her. About the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Jared asked, annoyed, but curious.</p><p>Ryan narrowed his eyes. \u201cWalter Grahm was the man that tried to rob Nina outside the pub. Ronnie Studebaker, whose friends call ed him \u2018Stu\u2019, was the man that stabbed me. Robert Benson was with them. They were never caught, or charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So?\u201d Jared said, impatient.</p><p>\u201cThey were al detectives of the Providence Police Department. Now they\u2019re dead. Grahm was kil ed while answering a robbery call , Benson stopped breathing in his sleep, and Stu went missing. His body has never been found. I can\u2019t account for the fourth man involved in the attack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have a point, Ryan?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cCommissioner Johnson and six members of state government, in addition to seven police officers have come to untimely deaths in the last eighteen months, including Kit Anderson. Grahm was kil ed the same night twenty-three deaths were reported in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.</p><p>Al GSW\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once. \u201cYou\u2019re not tel ing me anything I don\u2019t know, Ryan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. How do you know this information unless you are responsible for forty-one deaths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! You are way off, Ryan,\u201d I said, shocked at his conclusion.</p><p>Ryan leaned into the window. \u201cYou know what I think? I think the cops were dirty, and that they and those dead officials are part of some sort of crime ring, and Nina got mixed up in it somehow. There\u2019s no way you could have kil ed twenty-three people at the same time in two different states, so I think they lied about what happened. You with me so far?\u201d</p><p>Jared grinned, amused with Ryan\u2019s story. \u201cI\u2019m with you. You\u2019re ful of crap, but I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone that\u2019s dead is a threat to you somehow because they know too much about whatever it is that you do. The question is, how much is too much? And how much more can Claire tel me before you take me out?\u201d</p> <p>Jared laughed out loud. \u201cYou should ease up on the cop shows, Ryan. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, my fianc\u00e9 and I have wedding shopping to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou\u2019re not married, yet?\u201d He looked to me, genuine surprise on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been busy,\u201d I said, embarrassed.</p><p>Jared\u2019s jaw tensed. \u201cThe date has been set. June first. We\u2019l be sure to send you an invitation...that is if I haven\u2019t taken you out, yet.\u201d</p><p>The wheels spun against the wet snow, but the Escalade didn\u2019t move. \u201cDamn,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>He pushed open the door, forcing Ryan to jerk back, and disappeared behind the vehicle. The snow drift kept me from getting out on my side, so I climbed over the console, and Ryan helped me to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked Jared.</p><p>\u201cDigging the truck out. It\u2019l be just a minute, Sweetheart,\u201d he assured me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want help?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said quickly.</p><p>I turned to Ryan, crossing my arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t real y think Jared is responsible for your partner\u2019s death, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he is, Kit\u2019s not the first cop he\u2019s kil ed. There is a single connection tying every single one of those deaths together. Maybe you could talk your boy into keeping his gun in his holster until I figure it out. Or maybe you could just tel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything,\u201d I said, feigning offense.</p><p>\u201cI saw what Jared is capable of the night I was stabbed. I\u2019ve experienced first hand what Claire can do. They aren\u2019t...normal. I know Grahm and the other cops were dirty, but Anderson was a good man. He didn\u2019t deserve to die. Quit treating me like I can\u2019t keep a secret and just tel me.\u201d</p> <p>I looked past Ryan to see Jared stand up, look around, and then lean against the Escalade, freeing it from the ruts without effort.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Baby. We\u2019re out. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ryan walked to the Escalade, evaluating the slide marks the tires had made. He craned his neck at Jared. \u201cI\u2019m going to figure this out. It would save us al a lot of time and energy if you\u2019d just tel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Nina,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I nodded, climbing into the cab.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could help you. Have you thought about that?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Jared took off, leaving him in the snow-buried street.</p><p>I pul ed my coat tighter around me and stuffed my hands under my arms. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a connection in the police department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Ryan,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure talk a lot of smack to Claire about thinking with your emotions. You\u2019re not being objective at al !\u201d</p><p>Jared ignored me, instead, pul ing over when he noticed a woman trying to dig the snow out from under her buried tires.</p><p>A short drive around town turned into a three hour- long aid mission to free stranded motorists from the ice and snow. I would pretend to help, and Jared would pul or push cars and trucks out of snow drifts, ditches, and the side of the road.</p><p>It felt good to use Jared\u2019s abilities to help others; even if it was something smal .</p><p>When we returned to the house, Claire\u2019s Lotus was in the drive, along with a police cruiser.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Jared said, helping me from the passenger side. He carried me through the snow to the side entrance, and then stomped through the house until he found them.</p><p>They sat in the kitchen at the breakfast table, laughing. Claire seemed genuinely happy for once, and I smiled at the sight.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been here?\u201d Jared demanded.</p><p>Claire\u2019s smile faded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I waited for you. I told Ryan you\u2019d tel him what you thought he needed to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo questions asked,\u201d Ryan promised.</p><p>Jared\u2019s hand bal ed into fists at his side, and the tendons in his neck were strained. It took every ounce of wil power he had not to charge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tel ing him anything,\u201d Jared growled. \u201cLeave, before I do something we\u2019l al regret.\u201d</p><p>He turned his back to Claire, and she jumped up to stop him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, landing the palms of my hands on Jared\u2019s chest. \u201cSit, calm down...we\u2019l just talk,\u201d I said, nodding to Claire and Ryan. \u201cLet\u2019s just sit down and hear them out, and if you stil feel the same way, we\u2019l go.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a deep breath, and then nodded, taking a seat across from Claire. I sat beside him, placing my hand on his knee.</p><p>Claire mimicked his sigh, turning to Ryan. \u201cAnything Jared tel s you is privileged information, Ryan. Nina has lied to you, to her best friends, to her family. Are you sure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Ryan glanced at me.</p><p>I leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun knowledge to have. In this case, ignorance is bliss. I recommend you walk away, but it\u2019s your decision.\u201d</p><p>Ryan met Claire\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Claire said. \u201cFirst thing\u2019s first.\u201d She grabbed his shirt and ripped it open, popping off the buttons.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ryan said, holding up his hands.</p><p>\u201cStandard procedure,\u201d she said, pul ing up his white tank top underneath, bearing his chest. She ran her fingers down each side, and then around his back.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You think I\u2019m wearing a wire?\u201d Ryan said, looking at each of us.</p><p>\u201cI kil ed your partner,\u201d Claire said, expressionless.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ryan said. His eyebrows turned in, and he shifted nervously in his chair.</p><p>\u201cJust get right to the point, Claire,\u201d Jared said, shaking his head in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you kil Kit? He was a good man. He was a good cop....\u201d Ryan said, trailing off.</p><p>\u201cHe set you up. He asked you to meet him so men working for someone named Donovan could kidnap you, and ultimately use you as bait.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cNo. Kit wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he was forced. He has kids. They probably threatened to kil them if he didn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s shoulders fel . \u201cSo you were protecting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s once confused expression metamorphosed into suspicion. \u201cW-What do you mean it\u2019s your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d I said, covering my mouth with my hands. I remembered the moment Jared had told me the truth about what he was, and I knew Ryan wouldn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>Claire was stoic. \u201cI\u2019m your guardian angel. My father was an angel, my mother is human. When my father fel in love with my mother and decided to stay with her, he was cursed by Heaven so he would continue to protect his Taleh...his human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad,\u201d I added.</p><p>Claire continued, \u201cThe curse is carried throughout the bloodline for a few generations, so Jared, Bex, and I also have Taleh. We have trained our entire lives to be able to protect you, and we have superhuman speed and strength. Nina is Jared\u2019s...you\u2019re mine. I kil ed Anderson to protect you. I kil ed everyone else to protect Nina, so Jared could stay with her while she healed. I watched you throughout your entire military career, and yes, I pul ed you out of the desert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you were going to let me tel him,\u201d Jared said, displeased.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have al day,\u201d Claire answered.</p><p>Ryan was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot the most important part,\u201d I said.</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cOh yeah, and because of the curse, I can\u2019t die unless you do.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent. I squeezed Jared\u2019s knee, thankful he hadn\u2019t dropped the truth on me the way Claire had just done with Ryan. We al waited for him to breakdown, yel , or try to leave. He just sat in his chair, letting it soak in.</p><p>I took my hands from my mouth and slid them across the table. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked, touching his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he blinked. \u201cJust trying to get it al straight in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tel anyone, I\u2019ll end your life,\u201d Jared said in a low, frightening voice.</p><p>\u201cNot likely, since you\u2019d also be kil ing your sister,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cHe was paying attention,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>One side of Ryan's mouth turned up. \u201cSo you would literal y take a bul et for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Claire said, with zero emotion.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Ryan said, surprised at her answer.</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes, annoyed that she had to answer. \u201cIf I have time to stand in the way of a bul et, you have time to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Ryan said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cSo the question is,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat wil you do with the information now that you have it?\u201d</p><p>Ryan paused in thought, and then fastened the few buttons left on his shirt. \u201cFind Donovan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to our club,\u201d Bex said, plopping into the chair beside me. \u201cI just talked to Kim. They\u2019re on the move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim. Our Kim?\u201d Ryan asked, his eyes darting to me.</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s sort of the opposite of a demon magnet.\u201d</p><p>Ryan left that one alone, turning to Claire. \u201cSounds like you left a lot out.\u201d</p><p>She stood, pul ing Ryan with her. \u201cYes. This is going to be like on-the-job training. Can you handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part,\u201d I said, turning to Bex. \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d</p><p>Bex traded glances with Jared before he spoke. \u201cWe have to move. They have an entourage, so it wil take al three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jared said, nodding as he was lost in thought. \u201cWhere is Kim?\u201d</p><p>Bex twitched. \u201cOutside.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cKim, stays with Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I protested.</p><p>Claire pul ed on her coat. \u201cDid you hear Bex, Nina? The three of us are going. We don\u2019t need Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to stay with Nina. The only things you can\u2019t handle wil be protecting what we\u2019re going after.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t let her out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your gun?\u201d Claire asked.</p><p>Ryan patted his side in confirmation.</p><p>I threw my arms around Jared and squeezed, shutting my eyes tight. \u201cDon\u2019t stay away long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn and out, Baby. In and out,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t come back ful of bul et holes this time!\u201d I call ed after him.</p><p>The door shut, and the sound of the Escalade\u2019s engine faded as everyone I loved most in the world traveled farther and farther away.</p><p>\u201cBul et holes?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, pul ing him into down the hal . \u201cLet\u2019s find more comfortable chairs. This is going to take a while.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>If I Told You Everything</p><p>The rain beat against the window of the classroom, prompting Professor Sawyer to speak louder than her smal voice could accommodate.</p><p>Words squeaked from her throat as she struggled to lecture through the snickers and murmuring of the students.</p><p>Her words blurred together as I stared at the blank page of my laptop monitor. The nightmares were absent the night before, but only because sleep never came. The Ryels didn\u2019t return home until just before the sun rose, and even if I could have ignored the worry long enough for my eyes to close for a moment, Ryan\u2019s incessant questions kept me awake.</p><p>So...what if she gets shot in the head?</p><p>If I die and then Claire dies does she go to Heaven?</p><p>What if I don't die but I'm a vegetable?</p><p>Can she get knocked out?</p><p>So her dad was an angel? Can he see me right now.</p><p>His curiosity was insatiable. I final y lost my temper and yel ed at him to shut up, but he only smiled and sat quietly long enough to think of more questions. For the first time, I was glad that Ryan was no longer enrol ed at Brown.</p><p>I twirled the diamond ring around my finger, trying to block out images of what Bex and Claire had described earlier that morning. Their clash with Isaac and Donovan was short-lived, but had the Ryel's been human, it would have been lethal. The vision of Isaac was so vivid and frightening in my mind, the thought of coming face to face with him terrified me. He and Donovan had been commissioned to protect the Naissance de Demoniac, and because they were faced with al three of Gabe Ryel\u2019s children, they decided retreat was the prudent option\u2014but not before sinking four bul ets into Bex\u2019s chest.</p><p>The kitchen was a bloody mess by sunrise, and although Bex\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, seeing Claire pluck the remnants of bul ets from his flesh left me...wel ...unsettled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, to hel with this, class dismissed,\u201d the professor said in defeat.</p><p>I blinked, seeing the other students pack up without pause and leave the classroom. Once the doorway cleared, Kim stood with a smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back to the house with the others?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cTwo papers due today. I stil go to class, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo how did it go?\u201d I asked, fol owing her down the hal . My feet scampered along her wide strides.</p><p>She shook her head, clearly troubled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, Kim. You\u2019re the impervious one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking Shax, or Donovan and Isaac head on isn't working. We need to think of another way to get the Demoniac. They know when we\u2019re coming. We can\u2019t distract them because they want nothing else more than that book.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, wary of Kim\u2019s uncharacteristic concern. \u201cI stil say we don't need it. Your family had the book al this time. You have to know what it said.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t you open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI was never al owed to open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your uncle? Your father? Between them and Father Francis, can\u2019t we just get enough information for Jared to work with?\u201d</p><p>Kim lowered her chin. \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t catch the part about how we weren\u2019t al owed to open the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself!\u201d The words were louder than I\u2019d meant for them to be. I looked around, and then lowered my voice. \u201cWe can\u2019t take it when they know we\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded, but her somber expression melted away as an idea lit her eyes. \u201cThere is one thing they would want more than the book.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. No way, Jared would never go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need them to come to us. We need bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. He\u2019s not going to risk my life to save me, Kim. And I kind of hate you for even mentioning it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d Beth yelped in her southern drawl. \u201cEw. That\u2019s a horrible face,\u201d she said, mirroring my expression.</p><p>Kim pul ed a cigarette seemingly from nowhere, and popped it between her lips. \u201cWe were just discussing how we would use Nina as bait to lure demons,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>Beth\u2019s face morphed into revulsion. \u201cWhat class are you guys taking?\u201d</p><p>The corners of my mouth turned up, and I wrapped one arm around Beth\u2019s tiny waist. \u201cCome on. I don\u2019t want to lose our table at the Ratty.\u201d</p><p>The three of us carried our trays the corner spot, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile when I saw that Ryan\u2019s chair had been fil ed. His friends surrounded him with wide grins on their faces. They al talked and laughed, making the dead silence upon our approach that much more noticeable.</p> <p>\u201cLook who\u2019s back in town, Babe!\u201d Chad said, standing to greet Beth.</p><p>Beth's tray slapped against the table when she dropped it to throw her arms around Ryan.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bethy,\u201d Ryan said, giving her a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Her pageant-smile stretched to its limit, showing every one of her teeth.</p><p>To the others, lunch with Ryan was a celebration, but as the questions about his last days at war, how he got hurt, and why he\u2019d waited so long to tel them came, I grew nervous. So did Ryan.</p><p>He stood. \u201cWel ! I have to go home...get the old uniform on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you look great in it,\u201d Lisa smiled. \u201cI love men in uniform.\u201d</p><p>Kim rol ed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m out, too. Let\u2019s go, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked, looking up at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Where\u2019re you going?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Kim tugged on my arm until I stood. \u201cTo class, Detective,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat okay?\u201d</p><p>Ryan glanced at me, and then shrugged. \u201cJust asking.\u201d</p><p>Kim gestured for me to fol ow, and we walked to the parking lot. She glanced up once, but didn\u2019t stop to explain why. Her long legs and quick strides had me struggling to keep up, and I was panting by the time we reached the Sentra.</p><p>The light sprinkles stil fal ing from the gray clouds gently disturbed a large puddle near Kim's car. She barreled through it, splashing my jeans with dirty water.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry?\u201d I asked, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI'm taking you to Quincy. We could talk to my father to see what he knows, and if he knows what I think he does\u2014nothing\u2014we present my idea to Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I have class!\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cJared doesn\u2019t show it around you, Nigh, but he\u2019s desperate. He knows something is coming. They\u2019re planning something, and we\u2019ve got nothing.</p><p>We have no idea how to protect you when we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re protecting you from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that al we need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , that\u2019s too bad. Because I\u2019m coming,\u201d he said. He opened the car door behind the passenger side, and slammed it behind him.</p><p>Kim looked to me.</p><p>\u201cJared wil fol ow us,\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to know what my dad has to say...if he says anything.\u201d</p><p>I looked around; the Escalade was notably absent. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from any of them al day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes being in the dark make you feel better? You should know by now why they keep things from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said, afraid of the answer.</p><p>\u201cJust get in the car,\u201d Kim said, settling in behind the wheel.</p><p>The drive to Quincy was silent, but when we slowed to a stop in front of a large gate, Ryan and I shared a col ective gasp.</p><p>\u201cThis is your house?\u201d Ryan asked. Staring in awe at the looming mansion ahead.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Kim said, keying in a code.</p><p>The gate opened slowly, and then Kim accelerated slowly. The gravel drive crunched beneath the Sentra's tires.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Ryan said, his mouth hung open.</p><p>\u201cYes, way,\u201d Kim said, turning off the engine.</p><p>Ryan and I leaned against our windows, amazed at the colossal building in front of us. It wasn\u2019t a home, it was a fortress.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so rich, why do you drive this piece of shi\u2014,\u201d Ryan began.</p><p>\u201cThe Sentra serves her purpose,\u201d Kim interrupted.</p><p>I stepped onto the gravel drive. It snaked al the way to the large, detached garage. Her house was bigger than mine, and far more equipped with security. Cameras were mounted on every corner, and the black iron fence blocking general traffic from entering the drive spanned the entire estate.</p><p>Two large dogs ran with great leaps, barking wildly until they reached us.</p><p>\u201cHey boys!\u201d Kim said, giving them both loving, vigorous scratches. When the reunion was over, she turned to us. \u201cThis is Zeus, and the little one is Hera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of them are little,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>The dogs led us to the front entrance, wagging their tails with such fervor, their entire back half wiggled with the movement.</p><p>Kim opened the door, revealing a vast foyer. A smal , round table stood in the center of the room, boasting an incredible vase that held beautiful, long-stemmed flowers.</p><p>\u201cCharlie!\u201d Kim bel owed into the air, causing the dogs to bark. \u201cCharlie!\u201d she said again. Her voice echoed across the marble tile.</p><p>Two men entered the foyer, both no less than six feet, six inches tal . They were nearly equal in their massive size, and so intimidating that I realized I was unconsciously cowering behind Ryan.</p><p>The largest of the two had a ful , brown beard. When his eyes focused on Kim, he held out his arms, and a wide smile broke across his face.</p><p>\u201cBoo Boo!\u201d he said, his booming voice reverberating throughout the house.</p><p>Kim made her way to him quickly, and as tal as she was, the massive arms that encircled her made her seem tiny. Kim\u2019s feet came off the ground as the man arched his back, and then returned her to earth after a few sweet moments.</p><p>\u201cNigh...Ryan...this is my dad, Charles Pol ock. And this is my uncle Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said, watching as my hand disappeared into each of theirs when I shook them.</p><p>Ryan did the same, but he didn\u2019t seem intimidated at al .</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school, Kimmie?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not real y here to catch up. I brought Nina to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Charles asked, suddenly suspicious.</p><p>Bruce reached behind him, but stopped, looking beyond me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s al just relax, here,\u201d Jared said from behind me. I turned to see both of his arms outstretched in front of him, his Glock securely between his hands.</p><p>Bruce glanced at Charlie, me, and then at Kim, grudgingly pul ing his sidearm slow and careful from behind him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bruce,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Jared released the hold he had on his weapon, and then stood beside me, placing it on the table next to him.</p><p>Bruce pul ed another gun from his back, pointing it at Jared's face, but then his shoulders dropped. \u201cHow many of them are there?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d Claire said. I turned to see her in the same stance as Jared. \u201cAnd if you pul a weapon on us again, I\u2019ll blow your knee cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d Kim said, shaking her head in warning.</p><p>Bruce put the second gun down, and then pul ed up his pant leg, revealing another gun. He set al three side by side on the ground, and then stood.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to check the other leg?\u201d Claire asked, her weapon stil drawn.</p><p>Bruce sighed, and then reached down, pul ing a rather large hunting knife from a holster. \u201cThat\u2019s al of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim,\u201d Charles said, stiff and nervous. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, here?\u201d</p><p>Kim reached out to her father. \u201cNina is my friend, Dad. And she\u2019s important. These people are here to protect her. They\u2019re not here to harm us.\u201d</p><p>Charles nodded slowly, and then touched the arm of this brother. \u201cEasy, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>Bruce relaxed, then, and Claire stepped out of her rigid stance, replacing her gun in its holster.</p><p>Jared turned to me. \u201cWhat the hel are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cuss at me,\u201d I said, immediately defensive.</p><p>Anger lit Jared\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou...you have no idea how dangerous it is for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I would if you would just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I told you everything, you wouldn\u2019t want to leave the house. And I don\u2019t want that for you,\u201d he said, his eyes dark. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do certain things, Nina, and running off with two humans without tel ing me where you\u2019re going is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I huffed. \u201cI thought you\u2019d just fol ow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jared said, taken aback. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ, let\u2019s hear what Kim has to say and get out of here,\u201d Claire snapped.</p><p>I peeked at our audience, embarrassed about the outburst. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, clearing my throat.</p><p>\u201cThe book,\u201d Kim said to Charles.</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d Bruce said. Charles touched his brother\u2019s arm, and Bruce immediately silenced.</p><p>\u201cThey know,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the son of Gabriel, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Charles said, in awe.</p><p>\u201cOne of them,\u201d Jared answered.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s face turned red. \u201cThief. If he wouldn\u2019t have taken the damn book none of this would be happening.\u201d</p><p>Claire took a step forward, and Jared gripped her shoulder. \u201cYou call my father that again,\u201d Claire seethed, \u201cand it wil be the last words that come from your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey're going to help me,\u201d Kim interceded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Charles said, confused.</p><p>\u201cJared promised to help me return the Demoniac to the Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\u201d</p><p>Charles' eyes darted to Jared. \u201cIs this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI need time to study it, but after that, you have my word.\u201d</p><p>Charles took a step back, and then walked several steps away with Bruce right behind him. They conversed in low whispers, and then returned.</p><p>\u201cWe can't trust them,\u201d Charles said, finality in his tone.</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters, now,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe\u2019ve al got some history, here, that\u2019s apparent. But we need to focus on the problem. Dad, Nina is the women in the prophecy in the Naissance de Demoniac. Does that mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Charles\u2019 eyes shifted to mine, and then he scanned me from my hair to my shoes. \u201cNo,\u201d he paused. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Kim turned to me. \u201cI told you. We\u2019re not al owed to open the book. He knows nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you came here?\u201d Jared said, livid. \u201cI could have told you that! If Charles knew anything, Gabe and Jack wouldn\u2019t have taken it in the first place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth a try, because our next option was the last resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I looked at the crowd of people around me, feeling the negative, hostile energy in the air. It was in that moment that I recognized we had final y come to the last leg of the journey. Getting the book back into our hands had always been the only choice, which was why Gabe and Jack had come to me with the answers at night.</p><p>\u201cI have to distract Shax long enough for you to get the book,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Jared turned to me, his eyebrows squeezed tightly together. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jared, she\u2019s trying to be funny. Of course she\u2019s serious,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cBad idea,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>I reached out to to him, touching his cheek with my fingertips. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get the book.</p><p>Jared glanced at Claire, and then back to me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get the book to save you. It doesn\u2019t make sense to put you in danger in order to get our hands on it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is stupid, let\u2019s go,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Kim held up her hands. \u201cWait.

For the first time since we'd arrived, he seemed uneasy.</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes met mine. \u201cBoth sides are talking.

I could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen, Nina,\u201d Jared said. \u201cWe can figure out another way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d I said, looking up at him.</p><p>His eyes fel away from mine, and I knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d I cried, pul ing away from his grip.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Claire said as I passed.</p><p>I ran outside into the rain. Since the day Jack died, my life had spun so far out of control it was hard to remember what my life was like when I was just like any other girl. It wasn\u2019t fair. Eli had instructed me to be strong, and not to mourn the normal life I once had, but I didn\u2019t want to die\u2014 especial y for a choice I didn't make.</p><p>Jared was immediately behind me, encompassing me in his warm arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, his voice pained. \u201cLet me find another way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, wiping my nose. \u201cLet\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, the rest of the group joined us. They al waited patiently for my answer.</p><p>Charles fidgeted. \u201cI wish there was some way we could help you.\u201d</p><p>Kim hooked her arm with her father\u2019s. \u201cI'm helping them,\u201d she said, her eyes strangely soft and sad. \u201cI won't leave her side until it's finished.\u201d</p><p>Charles nodded, squeezing his daughter to his side.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, shaking off the fear. \u201cHow are we going to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy!\u201d Ryan said. \u201cTel her, Jared! There\u2019s no way we\u2019re using her for demon bait!\u201d</p><p>Jared cringed, but he didn\u2019t speak.</p> <p>Claire grabbed my hand. \u201cWe choose our own fate, right Nina?\u201d she said, managing an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, I want it to be on my terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re al insane!\u201d Ryan said, horrified. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m watching you al sentence her to death!\u201d</p><p>Kim opened the door to the Sentra. \u201cNow al we need is a plan,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jared tugged on my hand. \u201cRide with me.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his fingers in mine, knowing he faced the same fate as I. The ride home was quiet; no radio, no talking, just the noise of the road under the tires, and the rain pounding against the windshield.</p><p>The window wipers danced back and forth, clearing the rain drops long enough to let the next droplets splash into their place. Headlights from oncoming cars whizzed by, but they were driving slow because of the weather. It was Jared that was disregarding the speed limit by at least thirty miles per hour.</p><p>The decision to use myself as a distraction was mine, but the plan was up to Jared. He would be forced to map out our every move, hoping that it was perfect enough to spare our lives.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this,\u201d Jared final y said, lifting my hand to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s going to work, and we\u2019l have the book, and then we can save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said with a smal smile. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries,\u201d he said, his cloudy eyes glossing over.</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries,\u201d I smiled back.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The Roof</p><p>Jared paced, brooded, and once in a while, when his thoughts were particularly tormented, he winced. The color had long left his face as he played back the different scenarios in his mind. Back and forth he paced, so many times that I watched the floor, wondering when he would wear a trail. His inner turmoil could have set the room on fire. It was unbearable to watch, but I couldn't leave him; not when he was planning my death.</p><p>Claire sat next to me, holding my hand, suffering Jared's torture as I did. Jared had the most to lose, so the plan was his alone. Each decision, from the moment we left the house until the book was safe within its wal s, fel on Jared's shoulders. Watching that responsibility slowly tear him apart was agonizing.</p><p>I did not envy his position. Just he thought of doing the same made me feel sick to my stomach.</p><p>Jared stopped mid-step. \u201cRyan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man?\u201d Ryan said, standing. He had never been a fan of Jared, but we al shared a common thread. Whether we liked it or not, if one of us was hurt, we would al fal . A loss would affect al of us differently, but it would change our lives in the same horrific way.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Jared said, leaving the room.</p><p>Ryan glanced at Claire, and then fol owed Jared into the hal way. Claire's grip on my hand tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou can hear them,\u201d I said.</p><p>She looked down at our hands, and then closed her eyes. \u201cDon't ask me to tel you, Nina. Let Jared do this his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I nodded, trusting her judgment.</p><p>Ryan returned with a solemn expression. Uncomfortable at best, afraid was a more honest description. He took a few steps toward Claire and I, and then held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cFeel like going to the pub?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>My eyes veered to Claire, and my head turned slightly unintentional y. \u201cUm...I guess,\u201d I said, looking back to Ryan.</p><p>\u201cGood. Give her something shiny, Claire,\u201d he said, pul ing me to stand.</p><p>Claire reached behind her and held out her pistol. \u201cTake it,\u201d she shrugged, trying too hard to seem indifferent. \u201cI have seven more at home.\u201d</p><p>My first instinct was to ask a dozen questions, but something told me time was an issue. Jared wanted this to be over.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cOn the bright side, if I die, I don't have to worry that I didn't study for the test I have in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're not going to die,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis is just a test run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA test run,\u201d I said, looking at the gun in my hand. \u201cOkay. Let's see what they've got.\u201d</p><p>I fol owed Ryan into the hal , passing Jared along the way. He didn't meet my eyes, so I grabbed the sleeve of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou don't exactly exude confidence. Can you just pretend?\u201d</p><p>He forced a smile. \u201cI'l see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Ryan said dryly, pul ing me behind him.</p><p>In Ryan's truck, we took the short trip to the pub. Every bump, every pot hole, every street light seemed especial y big or bright, as if my mind wanted to record every second of my last moments on earth.</p><p>The truck slowed to a stop in the parking lot across the street, and I looked out the window to the pub. Col ege co-eds meandered on the sidewalk, congregating in smal groups, laughing and chatting without a care in the world. I had seen a few of them in the hal s of Brown, and I wondered what they would say when they heard the news, and what the news would even be. Would the papers call it an accident? A murder? A suicide? I shuttered when thoughts of myself post-mortem. Would demons al ow me any dignity or mercy at al ?</p><p>\u201cRyan? If it comes down to it, don't let them take me, okay? I don't know what things something so evil is capable of...but I don't want to....\u201d I struggled to say it aloud, \u201cDon't let me suffer, okay? Take care of it. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, his nose wrinkling. \u201cYou mean you want me to issue a mercy shot before they drag you off to torture you.\u201d</p><p>I didn't remember Ryan being so blunt before. Perhaps the desert had taken every bit of sensitivity he had left.</p><p>\u201cI don't want to be alone with those things. Even for a minute. If they take me, I'm giving you permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI won't let anything happen to you, and I know Jared, Claire and Bex are al watching. You act like you've never been bait before.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cCan't say that I have. Let's get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stepped out, and then walked around, opening the door. We walked into the pub hand-in-hand, and Ryan scanned the dozen or so faces, picking a spot on the corner of the bar. He ordered a shot and two beers, and then rested his elbows on the dark wood in front of him. The music was blaring, and the loud, variable tones of conversation blurred into one another.</p><p>\u201cSo what's the plan?\u201d I asked over the music.</p><p>The bartender set our drinks on the bar, and Ryan tossed him a twenty. \u201cI don't know. I'm just fol owing orders. So far it's to drink, but not too much where I can't aim straight., or it affects Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiming's not going to help,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cWhy do you get a shot and I don't?\u201d I asked, watching him throw his back.</p><p>\u201cJared said you get one beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d I picked at the label on the bottle. \u201cI guess he drinks when I do.\u201d</p><p>We didn't bother to toast to anything. I tried my best to forget that I was terrified, and sipped on the bitter, dark liquid until it was gone. Ryan ordered another round, but when the bartender placed a ful bottle in front of me, Ryan grabbed it with his other hand, drinking from them both. So much time had passed since I'd had any alcohol at al , just the one round helped to drown out the laughter in the background that became increasingly annoying as time dragged on.</p><p>When Ryan final y stood, I couldn't help but breath a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cThat's it? We're done?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cNo, we're just starting. Zip up your coat, we're going for a walk. Once we hit that door, I need Oscar-worthy drunk, giggly col ege kid on the sidewalk, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I've never felt so giggly in my life, so this should be a breeze,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>Ryan pushed open the door, and I hooked my arm in his. We walked a block, and then made a turn. After two blocks, we turned in a different direction.</p><p>\u201cThis is obvious,\u201d I said, noting the dark street.</p><p>\u201cSshh, we're being fol owed,\u201d Ryan whispered.</p><p>\u201cGoody,\u201d I said, trying to keep my steps in line with his.</p><p>Before we reached the corner, two men stepped onto the sidewalk from the al ey. Ryan stopped, pushing me behind him.</p><p>\u201cHi there, boys,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>One of the men smiled. \u201cThat's a pretty little girl you got there.\u201d</p><p>Ryan was clearly irritated. \u201cThanks. Tel your boss I'm insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why's that?\u201d the other man said, amused.</p><p>Ryan smiled. \u201cYou're smal er than I expected,\u201d he said, looking up at the ominous man looming over him.</p><p>Without warning, Ryan headbutted the first goon. The man stared into Ryan's eyes, stunned. Blood suddenly streamed from his nose, and then he stumbled back, final y fal ing to the ground.</p><p>The second man pul ed his weapon. His smal smirk quickly faded when Ryan and I traded glances, and then pul ed ours. Every nerve in my body was on edge. Instead of fear, I was fighting back a smile. Pointing a gun, and being on the offensive was so empowering that I had to work to keep from giggling with excitement.</p><p>\u201cHe set us up!\u201d the man said, kicking at his partner, shaking as his kept his gun pointed in our direction.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Lenny! We got set up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your gun on the ground!\u201d Ryan growled. His voice sounded different than what I was used to. No doubt residuary from his tour in Afghanistan.</p><p>The man did as Ryan commanded, and then scampered off, pul ing his friend with him. I clicked the safety on the pistol in my hand, habit from my lessons with Jared, and then stuffed it into the back of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Ryan put his hands low on his hips, spitting on the ground. \u201cNo. That was most definitely not the plan. They were supposed to take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel ...not take you, take you...try to take you, I guess. I real y don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me feel a lot better!\u201d I huffed.</p><p>Ryan froze when a clicking sound echoed in the al ey behind us. Donovan stood just feet away, pressing the barrel of his gun to Ryan's head.</p><p>\u201cSo they're trusting humans to watch their Taleh's now, are they? I don't care if you are some sort of hero, I ain't buyin' it,\u201d Donovan said, looking around.</p><p>I reached for my gun, but a warm hand encircled my wrist. \u201cShe's a brave little pistol, isn't she?\u201d</p><p>If it weren't for the voice, I would have expected to turn and see Jared standing behind me. The same warm skin, the smell , the blonde hair\u2014but his eyes were a lighter blue than Claire's\u2014almost white. He was so tal I had to take a step back just to get a good look at him.</p><p>\u201cIsaac?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He smiled, and then smirked at Donovan. \u201cI'm famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dead if we don't get the hel outta here. They wouldn't leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Isaac said calmly. \u201cBut we'l play.\u201d</p><p>Isaac and Donovan led us down the al ey to a waiting car. Isaac wasn't nearly as gentle as the other celestial beings I'd met. It shouldn't have surprised me; a Hybrid that protected a man who worked for demons had to have been so far detached from his origins and core beliefs. I didn't dare attempt to let my mind linger on what he was capable of.</p><p>After tying both of our hands behind our backs, Donovan hit Ryan on the head with the butt of his gun, and after a short crack, Ryan fel limp. Isaac slipped a black cover over his head, and then tossed him into the back seat of the car. Ryan's head fel against the door on the other side.</p><p>\u201cDon't!\u201d I said, recoiling.</p><p>Isaac smiled, and then shoved the same black covering over my head, tenderly helping me to a spot next to Ryan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don't tolerate violence against women,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>A part of me was relieved, but knowing they meant to kil me, I obsessed about the meaning behind Isaac's words for the entire trip to our destination.</p><p>Stil blinded by the fabric over my face, I was pul ed out of the car, and then escorted up a short flight of stairs. We paused for a moment, but quickly continued after the sound of a creaking door.</p><p>\u201cMore stairs,\u201d Isaac said, patiently waiting for me to find my footing. Our footsteps echoed against a hardwood floor, and then I was seated.</p> <p>The fabric was lifted from my face. Instinctively I gathered my surroundings. The room was large, and as my eyes scanned over the axes and swords that hung on the wal s, absolute horror struck me.</p><p>\u201cThis is Shax's building,\u201d I gasped.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cThe last place you'l ever see.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed, hard. Isaac's voice was so pleasant; almost maniacal. His soft tone, coupled with the absence of al humanity in his eyes, was beyond frightening.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p> <p>I rotated my neck to its limit to see Ryan sitting in a chair directly behind me, his back to mine. \u201cAre you okay, buddy?\u201d I said.</p><p>Blood saturated his hair line just above the temple. \u201cBesides my head throbbing so hard my eyebal feels like it's going to pop out? Peachy.\u201d</p><p>He squinted, obviously in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou didn't have to do that,\u201d I growled at Donovan.</p><p>\u201cThat's the beauty of it,\u201d Donovan smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhere's Shax?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, there, Cupcake. Don't be in such a hurry to die,\u201d Donovan said, scribbling something on a notepad sitting on the desk. \u201cHe'l be here soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Isaac stood before me, and then crouched just a few inches from my face. \u201cI knew Jared as a child. Did he tel you that? I remember the way he spoke of you. Now that I see you,\u201d he said, gently touching my cheek, \u201cI can't fathom what he sees in you that is so special. You are such a plain little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I yelped, looking down.</p><p>Isaac dug his thumbnail into my wrist, and blood oozed from the half-moon-shaped gouge.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Ryan said, jerking in his seat.</p><p>Isaac licked the crimson liquid from my arm. \u201cI thought maybe it was something I couldn't see. Merovingian, and nothing to set you apart from the rest of them. Very disappointing.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my chin and glared up at him. \u201cLike you must be to your father. With al of your amazing talents and abilities, and you're a sel out\u2014a sycophant for the other side.\u201d</p><p>Isaac reared his hand and let it fly, back-handing me so hard I fel over onto my side, crashing to the floor in the chair I was tied to.</p> <p>\u201cYou son-of-a-bitch!\u201d Ryan screamed, wildly struggling to get free.</p><p>\u201cSo much for not tolerating violence,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cThat was just a warning,\u201d Isaac said, setting me upright. \u201cI have less tolerance for disrespect.\u201d He slowly leaned in, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cLet's go,\u201d Donovan snapped. \u201cThey'l be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Isaac nodded, and then they were gone.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ryan said, scooting his chair until I was in his line of sight.</p><p>\u201cI'm not going to lie. That hurt.\u201d</p><p>Ryan leaned in, inspecting the bump quickly rising above my eyebrow. \u201cJared's going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure he already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be here by now. Something's wrong. Jared said if they weren't here within a few minutes, that I should get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>I looked around. \u201cWe can't leave. There's a safe behind that desk, in the wal . The book is in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Ryan's wrists and feet were tied to his chair like mine, and he pul ed and twisted his arms, ineffectively attempting to escape.</p><p>\u201cJack told me. We have to get into that safe.\u201d</p><p>Ryan raised an eyebrow. \u201cDid Jack tel you how to do that if you're tied to a chair? Because I got nothing.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cDidn't the Special Forces teach you anything?\u201d</p><p>Ryan smiled. \u201cYeah: Keep a knife with you at al times.\u201d He wiggled his right leg. \u201cIn my boot.\u201d</p><p>The chairs complained against the wood as we positioned ourselves so that I could reach the knife. After several minutes of grunting and groaning, I final y felt the handle.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d I grunted again, straining against the tight restraints, \u201cI think I've got it!\u201d I said, grasping the hard plastic between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon't drop...it,\u201d Ryan said too late, watching the knife fal from my fingers to the ground.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I huffed, blowing my bangs from my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ryan said, taking a deep breath. He jerked to the side until his chair tipped over, and then maneuvered his body until his hand was within inches of the knife. \u201cNothing's ever easy when I'm around you, Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I said, unamused.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel is going on in here?\u201d Claire said. She stood in front of the half-open window sil , arms crossed, her hot pink duffel bag over her shoulder.</p><p>A wide grin erupted across Ryan's face. \u201cBetter late than never, Gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cWow, I'm getting it from every angle,\u201d Ryan said, letting his entire body relax and fal against the floor in protest.</p><p>\u201cWhere's Jared?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBehind me. We don't have much time,\u201d Claire explained, tearing the cloth around my wrists and feet with a flick of her finger.</p><p>\u201cI'm on the floor, bleeding, and you save her first? I'm hurt,\u201d Ryan said to Claire.</p><p>Claire freed him, and then lifted Ryan to his feet. She pushed back his head to inspect his wound, overly rough. \u201cYou'l live.\u201d</p><p>Ryan winced. \u201cThanks, Honey, I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to the window, searching through the dark for Jared. \u201cI thought you said he was behind you.\u201d</p><p>Claire chomped on the large wad of gum in her mouth. \u201cHe had to calm down. When he sees that knot on your head and that hand print on your cheek, he's going to freak out al over again. Back up.\u201d</p><p>I took a step back, and Bex appeared in the window, barely making an effort as he pul ed himself through. \u201cYou smell like beer,\u201d he grimaced.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you, too,\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhere's the safe?\u201d Bex asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jared?\u201d I said with an impatient tone.</p><p>\u201cRight here, Baby,\u201d Jared said, crawling into the window behind Bex. \u201cI'm right here.\u201d I didn't wait for him to crawl al the way into the room before I grabbed him. After a few awkward maneuvers to stand while encapsulated in my arms, he kissed my forehead, and then inspected the remnants of my brush with Isaac. His jaws fluttered under his skin. \u201cI'm going to enjoy kil ing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe safe!\u201d Bex said, intent.</p><p>\u201cBehind the desk,\u201d I said, pul ing Jared with me. \u201cIt's there,\u201d I pointed.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Claire said, bending down to touch the wal . \u201cIt's just wal .\u201d</p><p>Bex twitched, and then closed his eyes. \u201cThey're coming.\u201d</p><p>Claire ran her hands over the drab paint. \u201cI don't feel anything.\u201d She knocked. \u201cIt doesn't sound like anything's back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Maybe we're in the wrong room?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>I looked around, seeing the same paintings on the wal . \u201cNo, I'm sure. I've seen this a mil ion times; the safe is right there.\u201d</p><p>Bex looked to Jared. \u201cWe have two minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cClaire? Move.\u201d</p><p>Claire obeyed, and Jared rammed the wal with his fist, pul ing back broken sheet rock. Claire helped him, and within seconds, the entire panel was open, revealing the safe, three feet inside the wal .</p><p>Thousands of dust motes flurried in the air.</p><p>\u201cThat explains why you always saw them waist-deep in the wal ,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire held up her hand. \u201cQuiet.\u201d She leaned her ear close to the safe, and then moved the dial back and forth, nodding intermittently. Within moments, the safe clicked open. Claire seemed stunned. \u201cThat was too easy. It's rigged with explosives or something.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI don't smell anything, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShax is notoriously pretentious, Claire,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI'm not surprised.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cThis whole thing is too easy. They take our bait, sit Ryan and Nina in the room with the safe, knowing we would come after them...and then leave?\u201d</p><p>Bex pul ed out the book. \u201cGot it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it's the real thing,\u201d I said.</p><p>Bex flipped through the pages. \u201cIt's real, al right.\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed my hand. \u201cThey left because Shax is bringing his legions to end us, Claire. They wanted us to come here and give them a reason to take us al out. Heaven can't step in if we provoke them.\u201d</p><p>Bex took a few steps toward the door, his head jerking in every direction. \u201cLegions is right. I think the whole of Hel is coming. We should get them out. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe roof!\u201d I said. \u201cThey always used the roof!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to repeat what Jack and Gabe did, Nina. That leads to the same end,\u201d Claire said, looking out the window, planning an escape.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Jared said, looking up. \u201cMaybe she had the dreams to show us how to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Claire said, grabbing the book from Bex.</p><p>Screeching from below echoed throughout the hal s, turning my blood cold.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes darted in every direction. \u201cIs that...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Claire said, shoving the book into her hot pink duffel bag. \u201cBex?\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded, running across the room and diving out the window.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s expression was a mixture of disgust and alarm. \u201cIt sounds like a dying animal...a thousand dying animals.\u201d</p><p>Claire pul ed her sidearm from its holster. \u201cYou should hear one when you send it back to Hel .\u201d She gestured to me, \u201cShow us the way, Nina.\u201d</p><p>The howls and screams of Shax\u2019s minions grew louder. Jared turned to me, cupping his hands on each side of my face.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, isn't it?\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared looked deep into my eyes, as if he wanted to pass the truth through them instead of just saying the words. But he said them, anyway. \u201cI won't let them touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm afraid,\u201d I said, shaking. The fear was so intense I felt powerless to control my own body. As the screeching grew closer, it became a physical effort to avoid slipping into a flew blown panic. I looked to Ryan, then. \u201cRemember what we talked about.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded once. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Jared\u2019s hand and we fled, climbing the staircase, and then sprinting down the hal .</p><p>\u201cThis way!\u201d I yel ed. I stopped in front of a closed door at the end of the hal way. It was pointless to whisper, with the deafening shrieking of the demonic fil ing the air. I pul ed on the knob, but it was locked. Jared moved me aside, and then landed a lethal blow with his foot. The door swung open, and hit the concrete wal , wooden pieces splintering and then fal ing to the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, pul ing me up the crumbling staircase.</p><p>On the roof, the wind mercilessly whipped al around us, and the night sky crowded even the brightest lights below.</p><p>Jared ran to the edge. \u201cWhich building?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin in the right direction. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned at Claire, unsure. \u201cYou\u2019re going to jump the length of a footbal field?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes. And you're coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll take the fire escape.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his coat, and then pushed him into Claire\u2019s arms. \u201cThousands of those things are going to swarm this roof in about seven seconds. You won\u2019t make it to the landing.\u201d</p><p>Jared wrapped his arms around my waist, and then took three long strides, grunting when he leaped from the edge. My fingers locked around his neck. I didn\u2019t dare look down, afraid the second I realized we were doing something impossible, his powers would fade, and we would fal five stories to the ground.</p><p>He made the same grunting noise to land as he did when we departed, but the landing was not as rough as I had anticipated.</p><p>I could hear Ryan\u2019s yel s somewhere between our building and Shax's. His voice grew louder as they approached, and when Claire's feet hit the ground just ten feet away, she let him go.</p><p>He fel to the ground, rol ing onto his back. \u201cLet\u2019s never... ever do that again,\u201d Ryan puffed.</p><p>Claire grabbed his hand and yanked him to his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t be a baby,\u201d she grinned, pul ing him to the roof access.</p><p>After two flights of stairs my lungs begged for air, but the adrenaline surging through my body made my legs feel they could go on forever.</p><p>Jared stopped, looked above us, and not a second later, a loud crash sounded on the roof, fol owed by the sounds only demons on the hunt could make.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d Jared said, looking to me, and then to Claire. \u201cTake Nina and Ryan out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said, gripping his arm.</p><p>\u201cThere are too many, Jared!\u201d Claire said. \u201cHalf of them wil slip past you.\u201d</p><p>They both looked to Ryan, and then Jared grabbed Ryan\u2019s coat with both fists. \u201cGet Nina out of here. Get her to the al ey.\u201d Ryan looked at Claire, and Jared jerked him again, demanding his ful attention. \u201cGet Nina out! We\u2019l hold them off.\u201d</p><p>Jared pushed Ryan back, pul ing two Glocks from their holsters. Claire threw the duffel bag to me. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t get himself kil ed, al right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, tugging on Ryan\u2019s coat.</p><p>We descended the stairs, leaving the Ryels behind. Ryan didn\u2019t take his eyes off Claire until she was out of sight, and then he focused, taking two steps at a time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The screeching grew louder, more excited, and then the gunfire began.</p><p>Ryan stopped, held his pistol to his chest, and then slammed his back to the wal . \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here! We have to go, Ryan. We have...to...go!\u201d I pleaded, tugging on him with each word.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her,\u201d he said, looking up.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way you can help her now is to stay alive!\u201d I said, emphasizing each word.</p><p>He closed his eyes tight, and then grabbed my arm, pul ing me down the last two flights of stairs.</p><p>\u201cThis is the door to the al ey!\u201d I said, pointing.</p><p>Ryan tugged on the handle a few times. When it wouldn't open, he aimed his gun, shooting a few rounds into the handle. I looked away, protecting my eyes from splinters flying in every direction.</p><p>Ryan rammed his shoulder into the door, forcing it open. I ran out into the al ey, struggling for breath. The darkness outside was so quiet, like we had entered a new world. The normal sounds of Providence were al around us: car horns in the distance, motorcycle engines revving as they pul ed away from a stop light, the last bit of rain water fal ing into the gutters\u2014it was like I was caught in one of my dreams.</p> <p>\u201cWake up,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes. I focused on my bed, and Jared's warm body next to mine. I opened my eyes, but the same scene was before me. I shut my eyes tighter this time. \u201cWake up!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Ryan gripped my shoulders, startling me. \u201cIt's not a dream this time, buddy. We need to move!\u201d</p><p>Something dark and swift caught the corner of my eye. Not smoke, and not a shadow, but thicker than the night air.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel is that?\u201d Ryan yel ed, shooting once. The bul et ricocheted off the brick of the building.</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d I screamed as the cloud rose above both of us, positioned to attack.</p><p>Ryan shoved me out of the way, and I landed hard on my knees and hands. His body flew backward, hitting the building on the other side of the al ey, and he then fel the fifteen feet to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cRun, Nina!\u201d Ryan said, stunned.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, but before running off alone, I hesitated. Ryan was human, and I promised Claire to keep him safe. The blackness focused on me, and Ryan shot another round to return its attention to him.</p><p>\u201cRUN!\u201d he yel ed, shooting again. The invisible enemy dragged him back into the building by one foot, and he held his gun in front of him, shooting at what he couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>Everything inside me wanted to stay, to try to help somehow, but I held the duffel bag close and dashed down the al ey, into the street. Tears fil ed my eyes, blurring my vision, final y spil ing over my cold cheeks.</p><p>Another al ey was ahead, dark and forbidding, but it seemed the right way to go, so I kept running.</p><p>When my lungs couldn\u2019t take in enough air, I stopped, hunched over and puffing. Whatever it was that had Ryan couldn't be far behind, so I leaned against the back entrance of a building, working up enough courage to move. A bus stop was just a half block away.</p><p>\u201cTake a step, Nina,\u201d I said to myself, wil ing courage to move my feet. \u201cIt's right there,\u201d I breathed, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>The door opened, causing me to lose my balance and fal back. Something grabbed me from behind, wrenching me inside with so much force that my hands, legs, and head al fel behind, jutting straight out in front me.</p> <p>\u201cSsshhh!\u201d Bex said, covering my screams with his hand.</p><p>More tears streamed down my face, and I threw my arms around his neck, sobbing with uncontrol ed relief.</p><p>He held me at bay, searching my eyes. \u201cWhere is everyone else?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know,\u201d I choked out.</p><p>\u201cThe book?\u201d</p><p>I held up the duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, hugging me to him. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>He led me to his Ducati that was parked around the corner, and we sped off, fishtailing down the street. As Bex took roads that would lead us to Woonsocket, I fantasized that Jared, Claire, and Ryan would be at St. Anne\u2019s waiting for us.</p><p>I replayed what happened over in mind, wondering if I could have done something different, or if I should have tried to help Ryan. Risking his life\u2014 and ultimately Claire\u2019s life\u2014 to steal a book that would save me was the epitome of selfishness...until I remembered that it would spare Jared as wel . Even knowing that, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d made the right choice. Even if I was part of some kind of prophecy, our lives weren\u2019t anymore valuable than Ryan\u2019s or Claire\u2019s.</p><p>Father Francis held open the door, waving for us to come inside.</p><p>\u201cAre they here?\u201d I asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>The priest closed the door, and then shook his head, sad. \u201cNot yet. You have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s here,\u201d I said, opening the duffel bag. I handed the leather-bound book to Father Francis, and he held it gingerly, as if he were holding a bomb.</p><p>He retreated to the front of the cathedral, sitting on the first pew. \u201cThe Naissance de Demoniac of Shax the Duke,\u201d he whispered. He completed the sign of the cross, and then prayed over the book.</p><p>Bex closed his eyes, and then smiled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The Mistake</p><p>It was my turn to pace.</p><p>Father Francis and Bex poured over the pages, searching for something to present to Jared upon his arrival. But it had been almost an hour, and we were stil the only ones that had made it to the church.</p><p>Every parishioner that entered the large, wooden door was politely turned away by Father Francis. It was harder for me to be polite, because each time the door opened, my heart stopped.</p><p>After my hopes had been dashed for the sixth time, anger took over. An older woman pushed her way through the door, only to be startled by the sight of me charging down the aisle. \u201cCan't you see the sign? The church is closed!\u201d</p><p>The woman scrambled to reach the door handle to escape.</p><p>\u201cWe need a bigger sign,\u201d I said, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cPatience, child,\u201d Father Francis said, approaching me with a look of understanding. \u201cHe wil come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I said emphatical y. \u201cHe should be here by now. I feel like I'm going crazy.\u201d</p><p>Father Francis gently guided me back to my pew, patting my shoulder. \u201cFaith is what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to have faith. It's hard when everyone tel s you that your death is inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath is inevitable for us al ,\u201d the priest said.</p><p>Bex looked up, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it Shax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bex said, his eyes fluttering. \u201cThey've been crowding us since we got here, but they're....,\u201d he opened his eyes, \u201cal gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d I said, incredulous. The theme of the night had been that Shax had let us get away with his precious book far too easily. Their retreat only set me on edge, wondering when he would decide to put up a real fight.</p><p>Suddenly the door opened, cracking against the wal . Bex stood up, pul ing me with him, using his body as a shield.</p><p>\u201cYou got a bathroom, Father?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>Father Francis scurried down the aisle, shutting the door behind Kim. \u201cOf course, child. Just through there,\u201d he gestured.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d Bex said, frowning at her as she walked past.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kim said, oblivious. \u201cJust because you're being chased by hundreds of demons, a girl can't pee?\u201d</p><p>Bex just shook his head, laughing once, absent of humor.</p><p>I col apsed into the pew, exhausted. \u201cSomething is wrong. They should be here by now.\u201d</p><p>Bex glanced at me, and then turned a page of the book, choosing to ignore my words.</p><p>\u201cI should have helped him. Ryan was dragged to his death, and I just ran away,\u201d I said, feeling the sting of salty tears wel up in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI'm trying to read,\u201d Bex grumbled.</p><p>A door slammed down the hal , and then Kim's loud footsteps announced her arrival before she came into view.</p><p>\u201cOh, geez. Are you crying?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd where is everyone? They go out for ice cream or what?\u201d</p><p>I dried my tear-stained cheeks with my sleeve. \u201cJared and Claire stayed behind to give me and Ryan time to get out. When we got to the al ey, something took Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d Kim said, eyebrow raised. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. I couldn't see it. It was kind of like a shadow...but it was more...,\u201d I trailed off, unable to find the appropriate word to describe it.</p><p>\u201cShadowy?\u201d Kim said, unimpressed.</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cNot everything's a joke, Kim. Ryan's dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo he's not,\u201d she replied, confident.</p><p>Her words peaked my attention. \u201cWhy do you say that? Have you heard something? Do you know where they are?\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded to the door. \u201cHe looks like crap, but he's right there.\u201d</p><p>I turned, gripping the top of the pew. Ryan, Claire, and Jared al stood near the entrance, dirty, blood-stained, and badly beaten. Before I registered that I was moving, my legs were carrying me down the aisle at ful speed, and I crashed into Jared's chest. He wrapped his arms around me tight, and sighed with relief.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Jared smiled, returning my repeated kisses as best he could. He kept his weight on one leg, and his pants were torn.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I said, crouching down to get a better look.</p><p>\u201cWe won,\u201d Claire said with a tired smile.</p><p>Ryan limped slowly down the aisle, his arm around Claire. Blood trickled from the outside of his eyebrow, and he was favoring his bad shoulder.</p><p>They settled into a pew behind Bex, and Father Francis scurried away, waving back at them.</p><p>\u201cI'l get the first aid kit!\u201d he call ed to them as he disappeared down a dark hal way.</p><p>Jared smiled down at me. \u201cWe did it.\u201d</p><p>I leaned up on the bal s of my feet to touch his lips to mine. Jared's words were empty. Winning that smal battle was only part of the war we had just started.</p><p>Jared led me down the aisle, sitting beside me in the pew behind Ryan and Claire.</p><p>Ryan leaned back, holding a folded piece of fabric against his eye. \u201cNext time we get into it with Hel , I get dibs on Mr. Puff.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled, licking her split lip. \u201cYour effort was impressive, even if that thing did hang you in the air by your ankle...and use you to open two doors...and make you scream like a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't scream like a girl,\u201d Ryan protested.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I was just hoping you would,\u201d she grinned.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, reaching out to touch her dirty face. His thumb gently grazed her cheek. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Claire's eyes met his for a moment, and then she pul ed away. \u201cJust get used to it. You don't need to thank me every time I save your stupid ass.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded, and then relaxed against the pew.</p><p>I watched Claire for a moment, as she desperately attempted to feign indifference. I could recal that expression wel ; Jared used it many times in the beginning. Unfortunately for Claire, Ryan was far more confident than I was stubborn, and he was certain she would come around.</p><p>My eyes settled on Jared's beautiful, dirty face. His eyes were tired, but bright blue, excited and amazed that we had the book and our lives.</p><p>Seeing his expression only made it more real that he didn't expect any of us to make it to the church alive. A fact that, to me, was more unsettling than relief.</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d Jared asked Bex.</p><p>Bex handed Jared the book. \u201cNot yet. It keeps talking about the birth, the birth, over and over. How it disturbs the balance and how Hel wil stop it and prevail.\u201d</p><p>Jared flipped through the pages, increasingly frustrated with each one. \u201cEvery prophecy has a loop hole. That is why the Nephilim were created, to try and stop the bloodline from King David to Jesus.\u201d He slammed the book shut. \u201cWhat did Father Francis say?\u201d</p><p>Bex's eyes shifted toward me for just a moment, and then he shook his head, looking down. \u201cHe doesn't see anything, either. But we've only looked at it once. We could have missed something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my vote,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cWhich is...?\u201d Ryan said. His eyes remained closed.</p><p>Kim stood and stretched. \u201cJared, I know you want to find something, but we had a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>I touched his arm. \u201cWhat is Kim talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn't look up from the pages. \u201cThe promise I made her. If she helped us get back the book, then we would go with her to Jerusalem...to return it to the Holy Sepulchre. To set her family free.\u201d</p><p>I couldn't argue, but Jared had just begun to look it over. Kim was being uncharacteristical y impatient.</p><p>\u201cWhat's the rush?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Kim waited for Jared to answer, but when he stayed focused on the book, she sighed. \u201cShax holds my family responsible. He'l retaliate.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed once. \u201cHe'l do that, anyway, when you return it and it's out of his reach. Your family's held him off this long. You can wait a few hours, Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't get it,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cJust let him read the damn book,\u201d Ryan groaned.</p><p>Questions formed in my mind, and I swal owed, always hesitant to get the answer. No matter what she might say, at that point I couldn't afford not to understand anything. The days of keeping me in the dark were over. \u201cWhat doesn't Claire get, Kim?\u201d</p><p>After a short pause, Kim took a breath. \u201cI'm not there,\u201d she said in a low tone. I've always been twenty minutes away; Shax knew that. He could have sent an entire legion to my father's house, and within minutes I would be there, and they would have to leave. We need to get on a plane, return the book, and then I need to get home before Shax realizes what we've done. Right now he just thinks you're looking for a loophole to the prophecy.</p><p>He has no idea he's about to lose the book forever.\u201d</p><p>Claire put her elbow on the back edge of the pew, and rested her head on her hand. \u201cYou don't think Jared finding a loophole to the prophecy is more concerning to Shax than losing the book?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kim said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cAnd why's that?\u201d Claire snapped back.</p><p>Quiet overcame the group, until Jared closed the book with a clap. \u201cBecause there is no loophole.\u201d</p><p>I smiled hopeful y. \u201cStop it, Jared. You haven't even read the whole thing, yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just did,\u201d he said, his eyes focused on the black seal that branded the cover. \u201cThey aren't going to stop until they prevent the birth of our child.\u201d</p><p>Kim sat beside me, lowering her chin. \u201cThis entire cat-and-mouse Jared's been engaged in has been a game to Shax. The fact that Ryan is stil alive should tel you...he's just toying with al of us.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIf that were true, why the dreams? Why did Jack and Gabe push us to get the book?\u201d</p><p>Jared stood. \u201cBecause they knew that is exactly what I would do, and the dreams were their way of helping us complete a fool's errand alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, standing next to him. \u201cI don't believe that. If that were true, they would tel me to stay away from the book, not how to get it. Gabe wouldn't have helped my father if it was pointless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you're right,\u201d Jared said. \u201cMaybe we need a little more time with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d Bex said.</p><p>Kim held up her hand in frustration. \u201cShax is a Duke of Hel , Jared. You pretty much walked into his house and slapped him, and he let you just walk out? Do you real y think that's how it works?\u201d</p><p>Ryan pul ed the fabric from his eye, revealing a deep, bloody gash. \u201cWe didn't just walk out, Kim, trust me. They put up a fight. I've never seen anything like that in my life, and I hope I never do again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Bex said again.</p><p>Jared frowned at Bex, and then returned his attention to Kim. \u201cNina is your friend. Are you tel ing me you're not wil ing to wait for us to figure this out before we take it somewhere that we can never get it back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is my friend, but this is my family we're talking about. We've been dealing with this for lifetimes. It's time to end it. It's time the Pol ocks are free of it.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked down at the book in his hands, and then back to Kim, his expression stern. \u201cI understand your plight, but you're not getting this back until I'm satisfied there's nothing in it that can help Nina,\u201d Jared said, shoving it under his arm.</p><p>Kim took a step forward. \u201cWe had a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven't forgotten that,\u201d Jared answered.</p><p>Father Francis came in with the first aid kit, taking quick steps. \u201cI'm afraid it wasn't where I thought it would be....\u201d he said, trailing off.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Bex yel ed. \u201cThey're coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Kim whispered, her eyes slowly rising to the ceiling.</p><p>A deafening boom surrounded St. Anne's. Every window burst inward, covering the ground with shards of colored glass. Jared took me to the floor, covering me with his body.</p> <p>Even after the explosion, it sounded as if a tornado was hovering above the church.</p><p>\u201cNot in the House of the Lord!\u201d Father Francis yel ed over the noise, his arms extended to the sky.</p><p>The priest was lifted high in the air by an invisible assailant, his legs kicking until he was blown back, smashing into the beautiful mural high above the stage. Pieces of the painting came down with him when he fel to the floor.</p><p>Bex rol ed into the aisle, and then took off toward the priest, so fast his body was a blur. He took Father Francis, limp and lifeless, into his arms.</p><p>The wind rushing through the broken windows blew Bex's platinum hair wildly as he felt for a pulse on the priest's neck.</p><p>\u201cHe's alive!\u201d Bex call ed.</p><p>Another explosion shook the building, and pieces of the ceiling fel in large chunks onto the pews, sending sheet rock and plaster into the air.</p><p>\u201cWe have to move!\u201d Jared yel ed, pul ing me to my feet.</p><p>The large wooden door blew open, forcing another strong pulse of wind across the room. Had Jared not kept his arms around me, I would have fal en over.</p><p>I held my hand to my face to shield it from the blast. When I lowered it, Shax was standing in the doorway.</p><p>He wore an al -black suit, shirt and tie, matching his cold, obsidian eyes. A smal smirk was on his face. He was final y ready to fight.</p><p>Jared stood his ground, positioned in front of me. Claire stood on the other side, guarding her Taleh.</p><p>Shax looked to each side of the church in dramatic fashion. \u201cWhere is your Samuel now, Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe's around,\u201d Jared said, his body rigid.</p><p>\u201cI'm afraid you've made yet another mistake, and Heaven won't intervene this time.\u201d</p><p>Two shadows that had been lurking behind Shax came into view under the dim light of the church. Isaac and Donovan stood on each side of their demonic master, their expressions anxious and ready. They had come to murder us al .</p><p>Jared shifted. \u201cIsaac, listen to me. You don't have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>\u201cI don't want you to die,\u201d Jared continued, \u201cbut if he comes near her, I'l kil him.\u201d</p><p>Isaac smiled. \u201cNot if I kil her, first. And I wil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're outnumbered,\u201d Claire said, her smal yet frightening voice somehow carrying across the room.</p><p>Shax grinned, and the long, clawed hands and feet of the night filtered into the room, covering the wal s and ceiling. I looked above me, seeing grotesquely malformed bodies of demonic minions scale the crumbling rafters.</p><p>The smell of burnt flesh and sulfur was overwhelming, and I could feel bile rise in my throat. Shax's servants weren't screeching this time, but making strange, excited cooing and whistling noises, waiting for the order to attack.</p><p>\u201cGive me the book,\u201d Shax hissed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jared said, tossing the leather bound pages to Kim.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to come and get it, though,\u201d Kim smiled.</p><p>Shax slowly turned his head to Isaac, and then Isaac's smirk turned into a satisfied grin. He pushed the far pew with both hands, slamming it into the pew before it, creating a domino effect. As the heavy benches toppled over and blew forward with the speed of a freight train, Jared and Claire reacted, jumping to the other side with Ryan and I in tow.</p><p>Kim simply side-stepped to the center aisle, remaining calm as thousands of pounds of wood narrowly missed her body.</p><p>\u201cYou're going to have to do better than that,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Isaac leaped the hundred yards to Kim's position, and then wrapped on hand around her throat, lifting her off the ground. \u201cI'm not a demon. You can't control me.\u201d</p><p>With a grunt, Isaac threw Kim back, but Bex moved quick, catching her before she col ided with the podium. The demons concentrated in the area closest to Kim scattered, afraid of being too close.</p><p>Bex looked Kim in the eyes, and after she acknowledged that she was okay, he scrambled to his feet, taking off ful speed, slamming into Isaac.</p><p>When they col ided, a loud crack echoed throughout the cathedral.</p><p>My human eyes couldn't make out who was hitting who, until Bex hit Isaac so hard that his body sailed across the air, and he landed in the exact spot he started, next to Shax.</p><p>\u201cIt's like people tennis,\u201d Ryan said, in awe. \u201cEveryone keeps flying across the room.\u201d</p><p>Isaac wasn't about to quit. He engaged Bex again, but this time Isaac got the upper hand. Bex was on the ground, and after the second time Isaac landed a blow that would have been fatal to a human, Jared's arm tensed.</p><p>\u201cDo something!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI can't leave you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I take my attention off of you for a second, they'l attack.\u201d</p><p>Donovan walked down the center aisle with purpose, dodging the fal ing chunks of ceiling. Claire pul ed out her firearm, aiming right at his face.</p><p>Isaac's attention was distracted, then, and Bex head-butted Isaac, and then threw him against Donovan. They both slid across the floor.</p><p>Isaac stood, pul ed out his gun, and aimed directly at Ryan.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Claire said, throwing herself in front of him.</p><p>Ryan and Claire were face to face when Isaac's gun discharged. Claire's body jerked twice as it was hit, and Ryan's horrified expression matched hers.</p><p>Stunned, Claire looked down, and then turned to Jared. \u201cThey went through me.\u201d</p><p>Claire and Ryan fel to their knees at the same time, and Jared rushed to his sisters side. He pul ed me with him, and I fel to my knees just behind him.</p><p>Ryan's head fel back, and he coughed, blood spraying up and spattering across his cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no!\u201d Jared cried, pul ing off his shirt and wadding it up, pressing it against Ryan's wounds.</p><p>Isaac's maniacal laugh seemed to be al around us. \u201cI always wanted to see that smug smile wiped off your face, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Bex glanced at the bloody scene, and then focused on Isaac, his hands bal ed into fists at his sides. He lowered his chin, then, and his expression morphed into something one might see from a demon rather than an angel.</p><p>Claire looked up at her brother, expressionless. \u201cEnd this.\u201d</p><p>Horrified, I watched Claire tend to Ryan's wounds, but within moments, Jared pul ed me to my feet.</p><p>He took my hand in one of his, and then pul ed out his side arm with the other. He pointed it directly at Isaac, shooting one round after another, walking toward him as he fired, forcing me to fol ow.</p><p>Isaac jerked with each hit, stumbling backward. \u201cYou son-of-a-bitch!\u201d Jared screamed, his eyebrows and lips pul ed in so tight, the skin around them was white.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Bex cried, but it was too late.</p><p>Donovan had his gun to Jared's temple. \u201cI suppose it'l take you a while to heal from this one,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>An abrupt blast resounded in the room, and Donovan fel to his knees, final y fal ing over, succumbing to the bul et hole I had just shot into his brain.</p><p>\u201cShawn!\u201d Isaac said, struggling to reach his Taleh.</p><p>It was too late for both of them. Shawn Donovan's life had already spil ed onto the floor.</p><p>Isaac fel back, already feeling a weakness in his body.</p><p>Jared's eyes were wide as he processed what had just happened. \u201cYou kil ed him,\u201d he said softly, looking to me.</p><p>\u201cHe was pointing a gun at your head,\u201d I explained.</p><p>Jared laughed once, momentarily forgetting that we were stil surrounded by the enemy.</p><p>A quick wind passed by, and Bex and Shax were suddenly in a bal . The sounds coming from their scuffle were horrific. Distracted, Shax lost his control on the demons clustered on the wal s and ceiling, and they began descending from their position, and swarming around us.</p><p>\u201cRun to Kim!\u201d Jared said, pushing me in her direction.</p><p>The hundred yards down the aisle to where she was protecting the book seemed a mile away, but I took off without hesitation.</p><p>Seeing that I was running to her, Kim scrambled to her feet, sprinting down the aisle to meet me. I turned, seeing Jared and Bex attacking Shax, and his minions were quickly crawling to the floor in endless numbers. Adrenaline kicked in, and my feet moved faster, desperate to reach Kim before the demons caught me.</p><p>\u201cRun, Nina!\u201d Kim screamed, the horror on her face tel ing me in moments I would be crushed and torn apart by the Hel so closely pursuing my flesh.</p><p>Their screeches were almost on top of me when Kim's long arms reached out, encompassing my body as she brought me to the ground. The wailing of the minions experiencing what Kim was capable of was deafening, but the individual howling resounding farther away was most definitely the sound of Shax losing his fight with Jared and Bex.</p><p>And then it was quiet.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Waiting</p><p>I peeked out from under Kim's arms, seeing Jared and Bex slowly making their way down the aisle. Kim helped me to stand, and Jared wasted no time pul ing me into his arms. His hands were trembling, and he was uncharacteristical y shaken.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jared asked, evaluating every inch of me for any signs of trauma.</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm fine,\u201d I said, shivering as the adrenaline soaked back into my system.</p><p>Bex carried Ryan in his arms, leaping and maneuvering around the ruins of St. Anne's to the entrance.</p><p>With the inordinate level of noise from just moments before, the night seemed eerily quiet. The crumbling concrete, wood and sheet rock grated against each other under my feet with every step. Those tiniest sounds echoed, even though the church seemed to be torn open and vulnerable, a contrast to the silence outside.</p><p>\u201cWe're going,\u201d Claire said, her voice distant and emotionless.</p><p>\u201cRight behind you,\u201d Jared said. He lead me quickly out of St. Anne's by the hand.</p><p>I turned to take one last look at the rubble, and saw Kim help Father Francis to his feet. She threw his arm over her shoulders, hobbling along herself beside him as they fol owed us to the Escalade.</p><p>Time passed in slow motion. Although everyone was desperate to get Ryan to the hospital, the distance to Jared's SUV seemed like miles, and getting everyone, bruised and bleeding, settled into their seats was a slow, frustrating process.</p><p>Claire rode with Ryan in the hatch, holding his head in her lap as he was nearly sprawled out. She seemed lost as she held pressure on his wounds, watching his face intently.</p><p>Bex sat in the back seat with Kim and the priest, but his focus was on Claire. He reached back, gripping his sister's shoulder. Bex's expression was heartbreaking, as the worries in his mind played out across his face.</p><p>\u201cThe closest hospital, Father,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cLandmark Medical Center. Two minutes away. Stay on this street, and then turn left on Cass Avenue.\u201d</p><p>Jared blew through the stoplight, and then weaved in and out of traffic, making a hard right turn into the hospital's ambulance bay.</p><p>\u201cWe need help here!\u201d Jared yel ed, jumping out of the driver's side.</p><p>I ran to the back, watching Jared open the hatch. Bex helped the priest into the Emergency Room, and Claire let Jared place Ryan on a gurney.</p><p>Jared was gentle, as if it were Claire he were holding. A smal cry escaped my throat, drawing Jared's attention away for just a moment. His eyes were dark, and suddenly I felt an overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014but more of an out-of-body experience. Watching Jared and Claire hover over Ryan's limp body was like seeing my last trip to the hospital from a different, more real perspective. It was cruel for both of them to have to suffer through it again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan was pale, but he had stopped coughing up blood. I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not.</p><p>He managed a weak smile for Claire. \u201cHow about a kiss...just in case?\u201d</p><p>Claire tenderly touched his forehead. \u201cI'l tel you what, Cowboy. You come out of this alive, and I'l kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Claire said, letting go of his hand.</p><p>In the emergency department's waiting room, Jared sat on the sofa next to me, Kim kept to herself, alone in a chair, and Claire stood with Bex in the corner. No one spoke, further discussion was unnecessary. We were waiting for someone to tel us if they had saved Ryan, or if Claire would die.</p><p>Claire kept her eyes closed, concentrating on everything she felt from Ryan. Her clothes were ripped and filthy, and her platinum pony tail had given up holding her hair in place hours ago. Once in a while she would twitch, and I wondered if she could sense when they used the scalpel, or if it was difficult while he was under anesthesia to sense anything at al . Jared would have answered my questions, but it was hardly the time.</p><p>The tension in the room was unbearable, but the waiting was worse.</p><p>I watched the faces of the people walking by. Some noticed our rag-tag group, some didn't. Glancing around the room, passers-by would no doubt wonder if we'd been in some sort of large accident. The news of the wreckage that was once St. Anne's would soon spread, and I worried that the hospital would be crawling with police officer's soon.</p> <p>The random thought occurred to me that those staring had no idea the pretty platinum blonde they couldn't help but notice could be dead in the next forty-eight hours. Claire was the strongest, most amazing woman I had ever met, and she looked so helpless in that moment\u2014so hopeless.</p><p>Final y, she broke the silence. \u201cThat's it,\u201d she snapped, stomping her way to the door.</p><p>Bex stopped her. \u201cWhoa...where do you think you're going?\u201d</p><p>Claire shoved at her brother, fighting to get free. \u201cI can help him. I have to do something; I can't just sit here!\u201d</p><p>Bex grabbed her face, cupping her cherubic cheeks in his hands. \u201cThey won't let you in there, and if force your way in, you'l just distract them from what they should be concentrating on.\u201d</p><p>Claire slammed the side of her fist into Bex's chest. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p> <p>Bex maneuvered his hands to get a better grip on Claire's arms, but she stopped struggling. Her eyes grew wide with fear.</p><p>\u201cHe's fading. They're losing him,\u201d she said, her voice sad and frightened.</p><p>Claire's body bent backwards, stiff and unnatural.</p><p>I stood, cupping my hands over my mouth. \u201cWhat's happening?\u201d I cried.</p><p>Jared stood with me, restraining me with his hands on my shoulders as Bex cradled his sister, and then helped her to the ground.</p><p>Claire relaxed, and then stiffened again.</p><p>\u201cHelp her! She's having a seizure!\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared turned my head, refusing to let me witness Claire's body writhing on the floor. \u201cNo, she's not. They're shocking him with a defibril ator.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, pul ing away from him.</p><p>Claire lay in Bex's arms, limp. \u201cHe's dying,\u201d she whispered, a single tear fal ing from the corner of her eye, down her temple, into her ear. Her eyes were nearly vacant, fixed on the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bex said. He closed his eyes. \u201cDon't take her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cPlease don't take her, too.\u201d</p><p>A sob escaped my throat, and I buried my face in Jared's chest. \u201cThey can't do this to us,\u201d I said. I pushed away from him, then, raising my fists to the ceiling in a rage. \u201cYou can't do this to us! We are the good guys, and this is what we get? How dare you! How! Dare! You!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cIt's not fair!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Jared enveloped me in his arms and kissed my hair. His fingers pressed into my skin, and I suddenly felt guilty, knowing Jared was suffering the agony of losing his baby sister, and then feeling my sorrow as wel .</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I said, holding him tightly. I took a breath, and focused on numbing al of my emotions.</p><p>\u201cDon't do that,\u201d Jared said, sensing my efforts. \u201cYou don't have to do that,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don't want you to hurt anymore than you already are,\u201d I said, tears spil ing down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Bex said in a strange tone.</p><p>I closed my eyes, terrified to peek out from Jared's arms to see Claire's lifeless body. There was stil so much I didn't know about Hybrids and the curse. Jared had prayed for Gabriel to take him quickly; maybe Samuel had taken mercy on her, and couldn't bear to see her suffer.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared said, nudging me. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Claire sat straight up, looking herself over, and then to the doorway. She didn't speak, she just waited. Final y, a nurse walked in, slightly confused by the spectacle on the floor.</p><p>\u201cEr...we just stabilized Ryan. We had to remove his spleen to stop the bleeding, but he's a fighter. I'l come back when we know more.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to the ceiling, stunned. \u201cUm...I'm sorry. Th-Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, a black figure appeared next to me. I jumped and recoiled, grabbing at Jared until I realized who it was.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d Jared breathed.</p><p>I frowned, and Samuel smiled in response. \u201cYou are unhappy with me, young Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven't been much help,\u201d I said, too angry to hold back.</p><p>He smiled, his white teeth a stark contrast to his rich, dark skin. \u201cIt appears to me that the situation is under control,\u201d he said, making his way to Claire. He leaned down, touching the top of her head with his massive hand. \u201cRyan wil be fine, I'm told.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled, another tear fal ing from her eye. \u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Bex and Claire embraced each other with raw relief. For the first time I heard Claire giggle. Her wet eyes were bright, and the sound of her laughter chimed in the air, reminding me of Lil ian. Bex laughed along with her, wiping the tears from his eyes as they celebrated together.</p><p>Jared squeezed me to his side, and Kim's mouth widened to a large grin. It was as if we could al breathe again.</p><p>\u201cHe's going to make it?\u201d I said. The question was redundant, but I had to hear it again.</p><p>Samuel nodded once. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, confident.</p><p>He returned to my side, and I wondered if any of the passers-by could see him. No one seemed to notice the half-dressed giant in the room.</p><p>\u201cWe stil need your help,\u201d I said. \u201cWe've read the book. We've al came close to death more than once trying to get our hands on it to find a loophole. Jared didn't find anything.\u201d</p><p>Samuel looked to Jared, who shook his head with a frustrated expression.</p><p>\u201cI think you already know the answer,\u201d Samuel said.</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cI was kind of hoping that would be a last resort.\u201d</p><p>Samuel touched Jared's shoulder. \u201cIt's a means to an end, isn't it?\u201d</p><p>With his last words, Samuel blinked from the space he had once occupied. Jared sat in the chair, pul ing me into his lap, lost in thought.</p><p>Bex helped Claire to her feet, and then walked her to the sofa. \u201cHe's right. It's what you should have done al along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>The nurse returned, this time with a smile. \u201cHe's in recovery, now. He's doing wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can I see him?\u201d Claire asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d the nurse said, offering a comforting smile before leaving the way she came.</p><p>Claire col apsed against the back of her seat. \u201cThat was close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo close,\u201d Bex said, hugging her against his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Samuel right about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Bex glanced at Jared, waiting for his brother to answer. When he didn't, Bex began, \u201cWe just started a war. The only way to win is to convince Heaven to fight with us.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBut we've tried. They won't help.\u201d</p><p>One side of Bex's mouth turned up. \u201cThey wil if you give them something to fight for. They won't let Hel destroy the baby once it's born. We just have to protect you until it gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat baby?\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared peeked at me from under his brow. \u201cThe baby you're carrying.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room stared at me, waiting for my reaction.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I said, touching my palm to my chest. \u201cBut I'm not pregnant. We haven't....\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw...ew...stop,\u201d Claire said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cJust once,\u201d Jared said, looking up at me sheepishly.</p><p>I remembered the night I begged Jared to help me forget about the chaos surrounding us; the night he said it wasn't a good time to tempt fate. I didn't realize at the time he had spoken literal y.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d I said, taken aback.</p><p>\u201cThe fol owing morning. I knew something was different...it took me a week or so to pin point exactly what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith child,\u201d Bex said. \u201cExpecting. Bun in the oven. Knocked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jared said, disapproving of Bex's last choice of words.</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d Claire said, her eyes bright.</p><p>Kim sighed. \u201cYou total y ruined my Spring Break. Just saying.\u201d</p><p>I took internal stock of my body, waiting to feel different, but it never happened. \u201cNo. I mean...I don't feel pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Kim raised her hands, letting them fal with a slap on her thighs. \u201cSeriously. How are we going to travel to Jerusalem with Preggo over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe'l go,\u201d Jared said, letting a smal smile pass over his lips.</p><p>The nurse knocked on the window, gesturing to the gurney she was wheeling down the hal . It was Ryan. She whispered into his ear, and he lifted his hand, giving us the thumbs-up.</p><p>Claire stood to fol ow, pausing at the door way. \u201cWe'l al go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we'l be waiting until Ryan is better before we're going on our trip,\u201d Jared said, pul ing my hand to his lips. \u201cWe could tend to a few things while he heals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat's that?\u201d I asked, feeling a bit overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cThere's a pretty little chapel on an island I'd like to take you to.\u201d</p><p>I couldn't help but smile. \u201cI guess we'd better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing Saturday?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHomework,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cMountains of homework.\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cSunday?\u201d</p><p>I mirrored his expression. \u201cI guess you're busy tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jared's brows shot up. \u201cYou want to go tonight?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He shook his head enthusiastical y. \u201cWe can go tonight if you want. We can go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm ready,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared grabbed each side of my face, pressing his warm, wonderful lips to mine. \u201cHow is is possible that I just went from almost losing everything I've ever loved, to getting everything I've ever wanted...al in the same night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in guardian angels?\u201d I asked, kissing him again.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cOne bathing suit, one white dress, and a few undergarments. That's what I've packed for my wedding getaway,\u201d I said, watching as Jared effortlessly clicked closed the buckle of my seat belt.</p><p>\u201cThat's al you need, Sweetheart,\u201d he smiled, checking the buckle one last time.</p><p>The stewardess went through her routine, and then the pilot came over the speaker, informing us of our place in line for takeoff and the current weather in Nicaragua.</p><p>\u201cShould be a pleasant flight, Mr. and the soon-to-be Mrs. Ryel,\u201d the pilot said.</p><p>Jared's grin stretched the width of his face. \u201cI might have paid him extra to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much,\u201d I teased. I looked out the window to the dreary Providence weather. In just a few hours, I would be lying on my favorite Caribbean beach with my husband. It didn't seem real.</p><p>The chartered jet taxied out to the runway, and within moments gained momentum, shuttering until the wheels left the ground. The lights of Providence became smal er, until they were just a cluster, separated from other cities by the dark countryside.</p><p>I relaxed against Jared, my eyes heavy.</p><p>Jared kissed my hair. \u201cDo you think you'l have good dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said without pause. \u201cMaybe I'l dream about our baby. Maybe I'l see what she'l look like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it's a girl,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it's a boy?\u201d Jared asked, playful y nudging me.</p><p>\u201cIt's not. It's a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlonde, of course,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cWith blue-grey eyes,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo. She'l have your eyes,\u201d Jared insisted.</p><p>Before long, I dozed off, sleeping deeper than I had in months. I didn't dream of our baby, or of Jack or Gabe, or anything at al . I closed my eyes and was lost in a peaceful darkness until Jared kissed me awake when we were about to land.</p><p>The pilot made his announcements on the intercom, and Jared checked my seat belt one last time.</p><p>\u201cIt's fastened,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure....\u201d he said, laughing once to himself.</p><p>We landed without event, and once we set foot on the pavement, I grinned. \u201cIt hasn't changed a bit, except for the number of people waiting on us this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only have two suitcases, and no tech cargo. It's been an easier trip for me this go-round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'd say so,\u201d I laughed.</p><p>Jared carried our suitcases to an old, rusted pick up truck, after a short drive, our island chauffeur slowed to a stop beside the pier. As we boarded the smal boat Jared had secured for us, it occurred to me how unlikely it would have been for anyone else to have made arrangements at such late notice, and so early in the morning. Jared, however, had enough connections to do whatever he set his mind to.</p><p>\u201cIt's awful y dark to be wandering around in the ocean, isn't it?\u201d I said, unsure as the boat captain steered in the general direction of the island.</p><p>The boat was quickly swal owed by the night, and the cool air off the water won over the thin fabric of my jacket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCold?\u201d Jared said, wrapping his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe's made this trip enough times, I'm sure he could do it blind-folded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it's this dark, he pretty much is,\u201d I said, a bit anxious.</p> <p>A half-hour later, the boat docked at the smal pier of Little Corn, and I sighed with relief. The waves had just begun to rock the boat a little more than I was comfortable with, and lightening had begun to spark across the horizon.</p><p>We met another smal truck with our luggage, and a smal , sleepy man by the name of Jose drove us to the same Casita we'd stayed in during our previous trip.</p><p>Speaking above the distant thunder, Jared spoke kindly to Jose in Spanish, and then pul ed our suitcases from the back of the truck, opening the door for me.</p><p>It had just begun to rain when he set our suitcases on the floor beside the bed, and the smell of the rain combined with the sound of raindrops tapping on the roof and bouncing off the palm fronds took me back to a not-so-distant past when everything seemed innocent and exciting.</p><p>Inside was the same simple accommodations, with only two differences: every surface was adorned with glowing candles, and a tal fan stood at the end of the bed. It stood stationary, ready to serve it's purpose while I slept next to Jared's feverish body in the Caribbean heat and humidity.</p> <p>I covered my mouth with my hand as I yawned. My long, undisturbed nap on the plane left me feeling groggy. \u201cIt's beautiful! Better than I remember,\u201d I said, trying to muster the appropriate excitement in my tone. Speaking through a yawn dampened that prospect, but thankful y Jared could feel what I couldn't adequately express.</p><p>He lifted me off my feet, and carried me to the bed, his body outlining mine. It felt as if we'd never left.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest, Miss Grey. We have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d I asked, sleepy. \u201cWhat kind of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe're changing your name tomorrow,\u201d he whispered in my ear. </p> </body></html>"]
