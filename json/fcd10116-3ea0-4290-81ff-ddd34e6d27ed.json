After tonight he\u2019d be mine for real. His hand reached down between us, guiding the round, rubbery head of his penis as it nudged my opening. It felt weird. He pushed at me and I guess he missed, because it hit me too high and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOuch! Shit, Zach, that hurts. I think you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d</p><p>He stopped immediately and grinned down at me, the gap between his front teeth teasing. Holy crap, I loved that grin. I\u2019d had the biggest crush on Zach since we were freshmen, but he never noticed me, not until a couple of months ago. My folks didn\u2019t let me out much, but in July I\u2019d managed to get permission to stay with Lyssa for a night and we\u2019d snuck out to a party. Zach had homed in, and we\u2019d been a couple ever since.</p> <p>I\u2019d gotten really good at sneaking out.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe,\u201d he murmured, leaning down to kiss me. I softened immediately, loving the feel of his lips ghosting across mine. He adjusted himself and started sliding into me again, slow and steady. This time he didn\u2019t miss, and I stiffened as he stretched me open wide.</p><p>Then he hit a barrier and paused.</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked up at him. He looked back down at me and I knew right then and there I\u2019d never love anyone half so much as I loved Zachary Barrett.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he whispered. I nodded.</p><p>He shoved into me and I squealed, pain ripping between my legs. Zach kept me pinned with his hips as I gasped, shocked. Then he pulled out and I tried to catch my breath. Before I could, though, he\u2019d thrust back into me. Hard. Ouch.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re tight,\u201d he muttered. He pushed himself up on his hands, throwing his head back as he pumped into my body, over and over, eyes closed and face straining with hunger.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d expected.</p><p>I mean, I wasn\u2019t stupid. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be perfect the first time, no matter what the romance books said. And it didn\u2019t hurt that much. But it sure as shit didn\u2019t feel good, either.</p><p>Zach moved faster, and I turned my head on the couch to look across the small apartment. His brother\u2019s, apparently. We had it for the night\u2014it was supposed to be our special, perfect time together. I\u2019d expected flowers or soft music and wine or something. Stupid. Zach had pizza and some beer from his brother\u2019s fridge.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d I muttered again as he paused, face twisting.</p><p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m gonna come,\u201d he gasped. I felt his penis throb deep inside, almost twitching. It was weird. Really weird. And nothing like I\u2019d seen in movies\u2014not even a little bit.</p><p>Was that it?</p><p>Huh ...</p> <p>\u201cOh, f**k that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>The apartment door opened as Zach collapsed between my legs, oblivious to the world. I couldn\u2019t do anything but watch in horror as a man walked in.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know him, but he couldn\u2019t have been Zach\u2019s brother. He didn\u2019t look anything like Zach, who was taller than me, but not by a whole lot. This guy was really tall, and muscular in the way men who work with their hands get from heavy lifting on the job.</p><p>He wore a black leather vest with patches over a ratty T-shirt and jeans that had streaks of dark motor oil or grease or something. A half rack of beer dangled from one hand. His hair was short and dark. Almost military. His lip was pierced and he wore two rings in his left ear and one in his right, like a pirate. Eyebrow was pierced, too. His features were bluntly handsome, but nobody would ever call him pretty. Big black boots covered his feet, and the chain from his wallet hung low across his hip. One of his arms had a full-sleeve tattoo. The other had a skull with crossed blades behind it.</p><p>He stopped in the doorway and looked us over, slowly shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI told you what I\u2019d do if you broke into my place again,\u201d he said quietly. Zach popped up and his face went white. His entire body\u2014with one notable exception\u2014stiffened. I felt that exception slither out of me, along with some fluid, and realized we hadn\u2019t even bothered to put a towel down or anything.</p><p>Ewww.</p><p>But how was I supposed to know we\u2019d need a towel?</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Zach said, his voice a tight squeak. \u201cRuger, I can explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**kin\u2019 explain,\u201d Ruger said, pushing forward into the room. He slammed the door shut behind him and walked over to the couch. I tried to hide my head in Zach\u2019s chest, more ashamed and embarrassed than I\u2019d ever been in my life.</p><p>Flowers. Were flowers too much to ask?</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, what is she? Twelve?\u201d Ruger asked, giving the couch a kick. It shuddered under me, and Zach sat up, pulling away from my body. I shrieked and pushed my hands down between us, trying to cover myself from his brother\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Shit. SHIT.</p><p>Then it got worse.</p><p>The brother\u2014Rooger? whatever the hell kind of name that was\u2014looked right at me as he leaned across my body, grabbing a folded blanket from the back of the couch.</p><p>He tossed it over my crotch.</p><p>I moaned and died a little inside. My legs were still spread wide, my skirt up high around my waist. He\u2019d seen everything. Everything. This was supposed to be the most romantic night of my life and now I just wanted to go home and cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 a shower and by the time I\u2019m done, you need to be gone,\u201d Ruger said, getting in Zach\u2019s face. My boyfriend flinched. \u201cAnd stay the f**k outta my apartment.\u201d</p><p>With that, he walked down the hall to the bathroom, banging the door shut. Seconds later I heard the shower come on. Zach jumped up, muttering.</p><p>\u201cAsshole. He\u2019s such a goddamn ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a prick.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and straightened my shirt. Thank God I hadn\u2019t taken it off. Zach loved to touch my br**sts, but we\u2019d actually moved pretty fast once we got started. I managed to get to my feet, holding the blanket in front of me while I pulled down my skirt. I had no idea where my panties had gone, but a quick look around didn\u2019t reveal them. I leaned over the couch, digging in the pillows, hunting. No luck, but I managed to stick my hand in the disgusting wet spot we\u2019d left behind.</p><p>I felt like such a whore.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Zach yelled behind me. My head jerked up\u2014how could things possibly get any worse? \u201cHoly f**k, I cannot f**king believe this!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe condom broke,\u201d he said, eyes wide. \u201cThe f**king condom broke. This has got to be the worst night of my life. You better not be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The air froze in my lungs. Apparently things could get worse.</p><p>Zach held the broken rubber out toward me. I stared down at the nasty thing, not quite believing my bad luck.</p> <p>\u201cDid you do it wrong?\u201d I whispered. He shrugged, not answering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably okay,\u201d I said after another long pause. \u201cI mean, my period just ended. You can\u2019t get pregnant that soon after your period, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, probably,\u201d he said, flushing and looking away. \u201cI didn\u2019t really pay attention to that shit in class. I mean, I always use a condom. Always. They never break, not even\u2014\u201d</p><p>My breath caught and I felt hot tears well up in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you\u2019d only done it once before,\u201d I said softly. He winced.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done it with anyone I loved before,\u201d he said, dropping the broken rubber and grabbing for my hand. I tried to tug away. The mess on his fingers grossed me out, but when he pulled me in tight and wrapped his arms around me, I caved.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d he muttered, rubbing my back as I snuffled against his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019re fine. And I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t honest with you. I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t stick with me if you knew I\u2019d been stupid before. I don\u2019t care about any other girls and I never will. I just want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, pulling myself together. He shouldn\u2019t have lied, but at least he owned up to it. Mature couples worked through hard stuff all the time, right? \u201cUm, we should probably get out of here. Your brother looked pretty pissed. I thought he gave you a key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stepmom has an emergency key,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cI took it. He was supposed to be out of town. Grab the pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we leave some for your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew him. And he\u2019s my stepbrother. We\u2019re not even really related.\u201d</p> <p>Oookay.</p><p>I found my shoes and slipped them on, then got my purse and the pizza. I still didn\u2019t know where my panties were, but just then I heard the shower stop.</p><p>We needed to get out.</p><p>Zach glanced over at the bathroom, then winked at me as he grabbed the half rack off the counter.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, taking my hand and pulling me toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stealing his beer?\u201d I asked, feeling a little sick. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck him,\u201d Zach said, narrowing his eyes at me. \u201cHe\u2019s a total dick, thinks he\u2019s better than everyone else. Him and his stupid f**king motorcycle club. They\u2019re all ass**les and criminals, and he is, too. Probably stole it in the first place. And he can buy more anytime he wants, not like us. We\u2019ll take it to Kimber\u2019s. Her parents are in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>We jogged down the apartment complex stairs, then crossed the parking lot to his truck. It was kind of old, but at least the full-size Ford\u2019s king cab had plenty of room. We\u2019d take it out sometimes, just the two of us, and spend hours lying in the bed under the stars, kissing and laughing. Other times we packed three or four couples in, all sitting on each other\u2019s laps.</p> <p>Zach hadn\u2019t done such a great job tonight, but that wasn\u2019t his fault. Sometimes life just didn\u2019t follow the plan. I was still crazy about him, though.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, stopping him as he opened the driver\u2019s-side door. I turned him around and popped up onto my toes, kissing him long and slow. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, babe,\u201d Zach said, smoothing my hair back behind my ear. I melted when he did that\u2014made me feel all safe and protected. \u201cNow let\u2019s go kill some of those beers. Shit, f**kin\u2019 crazy night. My brother is such a dick.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and laughed as I hauled ass around the truck.</p><p>So losing my virginity hadn\u2019t been perfect and beautiful and all that. But at least it was over and Zach loved me.</p><p>Too bad about the panties, though.</p><p>I\u2019d bought them special and everything.</p><p>EIGHT MONTHS LATER</p><p>RUGER</p><p>\u201cFuck, it\u2019s my mom. I gotta grab that,\u201d Ruger yelled across the table at Mary Jo, holding up his cell. The band hadn\u2019t started yet, but the place was still packed, and he couldn\u2019t hear a damned thing. He didn\u2019t get out much since he\u2019d started prospecting the Reapers. Earning a place in the club was a full-time job by itself, and he pulled shifts at the pawnshop, too.</p><p>Ma knew that, and she wouldn\u2019t have called if it wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>\u201cHey, lemme get outside,\u201d he said loudly into the phone, walking toward the door with long strides. People got the f**k out of his way, and he bit back a smile. He\u2019d always been a big guy, but now that he wore an MC cut?</p><p>Fuckers practically dove under the tables when they saw the club patches on his vest.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay, I\u2019m outside,\u201d he said, moving away from the crowd in front of the Ironhorse.</p><p>\u201cJesse, Sophie needs you,\u201d his mom said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, peering at his bike, parked down the street. Was that guy getting close to it? Oh, not gonna happen ...</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going?\u201d she said. Shit. She\u2019d been talking.</p><p>\u201cFuck, sorry, Ma. Missed what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a panicked phone call from Sophie,\u201d his mom repeated. \u201cStupid kids. She went to a kegger with your brother and now she thinks she might be in labor. He\u2019s too drunk to drive her and she\u2019s having contractions, so she can\u2019t drive herself. I\u2019m gonna kill him. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d take her somewhere like that, especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you f**kin\u2019 kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesse, don\u2019t use that language with me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cCan you help her or not? I\u2019m in Spokane and it\u2019ll take at least an hour to get there. I\u2019ll start making more phone calls if you can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, isn\u2019t it too early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little too early, yes,\u201d she replied, her voice tense. \u201cI wanted to call an ambulance but she insists it\u2019s just Braxton Hicks. Ambulance rides cost a fortune, you know, and she\u2019s scared of the bills. She wants to go home but I think she might need the hospital. Can you get her or not? I can meet you there as soon as I hit town. I\u2019ve got a real bad feeling about this, Jess. Didn\u2019t sound like Braxton Hicks to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d he replied, wondering what the hell \u201cBraxton Hicks\u201d were. He saw Mary Jo come out of the bar, smiling at him ruefully. She knew all about sudden phone calls and changes in plans. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>He got the information, then hung up, walking over to his date and shrugging his shoulders. This sucked. He wanted to get laid, and not at the clubhouse. Some f**kin\u2019 privacy would be nice for once, and Mary Jo was wild as they got.</p><p>\u201cClub business?\u201d she asked lightly. Thank f**k she wasn\u2019t a drama queen.</p><p>\u201cNope, family,\u201d he replied. \u201cMy ass**le stepbrother knocked up his girlfriend and now she\u2019s going into labor. Needs a ride to the hospital. I\u2019m gonna go get her.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Jo\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou should leave,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll take a cab home. Shit, that sucks ... How old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust turned seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she said, shivering with genuine horror. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine having a kid that young. Call me later, okay?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a fast but hard kiss. She reached down and offered his c**k a quick squeeze. Ruger groaned, feeling himself stiffen. He really needed to get laid ...</p> <p>Instead, he pulled away and walked over to his bike.</p><p>The party was halfway to Athol, off in some field that he vaguely remembered visiting when he was in high school. He found Zach\u2019s truck easy enough. Sophie stood next to it, looking scared in the summer twilight. Then her face tightened and she hunched over her giant belly, groaning. Now she looked terrified.</p><p>Ruger parked his bike and realized he\u2019d have to leave it in the field\u2014no way she could ride with him. Fucking great. Asshat little shits would probably run over it or something. Sophie\u2019s face was white with strain, though. No room to f**k around. She needed to go in the truck, and clearly she needed to go now. Ruger shook his head, glancing around for his brother.</p><p>He still couldn\u2019t figure out why a smart, beautiful girl like her would pick Zach, of all people. Sophie had long, reddish-brown hair, beautiful green eyes, and a way about her that screamed feminine softness\u2014a softness he\u2019d spent more than one night imagining with his dick in his hand. Even pregnant in the middle of a field party, she was still gorgeous.</p><p>Way the f**k too young, though.</p><p>She saw him and winced, reaching around to put one hand against her back, stretching as the contraction ended. Ruger knew she didn\u2019t like him, and he didn\u2019t blame her. They hadn\u2019t met under the best of circumstances, and things between him and Zach went further to shit every day. Ruger hated the way he treated their mom and hated the way he lived his life. More than anything else, he hated the way the little f**k was already running around on Sophie behind her back.</p> <p>Cocksucker didn\u2019t deserve a girl like her, and their kid sure as hell hadn\u2019t won the lottery when it came to his future daddy.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d he asked, coming up to Sophie and hunkering down so he could see her face. Her eyes were full of panic.</p><p>\u201cMy water broke,\u201d she said, her voice a hoarse whisper. \u201cThe contractions are coming really fast. Way too fast. It\u2019s supposed to be slow with your first baby, it never happens this fast. I need to get to the hospital, Ruger. I shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, f**k me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou got the keys?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cZach does. He\u2019s over by the bonfire. Maybe we should call an ambulance? Oh ...\u201d she groaned, leaning over.</p><p>\u201cHang in there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get Zach. I can drive you to the hospital faster than an ambulance at this point.\u201d</p><p>She groaned again and leaned back against the truck. Ruger took off toward the bonfire, finding Zach half passed out on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cOn your feet, ass**le,\u201d Ruger demanded, grabbing him by the shirt and dragging him upright. \u201cKeys. Now.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at him blankly. Was that barf on his shirt? High school kids stood around watching them, eyes wide as they clutched their big red Solo cups of cheap beer.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Ruger muttered again, digging down into his brother\u2019s pants pocket, hoping like hell he hadn\u2019t lost them. This was closer to Zach\u2019s dick than he ever needed his hand to be. He pulled out the keys, dropping Zach back onto the dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna see your kid gettin\u2019 born, get your ass in the truck now,\u201d Ruger told him. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>With that he took off toward the Ford, wrenching open the door and lifting Sophie into the backseat. He heard a thudding noise and saw Zach climb into the truck bed out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Little prick.</p><p>Ruger turned on the engine and popped the truck into gear, ready to go. Then he slammed it back into park, jumped out, and ran over to his bike. He had a little first aid kit in there. Nothing fancy, but at this rate they might need it. He climbed back in the truck, pulled out of the field, and started toward the highway, watching Sophie anxiously in the rearview mirror. She was panting hard and then she screamed.</p><p>Every hair on the back of his neck stood up.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, I feel like I need to push,\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, God, it hurts. It hurts so bad. I\u2019ve never felt anything like this. Drive faster\u2014we need to get there fast ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off as she groaned again. Ruger drove faster, wondering if Zach had something to hold on to. He couldn\u2019t see him back there. Maybe he\u2019d passed out in the bed.</p><p>Hell, maybe he\u2019d bounced out. Ruger didn\u2019t care either way.</p><p>They\u2019d almost made it to the highway when Sophie started shouting.</p><p>\u201cStop! Stop the truck.\u201d</p><p>Ruger stopped, hoping to hell that didn\u2019t mean what he thought it did. He threw on the parking brake and turned to see her, eyes closed, face almost purple and full of agony. She was crouching forward, moaning.</p><p>\u201cAmbulance,\u201d he said, his voice grim. She nodded tightly. He made the call, giving the operator the details of their situation. Afterward, he put the phone on speaker, dropping it to the seat. Then he got out and opened the back door, leaning in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with you, Sophie,\u201d the 911 operator told them. \u201cHold on. The paramedics only have to come up from Hayden. You\u2019ll see them soon.\u201d</p><p>Sophie groaned through another contraction.</p><p>\u201cI have to push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ambulance is ten minutes out,\u201d the operator said. \u201cCan you hold on until they reach you? They have everything they need to help you with this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFUCK!\u201d Sophie screamed, squeezing Ruger\u2019s hands so hard his fingers went numb.</p><p>\u201cAll right. It\u2019s unlikely the baby will be born before they arrive, but I want you to get ready, Ruger,\u201d the operator said, her voice so calm she sounded stoned. How did she do that? He felt about thirty seconds away from a heart attack. \u201cSophie needs you now. The good news is that childbirth is natural and her body knows what to do. A baby born this fast usually means a very smooth delivery. Do you have a way to wash your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ruger muttered. \u201cYou gotta let go for a sec, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but he pried his hands free. He ripped into the first aid kit, pulling out a couple of ridiculously small sanitary wipe packets. Then he attacked his hands and tried to go after hers.</p> <p>She screamed and punched his face.</p><p>Holy shit, girl had some power behind her. Ruger shook his head, then pulled it together, his cheekbone throbbing.</p><p>Another contraction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early,\u201d Sophie gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t stop it. I have to push now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is she due?\u201d the operator asked as Sophie moaned long and low.</p> <p>\u201cAbout a month,\u201d Ruger told her. \u201cIt\u2019s too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. The most important thing is to make sure the baby is breathing. Don\u2019t let it fall on the ground if it\u2019s born before the EMTs arrive. You\u2019ll have to catch it. Now don\u2019t panic\u2014it can take hours to push out a baby, especially the first one. But just as a precaution, I want you to find something warm to wrap around the child if Sophie delivers. You\u2019ll check the baby\u2019s breathing. If it\u2019s good, you\u2019ll lay him on the mother\u2019s bare chest, facedown, skin to skin. Then put whatever you have over him. Don\u2019t tug on the cord, cut it, tie it off, or anything. Keep your hands away from the birth canal. If the afterbirth comes out, wrap it with the child.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when it hit him.</p><p>Sophie was going to have her baby right here on the side of the road. His nephew.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>Holy shit, she needed to get her pants off first.</p> <p>She wore leggings and he tried to pull them down with her still inside the cab. It didn\u2019t work, and she couldn\u2019t seem to find a comfortable position, either.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get you out of here,\u201d he said. She shook her head, teeth gritted, but he picked her up and set her feet on the ground anyway. Then he pulled down her sopping wet leggings and panties in one smooth move, lifting one foot and then the other to free her legs from the clinging fabric.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Sophie cried out again, face tight as she bore down next to him, falling into a squat beside the truck.</p><p>Fuck, he needed something to keep the baby warm.</p><p>Ruger glanced around frantically, finding exactly nothing, so he pulled off his cut and tossed it into the truck. Then he ripped his T-shirt over his head. It wasn\u2019t the best, but it was relatively clean. He\u2019d showered and put on a fresh one before meeting Mary Jo.</p><p>Sophie pushed for an eternity, crouched down and digging her fingers deep into his shoulders. He\u2019d have bruises there in the morning. Probably cuts from her nails, too. Whatever. The 911 operator\u2019s calm voice encouraged them, saying the ambulance was only five minutes out. Sophie ignored her, lost in her own world of pain and urgency, giving loud, low groans with every contraction.</p><p>\u201cCan you see the baby\u2019s head?\u201d the operator asked. Ruger froze.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He was pretty damned sure he didn\u2019t want to look. Fuck. Sophie needed him, though. The kid needed him, too. Ruger dropped down to peer between her legs.</p><p>That\u2019s when he saw it.</p><p>A tiny head, coming out of her body, covered with dark black hair. Holy crap.</p><p>Sophie sucked in a deep breath and gripped his shoulders even harder. She let out one loud, long moan as she pushed again.</p><p>Then it happened.</p><p>Ruger reached down\u2014almost in a trance\u2014as the world\u2019s most perfect little human slid right out of her and into his hands. Sophie started crying with relief as blood streaked her thighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d the operator asked. He heard a siren in the distance.</p><p>\u201cThe baby just came out,\u201d Ruger muttered, awed. He\u2019d seen a calf born, but that had nothing on this. \u201cI\u2019m holding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it breathing?\u201d</p><p>He watched as the newborn opened its little eyes for the first time and looked right at him. They were blue and round and confused and f**king gorgeous. They closed again as the baby screwed up its tiny mouth, sucked in a deep breath and let out a piercing wail.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fuck. The kid is fine.\u201d</p><p>Ruger looked up at Sophie as he raised the baby between them. She smiled hesitantly and reached for her child. Her exhausted, tear-streaked yet radiant face was the second-most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen in his life.</p><p>Right after those tiny blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, babe,\u201d he whispered to Sophie.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She kissed the boy\u2019s head softly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Noah ... It\u2019s Mommy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take such good care of you. I promise. Always.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>SEVEN YEARS LATER</p><p>SEATTLE, WASHINGTON</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>Our last night in Seattle didn\u2019t go so great.</p><p>My babysitter, my emergency backup sitter, and my second emergency backup sitter all had the flu. I\u2019d have been screwed if one of my new neighbors hadn\u2019t volunteered to keep an eye on Noah. I didn\u2019t really know her, but we\u2019d been living next to each other for a month and no red flags. Not the best, I know.</p><p>You do what you have to when you\u2019re a single mom.</p><p>Then Dick yelled at me for coming in late for my shift.</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019d nearly missed work altogether because of Noah. And no, I\u2019m not just calling him Dick because he\u2019s actually a dick (although he is). It\u2019s his real name.</p><p>That night I truly understood why he was in such a bad mood, because of the six girls who were supposed to be on, only two showed. Two had the flu (genuine\u2014half the city had it) and two had dates. Or I\u2019m assuming they had dates. Their official stories were a dead grandmother (her fifth) and an infected tattoo.</p><p>Apparently none of the drug stores in her neighborhood carried Bacitracin.</p><p>Either way, things fell to shit fast. We had a band, which put the customers in a good mood, but the live music and drunken dancing made it even harder to keep up with my tables. Also made us busier than usual. We would\u2019ve been stretched even with a full staff. To make things perfect, it was a local band and most of their fans were college students, which meant crappy tips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By eleven I was already tired and needed to pee in a bad way, so I ducked into the bathroom. Out of toilet paper already (of course), and I knew damned well nobody had time to restock. I pulled out my phone, doing a quick check for messages, and saw two. One from Miranda, my babysitter, and a second from Ruger, the world\u2019s scariest almost-in-law.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Miranda first. I held it to my ear and listened, hoping to hell everything was all right. No way Dick would let me off early, even for an emergency. Ruger could wait.</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m scared,\u201d Noah said.</p> <p>I froze.</p><p>\u201cI took Miranda\u2019s phone and I\u2019m hiding in the closet,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a bad guy here and he\u2019s smoking inside and he wanted me to smoke, too, and they kept laughing at me. He tried to tickle me and make me sit on his lap. Now they\u2019re watching a movie that has naked people in it and I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to be here and I want to go home. I want you to come home. I really need you. Right now.\u201d</p><p>I heard his breath hitch, like he was crying but didn\u2019t want me to know, and then the message cut out.</p><p>I took a couple of deep breaths, trying to control my surge of adrenaline. I checked the time on the message\u2014almost forty-five minutes ago. My stomach twisted and for a second I thought I might puke. Then I pulled it together and left the bathroom. I managed to walk back into the bar and have Brett, the bartender, unlock the drawer where we kept our purses.</p><p>\u201cI need to get home, my kid\u2019s in trouble. Tell Dick.\u201d</p> <p>With that I headed toward the door, pushing through drunken frat boys. I was almost out when someone grabbed my arm, spinning me around. My boss stood there, glaring.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going, Williams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an emergency,\u201d I told him. \u201cI need to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave me now with a crowd like this, don\u2019t come back,\u201d Dick growled. I leaned forward and stared him down, which was pretty easy considering the guy was hardly more than five feet tall. On good days I thought of him as a hobbit.</p><p>Tonight he was just a troll.</p><p>\u201cI need to take care of my son,\u201d I said coldly, using my deadliest troll-killing voice. \u201cLet go of my arm. Now. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Driving home took at least a year.</p><p>I kept trying to call Miranda, but nobody answered. When I reached our ancient apartment building, I tore up the wooden stairs to the top floor, shaking with a weird mixture of rage and fear. Miranda\u2019s place was right across from my little studio, and while my thighs and calves hated the climb, I\u2019d loved how we were the only residents up here. Until now.</p><p>Tonight it felt remote and scary.</p><p>I heard music and grunting as I pounded on the door. No answer. I pounded harder and wondered if I\u2019d have to break in. Then the door flew open. A tall guy with unbuttoned pants and no shirt blocked the entry. He had the start of a gut and bloodshot eyes. I smelled pot and booze.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked, swaying. I tried looking around him, but he blocked me.</p><p>\u201cMy son, Noah, is here,\u201d I said, struggling to stay calm and focus on what really counted. I could kill this ass**le later. \u201cI\u2019m here to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Forgot about him. C\u2019mon in.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside and I ducked past him. Miranda\u2019s place was a studio just like ours, so I should\u2019ve seen Noah right away. Instead I spotted my useless neighbor on the couch, collapsed on her back with her eyes glazed and a dreamy smile on her face. Her clothes were rumpled, her long hippie skirt shoved up above her splayed knees. The phone lay on the coffee table in front of her, next to a bong made out of plastic pens, foil, and a Mountain Dew bottle. Empties surrounded it, because apparently weed wasn\u2019t enough to keep her entertained while she failed to babysit my seven-year-old child.</p> <p>\u201cMiranda, where\u2019s Noah?\u201d I demanded. She looked at me blankly.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d she slurred.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he went outside,\u201d the guy muttered, turning away from me as he reached into the fridge for another beer.</p><p>I caught my breath.</p><p>Across his back was a giant tattoo that looked kind of like Ruger\u2019s, only it said Devil\u2019s Jacks instead of Reapers. Motorcycle club. Bad news. Always bad, despite what Ruger insisted.</p><p>I\u2019d think about that later. Focus. I needed to find Noah.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft and trembling. I looked around frantically, then saw him climbing in through an open window facing the street. Oh my God. I moved toward him, forcing myself to approach oh-so-carefully. Four flights above the ground and my boy was clinging to a windowsill. If I wasn\u2019t damned careful, I\u2019d knock him off the ledge.</p><p>I reached out and clamped my hands around his upper arms, pulling him in and clutching him close. He wrapped around me like a little monkey. I rubbed my hand up and down his back, whispering how much I loved him and promising never to leave him alone like that again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what you\u2019re so upset about,\u201d Miranda muttered, pulling herself up to make room for her ass**le boyfriend. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire escape out there and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s cold. It\u2019s August. Kid was fine.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and forced myself to stay calm. Then I opened them and looked past her.</p><p>That\u2019s when I saw the p**n on the TV.</p><p>My eyes skittered away from the sight of a silicone woman screwing four guys simultaneously. Something terrible took fire in my heart.</p><p>Stupid bitch. Miranda would pay for this.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, anyway?\u201d she slurred.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother answering. I just needed to get my boy out of there and home safe. I\u2019d deal with my neighbor tomorrow.</p><p>Maybe by then I\u2019d have calmed down enough not to end her miserable life.</p><p>I carried Noah out of the apartment and across the hallway to my own door. Somehow I managed to get it open without dropping him, fingers trembling from suppressed rage and a healthy dose of guilt.</p><p>I\u2019d failed him.</p><p>My baby needed me, and instead of protecting him, I\u2019d left him parked with a druggie who could\u2019ve gotten him killed. Being a single mom sucked.</p><p>It took a warm bath, an hour of snuggles, and four books to get Noah to sleep.</p><p>Me? I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever sleep again.</p><p>The summer heat didn\u2019t help\u2014I swear, the place had zero airflow. After an hour of sweating in the darkness, watching his little chest rise and fall, I gave up. I popped a beer and sat down on our couch, a thousand plans running through my head. First, I\u2019d kill Miranda. Then either I needed to find a new place to live or she did. I also pondered whether to call the cops. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I liked the idea of throwing her and her stoner boyfriend to the wolves. They deserved a friendly visit from the boys in blue.</p><p>But since her man was in a motorcycle club, calling the cops might not be the smartest move. Guys in MCs generally weren\u2019t fond of the police, a perspective he and his club brothers might feel the need to share with me once he made bail. Not to mention Child Protective Services would get involved, which could also get pretty ugly.</p><p>I loved Noah and would do anything for him. I was a damned good mother. When other girls my age were out partying and having fun, I was taking him to the park and reading him stories. I spent my twenty-first birthday holding him while he puked from stomach flu instead of hitting the bars. No matter how rough things got, I spent time with Noah every day and made sure he felt loved.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t look so good on paper.</p> <p>Single mom. Dad out of the picture. No family around, crappy studio apartment. Probably unemployed after tonight ... What would CPS make of that? Would they blame me for leaving him with Miranda in the first place?</p><p>I had no idea what to do. I took a long pull on the beer and then turned on my phone, where Ruger\u2019s message glowed at me accusingly. Crap. I hated calling him. No matter how much time he spent with us (and he made a point of seeing Noah regularly), I just couldn\u2019t relax around him. Ruger didn\u2019t like me and I knew it. I think he blamed me for destroying his relationship with Zach. God knows, I played my part. I pushed that memory away.</p><p>I always pushed that memory away.</p><p>If only I unnerved him, too, but apparently that was too much to ask. Instead he just looked right through me, hardly bothering to acknowledge my existence.</p><p>Even more frustrating? Ruger had to be the hottest guy I\u2019d ever met. He was all danger and hard muscles, with his tattoos and piercings and that goddamned black Harley of his. When he walked into a room he owned it, because it only took one look to see he was a f**king badass, the type who takes what he wants and never says he\u2019s sorry.</p> <p>I\u2019d been nursing a hell of a crush on him for longer than I cared to acknowledge, something he\u2019d failed to notice despite his apparent fascination with every other woman under the age of forty within five hundred miles. Well, failed to notice all but once, and that hadn\u2019t exactly ended well.</p><p>At least he never brought any of his club whores around (which I greatly appreciated), but that didn\u2019t change the fact that he was one of the biggest sluts in north Idaho.</p><p>So that\u2019s where we stood.</p><p>Presented with my nonthreatening charms, the panhandle\u2019s sexiest, most prolific man-whore still preferred hanging with my seven-year-old child during his visits.</p><p>I sighed and hit the play button.</p><p>\u201cSophie, answer your f**king phone,\u201d he said, his voice cold and unyielding, like usual. \u201cI just got a call from Noah. I talked to him for a while and tried to keep him calm, but then some bitch started yellin\u2019 and took the phone away. Nobody answered when I called back. I don\u2019t know what the f**k you\u2019re thinking, but your kid needs you. Get off your ass and go get him. Now. I swear, if anything happens to him ... You don\u2019t wanna go there, Sophie. Just f**king call me when you find him. No excuses.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped the phone and leaned forward on my knees, rubbing my temples with the tips of my fingers.</p><p>In addition to everything else, now I had to deal with Mr. Being-a-Biker-Isn\u2019t-a-Crime losing his shit on me. Which he would do, I had no doubt. Ruger was scary enough in a good mood. The one time I\u2019d seen him truly enraged still gave me nightmares, and that\u2019s not a figure of speech. Unfortunately, he had a point. When my son needed me, I hadn\u2019t answered the phone. Thank God Ruger had been there for Noah. But still ... I really didn\u2019t want to deal with him right now, either.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave him hanging, though, worried about Noah all night. He\u2019d called me a bitch the last time I\u2019d seen him, and maybe he had a point, but I wasn\u2019t a big enough bitch to torture him like that. I hit the callback button.</p><p>\u201cHe all right?\u201d Ruger demanded, not bothering with a hello.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him and he\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear the phone ring at work, but I found his message and left about forty-five minutes later. He\u2019s okay. We got lucky and nothing happened, not that I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that ass**le didn\u2019t touch him?\u201d Ruger asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah said he tried to tickle him and make him sit on his lap, but he ran away. They were completely cross-faded. I don\u2019t think they even noticed when he took off. He was hiding outside on the fire escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck ...\u201d Ruger said. He didn\u2019t sound happy. \u201cHow high up was he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour stories,\u201d I replied, closing my eyes in shame. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m driving. I\u2019ll talk to you later. Don\u2019t f**king leave him alone again, or you\u2019ll answer to me. You got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered. I hung up the phone and set it down on the table. The room felt stifling and I couldn\u2019t get enough air, so I crept softly across the floor to the window. The splintery wooden sash slid up with a groan and I leaned out, looking down at the street, sucking in the cool breeze. The bars had just emptied and people laughed outside, walking along like everything was fine and dandy.</p><p>What if I hadn\u2019t checked the voice mail? Would any of these happy drunks have looked up and seen a little boy clinging to the fire escape? What if he\u2019d fallen asleep out there?</p><p>Noah could be dead on that pavement right now.</p><p>I finished my beer and grabbed a second one, then sat on my ratty couch and pounded it. The last time I checked the clock, it said three a.m.</p><p>A noise in the predawn darkness woke me.</p><p>Noah?</p><p>A hand covered my mouth as a large body came down over mine, pinning me to the couch. Adrenaline poured through me too late\u2014no matter how I struggled, bucking my entire body against his, my attacker held me trapped. All I could think about was Noah, sleeping right across the room. I needed to fight and survive for my son, but I couldn\u2019t move and I couldn\u2019t see a damned thing in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou scared?\u201d a rough, dark voice whispered in my ear. \u201cWondering if you\u2019ll live through the night? What about your kid? I could rape and kill you and then sell him to some sick pedophile f**k. You couldn\u2019t do a goddamned thing to stop me, now could you? How you gonna protect him livin\u2019 in a place like this, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. I knew that voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruger.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t hurt me. Asshole.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even have to break through the f**kin\u2019 pathetic lock you have on this shithole,\u201d he continued, shifting his hips over mine, emphasizing how little control I held. \u201cYour window\u2019s open and so is the window in the hallway. I just stepped out on the fire escape and walked right over, which means anyone else could, too. Including that sick f**k who messed with our boy earlier. That bastard still in the building? I want him, Sophie. Nod your head if you\u2019ll stay quiet, and I\u2019ll let you talk. Don\u2019t scare Noah.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head as best I could, trying to calm the racing of my heart, torn between the remains of fear and my building anger.</p> <p>How dare he judge me?</p><p>\u201cYou scream, you\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head. He pulled his hand away and I took several deep breaths, blinking rapidly, trying to decide if lunging at him with my teeth would be worth it. Probably not ... Ruger was heavy and he covered my entire body, his legs clamping down across mine, my arms trapped deep in the couch. I couldn\u2019t remember him ever voluntarily touching me before\u2014not for four years, at least. That was a good thing, because something about Ruger turned off my brain in a bad way, leaving my body in charge.</p><p>I got knocked up the last time I left my body in charge.</p><p>I\u2019d never regret my son, but that didn\u2019t mean I should let my libido do the thinking for me again. After I finally got shot of Zach, I\u2019d only gone out with very safe, very boring men. I\u2019d had three lovers total in my life, and numbers two through three were nice and tame. I didn\u2019t need a complication like my son\u2019s biker uncle ... But I\u2019d caught his familiar scent now\u2014gun oil and a hint of male sweat\u2014which led to an annoyingly predictable response down below.</p> <p>Even angry, I wanted Ruger.</p><p>In fact, I usually wanted him more when I was angry. This was unfortunate, because he had a gift for pissing me off. Life would be so much simpler if I could just hate him. The man was truly an ass**le.</p><p>He just happened to be an ass**le who loved the hell out of my kid.</p><p>So now he lay on top of me and I wanted to head-butt him or something, but I also felt embarrassing heat pool between my legs. He was big and hard and right there and I didn\u2019t know how to handle that. Ruger always kept his distance from me. I expected him to let me up now that he\u2019d made his point in the least constructive way possible, but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead he shifted again, leaning up on his elbows on either side of me, holding me trapped.</p><p>His legs moved, one coming to rest between mine. Way too intimate. I tried to close my knees, but he narrowed his eyes and slid his hips into the cradle of my pelvis.</p><p>Wrong. So wrong ... And unfair, too, because clenching him between my legs didn\u2019t exactly make my brain work better. I squirmed, needing him to be far away from me. Immediately. Yet I couldn\u2019t help wondering whether I could reach down between us and open his fly.</p> <p>The man was like heroin\u2014seductive, addictive, and a damned good way to wake up dead.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d he whispered, voice strained. \u201cThe fact that my dick\u2019s in its happy place is probably saving your life. Trust me when I say I\u2019m seriously considerin\u2019 strangling you, Sophie. Thinking about f**kin\u2019 you helps balance that out.\u201d</p><p>I froze.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d just said that. We had an agreement. We\u2019d never discussed it, but we both followed it scrupulously. Sure enough, though, he pressed his hips into mine again and I felt his hard length growing against my stomach. My inner muscles clenched, sending a wave of need wrenching through me. This was cheating. The infatuation went one way\u2014I lusted after him, he ignored me, and we pretended nothing had ever happened between us.</p><p>I licked my lips and his eyes followed the small movement, unfathomable in the dim light starting to filter through the windows.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d I whispered. He narrowed his eyes, studying me like a lion scoping out the slowest gazelle. Wait, did lions eat gazelles? Was this really happening?</p><p>Think.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t you, Ruger,\u201d I told him. \u201cThink about what you just said. Let me up and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI f**king mean every word,\u201d he replied, harsh and angry. \u201cI hear my kid is in trouble and his mom\u2019s nowhere to be found. I spend hours driving across the state, scared shitless that someone\u2019s molesting or murdering our boy, and when I finally get here I find you in a total shithole with a broken lock on the downstairs door and easy access to your apartment through an open window. I crawl in and find you passed out on the couch half naked and smellin\u2019 like beer.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head down, scenting me and twisting his hips into mine. Shit, that felt good. I actually ached between my legs, it felt so good.</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve taken him away from you, easy as f**k,\u201d he continued, raising his head, eyes burning through me. \u201cAnd if I could, so could anyone else, which is not f**kin\u2019 okay. So you\u2019ll just have to sit tight and wait for me to cool down a little because right now I\u2019m not feeling particularly reasonable. Until then, I\u2019d suggest you not tell me what I mean, you got that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, eyes wide. I believed every word he said. Ruger held my gaze as he shifted his legs again and then both were between mine and I felt every inch of his dick right up against my crotch. He surrounded me completely, overwhelming me with his strength, and I had a sudden, crazy flashback to that night I\u2019d lost my virginity to Zach in Ruger\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Me sprawled on a couch, legs spread, watching my life fall to shit.</p><p>Full circle.</p><p>Adrenaline still raced through me, and he wasn\u2019t the only one who needed to cool down a bit. He\u2019d scared me, damn it, and now the bastard was turning me on, a sensation that mixed disturbingly well with the anger and fear already overwhelming my system. I really couldn\u2019t move, either. Ruger dropped his head down next to mine and groaned, grinding his hips into me. A swirl of tingling, tightening, traitorous desire twisted up along my spine from my pelvis. I moaned as he pressed hard against my clit. This felt good. Too good.</p><p>My inner slut suggested a surefire way to burn off tension ...</p><p>As if reading my mind, Ruger\u2019s breath caught. Then he pushed into me harder, rubbing his length back and forth against the thin layer of cotton covering my center. Neither of us said anything but I tilted my hips up to feel him better and he stiffened.</p><p>This is a bad idea, I thought, arching into him, closing my eyes. I\u2019d wanted him for years. Every time I saw him, I secretly wondered what he\u2019d feel like inside me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, if we did this, I\u2019d still have to look at his smug, smirking face. He wouldn\u2019t even be embarrassed, the stupid jerk. We had to stop immediately. But he felt f**king incredible. His scent surrounded me, the hard strength of his body pinning and spreading me like a captured butterfly. His nose brushed the curve of my ear and then he dropped lower, giving my neck a slow, sucking kiss, lips dragging across my skin until I had to bite my own to stay quiet. I twisted underneath him and acknowledged the truth. I wanted him deep inside. Now.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care that captured butterflies die when they\u2019re pinned.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>I tried to speak but nothing came out. I cleared my throat and tried again, the heat of Ruger\u2019s breath playing across my cheek. My entire body throbbed, and he shifted, slowly dragging his hips across mine again, deliberately taunting me.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d I called to Noah, my voice unsteady. \u201cUm, give me a sec, okay? We have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Uncle Ruger?\u201d</p><p>Ruger thrust against me one last time before jackknifing up. I sat up unsteadily, rubbing my hands up and down my arms. Noah\u2019s voice should\u2019ve been cold water on my libido, but no such luck. I still felt Ruger\u2019s delicious hardness between my legs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here, little man,\u201d Ruger said, standing and running his hands across his head. I studied him in the dim morning light, wishing with all my heart he looked more like my former boss, Dick. No such luck. Ruger was over six feet tall, roped with muscle and annoyingly handsome in an I\u2019m-probably-a-murderer-but-I\u2019ve-got-dimples-and-a-tight-ass-so-you\u2019ll-still-lust-after-me kind of way. Sometimes he wore a mohawk, but the last few months he\u2019d taken to wearing the same buzz cut he\u2019d had when we first met, the slightly longer hair on top dark and thick.</p><p>Combined with his size, his piercings, his black leather club vest, and the tattooed sleeves on both arms, he belonged on a \u201cWanted\u201d poster. Noah should\u2019ve been terrified of him. But he didn\u2019t seem to notice how scary his uncle was. He never had.</p><p>\u201cI promised I\u2019d come get you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Ruger said softly. Noah crawled out of bed and stumbled over to Ruger, reaching his arms up for a hug. Ruger caught my boy and swung him high, meeting his gaze eye-to-eye, man-to-man. Ruger always did that\u2014he took Noah seriously.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, bud?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded, wrapping his arms around his uncle\u2019s neck and clutching him close. He worshipped Ruger, and the feeling was mutual. The sight was heartbreaking.</p><p>I always thought Zach would be Noah\u2019s hero. Obviously, my instincts were shit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, little man,\u201d Ruger told him. I stood, planning to join them, but Ruger turned away. So he wanted some privacy. I wasn\u2019t going to argue if it made Noah feel safe, but I still strained to hear the conversation as he carried my boy back to bed.</p><p>\u201cYou did good callin\u2019 for help,\u201d I heard him say faintly. \u201cYou ever get in a situation like that again, you call me. Call your mama. You can call the cops, too. You remember how to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine one one,\u201d Noah muttered, his voice sleepy and thick. A giant yawn caught him off guard and he slumped against Ruger\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut I\u2019m only supposed to do that in an emergency and I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bad man touches you, that\u2019s an emergency,\u201d Ruger murmured. \u201cBut you did your best, you did what I said. You hid and that was real good, little man. I want you to lie down and go back to sleep, okay? In the morning I\u2019m taking you to my house and you\u2019ll never have to see those people or this place again. But you can\u2019t come with me if you\u2019re too tired.\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath. What the hell?</p><p>I watched as he tucked Noah in, my mood far from mellow. Seconds later my kiddo was out again, clearly still exhausted. I pulled on a robe and waited for Ruger to come back, crossing my arms and bracing for battle.</p><p>He cocked a brow at me, deliberately checking me out. Was he trying to use sex to bully me? That might explain his little seduction-on-the-couch game ...</p><p>\u201cYou forget the part about not pissin\u2019 me off?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you tell Noah he\u2019s going to your house? You can\u2019t make promises like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking him home to Coeur d\u2019Alene with me,\u201d Ruger replied, his voice matter-of-fact. He tilted his head to the side, waiting for the fight he had to know was coming. His neck was thick with muscles and his biceps flexed as he crossed his arms, matching my stance. It really wasn\u2019t fair. A man this frustrating should be short and fat, with hairy ears or something. But it didn\u2019t matter how sexy he was this time, I wouldn\u2019t cave\u2014he wasn\u2019t Noah\u2019s dad and he could step the f**k off. \u201cI\u2019m betting you\u2019ll want to come with us, and that\u2019s great. But he\u2019s not stayin\u2019 in this shithole another night.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly and deliberately. I felt the same way about our apartment\u2014it didn\u2019t feel safe anymore\u2014but I wasn\u2019t going to let him just swoop in and take over. I\u2019d find us a new place. I wasn\u2019t quite sure how, but I\u2019d do it.</p><p>I\u2019d spent the last seven years honing my survival skills.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make that decision. He\u2019s not your son, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecision\u2019s made,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cAnd he may not be my son, but he\u2019s definitely my kid. I claimed him the minute he was born, and you damned well know it\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t like how you took him so far from me, but I respect why you did it. Things have changed now. Mom\u2019s dead, Zach\u2019s gone, and this\u201d\u2014he gestured around the ratty little studio\u2014\u201cthis isn\u2019t good enough. What the f**k do you need in your life that\u2019s more important than giving Noah a safe place to live?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it down,\u201d Ruger told me, stepping forward into my space, pushing me back. It was a power play, pure physical intimidation. I\u2019ll bet it usually worked for him, too, because when he loomed over me like that, every survival instinct I had told me to roll over and follow his orders. Something quivered down below ... Stupid body.</p><p>\u201cIt means exactly what it sounds like,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat the f**k are you spending your child support on? Because it sure as shit isn\u2019t this hellhole. And why the f**k did you move out of your other place? It wasn\u2019t great, but it was okay, and it had that little park and playground. When you told me you were moving, I thought that meant you found something nicer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I got evicted for not paying my rent.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened convulsively. His expression darkened, something impossible to read filling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me why\u2014exactly\u2014I\u2019m just hearin\u2019 about this situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you anything. It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p> <p>He stilled, taking a series of deep breaths. Long seconds passed, and I realized he was consciously forcing himself to calm down. I thought he\u2019d been angry before, but the cold fury that came off of him now was a whole new level ... I shivered. That was one of the many problems with Ruger. Sometimes he scared me. And the guys in his club?</p><p>Even scarier.</p><p>Ruger was poison to a woman in my situation, no matter how sweet he was to Noah or how badly my body craved his touch.</p><p>\u201cNoah is my business,\u201d he finally said, each word slow and deliberate. \u201cEverything that touches him is my business. You don\u2019t get it, that\u2019s your problem, but it ends tonight. I\u2019m taking him home where it\u2019s safe so I won\u2019t ever get another f**king phone call like that one again. Jesus, you haven\u2019t even done the basics to secure this place. Don\u2019t you ever listen to me? I told you to get some of those little alarms for the windows until I could come over and wire the place up right.\u201d</p><p>I steeled my spine and held fast.</p> <p>\u201cOne, you don\u2019t get to take him anywhere,\u201d I said, trying very hard not to flinch or let my voice tremble. I couldn\u2019t afford to show any weakness, despite the fact that I was perilously close to peeing myself. \u201cAnd two, your ass**le brother hasn\u2019t paid me any child support for nearly a year now. Health and Welfare can\u2019t find a trace of him, either. I did my best, but I couldn\u2019t keep up the rent on the other place. I can afford the rent here, so we moved. You have no right to judge me\u2014I\u2019d like to see you raise a child on what I earn. They don\u2019t just give out those window alarms for free, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>His jaw twitched.</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s working the oil fields in North Dakota,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cMakin\u2019 damned good money. I talked to him two months ago, about Mom\u2019s estate. He said everything was okay between you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied,\u201d I said forcefully. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does, Ruger. This isn\u2019t news. Are you really surprised?\u201d</p><p>I felt suddenly tired\u2014thinking about Zach always made me tired, but sleep wasn\u2019t the answer. He waited for me in my dreams, too. I always woke up screaming.</p><p>Ruger turned and walked over to the window, leaning on the sill and looking outside thoughtfully. Thank God, he seemed to be calming down. If he didn\u2019t look so deceptively attractive silhouetted in my window, my world would make sense again.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said after a long pause. \u201cWe both know he\u2019s a f**kin\u2019 loser. But you should\u2019ve told me. I wouldn\u2019t have let this happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your problem,\u201d I replied softly. \u201cWe were doing fine, at least until tonight. My regular sitters all have that flu that\u2019s going around. I made a mistake. I won\u2019t make it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Ruger said, turning to face me. He tilted his head to the side, eyes boring through me. He looked a little different, I realized. He\u2019d lost a bunch of his piercings. Too bad it hadn\u2019t softened him up even a little bit, because his expression was pure steel. \u201cI won\u2019t let you. It\u2019s time to admit you can\u2019t do it all on your own. Club\u2019s full of women who love kids. They\u2019ll help out. We\u2019re a family, and family doesn\u2019t stand by when someone\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d opened my mouth to argue when I heard a light knock on the door. Ruger pushed off the window and strode over to open it.</p><p>A giant of a man walked in, taller even than Ruger, which was saying something. He wore faded jeans, a dark shirt, and a black leather vest covered with patches, just like Ruger\u2019s, including his name and a little red diamond with a 1% symbol on it.</p><p>All the Reapers had them, and my old friend Kimber had told me it meant they were outlaws\u2014that I had no trouble believing.</p><p>This new guy had shoulder-length, darkish hair and a face so perfectly handsome he could\u2019ve been a movie star. Under one arm he held a stack of broken-down cardboard boxes, tied together with what looked like baling wire.</p><p>In the other he held an aluminum baseball bat and a roll of duct tape.</p> <p>I swallowed and nearly fainted. My hands actually started sweating, because I\u2019m clich\u00e9 like that. My nemesis hadn\u2019t just come to rescue us, he\u2019d brought along one of his accomplices. That was the biggest problem with Ruger\u2014he was a package deal. You bought one Reaper, you bought them all.</p><p>Well, all of them who weren\u2019t currently serving time.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of my brothers, Horse,\u201d Ruger said, closing the door behind him. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna help us move your shit. Stay quiet, but start packing whatever you want to bring. You\u2019ll be staying in the basement at my place. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen my new property,\u201d he added pointedly, which I knew was a dig at me for refusing his offer of a room at the beginning of the summer when we visited Coeur d\u2019Alene. \u201cBut it\u2019s got a daylight basement with a kitchen and everything, and you\u2019ll have your own little patio. There\u2019s tons of space for Noah to run around, too. It\u2019s furnished, so only bring what you really care about. The rest of this shit can stay.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the room, judging my furniture. I saw his point. Most of it had been scrounged off curbs next to Dumpsters. The finer pieces came from thrift stores.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the kid?\u201d Horse asked softly, setting the boxes down and leaning them against the wall. Then he hefted the bat, giving it a little toss and catching it with his other hand. I couldn\u2019t help but notice how thick his arms were. Apparently club life wasn\u2019t all drinking and whoring, because Ruger and his friend obviously did some serious weight lifting. \u201cDid the bastard touch him? What\u2019re we dealing with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s fine,\u201d I said quickly. I eyed the tape, which Horse had failed to deposit next to the folded boxes. \u201cHe was scared, but it\u2019s over now. And we really don\u2019t need your help, because we aren\u2019t going back to Coeur d\u2019Alene.\u201d</p><p>Horse ignored me, glancing toward Ruger.</p><p>\u201cThe guy still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno yet,\u201d Ruger replied. He looked to me. \u201cSophie, show us which apartment they\u2019re in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked, glancing between them. Their faces were completely blank. \u201cYou can\u2019t actually kill him. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t kill people,\u201d Ruger said, his voice calm and almost soothing. \u201cBut sometimes ass**les like him have accidents when they aren\u2019t careful. Can\u2019t control that\u2014it\u2019s a fact of life. Show us where he is.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Horse\u2019s big, strong hands holding his baseball bat and the roll of duct tape, one thumb caressing the silver surface.</p><p>Then I thought about Noah clinging to a fire escape, four stories high, hiding from a \u201cbad man\u201d who wanted him to sit on his lap so he could tickle him.</p><p>I thought about the booze and the pot and the p**n .</p><p>Then I walked to the door, opened it, and pointed across the hall toward Miranda\u2019s studio.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Ten minutes later, I couldn\u2019t stop wondering what Ruger meant by the word \u201caccident.\u201d</p><p>Were they planning a fatal \u201caccident\u201d?</p><p>I told myself it wasn\u2019t my problem. Miranda\u2019s fate was set the moment Noah called Ruger, crying and begging for help\u2014totally beyond my control. Telling myself that worked for about half an hour, and then my conscience kicked in.</p><p>If Ruger and Horse weren\u2019t planning to kill someone, why did they need a bat and duct tape? Those weren\u2019t constructive-discussion-about-what-you-did-wrong supplies. Those were killing-someone-and-hiding-the-body supplies. The only thing missing was a box of big black garbage bags. I\u2019d seen Dexter. I knew these things.</p><p>Miranda deserved serious payback for Noah, but she didn\u2019t deserve to die. I didn\u2019t need that kind of karma.</p><p>I called Ruger\u2019s cell. He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Then I crept across the hall and knocked on the door. There weren\u2019t any screams or anything coming from inside. Good sign or bad? Hard to tell\u2014this was my first felony and I didn\u2019t know the proper procedure. I heard boots crossing the creaky wooden floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d I said, pitching my voice low. \u201cCan you come out for a sec? I really need to talk, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuger\u2019s busy,\u201d Horse replied through the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll be done here soon. Go get packed and take care of your boy. We got this.\u201d</p><p>I tried the knob. Locked.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Sophie, go back to your place.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from the door. Now what?</p><p>The open window at the end of the hall caught my eye. The fire escape. Ruger had used it to get into my apartment, and Miranda\u2019s place was a mirror of mine. Maybe I could get in that way to make sure everything was all right?</p><p>I ducked back into my studio for a quick check on Noah, closing and locking my own window while I was at it. Thankfully, he was still totally out. Not a surprise, given the night we\u2019d had. I slipped through the door and locked it, then walked over to the hall window and stuck my head out to scope the situation.</p><p>Sure enough, the narrow iron landing stretched from my window and across the hallway before stopping under hers. I put my leg through cautiously and stepped onto the platform, making it creak. I glanced down and swallowed.</p> <p>Never been a huge fan of heights.</p><p>I held the rail with one hand, trailing the other along the brick wall until I reached her closed window. I crouched low, peeking through. Miranda wasn\u2019t much of a decorator, so she didn\u2019t have real blinds, just a filmy, translucent scarf she\u2019d tacked over the pane. Details might be a little fuzzy, but I could still see clearly enough.</p><p>Her boyfriend lay facedown on the floor, hands bound tightly behind his back with duct tape. They\u2019d wrapped his feet, too, with more tape around his head\u2014like they\u2019d decided to shut his mouth and just kept going. Blood trailed from a cut on his forehead and dripped out of his nose. Bruises were forming along his ribs. He seemed to be unconscious.</p><p>Ruger stood over him, aluminum bat in one hand, cell phone in the other.</p><p>Miranda knelt in the middle of the room, hands taped tight just like her man\u2019s. More duct tape covered her mouth and she wore a sleazy nightgown that was probably supposed to look sexy. Horse lounged casually across from her, leaning against the wall. He seemed bored.</p><p>I sighed with relief. I\u2019d been crazy to think they\u2019d actually butcher two people in cold blood. That didn\u2019t happen in real life. Sure, whatever was going on in there didn\u2019t look fun, but I could live with that.</p><p>Ruger hung up his phone and shoved it into his pocket. He said something to Horse. Horse shrugged and must\u2019ve cracked some sort of joke, because Ruger laughed. Then the big man walked over to Miranda, knelt down, and ripped the strip of silver off her face. Her lips quivered as she asked him a question. He shook his head as he replied, and she started trembling so hard I could see it from across the room and through the curtain.</p><p>Then things got bad.</p><p>Horse reached around and pulled an ugly black handgun out of the back of his jeans. I watched in frozen horror as he cocked the slider-thingy on top, clearly preparing to shoot. Then he said something else to Miranda.</p><p>Tears ran down her face as she slowly opened her mouth.</p><p>Horse nudged her lips wider with the barrel of his gun, pushing it in.</p><p>Holy f**k. HOLY FUCK.</p><p>I jumped up and pounded on the window with both hands, screaming at them to stop.</p><p>Ruger spun around, moving so fast I couldn\u2019t follow. Within seconds he\u2019d ripped open the window and jerked me into the room. The sash crashed down again as he wrapped his arms around me, pinning me to the front of his body, my back to his stomach. I tried to scream again, but his hand slammed across my mouth.</p><p>The bat clattered as it rolled across the wooden floor.</p><p>Miranda\u2019s eyes darted toward me, full of desperate hope that quickly melted when neither man moved. Then Horse spoke.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up, sugar. Usually people close their eyes. Your call.\u201d</p><p>Miranda moaned, shutting her eyes tight and visibly bracing her body.</p><p>Horse glanced up, smiled, and blew me a kiss.</p><p>Then he pulled the trigger.</p><p>RUGER</p><p>Sophie exploded in his arms, thrashing furiously. Her bitch of a neighbor screamed and fell back on the floor, flopping around dramatically.</p><p>Neither seemed to notice the f**king gun hadn\u2019t been loaded.</p><p>Ruger fought to control the banshee in his arms, hating Horse because the bastard just stood there, smirking at him like the smug, cocksucking ass**le he\u2019d always been. Seriously, a goddamned kiss? Sick f**k. One of Sophie\u2019s heels lashed back and caught him in the shin. When he grunted, she kicked the same spot again. Savagely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFifty bucks says your baby mama could take you in a fair fight,\u201d Horse taunted.</p><p>Miranda\u2019s shrieking suddenly stopped and she froze, opening her eyes to look around in stunned confusion.</p><p>Finally, dumbass had noticed she wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>Sophie stilled and Ruger\u2019s aching shin rejoiced.</p> <p>\u201cFeel like I\u2019m repeatin\u2019 myself here,\u201d he muttered in her ear. \u201cBut if I move my hand, you better keep quiet. Got me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head tightly.</p><p>Ruger let go and Sophie jerked away. Fast as a snake, her hand flashed out and slapped him across the face, which f**king hurt.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou scared the crap out of me! What kind of sadist pulls shit like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe kind interested in making a lasting impression?\u201d Ruger asked, cocking his head at her. \u201cJesus, did you want us to kill her?\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s face twisted and her mouth opened, but before anything came out, the bitch on the floor started crying. Loud. Ruger had come to realize Miranda did everything loud. Horse leaned forward and caught Miranda\u2019s arms, jerking her up and onto her knees. He caught her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWe do this again, a bullet comes out and pulps your brain. Got me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded frantically, her sobs even noisier than before. How was that even possible? Then Ruger caught the unmistakable smell of piss and sighed. Sure enough, she\u2019d left a puddle.</p><p>\u201cEvery f**kin\u2019 time,\u201d he muttered. Horse snorted.</p><p>\u201cPussy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys,\u201d Sophie said, clenching and unclenching her hands, shaking with adrenaline. She was so angry she\u2019d forgotten to be afraid. He actually liked that about her\u2014Sophie had grit. But right now she was getting on his nerves. They had a lot to do and limited time before the Jacks showed up. \u201cI thought you were killing her. She thought you were killing her. How can you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to catch her attention,\u201d Ruger replied, temper fraying. \u201cNear-death experiences tend to stick with a person. Next time she\u2019ll make better choices.\u201d</p><p>Sophie opened her mouth, then snapped it shut and glared.</p><p>The sound of tape ripping cut the air as Horse covered Miranda\u2019s mouth again. Thank f**k for that. Ruger was tired of her noise, he was exhausted from driving all night, and he was hungry.</p><p>\u201cGo back next door, Sophie,\u201d he said, rubbing a hand through his short hair. He caught a whiff of his own scent when he raised his arm. Nasty. He\u2019d have to shower at her place before they left for Coeur d\u2019Alene. \u201cWe won\u2019t go crazy, I promise. But don\u2019t forget, Noah spent more than an hour hiding on the fire escape last night. Four stories up, Sophie. Your babysitter\u2019s man is a registered sex offender, by the way. Bitch knew it, too. She still invited him over while she had a kid at her place. Don\u2019t feel sorry for either of them.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d</p><p>Horse answered.</p> <p>\u201cThey told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think sex offenders go around sharing that kind of information,\u201d she said, suddenly wary.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very persuasive people,\u201d Ruger told her. \u201cYou just gotta ask the questions right. Go home, Soph. We need to finish up here and get you moved out. I\u2019m tired, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all wrong. I feel like an accomplice,\u201d Sophie replied, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>For f**k\u2019s sake ... She hadn\u2019t been too worried about being an \u201caccomplice\u201d when she pointed out Miranda\u2019s place earlier. Little late to be complaining at this point in the game.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t like it? Personally, I don\u2019t like the idea of the next kid getting raped just because he isn\u2019t smart enough to hide on the fire escape,\u201d Ruger said, stepping slowly into her space and backing her toward the wall. \u201cHow \u2019bout this? You go ahead and feel guilty about being an accomplice, and I\u2019ll go ahead and keep doing your dirty work so you don\u2019t break a f**kin\u2019 nail or something. Then tonight we\u2019ll open a bottle of wine and talk about how today made us feel. Maybe eat some chocolate while we\u2019re at it, then watch The Notebook together. That work for you?\u201d</p><p>She hit the wall and he leaned forward, slapping his hands flat on either side of her head. Ruger dropped his face into hers, eyes blazing.</p><p>\u201cShit, Sophie\u2014I think I\u2019m showin\u2019 extreme patience, all things considered. This is not a f**kin\u2019 joke. Noah made it through last night because he stayed awake and alert on that fire escape, not because either of these f**ks lifted a finger to help him. They terrorized a little boy and laughed about it. Now it\u2019s their turn. Don\u2019t expect me to feel bad about that. Go. Home.\u201d</p><p>Sophie swallowed, eyes wide. She stayed quiet as she slowly slid down and out from under the barrier of his arms, skirting the edge of the room until she reached the door. She slipped through, closing it behind her very softly.</p><p>Ruger glanced over at Horse, who raised a brow. Great. Now he\u2019d catch shit from him, too.</p><p>\u201cYour baby mama\u2019s kinda hot when she\u2019s pissed,\u201d Horse said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Horse. You got no sense of boundaries, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he replied, and Ruger seriously considered taking the bat and smashing the bastard\u2019s face in. Of course, then he\u2019d have Horse\u2019s old lady to deal with ... Bitch was a damned good shot.</p><p>Miranda fell over with a thump, eyes wide. They looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do with this one?\u201d Horse asked. \u201cI want her out of our faces, but I gotta say, don\u2019t like the idea of leaving her here for the Jacks when they come to pick up their problem child.\u201d He jerked his chin toward the still-unconscious man on the floor.</p><p>\u201cLet her go right before we take off?\u201d Ruger suggested. He walked over and nudged her with his foot. \u201cHey, Miranda. We cut that tape off in a couple hours, we need to worry about you sharing this little adventure with anyone? \u2019Cause that would put me in a real bad mood.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head violently.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Horse asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s a problem, we\u2019ll figure out something else for you. Saw an empty lot not too far from here. Wonder how long it\u2019ll take before some construction worker digs up your body.\u201d</p><p>Miranda grunted, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna assume that means you\u2019ll keep your mouth shut,\u201d Ruger said, sighing and rubbing the back of his neck. Muscles were way too tight back there. \u201cOh, somethin\u2019 else you should know. It\u2019s not just us you\u2019d be dealing with if you talk. There\u2019s a hundred and thirty-four brothers in the club. Generally, I\u2019m considered one of the nicer ones.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue story,\u201d Horse chimed in. \u201cFuck with us, we\u2019ll f**k you back. Harder. Always.\u201d</p><p>She nodded frantically.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Horse said. He glanced over at the man on the floor and then caught Ruger\u2019s eye. \u201cMight wanna tell your baby mama that the next time she has a run-in with a guy from another club, she should give us a heads-up before we go in. This could\u2019ve been ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get it\u2014not ink, not cuts, nothing. She may have seen his tats, but she didn\u2019t know what they meant. Tape,\u201d Ruger said. Horse tossed it over and Ruger crouched down next to the woman. \u201cLegs together, bitch. It\u2019ll be a new experience for you.\u201d</p> <p>She obeyed, and he started wrapping tape tight around her ankles.</p><p>\u201cYou were still in Afghanistan when Sophie and Zach\u2019s shit went down,\u201d Ruger told Horse. \u201cBut trust me, it got ugly, and we didn\u2019t exactly socialize after that. She hates me, she hates the club, and the only reason she puts up with the situation is that she loves Noah too much to take away the only man in his life. Sucks for him, but I\u2019m the best he\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like she\u2019s a bitch,\u201d Horse said. \u201cRumor is, you saved her ass. Fuckin\u2019 knight in shining armor. Might wanna trade your bike in for a pretty pink unicorn to ride, seein\u2019 as you\u2019re such a special snowflake and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up, ass**le,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cI saved her, but I also lost my shit on her in a big way, at a time she couldn\u2019t handle it. Not that it matters now. Long story short, she knows jack about club colors or how we live. She didn\u2019t mention the back patch because she\u2019s f**kin\u2019 clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could offer a suggestion?\u201d Horse asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta tell her what to expect, help her understand club life before she f**ks up again,\u201d he said. \u201cSave yourself an assload of trouble down the line. Trust me on this, bro. Breaking in a civilian like Sophie as your old lady is rough enough. Don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be. Also, she\u2019s got a helluva mouth on her. What happens in private is one thing, but she can\u2019t pull that kind of shit at the Armory. You know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Ruger snorted, dropping the tape as he finished wrapping Miranda\u2019s legs. Why had he brought Horse? Anyone would\u2019ve been less annoying ... even Painter, despite the fact the kid probably couldn\u2019t find his own dick in the shower, let alone pin down a woman.</p><p>Unfortunately, only Horse had been both sober and stupid enough to answer his phone in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll be hard for your tiny little brain to process, so listen carefully,\u201d Ruger said, rising to his feet and tossing the tape onto the couch. \u201cOne, she\u2019s not my baby mama, so stop calling her that. Only funny the first fifty times. Two, I\u2019m not plannin\u2019 to make her my property. I\u2019m helpin\u2019 out because she\u2019s Noah\u2019s mom and for all practical purposes he\u2019s my son. I\u2019ll keep an eye on her for his sake, but she\u2019s a free agent. I doubt she\u2019ll ever set foot in the Armory, no matter what I tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot bullshit,\u201d Ruger snapped. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me, ass**le. Trust me, I have reason to know this. Our history is f**kin\u2019 complicated\u2014way too complicated for a dumbass cocksucker like you to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou struck out,\u201d Horse declared, a slow grin stealing across his face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still drivin\u2019 across the state in the middle of the night so you can set her up in your house? You are well and truly screwed, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t strike out,\u201d Ruger replied, eyes narrow. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. And I don\u2019t think of her that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a suggestion for future reference, then,\u201d Horse said. \u201cTry jerking off before answering the door if you want me to believe you don\u2019t think of her that way. Wood like you were sportin\u2019 usually implies the opposite. Unless it was for me? If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m genuinely flattered. No judgments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Marie shot you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not in denial about what my c**k wants,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cI piss her off, I get no pu**y. Watch and learn. Now let\u2019s get them locked down and start hauling your girl\u2019s shit out to the truck. Jacks\u2019ll be here in a couple more hours, and I don\u2019t particularly care to stay and discuss techniques for removing dumbasses\u2019 ink with them. What kind of suicidal idiot doesn\u2019t black out his tats when his club cuts him loose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he joined the Devil\u2019s Jacks in the first place,\u201d Ruger replied, shrugging. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t say much for his intelligence. Hope he has health insurance. Probably gonna need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if he\u2019s lucky. So tell me, brother. How many times you seen The Notebook? \u2019Cause that\u2019s information the boys back home are gonna need to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>Noah slurped down his cereal, hopping in his chair like a bouncy ball.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Uncle Ruger\u2019s today, right? Do you think he has Skylanders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, we\u2019re going to Uncle Ruger\u2019s. No idea about the Skylanders, but I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d I replied. My rush of adrenaline had died down, making it harder to sustain any real anger. Instead I surveyed my studio and finally admitted the truth.</p><p>The place was a total shithole. Not only that, I had no excuse for not putting on the window alarms. They sold them at the Dollar Store, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like letting Ruger win, but reality was on his side. I was broke, I\u2019d lost my job, and I couldn\u2019t protect my own child. Waiting tables hadn\u2019t paid enough to support us anyway, and I wouldn\u2019t have been working there in the first place if I\u2019d had better offers. My folks certainly wouldn\u2019t help. I\u2019d been dead to them ever since I refused to \u201cterminate\u201d Noah.</p><p>Turning down a safe, free apartment would be insane.</p><p>I still wasn\u2019t quite ready to forgive Ruger, though. Intellectually that didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. Sure, he\u2019d been a dick to me. He\u2019d also dropped everything to drive hundreds of miles and save Noah when he\u2019d needed help. The two should probably balance each other out, if I wanted to be fair. Not only that, Ruger had made a point I couldn\u2019t shake.</p><p>I really didn\u2019t want to do my own dirty work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruger and Horse had assessed the situation, made a tough call, and fixed things. And that was a huge relief. Ultimately, I\u2019d gotten mad at Ruger for scaring me, not for scaring Miranda. Well, that and his bullying.</p><p>He could\u2019ve just talked to me about moving to Coeur d\u2019Alene instead of playing creeper man in the night.</p><p>\u201cWe have to pack before we leave,\u201d I said as Noah finished up his cereal. He carried his bowl carefully to the sink, spoon teetering. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just going for a visit, we\u2019ll be living there for a while. I\u2019m going to get most of your stuff, but I want you to pick out some jammies and clothes to wear tomorrow. Tuck them in your backpack. You should also grab some books to read in the car, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Noah replied, dragging his bag out from under his bed. He didn\u2019t seem bothered at the thought, which said a lot about our existence. He\u2019d moved at least once a year his entire life. I shook my head, feeling the familiar weight of guilt settle over me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t seem to get it right.</p> <p>I rinsed out his bowl and put on some coffee. Then I grabbed a box to start packing.</p><p>\u201cWant some music?\u201d I asked Noah.</p><p>\u201cMy pick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, handing him my phone. He plugged it into our little speaker set like an expert. Here Comes Science started playing, and after a few minutes we were both singing along about the elements and the elephants. As kid stuff went, it wasn\u2019t too bad. Beat the hell out of Disney crap.</p><p>We didn\u2019t actually own much, so packing wasn\u2019t hard. Coffee helped. Three boxes of stuff for Noah. Two boxes for me, plus a suitcase. I had to stand on a chair to take down our big tie-dyed wall hanging. We\u2019d made it together last summer, on one of those glorious days where the sun is so bright and beautiful you don\u2019t even consider making your kid go in at bedtime. I used it to wrap the framed family portrait I\u2019d splurged on when Noah was three.</p> <p>Then I looked around the room\u2014not much left. Just the kitchen and bathroom stuff ... Packing up two lives should take more than an hour, I thought wistfully. I decided to take a quick shower before clearing out the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open the door unless it\u2019s Uncle Ruger or his friend,\u201d I told Noah, emptying the coffeepot into my mug. \u201cYou cool with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child,\u201d he replied, offering me a look of genuine disgust. \u201cI\u2019ll be in second grade soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, seeing as you\u2019re an adult, you go ahead and finish up out here. Make sure I haven\u2019t missed something,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ll wash up fast.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and pulled off my clothes. The room was small, but at least we had a tub. Unfortunately, the hot-water situation wasn\u2019t too great\u2014one of the joys of living on the top floor of a building with shared boilers. I showered quickly, grabbing a towel as I stepped out, dripping all over my dirty laundry. I dried off and wrapped the towel around my head before reaching for my clean clothes. They weren\u2019t there. I\u2019d already packed them all up without giving it a second thought.</p><p>Well, crap.</p> <p>I heard Ruger\u2019s voice in the apartment. Wasn\u2019t that just perfect? I grabbed a second towel and wrapped it around my body, opening the door a crack.</p><p>\u201cNoah, can you come here?\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s downstairs with Horse. Wanted to help load the truck,\u201d Ruger answered. He strolled toward the bathroom, all lean and tall and full of controlled strength. A great big killer cat. He stopped outside the door and crossed his muscular arms, eyes dark with something I couldn\u2019t interpret. Memories of those arms around me earlier flashed through my head and I flushed ... Stupid. Ruger was a dead end, at least in terms of a relationship, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t want a booty call. Okay, that was a lie. I\u2019d love a good booty call. Just not with a guy I\u2019d still have to deal with ten years from now. My hormones needed to find something else to obsess about.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI forgot clean clothes,\u201d I told him, considering my strategy. \u201cYou mind stepping outside for a sec? I\u2019ll get dressed fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna give me crap about coming to Coeur d\u2019Alene?\u201d he asked, raising a brow in challenge. Great. I\u2019d gotten over my snit, but clearly he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna bitch me out for what happened next door?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fast turnaround.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of choice,\u201d I admitted, forcing myself not to grit my teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019d pick, but it\u2019s better than staying here. And you win\u2014I didn\u2019t want to do my own dirty work. I\u2019m glad you did it for me. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like it hurts.\u201d</p><p>It did hurt. The man was like a cheese grater on my skin.</p><p>\u201cJust let me grab something to wear, Ruger. You won. Don\u2019t rub it in.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the sound harsh.</p><p>\u201cGlad you figured that out,\u201d he said. \u201cLife\u2019s easier when you have help, like it or not. I\u2019ll dig something out for you. Suitcase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay\u2014\u201d I started, but he\u2019d already turned and grabbed the bag, flopping it on the now-naked bed to unzip it. I swallowed as he began digging around. Not that I had anything to hide, but I didn\u2019t like him touching my things. Way too intimate.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Ruger said, turning back toward me, dangling a black, lacy push-up bra from one finger. The side of his mouth twitched and those dark eyes warmed. \u201cYou should wear this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it down, Ruger,\u201d I told him. \u201cJust go outside. I\u2019ll find what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like these ones, too,\u201d he said, pulling out a pair of turquoise panties. \u201cThey\u2019d go good with the garter belt.\u201d</p><p>I bit back a groan. I might have a thing for pretty underwear, but I didn\u2019t need his input. Jerk. I checked my towel, making sure it was securely tucked in. Then I walked out of the bathroom, determined to get his hands off my panties.</p><p>\u201cJust put them down,\u201d I repeated as I moved across the floor. He turned toward me, eyes sweeping over my figure and pausing on my br**sts. I felt exposed and uncomfortable, which was silly. The towel covered more than most swimsuits. He had a hungry gleam in his eye, though\u2014one I refused to take as a compliment. We\u2019d already established that Ruger found me attractive on a basic, biological level.</p><p>Problem was, Ruger found every woman attractive on a basic, biological level. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I really didn\u2019t like this new dynamic between us. Things were more comfortable when Ruger treated me like a piece of unwanted furniture.</p><p>\u201cBut I like them,\u201d he said, examining the soft fabric with a smirk. I grabbed for the panties but he held them out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cI just got done convincing myself I\u2019ve been unfair to you,\u201d I told him, narrowing my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin it.\u201d</p><p>Ruger didn\u2019t say anything for several seconds. Then he stretched the panties between his hands like a rubber band and shot them at my face. I lurched to grab the silky blue missile. That\u2019s when the towel slipped and I flashed enough of myself to earn a damned fine collection of Mardi Gras beads.</p> <p>\u201cNice rack,\u201d Ruger told me. \u201cChecked out the rest of you before, but never those. Usually the other way around, now that I think of it. Tits before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a pig,\u201d I said, cutting him off as I jerked up the towel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll concede the point,\u201d he said, shrugging and stepping away from the suitcase. \u201cBut only if you wear that black bra. I liked the girls. They deserve something nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d I muttered, pissy mood back in full force.</p><p>I dug through my bag, pulling out a pair of ratty cutoffs. Then I spotted the super tight, super low-cut \u201cBarbie Is a Slut\u201d tank top my friend Carrie got me two years ago for Halloween, when we stayed with her folks in Olympia. We\u2019d taken Noah out trick-or-treating wearing friendly witch costumes early in the evening. Then we tucked him safely in bed at her mom\u2019s place and took ourselves out trick-or-drinking. I made out with three different guys at three different parties ... using three different names. We finished by eating our weight in chocolate chip pancakes at IHOP as the sun rose.</p> <p>Best. Night. Ever.</p><p>I pulled the tank out with a smile. Ruger wanted to treat me like one of his sluts? I could go there. I\u2019d let him perv on my boobs. All day. Publicly. Maybe I\u2019d flirt a little, too, but not with him. Nope, he could just suck it while I flashed the world. That would teach him to play with my panties.</p><p>I hoped his balls turned so blue they froze.</p><p>I ignored him as I took the shorts, tank, bra, and panties back to the bathroom and got dressed. I dried my hair and put on full war paint. Then I stepped out to find Horse and Noah were back.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom\u2014Horse has a dog named Ariel. Can we get a dog, too?\u201d Noah asked the instant he saw me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I replied. \u201cA dog\u2019s a lot of work. We should start smaller. Maybe a hamster. Let\u2019s ask Uncle Ruger if that\u2019s okay or if he thinks it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at Ruger, whose eyes were glued to my chest. I adjusted my tank, pulling it down just enough to expose the top of the bra he\u2019d requested.</p><p>He wanted to break our rules and bully me?</p><p>No problem. I was a big girl now, and I could fight back.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think, Uncle Ruger?\u201d I asked sweetly. \u201cIs it too much?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Despite his earlier breakfast, Noah had no trouble polishing off a full plate of pancakes, two slices of bacon, and a glass of orange juice.</p><p>Another growth spurt coming, I realized. That sucked. Seemed like I\u2019d just bought him new clothes a month ago. Every time I caught up, the kid got bigger.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d I asked him, leaning back in the booth. We\u2019d finished packing an hour ago, at which point Ruger and Horse kicked us out. Apparently we were getting in their way. Ruger handed me two twenties and told me to take Noah out for breakfast down the street, which made sense, given the long car ride ahead of us. I didn\u2019t like taking his money but I had to be practical. I couldn\u2019t afford to waste cash on something as frivolous as eating out.</p> <p>\u201cDone,\u201d Noah said, grinning at me. God, he was beautiful. His face still held a hint of the softness he\u2019d been born with, but his legs and arms were getting lanky. He liked his hair on the long side, so it hung shaggy around his face and shoulders. Not quite long enough for a ponytail, but close. People told me I should cut it. I figured it should be his choice. When he was older he\u2019d learn all about peer pressure and fitting in. For now I wanted him to enjoy the blissful freedom that comes from not giving a rat\u2019s ass about the world\u2019s opinions.</p><p>His skin was light, with a smattering of freckles across his nose and face. Sometimes I caught glimpses of myself or Zach in him, but not often. Noah was his own person, no question of that.</p><p>Kind of took after Ruger that way, I mused.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d I said, dropping some money on the table. I tipped the waitress nearly fifty percent\u2014she seemed overworked, and I knew how that felt. Also, it wasn\u2019t my money.</p><p>I texted Ruger as I left, wondering if we\u2019d killed enough time. He replied, telling me to give him another thirty minutes. We didn\u2019t have a park right by our apartment, but there was a lot about three blocks away that Noah liked running around in. I\u2019d heard it used to be a hangout for dealers and users, but a few years back yuppies had started moving into the neighborhood. Now about half of it was a community garden, and the rest was for the kids. Someone had built a wooden swing set. Murals on the sides of the buildings bordering the lot kept the place looking cheerful and bright.</p><p>It took us about ten minutes to reach the park, and Noah made the most of his time there. I ran laps with him around the edges, hoping to tire him out. It didn\u2019t work, of course. Then we headed back, popping into a used bookstore on the way to pick out something special for the car ride.</p><p>We found Horse, Ruger, and two guys I didn\u2019t recognize on the sidewalk outside the building. The newcomers wore leather vests that read \u201cDevil\u2019s Jacks\u201d across the back. Below that was a picture of a red devil and the word \u201cNomad.\u201d They were both tall guys, one bulky in a muscular way and the other long and lean in his strength. Both had dark hair. One raised his chin in silent greeting.</p><p>The men clearly appreciated my Barbie tank top. They were both attractive, but the tall one was actually almost pretty, he was so cute. He had floppy brown hair and hadn\u2019t shaved in a couple of days. He wore a battered Flogging Molly T-shirt with his faded jeans and leather boots. Both of them looked about my age.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, coming up to them, smiling. \u201cYou must be Ruger\u2019s friends? Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Sophie. This is my boy, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cGo wait in the car,\u201d he said, tossing me his keys.</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t my keys. Introduce me to your friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re my keys. Blue rig, right over there,\u201d he told me, nodding toward a large SUV across the street. \u201cCar. Now. Horse is gonna drive yours back to Coeur d\u2019Alene.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to argue, just on general principle. Then I caught Horse\u2019s eyes, which held a silent warning. He glanced toward Noah, then toward the strangers. That\u2019s when I finally caught the tension in the air\u2014their body language was far from friendly.</p><p>Oops. This wasn\u2019t a happy visit.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said, taking Noah\u2019s hand. I dragged him across the street and climbed into the big SUV waiting for us. Ruger had already installed a booster seat in the back. Noah\u2019s backpack sat next to it. I leaned over and stuck the keys in the ignition, then switched on the AC.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, Ruger came over and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cYou buckled in, little man?\u201d he asked as he popped the SUV into reverse.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Noah replied. \u201cThanks for grabbing my backpack. I\u2019m excited to see your house. Do you have Skylanders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot no idea what a Skylander is, kid,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we can get some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuger\u2014\u201d I started, but he cut me off.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Sophie,\u201d he said, glaring at me. \u201cNow I can\u2019t buy the kid a present? Shit, he\u2019s had a rough night. If I wanna buy him something, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was going to ask if I could take him upstairs to the bathroom before we leave,\u201d I replied, smiling sweetly. \u201cHe drank a big glass of juice at breakfast. We aren\u2019t going to get far without a pit stop.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s glare faded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s totally reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m a reasonable person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop at a restaurant or something,\u201d he said, pulling out. \u201cI don\u2019t want you going back upstairs. Hunter and Skid are up there now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHunter and Skid?\u201d I asked. \u201cThose the guys you were talking to on the sidewalk? Things seemed a little tense. What was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cClub business. I\u2019ll pull off when I see a good place to stop.\u201d</p><p>Predictably, Noah started begging for a kid\u2019s meal when we stopped at a fast-food place, especially when he saw they were Skylander-themed. He couldn\u2019t possibly be hungry, but Ruger ordered two of the overpriced little boxes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I told him as he carried them back to the car. \u201cThe food will go to waste. Noah is stuffed. Not to mention he already ate out earlier. He doesn\u2019t need unhealthy junk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for me,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cHe can have the toys, I\u2019ll take the food. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>As we pulled out and onto the freeway, Noah started telling Ruger all about the Skylanders. By now he was totally wired and it was a damned good thing he was belted in\u2014otherwise he might have jumped around until we crashed the car. He talked Skylanders as we cleared the city. He talked Skylanders as we passed North Bend. He talked Skylanders as we started up Snoqualmie Pass.</p><p>Poor Ruger. He had no idea how much conversational stamina Noah had ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a nap,\u201d I said, raising my arms and stretching, chest thrust out. I saw Ruger\u2019s eyes flick toward me, and they weren\u2019t looking at my face. Good. I wanted his balls so blue they stayed that way, because maybe that would teach him a lesson about changing the rules of our relationship without warning. I still had a crush on him, but he wasn\u2019t crushing on me at all.</p> <p>Nope.</p><p>Ruger was just horny.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he grunted. Noah rattled on in the background as I leaned my seat back and closed my eyes.</p><p>I woke slowly, feeling myself in motion and trying to remember where I was. I heard Noah talking and it came back to me. Ruger. Coeur d\u2019Alene. Packing. Miranda.</p><p>\u201cThen the Skylanders realized they needed the Giants if they wanted to defeat Kaos,\u201d Noah said to Ruger, his voice earnest.</p><p>\u201cYou still talking about Skylanders?\u201d I asked sleepily, turning to look at Noah. He was all smiles, clearly excited to have a captive audience.</p><p>\u201cYup. Still talkin\u2019 about Skylanders,\u201d Ruger said, his voice strained and his expression dark. I bit back a laugh. \u201cBeen talkin\u2019 about Skylanders nonstop. I think we ran out of new material a while ago, because now he\u2019s tellin\u2019 me the same shit over again. We\u2019re almost to Ellensburg. I want to pull off and buy one of those little DVD players for him to hold on his lap, and some headphones. We got almost three and half more hours. This might kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I get to have it in my room?\u201d Noah asked, his excitement kicking up a notch, voice growing shrill. \u201cI want lots of movies. I want to watch it every night. Mom doesn\u2019t let me watch very much TV and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for the car,\u201d Ruger snapped. Noah\u2019s face fell. Ruger glanced back in the mirror and grimaced. \u201cSorry, little man. Didn\u2019t mean to yell at you ... Uncle Ruger is kinda tired. Think we could keep it quiet until we get to the store? Please?\u201d</p><p>The poor man was clearly desperate. I bit my tongue, looking out the passenger-side window, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I started giggling. I couldn\u2019t help it. Soon Noah joined in, filling the car with his happy noise.</p><p>Ruger stared straight ahead at the road, face grim.</p><p>If I were a better woman, I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it so much.</p><p>I had to admit the silence was refreshing.</p><p>Noah was a fantastic kid, but his mouth didn\u2019t have an off switch. Ruger had gotten him a little DVD player that strapped to the back of the passenger seat and plugged into the car. Combined with Star Wars headphones and four new movies, the trip was already a thousand times more tolerable.</p><p>I waited until Ruger\u2019s fingers stopped clenching the steering wheel so hard they turned white before I opened the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward me.</p><p>\u201cNever good words, comin\u2019 from a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s not convenient,\u201d I replied, rolling my eyes. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to figure some things out. At least, I need to figure some things out. What\u2019s the plan once we\u2019re back in Coeur d\u2019Alene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving into my basement,\u201d he said. He reached back and rubbed his shoulder with one hand. \u201cShit, I\u2019m all knotted up here. That\u2019s what I get for driving all goddamned night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ignored the comment and pushed ahead.</p><p>\u201cI know the basement part,\u201d I continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to have to figure some other things out, too. Noah needs to get registered for school. It starts a week from tomorrow back home. Do you know when it starts in Coeur d\u2019Alene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what school he\u2019ll be going to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think about schools at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about anything other than getting him safe and hurtin\u2019 the f**kers who nearly killed him. That\u2019s fixed, so from here on out you\u2019re in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I muttered, leaning back in my seat. I put my bare feet up on the dashboard, knees bent. I enjoyed not having to drive. Noah and I weren\u2019t like most families, where the adults could take turns on a road trip. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that. The next thing to worry about is a job. You have any idea what the market is like right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the most helpful person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned this, babe,\u201d he replied. \u201cI got a phone call last night, I called Horse for backup and we left. That\u2019s it. Haven\u2019t had time to do a damned thing since then. If I\u2019d known about this shit ahead of time, I would\u2019ve hurt the f**kers preemptively. I\u2019m doin\u2019 this on the fly, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I felt my snark die. He was right, which wasn\u2019t fair. Again. Ruger was always right. It didn\u2019t make any sense, because so far as I could tell he lived life without a second thought for the future. I scrimped and saved and planned and worked, yet I still couldn\u2019t get any traction.</p><p>\u201cMight be able to arrange something for you with the club.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and frowned.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me and Noah,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI even appreciate what you and Horse did earlier. I don\u2019t care that it was a crime. But that\u2019s where I stop, Ruger. I don\u2019t want to get involved in any more illegal things. I won\u2019t be your drug runner or something.\u201d</p> <p>Ruger burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sophie,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the hell do you think I do all day? Fuck, my life\u2019s not even close to that interesting.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a gunsmith and security expert,\u201d he continued, shaking his head. \u201cThis should not be a surprise to you, seein\u2019 as I\u2019ve wired up your apartments over and over. I spend most of my time repairing firearms in a perfectly legal shop the club runs. I design and install custom security systems on the side, \u2019cause I get off on that shit. Lotta rich f**kers with summer homes on the lake. All of \u2019em need security and I\u2019m more\u2019n happy to take their money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014they let a motorcycle gang run a gun shop?\u201d I asked, startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that part. I\u2019ll bet the cops love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, we\u2019re a club, not a gang,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the store is technically owned by one guy. Slide. Been a brother for fifteen years. But we all pitch in and it\u2019s a group effort. Having him hold the deed makes the paperwork easier, given the type of business. I apprenticed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this gun shop is one hundred percent above the table?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cAnd people actually pay you to install their security. Aren\u2019t they afraid you\u2019ll be the one breaking in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m damned good at what I do,\u201d he replied, smiling. \u201cNot exactly forcing \u2019em to hire me. You want to see the gun shop, come check it out. Check out any of the businesses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have more than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a strip club, a pawnshop, and a garage,\u201d he said. \u201cLot of the guys work in those, but we got civilian employees, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you see me doing, if I worked for the Reapers?\u201d I asked, considering the strip club.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we need,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cNot even sure there\u2019s an opening. We\u2019ll have to check and see. But it\u2019d be good for you. Got health care plans and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you guys don\u2019t do anything illegal? It\u2019s all legitimate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d tell you if we were doing something illegal?\u201d he asked, sounding genuinely curious.</p><p>\u201cUm, no?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what I tell you anyway, because you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Club business is for club members. Seeing as you\u2019re not a member, it\u2019s not your problem. All you need to know is I\u2019m trying to help you here. If there\u2019s a job you\u2019re qualified for, it\u2019ll be yours. If not, no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuger, don\u2019t take this personally, but I don\u2019t want to work for your club at all, even if there\u2019s an opening,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve never wanted anything to do with the Reapers. You and Horse helped me and I appreciate it, but nothing\u2019s changed. I don\u2019t agree with your lifestyle. I don\u2019t want Noah around your friends, either. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good environment for a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never even met them. Kinda judgmental, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, looking away. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to do the best I can for Noah, and hanging out with a bunch of criminals isn\u2019t part of that. I don\u2019t believe for a minute that there isn\u2019t something shady going on with you guys.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s hands tightened on the steering wheel. Great. Now I\u2019d insulted him.</p><p>\u201cConsidering your folks haven\u2019t talked to you in seven years, your son\u2019s father needs a restraining order, and you can\u2019t hold down a job or provide for your child, seems to me like you aren\u2019t in a position to be calling us anything,\u201d he told me, voice tight. Friendly Ruger was gone. \u201cLotta things happen at the clubhouse. Some of those things run deep, no question. Might scare you. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing. When one of our own is in trouble, we don\u2019t kick \u2019em out in the street. More than I can say about your daddy. He\u2019s the model citizen and we\u2019re the criminals, but shit goes down, I can count on my brothers. You got anyone you can say that about? Besides me? Because deep down in my heart, in my guts, in my f**kin\u2019 DNA, I\u2019m a Reaper, Sophie. Still sure we aren\u2019t good enough for you?\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath, hating how my eyes filled with moisture. Bringing up my folks was a cheap shot. I tried to ignore the tears, refusing to blink and let them fall. Then my nose started running and I sniffed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was low, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was true, Sophie. You wanna be all high and mighty, you need to find another target. Your ass is gettin\u2019 saved by me, and behind me stands the club. If you were with the Reapers, Noah\u2019d be surrounded by adults who care about him. Lot of kids in the club, Soph. They go home when things get wild, but lemme tell you\u2014somethin\u2019 like this happened in Coeur d\u2019Alene to one of our kids, I\u2019d have to fight my brothers for the privilege of killin\u2019 the guy. That\u2019s family, Sophie. And Noah could use some of that family around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t talk,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut listen up. I get that you don\u2019t want to be part of club life. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not gonna force the point, because if you\u2019re gonna be a stuck-up bitch I wouldn\u2019t want you around them anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up and listen,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThis is important. Love the club, hate the club, you need to be aware of a few things, because they\u2019re part of your reality now. The ass**le that hurt Noah, you saw the ink on his back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, wishing him straight to hell.</p><p>\u201cCalled a back patch,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s his club colors, right on his skin. Club colors are what we wear on our cuts\u2014our vests, call \u2019em rags, too\u2014and they say a lot about a man. In this case, those colors said he was part of the Devil\u2019s Jacks. Lotta MCs out there, good and bad, but the Jacks are one of the worst. Reapers and Jacks are enemies. Things worked out this time, but you run into a guy with colors like that again, you need to tell me. I\u2019ll still go after him, but I\u2019ll call in more backup first. This morning it all worked out. Next time it might not. You got me?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, looking away. Ruger growled in frustration.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you get me, Soph,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me tell you a little story. Got a brother named Deke, down in the Portland chapter. Deke\u2019s got a niece named Gracie\u2014his old lady\u2019s sister\u2019s kid. She had jack shit to do with the Reapers, by the way. So Gracie went off to college down in northern Cali three years ago and started dating a guy who turned out to be a hangaround with the Jacks.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him, unnerved. He stared straight ahead, face grim.</p><p>\u201cSo little Gracie went to a party with him and a bunch of guys raped her, one right after the next,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ever heard of a train?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, some women are down with that,\u201d he continued. \u201cGracie isn\u2019t one of them, and they were not gentle. They tore her up so bad she\u2019ll never have kids. Then they carved a \u2018DJ\u2019 into her forehead and dumped her in a ditch. Deke found out when they sent him pictures they took of her with her own f**kin\u2019 phone. Tried to kill herself. She\u2019s doin\u2019 better now, engaged to one of the brothers in the Portland chapter. Did I mention they aren\u2019t nice guys?\u201d</p><p>He fell silent. I thought about the two men I\u2019d met earlier, Hunter and Skid.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the men who did it?\u201d I asked hesitantly. \u201cWere they ... were those guys you were talking to ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was four hangarounds and two Jacks,\u201d he told me. \u201cGood news is, they won\u2019t be hurtin\u2019 any more girls. Hunter and Skid weren\u2019t part of that particular mess, which still doesn\u2019t qualify them as decent human beings. So let me ask you again\u2014you got me, Soph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered, feeling sick.</p><p>Silence fell. Noah started laughing at his video in the backseat. Ruger drove, jaw muscle tight, staring straight ahead. Gracie\u2019s story played over and over in my head, along with what he\u2019d said earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a stuck-up bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoulda fooled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a right to keep my son away from your club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you left Coeur d\u2019Alene?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know damned well why I left Coeur d\u2019Alene,\u201d I said, hating him. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve called me a bitch. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I replied, frustrated. I crossed my arms. The motion pushed my br**sts up high. His eyes caught on them in the rearview mirror and I dropped my arms, tugging up my tank.</p><p>What a stupid game I\u2019d been playing that morning.</p><p>Ruger wasn\u2019t a boy I could tease by dressing like a slut. I didn\u2019t want his attention, or to get more involved in his world.</p><p>I\u2019d never be more than a toy to him, and the men in his family had a history of breaking their toys.</p><p>They just did it in different ways.</p><p>Ruger didn\u2019t actually live in Coeur d\u2019Alene. He lived west of town in Post Falls, back in the hills near the Washington border at the end of a private gravel road. We pulled up to his place around five that evening, Horse behind us. The driveway widened into a large parking area behind an L-shaped, two-story cedar house overlooking a small valley. The setting was fantastic. Evergreens surrounded us, and I heard the trickle of a stream somewhere not too far away. A strip of grass ran down the hillside around to the front. It looked like it needed water, and given the yard\u2019s condition, I got the impression Ruger liked his landscaping natural.</p><p>Noah bounded out of the car, running around the house in excitement. I stretched up high as I stood, pulling the tank up with me, exposing my stomach. I felt Ruger\u2019s eyes touch me, cool and speculative, and I quickly pulled it back down.</p><p>Really, really stupid idea, that tank.</p><p>What the hell had I been thinking? You don\u2019t pull a tiger\u2019s tail. I\u2019d spent years wishing Ruger would notice me, just once. Now I needed him to unnotice me and start treating me like furniture again. Life as furniture might not be exciting, but it was definitely safe.</p><p>\u201cYour car needs a tune-up,\u201d Horse said, walking over to us. He tossed me the keys and I caught them, chest jiggling precariously. Horse eyed me, then smirked at Ruger, who watched us with something like disgust. \u201cI\u2019ll help haul your shit in, then I\u2019ll head home to Marie. She\u2019s startin\u2019 school day after tomorrow. Want to enjoy some time with her before she gets all stressed out and bitchy.\u201d</p><p>Ruger walked to the door, which sat kitty-corner from the three-car garage forming one side of the \u201cL.\u201d A narrow band of deck followed the line of the house around to the front. He punched in a code, opened the door, and we went inside. There he put in another code, because apparently one wasn\u2019t enough for Mr. Security-Is-Critically-Important. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked in and my mouth dropped open.</p><p>I fell in love with the house instantly.</p><p>Before me was a great room with a giant, prow-shaped bank of windows looking out across the valley. The place wasn\u2019t huge, but it was definitely big enough to impress me. To the right was a door that had to lead into the garage. To the left was an open-plan kitchen with a breakfast bar. A separate dining area held a table. Dishes littered the counter, and a smattering of empty beer bottles stood on the bar, which separated the kitchen from the main room. A stone fireplace lined one wall in the living room, and a sweeping staircase snaked upward along the other.</p><p>Forgetting all about the men, I walked slowly forward to take in the view. Directly in front of the house was a broad meadow, ringed by evergreens lower on the slope. The valley lay beyond that, stunning and sweeping. Here and there I saw other houses, a mix of high-end, new construction and original farms. I looked up to see that the ceiling vaulted all the way to the second story. Behind me was a loft. A pile of dirty laundry had been shoved against the open railing, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p> <p>Ruger had never been much of a housekeeper.</p><p>The living room needed attention, too. The leather couches seemed to be relatively new, as did the rest of the furniture, but for all the care he took to keep things clean it could\u2019ve been a frat house. There was even an empty pizza box on the coffee table.</p><p>I heard a beer top pop and turned to find the men standing in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYour house is almost as disgusting as the Armory,\u201d Horse said to Ruger.</p><p>\u201cLike yours used to be?\u201d Ruger asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember that,\u201d Horse replied, his expression innocent.</p><p>\u201cJust be glad you have Marie around. Otherwise you\u2019d be livin\u2019 this way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never gross like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I said, smiling at Ruger, my earlier frustration forgotten. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe how gorgeous his place was. I had no idea what the basement looked like, but it could be a spider hole and I\u2019d still be thrilled, just for the location. Not to mention the yard for Noah. \u201cBut how did you get a house like this? I mean, it had to cost a fortune. How much land do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen acres,\u201d he said, a shadow crossing his face. \u201cI bought it in March. Used my share of Mom\u2019s estate for the down payment.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head, stunned. Ruger\u2019s mother, Karen, had been disabled in a car accident a couple years before I met her. She\u2019d been living on disability by the time I came along, pinching every penny. I\u2019d never forget the sacrifices she made when she brought me into her home.</p> <p>I\u2019d also never forget the betrayal on her face when I moved out after sending her stepson to jail.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Why was she living so poor if she could afford something like this? Why did you let her?\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened.</p><p>\u201cThey finally settled,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all those years, f**kin\u2019 insurance company finally offered us a settlement. Too late. It went into the estate and I used my half to buy this place.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Zach got the other half?\u201d I asked, swaying. \u201cHe\u2019s got money like this and he still stopped paying his child support?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like it,\u201d Ruger replied, his voice tight. \u201cRemember what you asked me earlier? You really surprised by anything Zach does? Mom never thought she\u2019d leave anything but bills. Estate planning wasn\u2019t a priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard,\u201d I whispered, stunned. \u201cWe\u2019re starving and he\u2019s off spending your mom\u2019s money ... She\u2019d be so pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to argue with that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMarrying his dad was the stupidest thing she ever did, and I\u2019ve been payin\u2019 for it ever since. Zach\u2019s a f**kin\u2019 weight around my neck. Everything he touches turns to shit, and then I\u2019m stuck haulin\u2019 out his garbage. Again.\u201d</p><p>I felt like he\u2019d just punched me in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you feel about me and Noah?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>RUGER</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d said that. At least Noah hadn\u2019t heard it.</p><p>Sophie, though ... Jesus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna start unloading the car,\u201d Horse said. Coward.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel that way, Sophie. Believe me,\u201d Ruger said, and he meant it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only f**kin\u2019 thing he ever did that\u2019s worth a damn. I\u2019m crazy about Noah, you know that. And we don\u2019t always get along, but you\u2019re important to him and that makes you pretty f**kin\u2019 important to me.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a quavering smile, and to his horror he saw the glint of tears in her eyes. Not good. Ruger could handle Sophie pissed off, but crying?</p><p>No. Fuck no.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you your place,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cDownstairs. You got your own French doors down there, private entrance. It\u2019s pretty. You can use the front door, too, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured. Ruger walked across the kitchen to the basement door. He opened it, leaning in to turn on the light, holding it open for Sophie. He followed her down the steps, feeling like a dick. Then he felt like a bigger dick, because instead of thinking about ways to make things better, he checked out her rather fine ass.</p><p>Damn woman had been driving him crazy all day.</p><p>Her tits practically jumped out of that tank of hers, and the cutoffs had to be ten years old, the fabric was so worn and thin. They were tight, too, which matched his theory about their age. Sophie wasn\u2019t fat, but she\u2019d put on some weight since high school. In fact, she\u2019d filled out far too nicely for his comfort. Having her in the house would be a living hell. Hell already. He couldn\u2019t see her legs without imagining them wrapped around his waist. When she\u2019d propped them up on the dash earlier, he\u2019d almost crashed the goddamned car.</p><p>He thought about that morning, on the couch in her apartment. His c**k grew bigger with the memory, and he hoped to hell she wouldn\u2019t notice, because he\u2019d been right about one thing. Sophie really could be a stuck-up bitch, and he didn\u2019t doubt for a minute she\u2019d use his attraction against him. She might want to f**k him\u2014and he knew she did, she\u2019d been as into it as he had\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean she thought he was good enough for her.</p><p>Fuck, she was probably right about that one.</p><p>Screwing her would kick ass. But after that? Things would get weird. Ruger wasn\u2019t interested in settling down with any woman, but if he ever did, she\u2019d be different from Sophie. She\u2019d fit in with the club, for one thing. She\u2019d be the kind of girl who knew how to crack a beer at the end of a long day, kick back, and then give him a blow job before bed. She\u2019d love riding on the back of his bike, she\u2019d be blonde, and she\u2019d be tough enough to hold her own in a fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most important, she wouldn\u2019t f**king talk back to him. Sophie had a hell of a mouth.</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Sophie said, stopping him dead at the bottom of the stairs. He looked at her to find all traces of wistful sorrow gone. Instead she smiled big at him, clearly thrilled with something or other. Damn, woman\u2019s moods changed so f**king fast, a man couldn\u2019t even begin to keep up. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. How did you get everything ready so quickly?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, then looked around, shocked.</p><p>What the f**k?</p> <p>When he\u2019d left that morning, the place had been clean-ish. Not because he\u2019d cleaned it, of course, but because one of the girls from the clubhouse had a few weeks ago for some reason. Trying to hook him for her old man, probably. He\u2019d f**ked her and kicked her out, because he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let one of those bitches get their claws into him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t sort of clean now, though. It f**king sparkled.</p><p>This was supposed to be a family room, with a small kitchen built into the back for reasons he\u2019d never bothered to consider. There was a short hallway to the side, with two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a utility room. He used one of the bedrooms for storage, the other as a place for his friends to crash. Never once had it looked or felt like a home.</p><p>Someone had come in and fixed all that.</p><p>Softy, fuzzy-looking blankets were draped across the couches, and a spiral rag rug full of bright colors covered the center of the beige carpet. There were fresh flowers on the coffee table, right in front of the wall of glass looking out over the valley. French doors opened onto the little patio under the ground-floor deck. Two loungers covered in big, soft pillows sat ready and waiting for use outside, framed on either side by cascading hanging baskets.</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t been there that morning.</p><p>There were even more fresh flowers on the pretty blue-checked cloth covering the round table near the kitchen. A goddamn mystery table, because he had no f**king clue where it came from. Even the windows looked different. He studied them, then realized they had new blinds and long, gauzy curtains.</p><p>Then he saw the TV. A flat-screen sat on what looked like an old-fashioned wooden radio, which he had to admit was kind of cool and different. Not a huge TV, but plenty big for the space. Sophie darted down the hallway, sadness forgotten. He understood her sudden happiness, because right now the basement looked a lot more comfortable and welcoming than his space upstairs.</p><p>\u201cRuger, I can\u2019t believe this!\u201d she said called from one of the rooms. He walked in to find a child\u2019s bed, dresser, and bookshelf set up and ready to go, complete with a motorcycle-covered blanket and pillowcase. The walls had been painted light blue and little pictures that matched the blanket edged the ceiling. One wall had a big, black square painted on it, with the words \u201cNoah\u2019s Room\u201d written on it in chalk. \u201cNoah is going to love this. Thank you so much!\u201d</p><p>Sophie launched herself at him. Ruger wrapped his arms around her automatically, confused as hell. Shit, she felt good. His dick jumped to full-on attention and he sniffed her hair, wondering what it\u2019d feel like wrapped around his fingers while she sucked him off.</p><p>Sophie stiffened, obviously feeling his hard cock, and tried to pull away. He slid his hands down to her ass, holding her tight as he studied her face. Her tits pressed tight against his chest and he felt her ni**les harden. She wanted this as bad as he did. Fuck, her lips were big and soft and pink.</p> <p>He wanted to bite them.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Noah called. \u201cMom, where are you? I can\u2019t believe this, there\u2019s a stream and a little pool to play in. Ruger\u2019s got four-wheelers, too. Horse says they\u2019ll take us on a ride sometime!\u201d</p><p>Ruger jerked away from Sophie.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered, eyes wide. \u201cThis is breaking the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, which was a goddamn shame. For four years they\u2019d played this game, pretending the other didn\u2019t exist. It\u2019d been the right thing to do. Sometimes they\u2019d played it so well he almost believed it. That\u2019s what his nephew needed from them, not some sort of bullshit one-night stand ruining things.</p><p>Ruger could get laid anytime\u2014Noah only had one mom.</p><p>The kid ran in and stopped, eyes wide as he took everything in.</p><p>\u201cIs this my room?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cLooks like it. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a room like this. Mom, you gotta see the yard!\u201d</p><p>He tore off again. Then Horse stuck his head in, offering Ruger a shit-eating grin.</p><p>\u201cNice, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should talk,\u201d Ruger said to him, jerking his chin toward the living room. Sophie took the opportunity to dart through the door and investigate the second bedroom.</p><p>Horse nodded, and Ruger followed him out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k happened here?\u201d Ruger asked, keeping his voice low.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Horse said. \u201cMarie. She and the girls came over to fix the place up. All of \u2019em. I asked her to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want your baby mama and kid to feel good about stayin\u2019 here, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaybe feel safe and welcome? Chicks need that. Figured it would make life easier. Not only that\u2014made the girls happy to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA heads-up would\u2019ve been appreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were too busy pretending you don\u2019t wanna f**k Sophie,\u201d he replied, shrugging. \u201cSomeone needed to step in. Marie charged everything, by the way. I told her to leave the receipts for you upstairs, on the counter. You can give me a check now or I\u2019ll catch you later.\u201d</p><p>Ruger froze.</p><p>\u201cFuck, didn\u2019t think of that,\u201d he said, looking around again, appraising things with new eyes. How much did TVs cost, anyway? He glanced back at Horse, whose shit-eating grin had grown to full-on mockery.</p><p>Oh, crap ...</p><p>\u201cYou did this on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cYou did it just to f**k with me, didn\u2019t you? Like you give a flyin\u2019 fuck about welcoming Sophie. You know I can\u2019t take it back now. How much did Marie spend, ass**le?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her to keep it under three grand,\u201d Horse replied innocently. \u201cAnd I think she got most of the furniture used. You know Marie, never spends money unless she has to. Hell, you don\u2019t even have to pay her back, it\u2019s not like you told her to do it. I\u2019ll cover the bill if you won\u2019t. Not every man provides for his family\u2014takes all kinds. I get that ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cocksucking bastard,\u201d Ruger said, advancing on him.

Ruger turned to find the kid standing in the open patio door, looking proud as hell.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he heard Sophie gasp. He spun around to find her bracing a hand against the wall at the entrance of the hallway. Fuckin\u2019 perfect, because they really needed more to fight about, right? \u201cRuger, you can\u2019t say things like that around Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna have to work on that mouth of yours, brother,\u201d Horse told him. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna make Sophie mad. Like I said earlier, pretty sure she could take you in a fair fight. I\u2019d pay to see it, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Ruger said to him, jerking his head toward the stairs. \u201cJust get the f**k out. Go home before I shoot you.\u201d</p><p>Sophie opened her mouth. Ruger turned and stopped her with one look. Enough.</p><p>\u201cThis is my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk however the f**k I want, and you\u2019ll keep your goddamned mouth shut. Got me?\u201d</p><p>She gaped as he turned and stomped back up the stairs. Behind him, he heard Noah chanting, \u201cFuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>He needed a beer.</p> <p>Make that a shot.</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>Noah glared at me like an angry leprechaun. He sat in time out on our couch, thanks to repeated use of his new favorite word.</p><p>I popped a beer and raised it in a silent toast to the women who\u2019d come to clean, decorate, and fix us food. I\u2019d been serious when I told Ruger I didn\u2019t want to spend time with the club, but what they\u2019d done for me was enough to make me reconsider.</p><p>At the very least, I\u2019d need to make an appearance to say thanks. They even left me a card and a long welcome letter full of important information, everything from their cell-phone numbers to the address of Noah\u2019s new school.</p><p>This was particularly important, because school would be starting on Monday, a full week earlier than back in Seattle. In addition to stocking the basics, they\u2019d left me a pan of taco meat and all the fixings, ready to heat and serve. Thank God for that, because there was no way in hell I was going upstairs in search of food.</p> <p>In fact, I had no intention of going upstairs at all, not without an invitation. I\u2019d use the patio door. Safer that way. Not that I was still mad at Ruger\u2014this was so much better than our old place that not even I could hold a grudge at this point. Nope, by then I was more scared of him, because the rules kept changing and I wasn\u2019t sure where we stood.</p><p>Drinking one of the beers helpfully stocked in my fridge helped me relax a little.</p><p>Most of our stuff was still out in the car. Ruger and Horse had done the heavy lifting at my old place, but I could handle unloading by myself. Not like we owned much anyway. I figured I could start hauling things down tomorrow, feeling pleased that I\u2019d had Noah pack jammies for the road. No pressure to find his clothes tonight.</p><p>The one thing I would not be doing was asking Ruger for help.</p><p>Things were weird enough already.</p><p>I heated the tacos and grabbed a couple of plates (the kitchen was fully stocked\u2014just Corelle, nothing fancy, but it looked new to me).</p><p>\u201cYou ready to make good choices?\u201d I asked Noah.</p><p>He glowered at me and crossed his arms.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to eat,\u201d I told him. I filled my plate, grabbed a second beer, and walked over to the doors, opening them wide and stepping out to one of the loungers. I sat down with crossed legs, setting my plate on the pillow in front of me. Then I took a bite.</p><p>Holy shit, that tasted good after a long day.</p><p>\u201cThis is really yummy!\u201d I called to Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s your favorite. Lots of cheese and no tomatoes. Too bad you aren\u2019t hungry.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t respond, but I heard the scrape of a chair on the deck overhead. I looked up to see the shadow of someone above, through the cracks in the decking. I waited for Ruger to say something. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>I finished one taco and considered the second. Noah would be impossible if he didn\u2019t eat, but I couldn\u2019t let him get away with defying me like that, either. Time for the big guns.</p><p>\u201cNoah, you sure you don\u2019t want a taco?\u201d I called. \u201cI\u2019m halfway done, and when I finish I\u2019m putting the food away. Nothing but plain bread after that if you get hungry. Not only that, they left pie and ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then the chair above scraped again, and I heard footsteps as Ruger walked across the deck. Great. I hoped my yelling wasn\u2019t pissing him off even more. I couldn\u2019t get that garbage comment out of my head. I polished off my beer, bracing myself for battle on two fronts.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pie?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cLooked like berries to me,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to warm mine up before I put the ice cream on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he replied. I allowed myself just a few seconds to gloat before I walked back inside, face stern.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019ll make better choices next time. Can I make my own taco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t use bad words like that,\u201d I told him seriously. \u201cYou say that at school, you\u2019ll get in really big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can Uncle Ruger say them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s not in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Kid had a point.</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t fair. Make your taco.\u201d</p><p>I was digging through the fridge for the milk when I heard a light knock on the outside door.</p><p>\u201cUncle Ruger!\u201d Noah called. \u201cWe\u2019re eating tacos. Do you want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he replied. I straightened and turned toward him, wondering if he was still upset with me. I couldn\u2019t quite figure out how he\u2019d been the one to teach Noah to say \u201cfuck,\u201d yet I\u2019d gotten in trouble.</p><p>Of course, there were all sorts of things I\u2019d never figured out about Ruger.</p><p>He came in and I handed him a plate warily, waving toward the food. He didn\u2019t smile at me, but he didn\u2019t scowl, either. I decided to take it as a positive sign.</p><p>\u201cYou made all this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNope, the girls from your club did,\u201d I told him, figuring it was always good to make peace over food. And I definitely wanted peace with him, for both Noah\u2019s sake and my own.</p><p>Maybe we could just forget today and start over tomorrow?</p><p>I decided I liked that idea a lot. I grabbed two more beers and handed him one, smiling hesitantly. \u201cI found it all in the fridge. I still can\u2019t believe they pulled everything together in one day. Thank you so much\u2014I had no idea you were planning something like this. I\u2019m blown away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grunted, not bothering to look at me. Okay, guess we were back to him treating me like furniture.</p><p>Because I\u2019m a perverse bitch, I didn\u2019t like it. Stupid, right?</p><p>\u201cYou want to bring your food upstairs?\u201d he asked us. \u201cI\u2019ve got a table on the deck. Hell of a view, and we\u2019ll be able to watch the sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, surprised. Guess he wanted to make peace, too. Thank God for that\u2014neither of us had anything to gain from a cold war. And this really was nicer than any place Noah and I had ever lived. I liked the idea of having access to the deck ... so long as Ruger didn\u2019t turn on me again. Would I ever get to the point where being around him wasn\u2019t hard to handle?</p> <p>Yes, I told myself. I\u2019d force myself to do it. For Noah\u2019s sake.</p><p>Dinner went better than expected. Noah talked the whole time, which smoothed the way for me and Ruger. I finished my food and then went and grabbed us some more beer, refilling Noah\u2019s glass of milk while I was at it. Eventually Noah got bored and headed down the stairs on the side of the deck to run around. By then I\u2019d had enough alcohol to feel slightly less awkward, and Ruger seemed to be in a good place, too. I dragged my chair away from the table to the deck rail, propping my feet up against the railing. He went back into the house and started some music, a mix of old and new stuff.</p><p>We each drank another beer as the sun grew low in the sky. I went from feeling good to feeling f**king fantastic all around.</p><p>Noah needed bed, so I took him down and gave him a quick shower. Poor kid was dead on his feet, falling asleep before I finished his story. I decided to go back upstairs and sit on the deck awhile longer. I liked a little time away from Noah every day, which had been hard to get in our last couple of apartments. This was different, though. Noah could be safe while I had space.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I called as I climbed back up to the deck. \u201cYou mind if I sit up here for a while longer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat it\u2019s for,\u201d Ruger said. He stood at the railing, leaning forward on his elbows and looking out across his kingdom. He must\u2019ve gone in and taken a shower while I was putting Noah to bed, because his hair was damp. He\u2019d changed into a pair of worn flannel lounge pants that hung low enough to expose his hipbones.</p><p>Maybe I was projecting one of my dirtier fantasies, but I was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t wearing anything under those pants, either.</p><p>They certainly gave me a nice, defined view of his ass.</p><p>The look worked for him in a big way. Ruger was all lean and muscular, with a six-pack that tapered down nicely and biceps that were a work of art. Oh, wow. One of his ni**les was pierced, too. I\u2019d never seen that before. His pecs were broad and hard, large enough to be hot without venturing into man-boob territory. And his tattoos ...</p><p>I\u2019d always wondered about his tattoos.</p><p>His back was all Reapers MC, but his arms and shoulders had ink, too. I wanted to study them up close, but that seemed sort of rude. Also, I couldn\u2019t quite get my eyes to focus.</p> <p>I settled for standing next to him, leaning forward against the rail.</p><p>\u201cWant another beer?\u201d he asked. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d I replied. I\u2019d had slightly more than enough, actually. I\u2019d swayed climbing the stairs, and to be honest, I needed to either lean on the rail or sit. I felt my cheeks warm, and then I giggled.</p><p>Ruger glanced at me, raising his brows in silent question.</p><p>I giggled again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty buzzed,\u201d I admitted, smiling at him. \u201cGuess the beer hit me a little harder than I thought. Been that kind of day. Not enough food, not enough sleep. You know how it goes.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at me, and damn, he was beautiful. He\u2019d definitely taken out some of his piercings, though.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you have less metal in your face now?\u201d I asked, my sense of tact lost along with my sobriety. \u201cIt makes you look less scary and more human.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, raising his brows.</p><p>\u201cI pulled most of \u2019em out last winter,\u201d he said. \u201cStarted boxing, and they aren\u2019t so good for that.\u201d</p><p>Huh. I didn\u2019t know what to say about that. My eyes caught on the ring he\u2019d left on the lower left side of his lip. I wondered how it would feel if I kissed him there, maybe sucked it into my mouth. I\u2019d tug on it with my teeth and then attack the rest of his\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re drunk,\u201d he said, startling me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk,\u201d I told him, indignant. \u201cI\u2019m buzzed. Perfectly okay ... just ... happy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then leaned over to whisper in my ear.</p><p>\u201cGet much happier, you\u2019re gonna pass out. Then imagine what I could do to you.\u201d</p><p>That was pretty funny, and I found myself giggling harder.</p><p>\u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d I asked, feeling daring. I\u2019d been trying to figure him out all day. Why hadn\u2019t I just asked? I\u2019d been afraid to talk about our relationship before now, but I couldn\u2019t remember why. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t understand you, Ruger. Half the time you seem to hate me and then it all changes. Keeps flipping back and forth. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. My eye caught on the piercing there, too. I wondered how much that hurt. Of course, it was nothing compared to his tattoos. My eyes dropped back down to his lips. They were full and way too soft for a guy, which I knew for a fact because they\u2019d been all over my neck earlier.</p><p>Yup, I\u2019d definitely suck on those, given the chance. I\u2019d suck on them for a good long time.</p><p>Then I\u2019d start moving down, trying out that pierced nipple on the way down to his cock. Was it as big and built as the rest of him? I wanted to know, desperately. I swayed again, feeling heat rise up through me, ni**les hardening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to flirt with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh. Now that was a buzzkill.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d I said, sighing. What a shame. I wanted to sleep with Ruger. I really did. Or hell, anyone, for that matter. My rule about only dating safe guys I could control didn\u2019t lead to much in the way of action. Maybe I should revisit those guidelines ... \u201cI don\u2019t get to flirt enough. I spend all my time working and taking care of Noah. It\u2019s kind of tiring, Ruger. I\u2019d like to meet someone, you know?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, looking straight ahead. A little muscle in his jaw clenched. If I\u2019d been just a little braver, I\u2019d have leaned over and licked his jawline. He had just enough of a five o\u2019clock shadow that it\u2019d be nice and rough under my tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he said, closing his eyes. \u201cDespite what happened this morning, I\u2019m not trying to start something with you, Sophie. You realize how f**ked things would get if we started screwing each other? I\u2019m not looking for a relationship and I\u2019m not a one-woman man. We gotta work together for Noah. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. I did know it. Stupid beer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, turning away from him to look out across the valley. He\u2019d really found a hell of a place. I still couldn\u2019t believe how great our new home was.</p><p>Felt great to really relax, too, let it all out.</p> <p>\u201cNoah has to come first, we can agree on that one. I just want to get laid, though. Do you think any of the guys in your club are available? I don\u2019t want a boyfriend, just a friend with benefits. Someone I can f**k and then ditch, guilt-free, when it gets old.\u201d</p><p>Ruger made a choking noise and I glanced over at him, concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want anything to do with the club,\u201d he said, his voice strained. \u201cHow did you go from that to friends with benefits so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think I might give the club a chance,\u201d I replied. Maybe the Reapers would be all right\u2014and the more I considered the whole friend-with-benefits thing, the more I liked the idea. I never got to have sex. I was twenty-four years old, for God\u2019s sake. I should get to have sex!</p> <p>\u201cThey did some really nice things for me today. Horse left home in the middle of the night to help someone he didn\u2019t even know. And those girls ... They must\u2019ve worked for hours, getting everything ready for us. Just the furniture is amazing, let alone leaving dinner ready to go. I think the stencils are still wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus f**kin\u2019 Christ.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought you wanted me to get to know your friends in the club. And seriously\u2014I deserve to get laid. I\u2019ve earned it!\u201d</p><p>Ruger straightened and turned to me, every muscle in his body tense and tightly leashed. His nose flared as he took a deep breath, and my eyes caught on the muscle in his jaw. He\u2019d always been scary, but right now he looked downright lethal. I should\u2019ve been terrified, but I had my buzz wrapped around me like a nice warm blanket of protection.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to let him bully me anymore.</p> <p>\u201cI think the girls would be good for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least, some of them. You stick with the old ladies. Don\u2019t want you around the others. But this friends-with-benefits shit? Not happenin\u2019, Soph. Put that outta your mind, got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I demanded, outraged. \u201cYou screw everything that moves. Why can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a mother,\u201d he said, his voice almost a growl. \u201cYou got no business f**kin\u2019 around like that. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mother, but I\u2019m not dead,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let Noah meet someone unless it\u2019s serious. But I\u2019m ready for a little fun. Horse is hot, and if any of the other guys in your club are like him\u2014even a little\u2014they\u2019d be perfect for me. Don\u2019t give me shit about it, either. I know you guys f**k around. Why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are sweetbutts and club whores,\u201d he said, his voice hard. \u201cThey\u2019re trash. No f**kin\u2019 way you\u2019re gonna be one of them. Not happening, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t my boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a goddamned fourteen-year-old,\u201d he replied, eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t sound like an overprotective father,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad, Ruger.\u201d</p> <p>He reached out and caught me behind the neck, jerking me into his body. Then he dropped his mouth down to my ear, my face so close to his chest I could\u2019ve licked him.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m well aware I\u2019m not your father,\u201d he said. His nose traced the curve of my ear, the warmth of his breath sending a shiver through me. \u201cIf I was, they\u2019d throw my ass in jail for the shit I think about you.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands, sliding them up along his sides, tracing the line of his muscles before bringing them in to graze his ni**les. I couldn\u2019t help myself\u2014I leaned forward and flicked his piercing with my tongue. Ruger groaned, and his fingers tightened in my hair. His entire body tensed, and then I felt the brush of his c**k against my stomach.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>My ni**les peaked and the flesh between my legs spasmed. I shifted restlessly. One of his hands slid down my back, past my shorts and panties, to cup my bare ass. His fingers tensed as I licked his nipple again, then sucked the ring into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cJesus ...\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou got two seconds before I lay you over that table and f**k you so hard it breaks. Swear to God, Soph. You wanna tell me how we\u2019re gonna explain that to Noah? \u2019Cause I got shit. I\u2019m not lookin\u2019 to marry you and I sure as f**k won\u2019t hand you my dick on a leash, so things could get weird fast, babe.\u201d</p><p>I froze, shivering, feeling moisture soak my panties. I wanted to hump his leg like a bitch in heat, desperate for anything to fill the emptiness inside me.</p><p>Instead I pulled away from him slowly. His hand slid free of my shorts and we stepped apart, eyes boring into each other.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ruger muttered, running a hand through his hair. He looked away from me. The front of his pants bulged outward, his c**k so hard I saw the thick head clearly outlined. I wondered what he\u2019d do if I knelt down, pulling his pants low so I could run my tongue around the tip before sucking him deep into my mouth. It actually watered at the thought.</p><p>Desire speared me like a weapon. I sighed, licking my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get another beer,\u201d Ruger said harshly. I looked up from his c**k to his face to find his eyes glued to my chest. Shit. I was still wearing the damned Barbie tank, which left nothing to the imagination. My suitcase sat in his car.</p><p>\u201cGrab me one, too,\u201d I replied, my voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cSure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and shook my head. His chest rose and fell too fast, his dark eyes almost fully dilated. He swallowed and I rubbed my hand against the top of my thigh, restless and hungry. The steady motion caught his eye and he swallowed again.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I want one anyway.\u201d</p><p>I walked unsteadily across the deck to a lounger and lay back on it, limp and full of need so intense I thought I might die. The sun had set, and the evening stars had started coming out somewhere along the line. I should go back down to my little apartment. I knew that. Instead I closed my eyes and thought about how much I wanted to reach down between my legs and rub my clit until I blew up right in front of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something cold touched my cheek.</p><p>I opened my eyes to find Ruger standing over me, eyes intense. They slid slowly across my body. Impossibly, the bulge in his pants was larger. God, it\u2019d be so easy to just reach out and take him into my hand, feel that hard length for myself. Or I could sit up and lean my head forward, letting my cheek touch him through the soft fabric. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off it.</p><p>I rose until my face was only a few inches away from his crotch. Then I looked up at him, wondering if I\u2019d lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your beer,\u201d he said roughly, holding it out to me. I took it and wrapped my mouth around the neck for a drink, holding his gaze.</p> <p>I hated him for being sober and in control.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sophie ...\u201d he groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t f**kin\u2019 look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I asked him, catching a drip on the side with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop I\u2019m gonna f**k you.

You\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head to the side, thoughtful.</p> <p>\u201cAre you?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrunk?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, sinking down to sit next to me. He leaned over, scenting my neck. We weren\u2019t touching at all, but just the warmth of his breath on my skin almost killed me. I took another drink of my beer, slow and deliberate.</p><p>His eyes burned a hole right through me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cMine\u2019s alcohol. Whatever I do tonight, I can blame the beer. What excuse should we use for you?\u201d</p><p>Ruger reached over and took the bottle from my hand, setting it on the deck.</p><p>\u201cNo more tonight,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cYou\u2019re done. We\u2019re done. We\u2019re not doing this. Got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, forcing myself to think past the buzz. I knew he was right. Noah needed us both, and we had enough trouble getting along already. I was going to be living in his basement, for God\u2019s sake, and it wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t been clear\u2014he wanted to f**k me. No heart, no flowers, no dates, and definitely no commitments. At least I wasn\u2019t just a piece of furniture anymore.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he replied. I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIs this a new thing for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t follow,\u201d he said, glancing at me. His eyes pierced mine, the warm night air hanging heavy between us.</p> <p>\u201cWanting me,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIs it a new thing for you? I mean, aside from ... back then ... I always assumed that was just a moment, you know? You always looked right through me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing.\u201d</p><p>We sat together, neither moving, frogs chirping all around us. After a while he reached up and rubbed the back of his neck, like he had in the car.</p><p>\u201cYou still sore?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, I kinked it somehow last night while I was driving. Stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to rub it for you?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo f**kin\u2019 way you\u2019re touching me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe covered that already. I\u2019m not drunk, Soph. I won\u2019t f**k things up for Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to f**k up anything,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m getting sober now, it\u2019s okay. I took a massage class, though. I\u2019m actually pretty good at it. Let me help you. You\u2019ve done so much to help me, I feel like I owe you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, and bumped his shoulder with mine.</p><p>\u201cChicken?\u201d I asked, smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re annoying,\u201d he muttered, but he didn\u2019t protest when I crawled behind him. I ignored the screaming need between my legs as I knelt up and put my fingers on his shoulders. They were hard and strong, soft skin stretched over sleek muscles more than capable of supporting him while he pounded into my body.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too dark for me to see much of his tattoos, which was a damned shame. Ruger wasn\u2019t shy about taking off his shirt, but I never got close enough to really scope them out.</p><p>I dug my fingers in and he groaned, head dropping forward. He wasn\u2019t kidding about being tight, either. Big knots snarled his neck and shoulders. After a few minutes of going at them with my fingers, I started using my elbows. Slowly I got his neck to relax and started moving down his back.</p><p>\u201cLay down on your stomach,\u201d I told him, sliding off the side of the lounger behind him. I flattened it. He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cYou really are chicken,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m just going to give you a back rub, Ruger. Enjoy it for what it is, okay?\u201d</p><p>He grunted and rolled onto his stomach. I leaned over him and went to work. Some of the knots just wouldn\u2019t give, so I decided to climb on top of him to get good leverage.</p><p>Was this stupid?</p><p>Of course. Did I care?</p><p>Not one drunken bit.</p><p>I straddled his butt, enjoying the feel of his hard body between my legs and his skin under my fingers. He smelled fresh and clean, but still utterly male. Drove me crazy. With every stroke of my hands I rode him, not getting quite enough stimulation to satisfy me, but enough that when I felt a light beading of sweat break out, it definitely wasn\u2019t from the effort of giving the massage.</p><p>At first he tensed, but slowly he gave in to it, each muscle group relaxing in turn. Finally my hands were tired and we were both limp. I lay down across his back, taking in his scent, the warm summer breeze just enough to keep me from overheating.</p><p>\u201cSoph ...\u201d he said, his voice a warning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Ruger,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything. Just let it be, all right?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and silence fell between us.</p><p>I was still frustrated, no question. But it was a strange, relaxed kind of sexual desire washing through me now. Night sounds surrounded us and I let myself enjoy the feel of Ruger\u2019s body under mine, wishing I really could have a man like this\u2014strong, steady, and capable of protecting me from anything.</p><p>If Ruger were mine, I\u2019d be safe. Always.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Sophie,\u201d he murmured softly, sounding half asleep. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, because I didn\u2019t believe him. Instead I dozed off. The next thing I remembered was him lifting me and carrying me down to my bed.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Ruger was wrong. It wasn\u2019t okay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Things got weird.</p><p>So weird that he took off on me for nearly five days, leaving Sunday afternoon and not showing up again until Thursday. I had no idea where he went and didn\u2019t ask him about it when he came back. But it had to get less uncomfortable, right? Because you can only be all tense and strange around each other for so long ...</p><p>At least Noah started school without any problems, which didn\u2019t really surprise me. He\u2019d always been good at making new friends and tended to roll with whatever changes came along. Before Ruger left on his club run (I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure what \u201cruns\u201d were, but apparently this one involved being gone for five days), he\u2019d handed me some money and suggested I wait until the next week to start job hunting. He wanted to explore work options with the club, and also thought I should focus on helping Noah adjust to his new situation.</p><p>I\u2019d love to say I\u2019m such a strong, independent woman that I told him to butt out, but it was actually a huge relief. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d had a week off, and I loved it. I unpacked everything, sucked up the sun and got reacquainted with the area.</p> <p>I also spent an afternoon with my old friend Kimber.</p><p>She invited me over for lunch on Tuesday. We\u2019d stayed in touch through the years, and last summer I\u2019d stayed with her and her new husband when we came to visit. Kimber had gone a little wild for a while after graduation. Then she met Ryan and settled down. He was some kind of software engineer and apparently did pretty well for himself, because she had one of those big houses popping up like mushrooms out on the Rathdrum Prairie. It was part of a development, not custom like Ruger\u2019s, but twice the size and pretty impressive.</p><p>She also had a pool.</p><p>\u201cYou want a margarita?\u201d she asked, opening the door in a bikini, a brightly colored wrap, and sunglasses that would\u2019ve made Paris Hilton jealous. I smirked, because some things never change.</p><p>\u201cThis early?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always happy hour when you have kids,\u201d she replied, shrugging. \u201cEither that or it\u2019s sad hour, and that\u2019s not half as much fun.\u201d</p><p>We grinned at each other like total dorks.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want one or not?\u201d she asked, dragging me through her grand entryway and down the hall to her kitchen. \u201cBecause I\u2019m definitely having one. Ava was up all night teething. She finally fell asleep about fifteen minutes ago. If I\u2019m lucky, I have two hours before she\u2019s up again. I need to make the most of it and pack in six weeks\u2019 worth of social life before you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I told her. \u201cBut just one. I have to drive and pick up Noah later. I take it you\u2019re enjoying mommyhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving it,\u201d she replied, pouring me a drink in a brightly colored martini glass with a flamingo-shaped stem. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how amazing Ava is. But it\u2019s crazy, too. I had no idea how much work they could be\u2014I still can\u2019t believe you did this when you were seventeen. I couldn\u2019t even find my keys half the time back then, let alone keep track of a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes life brings us surprises,\u201d I replied, thinking back to those early days. After Noah, I\u2019d gone to the alternative high school and lived with Ruger\u2019s mom. It hadn\u2019t been easy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give him up, so I figured it out. What doesn\u2019t kill us, and all that shit.\u201d</p> <p>I waved my hand airily to illustrate the point.</p><p>Kimber burst out laughing, and it was just like high school again. God, I loved her. We made our way out to the backyard, sitting at a tile-topped table under a vine-draped pergola. Her backyard really was gorgeous. Totally different than Ruger\u2019s wild acreage ... Kimber had a perfectly manicured little Garden of Eden in the suburbs.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re staying with Jesse Gray,\u201d she said, arching a brow. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard him called Jesse since his mom died,\u201d I replied. \u201cHe goes by Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d she said, eyes drifting away from mine as she sipped her drink thoughtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be negative, but is this a good thing? I thought you hated him. I mean, things got bad there before you left ... It was an ugly time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, \u2018hate\u2019 is probably too strong a word for Ruger,\u201d I replied, taking a sip from my flamingo-themed glass. Ugh, way too much tequila. Yuck. She wasn\u2019t kidding about packing in weeks of social life. I set it back down, eyeing the yard speculatively. When she went inside, I\u2019d dump it on a shrub or something.</p><p>Did tequila kill shrubs?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say our relationship is a little tense, though,\u201d I added. \u201cHe was kind of a jackass about me coming back to town, but I have to admit, it\u2019s a good move for us. Things weren\u2019t so great in Seattle.\u201d</p> <p>Kimber made a soothing noise and waved her hand at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad you came back,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf nothing else, now you\u2019ll have me around to babysit for you. I promise\u2014no drinking when I\u2019m watching your kid. Scout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey kicked you out of Scouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the Girl Scouts,\u201d she mused. \u201cThose boys always found room for me in their tents. Seriously, though, Noah\u2019s a great kid, and it\u2019s not like I get to go out and do anything these days anyway. Not that I mind\u2014I\u2019ve had my fun.\u201d</p><p>I snickered at that. She didn\u2019t even blush. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure she was joking about the scouts and their tents.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of fun ...\u201d she said slowly, swirling her drink. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at her, and for the first time since I\u2019d known her, Kimber looked embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, a little nervous.</p><p>Nothing embarrassed Kimber.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this, so I\u2019m just going to spit it out,\u201d she replied, swallowing. \u201cI slept with Ruger three years ago. It was a one-night thing, nothing special. I figured you should know, since I might want to come and hang out at your new place sometime. Full disclosure.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you sleep with Ruger?\u201d</p><p>She cocked a brow at me, eyes knowing.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she asked, and I flushed. Of course I knew why. \u201cIt was before Ryan, so it\u2019s not like I did something wrong. You were still living in Olympia and could hardly stand him long enough to let him see Noah. I thought I was in the clear.\u201d</p><p>I looked away from her, trying to process. The thought of her and Ruger felt wrong. In fact, it made me kind of angry. And that was ridiculous, because it wasn\u2019t like I had any business being upset. Not only that, it\u2019d been three years ago. A full year after things fell to shit here, and not even Kimber knew all the details on that one ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strong or not, I took a big gulp of my margarita, which blazed a nasty, fiery trail down my throat. My lungs spasmed in protest.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t planning to do it again, are you?\u201d I asked once I stopped coughing. She burst out laughing and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Kimber sputtered. \u201cFor one, I\u2019m married. Remember? You were in the wedding, dumbass ... But even if I wasn\u2019t, he\u2019s not a return-trip kind of guy. I mean, I\u2019d have done him again, because he\u2019s that good\u2014trust me\u2014but he\u2019s definitely not the type to stick around. He\u2019s f**ked half of Idaho. It was fun, but I don\u2019t get off on being one of many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to talk about this?\u201d I asked, squirming.</p> <p>\u201cNo, not really,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wanted you to know, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in case what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just in case I come over. It seems weird not to tell you, now that I know you have a thing for him. I didn\u2019t know that when I f**ked him, though. I swear. I thought you hated him as much as you hate Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a thing for him,\u201d I said quickly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother denying it,\u201d she replied lightly, giving a theatrical shudder. \u201cI can see it in your face when you talk about him, and I get it. He\u2019s one of those guys you just want to shove down and lick all over. Which I did, actually. He\u2019s nasty in bed, too, never tried some of that shit before. Pierced dick. I shit you not.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened and I took another gulp of my drink.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes that mean\u2014wait, no. No. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cThe answer to your unasked question is yes,\u201d she said, leering comically. \u201cBut you need to stay away from him, babe. No kidding on that one.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. I wanted to be annoyed with Kimber, but you just couldn\u2019t. She was too sweet and crazy to get pissed at.</p><p>\u201cI live with him,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cI can\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile faded.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s my point,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cBut you can keep your distance in other ways. You need to build your own life and cut out any fantasies of messing around with him, because it won\u2019t end well. If you guys fall into bed one night, you better be ready to wake up and clear out before the next chick shows up. And the next one and the next one and the one after that. That\u2019s just how he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Pisser, hmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you have to give up on sex,\u201d Kimber said. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m stuck at home all the time anyway. Might as well watch Noah so you can go out and get some. You\u2019re hot\u2014guys\u2019ll be crawling all over you. In fact, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do setups,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d she replied knowingly. \u201cTrust me, when you see his picture you\u2019ll be all over him. His name is Josh, he works with Ryan, and he\u2019s loaded.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her phone, flipped around until she found what she wanted, then handed it over.</p><p>Damn. This guy really was hot, in a pretty, clean-cut lawyer kind of way.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She burst out laughing and I chugged the rest of the margarita. Ava squawked over the baby monitor and Kimber groaned.</p><p>\u201cFuck my life ...\u201d</p><p>As Kimber went inside to check on her, I pulled off my sarong and slid down into the pool, considering Kimber\u2019s cute friend. Unfortunately, when I tried to imagine him kissing me, I thought about sucking on Ruger\u2019s lip ring instead. Then I thought about sucking on other things, which wasn\u2019t productive at all.</p><p>What exactly did a pierced dick look like, anyway? And how would it feel inside?</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>Kimber finally got Ava settled and came back outside, jumping into the water with me.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you started job hunting yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I replied. \u201cRuger wants to see if there\u2019s something I can do with the club. I\u2019m on the fence about that. Not sure I want to get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if your goal is to make good money, the best place to work is The Line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe strip club?\u201d I asked, widening my eyes. Everyone knew about The Line, of course, but I\u2019d never been there.</p><p>\u201cYup. Totally paid for my degree that way,\u201d she replied, leaning back into the water to wet her hair. I gaped as she came back up.</p><p>\u201cYou worked at a strip club? Stripping? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>Kimber laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I worked there valet parking,\u201d she replied, rolling her eyes. \u201cYes, I stripped. Made really good money, too. I only had to work two nights a week. It kicked ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wasn\u2019t that kind of ... icky?\u201d I asked, intrigued. She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDefine \u2018icky,\u2019\u201d she replied. \u201cI mean, sometimes it was really fun. I liked dancing on the stage and all the flirting. The lap dances weren\u2019t quite as much fun, especially if the guys were old or something. But they aren\u2019t allowed to touch you. At least, not unless you go back into the VIP rooms. All kinds of things happen back there\u2014but only stuff you decide to let happen. Nobody forces you to do anything.\u201d</p><p>I turned this information over in my brain, stunned.</p><p>\u201cSo did you?\u201d I asked, knowing it was rude but completely incapable of not asking.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back in the VIP rooms?\u201d I asked, unable to help myself. She giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, but that\u2019s where you earn the most money. Security keeps a pretty close eye on things. It\u2019s not dangerous or anything.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. She stared back, smirking.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said finally. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you going to get all judgy on me?\u201d she asked. \u201cFuck that. I\u2019m not ashamed. Ryan knows all about it, too. That\u2019s where I met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t bother him?\u201d I asked, even more startled.</p><p>\u201cIt would be pretty damned hypocritical if it did,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cFirst time he came in, he paid for me all night, and I gotta tell you, we had a damned fine time in that little room all by ourselves ... I swear, I fell for him on the spot. He didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing me with any other guys, so I quit the next day. I didn\u2019t want to f**k things up between us, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cI know I keep saying that, but I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around this.

And I didn\u2019t get into drugs. A lot of the girls blow their money on drugs and stupid shit. But the smart ones? They save their cash and retire early. I covered our wedding, our honeymoon, and the down payment on this house. Ava\u2019s got a college fund started, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>Kimber laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a long-term career,\u201d she said. \u201cBut think about it. A regular job keeps you away from Noah forty hours a week, at least. Maybe more. You start stripping, you\u2019re only away from him two nights a week. What\u2019s better? A mom with a lily-white reputation, or one who\u2019s actually around to take care of her kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell of a good point,\u201d I answered, bemused.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd consider this\u2014you start making good money, you\u2019ll have your own place in no time. I don\u2019t care how nice Ruger\u2019s house is. So long as he\u2019s living there, you\u2019re up shit creek.\u201d</p> <p>Hard to argue with that.</p><p>PORTLAND, OREGON</p><p>RUGER</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a town with so many damned strip clubs,\u201d Picnic muttered, sipping his beer. Ruger glanced over at his club president and shrugged. It was Wednesday afternoon, but they\u2019d only been awake for a couple hours.</p><p>Last night Ruger had found a hot little blonde who\u2019d done her best to make him forget all about his new roommate. Unfortunately, he\u2019d f**ked himself over by pretending she was Sophie the entire time he\u2019d pounded her slick pu**y.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure, but he might\u2019ve called Soph\u2019s name when he came.</p> <p>Shit, he needed to get a handle on this ... But there was just something about the thought of her in his house, all available and at his mercy. It was too much power.</p><p>Ruger had never been one of the good guys.</p><p>He took a long, deep breath. This was a business trip, so time to pull his head out of his ass. He glanced over to the stage, where a nearly naked woman gyrated lifelessly around the pole. She could\u2019ve been cleaning toilets for all the enthusiasm she showed.</p><p>\u201cToo bad they\u2019re more interested in quantity than quality,\u201d Ruger said, nodding toward the stage. \u201cFire her ass, she worked at The Line.\u201d</p><p>Deke gave a snort of laughter. Ruger glanced at him, noting the humor didn\u2019t reach the Portland president\u2019s eyes. Man was dead inside, so far as he could tell. He\u2019d heard that Deke was national\u2019s first choice for enforcement, and he had no trouble believing it. The former marine could probably pull off a hit in his sleep.</p><p>Good guy to have at your back in a fight.</p><p>\u201cYou bastards have it easy up there in Idaho,\u201d Deke said. \u201cFuckin\u2019 monopoly, so all the talent has to compete to work for you. We got more strip clubs here than anywhere else in the damned country, or so I hear. Market\u2019s saturated, and that means owners gotta take what they can get. Some of these places barely break even. Crazy-ass shit.\u201d</p><p>Ruger glanced around the room with new interest. Aside from their table, there couldn\u2019t have been more than six customers total. No, make that seven. Some lucky bastard was getting a hand job back in the far corner.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s always this empty?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s f**ked up. No wonder she isn\u2019t trying. Why bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t dance for shit, but at least she gives a hell of a blow job,\u201d Deke responded. \u201cTry her out later if you like. Any of the girls, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Deke glanced over at their waitress, jerking his chin toward their drinks. She carried over a tray of refills, smiling nervously. Ruger eyed her, considering Deke\u2019s offer. The girl wore a black leather bustier, a short, tight skirt, and black fishnets. Long, reddish-brown hair, sort of like Sophie\u2019s. And there his c**k went again, getting all hard.</p><p>Yeah, this good-guy bullshit wasn\u2019t his gig at all.</p><p>Damn, but he\u2019d wanted Soph in his bed a long time. Every inch of her hot little body was burned in his brain, starting that first night he\u2019d seen her screwing Zach in his apartment, which officially classified him as one sick f**k. She\u2019d been sixteen years old and scared shitless, and what\u2019d his response been?</p><p>He\u2019d jacked off in the damned shower while she hunted for her panties in his living room. Panties she\u2019d never found, by the way, which he f**king well knew because he still had them. Pink and lacy, innocent as hell, and enough to get his ass thrown into jail back in those days.</p><p>Then he\u2019d gone and really f**ked things up four years ago, f**ked them up so bad her entire life exploded. Not entirely his fault, but he still regretted how he\u2019d handled Zach. Should\u2019ve killed the cocksucker when he had the chance. Even with all his guilt and regret, though, one thing hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>He still jacked off to those panties sometimes.</p><p>\u201cWhere the f**k is Hunter?\u201d he asked irritably.</p><p>Deke narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLike I give a shit?\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m not on board with this. We don\u2019t talk to Jacks. We hurt them. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done\u2014there\u2019s a system.\u201d</p><p>Toke, one of the younger Portland guys, nodded in agreement, his face grim. He\u2019d insisted on being part of this meet. Gracie was his old lady these days. Between him and Deke, they were sitting on a f**king powder keg ...</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking to this one,\u201d Picnic said, his voice soft but unyielding. At forty-two, he was the oldest man at the table. He and Deke might have equal rank, but Pic had been around a long time, and when he spoke, men listened. Ruger knew he\u2019d been talked about for national president, but the man wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on. I want to hear what this ass**le has to say about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 simple,\u201d Deke replied. \u201cLittle bastards are movin\u2019 in on our territory. You know it, I know it. This shit needs to end.\u201d</p><p>Pic shook his head and leaned forward, pale blue eyes intense.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make sense, brother,\u201d he said. \u201cFour guys living in a house in Portland ... Two of them going to f**king school here, like they\u2019re citizens or something. Nomads. You seen them pull a goddamn thing these past nine months?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deke sighed, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Pic continued. \u201cWe know they\u2019re our enemies. They know it, too. So why the f**k would they be here? Death wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSetting us up,\u201d Ruger suggested. \u201cTrying to get us to relax? Either that or a mind f**k.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour situation in Seattle, they give you any shit about it?\u201d Pic asked him, although Ruger knew he had the answer already.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d he replied. \u201cFuckwad was theirs to punish, no problem with that. Made our lives easier. Damned civil about it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, and you ever know a Devil\u2019s Jack to be polite?\u201d Picnic continued. \u201cFuck, didn\u2019t think they knew how. These guys are young\u2014different\u2014and none of us has ever seen them before this year. Roseburg boys say there\u2019ve been dustups in northern Cali. Something\u2019s happening in that club, and for once I think it might not be about screwing us over.\u201d</p><p>Deke slammed down a shot, then leaned back, arms crossed, face grim.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t change,\u201d Toke muttered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what games they\u2019re playing, doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in charge, none of it. They\u2019re Jacks and they belong in the ground. Period. Every day they\u2019re livin\u2019 in my town, it eats at me. I want to end it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got one-track minds, both of you,\u201d Horse said, pulling up a chair to join them. \u201cI swear, we\u2019re goin\u2019 in f**kin\u2019 circles here. Slide just texted. Jacks are in the parking lot. Just the two of \u2019em, no sign of anyone else. Don\u2019t do anything crazy until we finish talking, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Toke nodded, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Shit, Ruger thought. They shouldn\u2019t have let him come along. Man hated the Devil\u2019s Jacks, and with good reason, but he was like a damned grenade without a pin.</p><p>The door opened, bright sunlight framing two figures Ruger recognized. Hunter and Skid\u2014the same bastards who\u2019d come up to collect their former brother in Seattle the weekend before. Both were big, although Hunter was the taller of the two. He was young, probably no more than twenty-four or twenty-five. Nomad, so he didn\u2019t have a home chapter. No official status, but the man carried himself with instinctive authority.</p><p>If the Jacks had a serious power-shift in progress, Ruger would bet a thousand bucks Hunter was at the center of it.</p><p>The music changed and a new girl strutted out onto the stage. Ms. Personality hopped on down, but she didn\u2019t bother coming over to their table trying to sell lap dances. She might not be enthusiastic about her job, but apparently she wasn\u2019t entirely stupid.</p><p>None of them stood as the Jacks approached. Ruger kicked a chair over to Hunter, who caught it with a smile that was anything but friendly. He flipped it backward, straddling it casually. Skid dropped down next to him.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready to talk?\u201d Hunter asked, looking between the men. \u201cI\u2019m Hunter, by the way. With the Devil\u2019s Jacks. Motorcycle club, may have heard of us? This is Skid.\u201d</p><p>Deke\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Ruger had to bite back a grin. He wasn\u2019t sure yet if Hunter was an idiot or not, but the kid had balls of f**kin\u2019 brass.</p><p>\u201cPicnic,\u201d the Coeur d\u2019Alene president said. \u201cMy brothers Deke, Horse, Toke, and Ruger. Deke\u2019s the president here in Portland. Gotta say, he\u2019s a little hurt you haven\u2019t dropped by to introduce yourselves before now. You might not know this, but Portland belongs to the Reapers.\u201d</p><p>Hunter held up his hands, palms forward.</p><p>\u201cNo problems there,\u201d he said. \u201cMy rocker says Nomad, not trying to claim Oregon. Your town, your rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breathing our air,\u201d Deke said, his voice cold. \u201cGenerally we charge for that. I think we discussed this with one of your boys last winter. Stayed with us for nearly a week, if I remember right.\u201d</p><p>Skid\u2019s eyes narrowed, but he kept his mouth shut. Hunter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThese things happen. We get shit\u2019s not good between the Jacks and the Reapers,\u201d he said, his tone mild. \u201cBut we\u2019re here today because you helped us out. Been wantin\u2019 to meet up for a while now. This opened the door. We wanted to offer our thanks and talk to you about a truce. Asshole you handed over up in Seattle\u2014he was a problem for us. Serious problem, more than you realize. Now the problem\u2019s gone. We appreciate the gesture, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Deke asked. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve got some problems, too. You truly appreciate the favor, we could use some help resolving those. You get me?\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get you,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat was a bad business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was my niece,\u201d Deke said, slamming his hand down on the table. \u201cCute kid. Never gonna have kids of her own, though, what with the way your boys ripped her up from the inside out. Spent a year on a f**kin\u2019 psych ward. Still scared to leave her house.\u201d</p><p>Toke grunted, pulling out his knife and laying it on the table. Hunter leaned forward, his face every bit as intense as Deke\u2019s. He ignored the knife.</p><p>\u201cThat problem\u2019s been solved,\u201d he said. \u201cWe offered proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProof wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Deke replied. \u201cDead is easy. They needed to suffer, and I needed to be the one making them suffer. You stole that from me.\u201d</p><p>Hunter glanced at his friend, then nodded to the waitress, gesturing for her to come over. She approached their group cautiously, clearly reading the tension.</p><p>\u201cAnother round for the table,\u201d Hunter told her. She scuttled off, and silence fell. The girl returned with the drinks, and Hunter picked up his beer, sipping it thoughtfully. Ruger joined him, wondering how this would play out. He\u2019d stand by Deke and Toke\u2014still his brothers, right or wrong\u2014but attacking some kid who\u2019d had nothing to do with the incident wouldn\u2019t accomplish much. Finally, Skid spoke.</p><p>\u201cThings are changing with the Jacks,\u201d he said. \u201cLot of things in play. What happened to your niece? There\u2019s no excuse for that and no way we\u2019re trying to say it was okay. None of us were down with it, and we took care of the men involved. Only two were our brothers. The rest were hangarounds, and all of them are gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve brought them to you,\u201d Hunter added. \u201cWe get that now. At the time, we just took care of business, because your girl was the last straw in a much bigger, much uglier situation, so wrap your head around that. Figured we\u2019d minimize your risk and haul out our own garbage. I can\u2019t travel back and fix what happened to her. Can\u2019t give you a shot at them, either. It\u2019s done. What I can do is try to move forward, make sure it never happens again. We\u2019re tired of this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTired of what?\u201d Picnic asked, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cTired of putting time and energy into fighting Reapers when we should be focused on more important things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, you weren\u2019t feeling all peaceful last December,\u201d Horse put in. \u201cMy woman was in danger. I don\u2019t appreciate ass**les like yourselves threatening my property.\u201d</p><p>Hunter sighed and leaned back in his chair, rubbing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.</p> <p>\u201cTimes change,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWe all know that. Some of our guys, they\u2019re a little slow, clinging to the past. That was their play, and it was a f**kin\u2019 stupid one. But most of my brothers and me, we\u2019re looking to the future. Fighting you is a waste of time and energy. Used to be we were in the minority on that one. Now we\u2019re not, so I\u2019m opening the door. This wasn\u2019t an easy meeting to arrange, but we all put down our guns and came here today. That\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t put down my gun,\u201d Deke rumbled.</p><p>Hunter smiled, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a hardass,\u201d he told Deke. \u201cRespect. But seein\u2019 as I\u2019m still alive right now, I think my point stands. We\u2019re talking, not shooting. Gotta be a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your play?\u201d Picnic asked, openly skeptical. \u201cYou had some kind of revolution back home, so now you\u2019re here tryin\u2019 to make peace? Lemme guess, you think we should all just hug and make up, maybe swap some recipes, organize a potluck?\u201d</p> <p>Hunter laughed, his body language so relaxed it was almost insulting. Didn\u2019t he realize they could take him in a heartbeat?</p><p>Yeah, Ruger decided. He knew it.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t care, and a man who\u2019d stopped caring was dangerous as f**k.</p><p>\u201cCut the shit,\u201d Ruger said suddenly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Hunter leaned forward and met his eyes, voice serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because we\u2019ve been losing territory and influence for years, and it\u2019s getting worse. We got boys coming up from the south, out of L.A., and they\u2019re looking to expand. We need to be fighting them, but we\u2019re fighting you instead. So far as I can tell, we\u2019re doing it out of habit like a bunch of damned monkeys who can\u2019t figure out something better to do,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cSwattin\u2019 flies isn\u2019t habit, it\u2019s housekeeping,\u201d Deke rumbled. \u201cSame with killin\u2019 Jacks.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cTell me this,\u201d he said. \u201cYour niece, that was some bad shit. But before her, Reapers killed three of our guys in Redding. Two of those guys had kids. You remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming it happened\u2014which for the record, I don\u2019t acknowledge\u2014it\u2019s probably because they attacked our guys the night before,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cPreemptive self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guys were down there to steal one of our shipments,\u201d Hunter said flatly. \u201cAnd they burned down our clubhouse while they were at it. Why\u2019d they do that?\u201d</p><p>Picnic shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDunno. I wasn\u2019t in on that decision,\u201d Picnic admitted. \u201cThat was all Roseburg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet we\u2019re prepared to fight and kill each other over it,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd each time we strike back, it gets worse. Sooner or later we\u2019re gonna kill each other off completely, which is exactly what the gangs down south want. Our clubs, we got history between us, and it\u2019s not good. But we\u2019re the same kind\u2014we know what it means to be brothers. Men like us, we live to ride, and ride to live. Fuck the world.\u201d</p> <p>Ruger nodded, acknowledging the point.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing boys movin\u2019 north, boys who aren\u2019t part of a brotherhood ... and I mean boys\u2014they got kids workin\u2019 the streets can\u2019t be more than ten years old,\u201d Hunter continued. \u201cThese children are takin\u2019 orders from generals who don\u2019t get their hands dirty, let alone throw down for them. They don\u2019t get to vote, they don\u2019t get to think, and they don\u2019t even know why they\u2019re fighting. They\u2019re a threat to our way of life, yours and mine. I\u2019m tired of putting time and energy into worrying about Reapers when every time I turn around some high school dropout\u2019s takin\u2019 potshots at me. I just want to ride my f**kin\u2019 bike and get laid.\u201d</p><p>Ruger glanced at Picnic. His face was thoughtful, although his expression didn\u2019t give away a thing. Horse grunted, polishing off his drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who feels that way,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cLot of my brothers, we\u2019re tired of this war. Those same brothers are moving up in their chapters, thinking maybe it\u2019s time for us to be on the same side in this little game. It\u2019s about values and what we stand for. We\u2019re brothers and we ride, all the rest is details. These f**kers, though ... Deep down inside, there\u2019s nothing there. We gotta stop them before it\u2019s too late. I can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m fighting a war on two fronts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Deke growled. \u201cYou\u2019re a little f**kwad and you don\u2019t know jack. What\u2019s gone down between us, that shit doesn\u2019t go away just because you and your boyfriends decide you\u2019re scared of someone new moving in on your territory. You wanted a war with the Reapers and now you\u2019ve got it. We\u2019re going to kill you. All of you. Might take a while. I\u2019m patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeke\u2014\u201d Picnic said, his voice low and full of unmistakable command. \u201cWhat they did to Gracie can\u2019t be fixed, brother. But the bastards paid and now they\u2019re gone. The more we fight, the more likely some other girl\u2019s gonna get hurt. I got two daughters. Peace between clubs isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Especially when the cartel\u2019s movin\u2019 in. I hear stories ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know you got two daughters,\u201d Hunter told Picnic, eyes narrowing. \u201cIn fact, we know a hell of a lot more than you\u2019d like. We know because there\u2019s guys in my club who think we should strike, think we can use the cartel to throw you off balance. They called the shots last December, but they aren\u2019t in control right now and I\u2019d like to keep it that way. You got two choices here ... First one is nut up and work with me to control this new threat. We pull that off, everyone goes home happily ever after, shittin\u2019 rainbows and dancin\u2019 with unicorns. Second choice is keep fighting with each other until they take us all out. You want that? Fine. I\u2019m not scared to bring it. But consider this ... You got daughters you care about. One\u2019s up in Bellingham, other\u2019s in Coeur d\u2019Alene. Pretty girls, which I know \u2019cause I\u2019ve seen \u2019em for myself. Recently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou leave my girls out of this,\u201d Picnic said, reaching for his gun.

You call me when you\u2019re ready to talk.\u201d</p> <p>With that Hunter stood up, shoving away his chair. Deke flushed, but Picnic\u2019s face could\u2019ve been carved from stone. Hunter thew a handful of bills on the table and walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s f**kin\u2019 with us,\u201d Toke said. \u201cCartel\u2019s got f**k all to do with us up here. He\u2019s losing territory. That\u2019s not our problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think they can hold out?\u201d Ruger asked him. \u201cCartel\u2019s got a thousand kids ready and waitin\u2019 to die, every one of them so hungry for glory they\u2019ll shoot their own mothers. Jacks are tough bastards, but they\u2019ll be f**ked if they can\u2019t shut them down before they get a foothold. We would be, too, and you know it. Those gangs exist for one reason\u2014to make money. We let them take over, we\u2019ll lose our territory and our freedom. No f**kin\u2019 point in breathing without that. Not to mention the cartel doesn\u2019t care where they shit or who they kill. You want them here in Portland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is big,\u201d Picnic said slowly. \u201cBigger than we can decide here. We\u2019ll get the brothers together, make sure we\u2019re all on board. Take it from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never make peace with the Jacks,\u201d Toke muttered. \u201cYou want peace, you\u2019ll go through me to get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat a threat?\u201d Ruger asked. He respected the hell out of Toke, but it wasn\u2019t his decision to make. \u201cI hate the thought of taking on a brother, but don\u2019t think I won\u2019t. We\u2019re in this together, Toke. That means we make the call as a group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you could take me?\u201d Toke asked, cocking a brow.</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d Ruger replied, meeting his gaze without flinching. \u201cBut I tell you one thing. We start fightin\u2019 with each other, the cartel wins. Keep your eyes on the prize, brother. We make peace with the Jacks, they\u2019re our buffer. That lets us put our energy into makin\u2019 money and gettin\u2019 laid. We give it a shot and it falls apart, least we\u2019ll pick up some good intel along the way. Make it easier to go after \u2019em, the time comes.\u201d</p><p>Toke took a deep breath, then let it out, visibly forcing himself to calm down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forgive them for what they did,\u201d he said. \u201cJesus, she\u2019s still so f**ked up. You got no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou damned well shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Horse told him, voice serious. \u201cWhat happened can\u2019t be undone, and the ass**les who did it deserved to die. Good news is, they did. Think ahead. We turn the Jacks into allies, we\u2019ll own half the west coast with the Jacks as a line of defense between us and the cartel. That\u2019s somethin\u2019 we should consider.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll settle for protecting my girls,\u201d Picnic muttered. \u201cFuckin\u2019 asshole knows where they are, maybe\u2019s even watching them. You know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans nobody\u2019s safe,\u201d Horse said softly. \u201cAnd he\u2019s damned right about one thing\u2014in our world, we don\u2019t f**k with citizens, so long as they show respect. We keep our towns safe and control what gets in. I know the Jacks did your niece, Deke, but she got as much justice as they could give. The cartel, though ... They\u2019re shootin\u2019 women and children, and they don\u2019t give a f**k who they kill so long as they get their money. No values. I\u2019ll take the Jacks over them anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re telling us the truth,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cRemember\u2014they lie. We need information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to call the brothers together,\u201d Pic said. \u201cNo help for it. You want to host, Deke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it in Coeur d\u2019Alene,\u201d the Portland president replied, shaking his head. \u201cWe got nothin\u2019 like the Armory. Whatever else the Jacks might be, they aren\u2019t magic. We meet at the Armory, we\u2019ll have space to talk. I\u2019ll start making calls.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>No girl should have to lose panties this expensive.</p> <p>I felt almost wistful when I found them in Ruger\u2019s couch. Dark, rich purple silk, delicate lacy cutouts in the front. Whoever she was, she\u2019d shelled out way too much money prettying up for a one-night stand with the man-whore.</p><p>I knew the pain of lost panties myself ... On that less-than-spectacular night Noah had been conceived, I\u2019d had to go without mine after we got kicked out of Ruger\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Sighing, I dropped the couch cushion I\u2019d been vacuuming under. I\u2019d made my first pass through Ruger\u2019s house doing surface cleaning. Now I was on to the deeper stuff, which meant hunting through the bowels of the furniture, among other things.</p><p>It was Thursday afternoon and the week had come together nicely. After my visit with Kimber, I\u2019d gotten in touch with some of the girls from the club who\u2019d left their cell-phone numbers. They were coming over on Friday night to meet me and hang out. They sounded every bit as nice and thoughtful as I\u2019d suspected, and I couldn\u2019t wait to put faces to names.</p><p>I\u2019d also gotten to know the neighbor down the road, a woman in her late thirties named Elle. She\u2019d been widowed a couple years back and now she lived alone. We met her Tuesday afternoon, when Noah and I went exploring and wandered onto her property.</p><p>She and I spent a couple hours sitting outside her house (she had one of the old, original farmhouses, which meant a kick-ass porch complete with swing and rockers), sipping iced tea, and shooting the shit. Elle really hit it off with Noah, too, and had already offered to babysit if I needed it. I got a great vibe off her, Noah adored her, and we\u2019d been thrilled when she had us over for dinner on Wednesday.</p><p>Wednesday was also when I started cleaning Ruger\u2019s house.</p><p>This was partly out of boredom. I also felt guilty, because Ruger was a single man who clearly enjoyed his freedom, yet he\u2019d brought us home anyway. This had to cramp his style. Not that I particularly liked the idea of him being completely free to indulge himself ... I knew I couldn\u2019t have him, but it still bugged me to think of him with other women. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I totally got how messed up that was.</p><p>Didn\u2019t change how I felt.</p><p>Anyway, I decided the best way to pay Ruger back was to become his unofficial housekeeper. He didn\u2019t plan to charge us any rent, but I wouldn\u2019t feel right if I wasn\u2019t earning my keep.</p><p>Which brought me to the pair of tiny purple panties lost in the couch.</p> <p>Sadly, this was not the first piece of lingerie I\u2019d found in the last twenty-four hours. They weren\u2019t all the same sizes, either\u2014Ruger clearly appreciated variety among his many booty calls.</p><p>I picked up the panties with a pair of kitchen tongs and carried them into the laundry room. I didn\u2019t know who they belonged to, but I didn\u2019t think I should be tossing out anything I found, no matter how ... used ... it might be. I dropped the panties into one of the four plastic boxes I\u2019d lined up across the top of the dryer.</p><p>The first held money. So far I\u2019d found ninety-two dollars and twenty-three cents. Box two was condoms. I found stashes in almost every room. Some were definitely on purpose, and I left those in place. But I\u2019d also found them in the pockets of stray pants, in the silverware drawer, on top of the bookshelf ... I\u2019d even found two in the pizza box on the coffee table. Chocolate-flavored ones. This led to a series of fantasies about pizza-themed sex, which squicked me out a bit.</p><p>Also made me sort of hungry.</p><p>That\u2019s when I decided I needed little boxes to put all this stuff in, so I could just close the lids and pretend they didn\u2019t exist. So far it was working pretty well. Box three held women\u2019s underwear, bras, and a single silk stocking. Box four was \u201cother\u201d\u2014small, strange chunks of metal, random tools, a Buck knife, and two ticket stubs from a Spokane Indians game.</p> <p>Weird pangs of jealousy aside, I wanted Ruger\u2019s house fresh, clean, and comfortable when he got home. It was the least I could do. I cleaned everywhere but his bedroom, although I did wade in just far enough to grab the worst of the laundry.</p><p>That night, Noah asked me when Uncle Ruger would be back. I had no idea what to tell him, and I wondered if living in his house could ever feel normal. Free rent was great, but Kimber was probably right. Ultimately, I needed my own place, where the couch cushions weren\u2019t full of strange underwear and the silverware drawer was condom-free.</p><p>The thudding of feet overhead woke me up around three o\u2019clock early Friday morning. Ruger was home, I noted drowsily, and it sounded like he was throwing a party. Fortunately, my kid and I could sleep through anything, so five minutes later I was out again.</p><p>The next day, Noah and I did our best to stay quiet as we got ready and used our own door to leave the house. When I got back from dropping him at school, I had a near-miss with the house alarm, punching in the code twice before I got it right. Ruger\u2019s obsession with security was damned inconvenient at times ...</p><p>I showered and straightened up our little apartment. By then it was almost ten and still no noise from upstairs. Maybe I dreamed the whole thing up? God knew, Ruger had a tendency to invade my dreams.</p><p>I slipped up the stairs softly, not wanting to wake him. I reached the top, turned toward the kitchen and swayed, completely shocked.</p> <p>Apparently a hurricane had hit the house in the night.</p><p>Empty beer bottles covered every possible surface. The furniture had been shoved around, with one end of the love seat actually lifted up and resting on the back of the main couch. There were partially empty pizza boxes, spilled beer\u2014and the most disturbing part of all?</p><p>A completely naked blonde chick sat at the breakfast bar, lighting a cigarette.</p><p>Seeing her hit me hard\u2014I actually couldn\u2019t breathe for a second, and I felt dizzy. I knew Ruger slept around. I\u2019d found the evidence myself, but somehow this finally brought it all home for me.</p><p>She was gorgeous and utterly unselfconscious. Naturally, I wore an old tank top and cutoffs, hair in a messy bun, and no makeup. I wanted to kill her. Dead. Strangle her on the spot for being a damned whore and being prettier than me and f**king my man.</p><p>I gave myself a mental smack.</p><p>I had no claim on Ruger. None. This was his house and he could do whatever he wanted in it, including this whore.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even want him, not really.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you Ruger\u2019s property?\u201d she asked me, eyes hostile, red-tipped talons tapping the bar idly.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think I understand the question,\u201d I replied, torn between staring at her perky, jiggly boobs and watching the trail of smoke rise from her cigarette toward the ceiling. Once that smoky smell gets into a house, you never get it back out.</p><p>Yet another reason to hate the bitch.</p><p>\u201cSimple yes or no,\u201d she said. \u201cYou belong to him? He patch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I said, glancing around the living room, growing pissier by the second, despite the fact that it was none of my business. This was going to take hours to clean and it sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be me doing it, I decided. Let the whore do it. Or Ruger himself\u2014what a concept!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a no ...\u201d she said slowly. \u201cSo why the hell are you here? Did he call you this morning? Seriously, if he wanted a three-way, he should\u2019ve talked to me earlier. No offense, but I can do better.\u201d</p><p>She looked me up and down as she said this, judging every inch of my body.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go back downstairs,\u201d I said with careful control. I turned to leave, but Ruger\u2019s voice stopped me.</p><p>\u201cYou still here?\u201d he called. The blonde answered, voice all sweet like honey, eyes sparkling with possessive triumph.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, baby. You need me?\u201d</p><p>Ruger strolled down the stairs and into the living room, wearing only a pair of unfastened jeans. I could tell this because they drooped low enough to leave very few secrets. Damn.</p><p>I knew Ruger was hot, but it seemed like I forgot just how hot whenever I didn\u2019t see him for a while, because it still shocked me. I could spend a year trying to describe him, but you still wouldn\u2019t fully appreciate his unique appeal until your panties spontaneously combusted the first time he smiled at you.</p><p>Or, in this case, when he walked through the living room wearing half-fastened jeans commando, eyes still sleepy.</p><p>My eyes caught on his chest, sliding down along the lines of his muscles. Oh, my ... Perfect pecs, sculpted obliques and abs. They disappeared into the denim, which just barely rode his hips, ready to slip at any minute. I wanted to lick him all over.</p><p>Right after I killed him for f**king The Blonde Slut.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said, looking from me to TBS. I raised my hand and gave a little finger wave, wondering if the knife in the laundry room was well-balanced for throwing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome back, Ruger,\u201d I said, trying not to sound like a jealous wife, because nothing crazy about that, right? \u201cHave a nice trip? Noah missed you. I was just going downstairs. Have a great morning.\u201d</p><p>TBS smirked, taking my attempted retreat as a victory for her. Or that\u2019s what I imagined was behind her smirk. For all I knew, that could have been her thank-God-I\u2019m-not-in-a-three-way-with-this-loser face.</p><p>Whatever it was, she could damned well shove it up her ass.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ruger said, staring at me intently. His eyes flicked down my figure, and no matter how hot the chick in the kitchen was, I could tell he still wanted me. His eyes were dark and needy like they\u2019d been the other night. And all those years ago, too ...</p><p>Nope, not going there, I reminded my brain. This situation\u2019s f**ked up enough already.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk. It\u2019s important,\u201d he told me. Then he glanced toward TBS. \u201cWe\u2019re done, time to go. Don\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>Wow. That was cold.</p><p>I liked it.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously want her over me?\u201d TBS demanded, looking between us, face genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s my nephew\u2019s mom,\u201d Ruger said, voice going hard and flat. \u201cOne of her in dirty sweats is worth ten of you naked on your knees, so get the f**k out.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that was sooo cold. Maybe I didn\u2019t hate him quite so much, because he might be an ass**le, but he was definitely being a bigger ass**le to her than to me. Justice, for once.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of a dick,\u201d TBS said, pouting.</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d he asked, walking past us to open the fridge. Ruger pulled out a container of orange juice and chugged it without using a glass. He finished, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and slammed it down on the counter. Juice splashed, reminding me of the brand-new, giant-ass mess everywhere else.</p><p>A mess I wouldn\u2019t be cleaning. Enough of this.</p><p>I needed to retreat back downstairs, away from this bitch and Ruger, the world\u2019s biggest ass**le. He ranked up there with the biggest pigs, too, based on what he\u2019d accomplished in one night with his friends. I turned to the stairs but his hand caught my arm, tight and unyielding as a handcuff. He tugged me through the kitchen to the bar, pushing me into a seat.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he ordered me, his eyes hard. Then he looked over at Blondie. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>His tone didn\u2019t leave room for discussion, and she jumped up, scowling. Ruger strode quickly across the living room and up the stairs. Blondie followed him, then ran back down fast, her clothes flying over the balcony from the loft.</p><p>Five minutes later she was gone with a massive slam of the front door and Ruger was back in the kitchen making me all nervous. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say to him. I hated him for bringing her home. I was jealous of her, because she was hot and she\u2019d felt his c**k inside her last night, when all I\u2019d gotten inside me was my vibrator. Hell, it wasn\u2019t even working right\u2014some sort of loose connection. Half the time it wouldn\u2019t turn on and I didn\u2019t have money to buy a new one. How pathetic was that?</p><p>Too broke to buy a damn vibrator.</p><p>Maybe I should stand outside the Adam &amp; Eve store holding a sign reading \u201cSingle Mom, Anything Helps\u201d and a cup for change.</p><p>Ruger narrowed his eyes at me. He still hadn\u2019t buttoned his pants. Holy shit. I sincerely hoped I wasn\u2019t drooling.</p><p>\u201cSo, tonight the girls from your club are coming over,\u201d I told him, trying to find a safe place for my eyes. They skittered across the tribal tattoo on his pec and caught on his nipple ring. I flushed. Definitely not there. \u201cI guess we\u2019re planning some sort of party for tomorrow at your club\u2019s armory? Do I want to know why your club has an armory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an actual National Guard Armory,\u201d he said. \u201cClub bought it when it got surplussed, years ago. It\u2019s got everything from a big kitchen and bar to rooms upstairs for people who need somewhere to crash for the night.\u201d</p> <p>So. His clubhouse had beds. Why did this not surprise me?</p><p>I wanted to ask him why he hadn\u2019t f**ked TBS there instead of bringing her home to me and Noah, but I couldn\u2019t think of a not-crazy way of doing it. Instead I decided to keep talking about my schedule.</p><p>\u201cThey had me line up a sleepover for Noah at my friend Kimber\u2019s house for tomorrow night,\u201d I said, eyes darting to his face. Not a flicker of recognition at her name. Good. \u201cAnyway, they invited me and I promised you I\u2019d give it a shot, so ... I\u2019ll see you at the party?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and studied me, utterly impossible to read. Silence stretched between us. I struggled not to start babbling just to fill the void.</p><p>\u201cBigger party than they think,\u201d he finally said, his voice low. It took me a minute to remember what we\u2019d been talking about. Oh, yeah. Party planning. Armory. \u201cWhole bunch of guys from all over coming in tonight and tomorrow. Not sure I want you there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, tongue flicking out to slide along his lower lip, catching on the ring. I wanted to flick it with my tongue, too. Then I caught a glimpse of something else ... Shit. His tongue was pierced. There was a hard, round ball right in the middle.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been there four years ago. I would\u2019ve remembered.</p><p>What would it feel like in my mouth ... or lower? I\u2019d never kissed a guy with a pierced tongue, let alone had one go down on me. I started tingling between my legs, which was not what I needed in that moment. Assholes this big shouldn\u2019t be so hot.</p><p>Hairy ears, I thought. Pretend he has hairy ears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very frustrating person, Ruger,\u201d I said, torn between bitching at him for being such a giant whore and jumping over the counter, ripping off his pants, and riding his cock. Not the best way to handle the situation.</p><p>I knew this.</p><p>Really.</p><p>\u201cYou say I shouldn\u2019t judge the club,\u201d I added, trying to focus. \u201cYou say you want me to get to know everyone, and that Noah\u2019s life would be better if he had the club behind him. If that\u2019s true, why can\u2019t I go to one of their parties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this one\u2019s gonna get pretty f**kin\u2019 wild. Not really a starter party,\u201d he said, unfolding his arms to brace them on the counter on either side of his body. I saw his biceps rippling under his full-sleeve tattoos. He had more ink across his shoulders, some kind of rounded slash things in addition to the pattern on his chest. There was another tat curling around his stomach from his hip. A panther disappearing down into his pants on one side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucky cat.</p><p>I really, really wanted to see the rest of it.</p><p>\u201cYou said some shit the other night that we gotta deal with. Um, Sophie? I have a face, you know,\u201d he added, and my eyes jerked up from his stomach. I felt myself flush and he stayed silent, watching me with hooded eyes. He raised a hand and rubbed the back of his neck, biceps and triceps flexing nicely, then scratched at his stomach. The muscles between my legs took note, pulsing their approval.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have to deal with?\u201d I asked, feeling my cheeks flush again.</p> <p>\u201cNo friends with benefits for you,\u201d he told me without a trace of humor. \u201cNo f**king around, no kissing, or even fluttering your goddamned eyelashes at any guy in the club. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be at the party. Or any club event.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at him and shook my head. No matter how uncomfortable this conversation might be, I needed to set some boundaries.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m single. If I meet someone I like, it\u2019s my decision whether I flirt with them or kiss them or whatever. And you\u2019re one to talk\u2014you just threw a naked chick out the door without even a thank-you for the road. Hypocrite much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house, my rules,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou go to that party, nothing happens. You\u2019re the Virgin f**kin\u2019 Mary, got me? Otherwise you stay home.\u201d</p><p>I thought about this, then straightened, placing my hands flat on the counter. Until that moment, I\u2019d been on the fence about the party. I wanted to give the club a shot, but I\u2019d been nervous about jumping in headfirst. Now? Now I\u2019d show up at that damned Armory if it killed me. I\u2019d flirt all over the place, too.</p> <p>Fuck him and his whore.</p><p>I glared at him. He glared back. Neither of us blinked.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot Ruger and I refused to talk about, and God knew he could hide his thoughts from me. Now I couldn\u2019t even begin to follow his logic\u2014he\u2019d made it clear nothing would happen between us, so why the jealous boyfriend act?</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d I asked finally. \u201cAre your friends so dangerous that I\u2019m not safe? Because you\u2019ve spent a lot of time giving me shit for assuming they\u2019re dangerous criminals instead of giving them a shot. So it\u2019s either that or because you\u2019re jealous. That it? You don\u2019t want me but nobody else gets me, either? Would it be easier if you peed on me so they know I\u2019m taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier if you\u2019d shut the f**k up,\u201d he said, eyes darkening.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you want from me? Silence?\u201d I demanded, feeling my temper rise. \u201cCall me stupid, but it seemed like you wanted a hell of a lot more the other night. You can\u2019t have it both ways, ass**le. Either there\u2019s something between us or I\u2019m a free agent.\u201d</p> <p>Ruger pushed away from the counter, holding my gaze as he stalked across the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can have it both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make assumptions about what I\u2019m capable of, Soph. I\u2019ll be nice and give you a heads-up what\u2019s happening here. I want to f**k you.\u201d</p><p>He rounded the kitchen island, prowling like the big cat tattooed on his hip. The kitchen felt smaller and smaller. I was all too aware of his bare chest, black ink rippling as he moved, and just how tightly controlled he kept his strength. Perhaps direct confrontation had been a mistake ...</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about guys like me,\u201d he continued, his voice low and smooth, eyes boring right through mine. \u201cWe don\u2019t do what we\u2019re supposed to. We take what we want. And me? I want all kinds of things. First I want to tie you up in my bed with my belt. Then I want to cut off your clothes and f**k you in every hole you have. I also want to come on you and rub it into your skin and lick your pu**y until you scream at me to stop because if you come one more time you\u2019ll die. Then I want to do it again. I want to own you, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>He stopped beside my stool, so close the heat of his body engulfed me. I couldn\u2019t even turn my head to look at him, frozen like a rabbit, his words turning over and over in my head. His scent surrounded me. I tried to breathe as he leaned in close, one arm braced on the counter, whispering in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI want to own every part of you,\u201d he continued, his breath hot against my skin. \u201cI want to throw you face-first across this counter, rip off those shorts, and f**k you hard and fast until my goddamned c**k stops hurting and my balls don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re gonna explode. Because they\u2019ve felt that way for a helluva long time, Soph, and I\u2019m startin\u2019 to think it\u2019s not gonna go away unless I do something about it.\u201d</p><p>It took everything I had not to squeak in panic. Every part of my body tingled and I clenched my legs together tightly, putting pressure on my clit with every pulse of desire. Oh, that felt good. Not good enough, though, I needed more. My cheeks flushed and my breath came quick. I considered reaching down and shoving my hand into those half-fastened pants. Maybe discover for myself if Kimber had been telling the truth about his c**k ...</p><p>Ruger hadn\u2019t even touched me.</p> <p>He still wasn\u2019t touching me. I bit back a moan.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s probably not a real good idea,\u201d he added, his voice cooling as he pulled back. \u201cWe both know it. Not what Noah needs and a f**kin\u2019 tar pit for you and me, too. But your idea about hooking up with one of my brothers? That keeps runnin\u2019 through my head, Soph, and then I start thinking about shootin\u2019 people. I don\u2019t want to have to shoot anyone tomorrow, get me? Shitty way to end a party. Not to mention the prez might get frustrated, one of the local brothers loses it in public with the whole f**kin\u2019 club here for a meet.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>I nodded, chest tightening.</p><p>\u201cSo, all things considered, you might think about doing exactly what I say at that f**kin\u2019 party,\u201d he said, and while he phrased it like a suggestion, it was a straight-up order. \u201cI get that you don\u2019t want someone like me in your bed, not as a keeper. Don\u2019t want things to get weirder than they are between us, either. But if you\u2019re gonna screw a biker, Soph, I\u2019m the only one you get. I won\u2019t stand by and let you f**k one of my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said all that,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong on so many levels. I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>He considered me, eyes hard, voice cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is. My house, my world, my rules. Tell me you understand and I\u2019ll let you go to the party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult,\u201d I managed to say, although my voice shook. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet I\u2019m doin\u2019 it,\u201d he returned, shrugging casually. \u201cDo you really think I won\u2019t enforce this? I\u2019ll f**kin\u2019 enforce it, Soph. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided about the party,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut I\u2019m done with this conversation. I\u2019m going back downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d he said, and that little, instinctive voice deep down inside me screaming to run finally won. I slid off the stool and made a break for the stairs. Big mistake, because Ruger caught me around the waist and lifted me up onto the kitchen bar, eyes blazing. Two seconds later he stepped in between my legs, one hand pulling me in tight and the other twisting through my hair, jerking my head back.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d I whispered. He cocked his head, as if considering the idea, then slowly shook it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. Then his lips covered mine and a fuse blew in my brain.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a polite kiss. It wasn\u2019t slow and seductive and deeply meaningful. This was an explosion of pent-up lust ... Years\u2019 worth, to be honest. Ruger\u2019s chest was like a concrete wall, and I wrapped my legs around his waist without a thought. His hand tightened in my hair, tilting my head to the side, giving him better access. His tongue was thrust deep and without mercy. The little ball in the center teased me, reminding me that sex with him would be different than anything I\u2019d felt before. His c**k pushed into my stomach so hard it almost hurt.</p><p>Holy hell, I wished we weren\u2019t wearing so many clothes.</p><p>Ruger slid his hand into my tank, pulling his torso back just enough to cup my breast. His fingers found my nipple, tweaking it through the thin silk of my bra as I arched my back, desperate for more. He tore his mouth free, and we stared at each other, panting, mesmerized.</p><p>\u201cWe decided this is a bad idea,\u201d I reminded him rather desperately, wondering how he\u2019d feel if I just leaned forward and sucked on his lip. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off it, all dark red and glistening with a sheen of moisture from our kiss. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk today. No excuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to get laid,\u201d he replied, pupils dark and full. \u201cI\u2019m here. It\u2019s already all screwed up between us, so why not make the most of it? Damage is done, we\u2019re totally f**ked. I can\u2019t forget how you tasted the other night, or how you felt on top of me on that couch. I need inside you, Soph.\u201d</p><p>Oh, so tempting ...</p><p>But could I keep messing around with Ruger and still live here? I\u2019d lusted after him forever, and there was no question he wanted me. Then I thought about the woman who\u2019d sat naked in this very kitchen just half an hour ago. The purple panties. The green bra ... All in Ruger\u2019s house, which was supposed to be Noah\u2019s refuge.</p><p>Sleeping with Ruger was suicide.</p><p>I felt like banging my head against something hard, but only his chest was handy and getting closer to that expanse of bare skin was the last thing I needed.</p><p>\u201cBad idea,\u201d I said. His fingers rolled my nipple. His other hand lowered to brace my hips as he rubbed the rigid length of his c**k against my clit. That slow back-and-forth would only get better once he slid inside me.</p><p>I felt all wound up inside, almost dizzy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted anything more than I wanted him in my body.</p><p>Except a decent life for Noah.</p><p>\u201cIf we do this, you can just move along afterward,\u201d I told him, closing my eyes. My sex clenched tight, desperate and empty. I tried to ignore it. \u201cWho you sleep with is nothing to you, Ruger. But I\u2019m different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who was talking friends with benefits,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhy\u2019s your story changin\u2019 now? Scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I\u2019m scared,\u201d I replied, opening my eyes again, searching his face. I saw no mercy or understanding there, just harsh, unyielding lust. \u201cI live with you and I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go. I found three pairs of panties in your couch cushions yesterday, and none of them were the same size. I don\u2019t think I can sleep with you and then nod and smile while a parade of women passes through the house. Sounds like a pretty good reason not to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell were you looking through my couch cushions?\u201d he asked, and his hips stilled.</p> <p>I\u2019d caught him off guard with that one.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned your house,\u201d I replied. \u201cKind of a surprise-slash-thank-you-present. Your company last night pretty much took care of that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered, shaking his head slowly, hips starting to rock again. Oh, that was nice ... His c**k felt so good rubbing against my most sensitive spot. Could I come from just that, even with the fabric between us? \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I didn\u2019t even know they were coming over. Don\u2019t suppose that\u2019s much of an excuse.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, unable to meet his gaze. I looked at his tattoos instead. Most of them were high quality, fanciful designs clearly put together by a true artist. He took his body art seriously, I realized. Ink wasn\u2019t just a whim. I\u2019d bet he had a story for each one, and I wanted to hear those stories far more than was healthy.</p><p>Ruger eyed me thoughtfully, rubbing the tip of my nipple with his finger in a slow circle. Then he took my hand and slid it down between us, pressing it against the length of his hard cock, the backs of his own fingers brushing my clit. I gasped and squirmed. My grip tightened, shaping him through the stiff fabric of his jeans. Even through the denim, I could tell he was big and broad, much bigger than my vibrator. Was that hard bump near the tip his ...? I didn\u2019t even know what to call it. I wanted to see it\u2014to see all of him\u2014so badly I could\u2019ve died. His knuckles framed my clit and I moaned.</p><p>Ruger\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cYou want this as much as I do,\u201d he said, voice soft. \u201cIt\u2019s not goin\u2019 away. We\u2019re just going to burn up higher and higher until one of us explodes and we get hurt. Let\u2019s end it now. I need inside you, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed to be inside your blonde last night,\u201d I replied quietly. \u201cAnd look how that ended. You going to kick me and Noah out if things get awkward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cAbout kicking us out? It\u2019s not going to work, us sleeping together and you sleeping around. Some random guy I could just ditch, but I\u2019m stuck with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWrong about needin\u2019 to be inside her last night,\u201d he corrected me. \u201cI needed you. You\u2019re all I thought about while I was gone. Went to sleep every night with a stiff dick, woke up harder, didn\u2019t matter how much I jerked off or who I f**ked. Riding home from Portland last night, I knew that if I came back into this house all dark and quiet, I\u2019d go downstairs and find you. I\u2019d crawl into your bed and stick my fingers into your pu**y and open you up for me whether you wanted it or not. So I tried something else, because we decided we weren\u2019t going to screw around with each other. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>My hand had started rubbing his dick through the rough fabric. It was hard to focus on his words, between that and his knuckles stroking my clit. They\u2019d found a steady rhythm up and down, and my hips rolled into them ever so slightly, rebelling against all rational thought.</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause when I saw her, I wanted to kill her. And you. I don\u2019t have any right to feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any right to put you off limits, either,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m doin\u2019 it anyway. No f**kin\u2019 around with anyone at the club. Make that no f**kin\u2019 around, period. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my hand and slid it down into his jeans, fingers tracing his naked cock. I found the metal bar piercing his glans\u2014two hard, metal balls capped it, top and bottom. I touched it softly and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cImagine those deep inside you,\u201d he muttered, closing his eyes and as his hips spasmed. \u201cFirst I\u2019ll rub them against your clit, and then they\u2019ll hit your G-spot the whole damned time I\u2019m riding you. Un-fucking-believable, babe.\u201d</p><p>I tightened inside at the thought, nearly undone. I played with them a few seconds longer then moved lower, gripping his shaft firmly. He moaned and I tightened my fingers, almost angry because I wanted him so bad.</p><p>Ruger opened his eyes, giving me a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to hurt me?\u201d he whispered. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll never be able to, babe. Squeeze me hard as you like. I get off on it. I\u2019m stronger than you, which means in the end, I\u2019ll win. That\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d I replied softly. He leaned forward, resting his forehead against mine. His fingers pulled away from the front of my cutoffs to slip inside. I felt them lower, one on either side of my clit, fluttering and squeezing. His c**k pulsed in my hand, hot and hard, the ball brushing lightly against the inside of my wrist.</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t fair,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSometimes you just have to make the most of what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould this be a one-time thing?\u201d I asked, so tempted. Could I do it? Just give in for once, then go back to pretending it never happened?</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he replied, voice lowering, growing harsher. \u201cProbably take more than once, gettin\u2019 out from under each other\u2019s skin. I\u2019ve wanted you a long time, Soph. Never forgot how you tasted, not for one single f**kin\u2019 day in the last four years. Jesus, you were sweet.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught.</p><p>\u201cAnd after it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe move along,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ll show you respect, you do the same for me. Won\u2019t bring any women here. Shouldn\u2019t have done it anyway, got beds at the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll move on,\u201d I said slowly, feeling something deep inside me tear apart. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll just be another in your lineup, because that\u2019s what you do. You f**k women, and then you f**k them over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than f**king my hand,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ve never pretended to be somethin\u2019 I\u2019m not, babe. I\u2019m not gonna settle down. I don\u2019t want to commit. I love my life the way it is. Most guys feel the same way\u2014the difference between them and me is I\u2019ll never lie to you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why this is such a huge mistake,\u201d I told him, wishing it could be different. I hurt, and not just from frustrated desire. I\u2019d always known this about him, but hearing him say it so bluntly ... that got to me. \u201cI should go downstairs right now and we\u2019ll forget it ever happened.\u201d</p><p>But my hand kept sliding up and down his cock, reaching up and catching on the metal as I found his pre-come, using it to ease my way back down. His fingers kept moving on my clit, rolling it as a shiver tore through me. My inner muscles clenched and I knew I had to be dripping wet by now.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop soon,\u201d he said, rubbing his nose along mine oh-so-slowly. \u201cJust one more taste.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s lips parted mine again, tongue plunging deep, filling my mouth the way I wanted him to fill my body. It was hard to focus on all the sensations\u2014Ruger\u2019s hungry kiss, his fingers gliding along my clit. His hard c**k in my hand, pulsing as those two metal balls taunted me. All of it blended into one big ball of aching, burning need. Then his fingers moved faster and I gave up everything but my own pleasure.</p><p>Tension built in me as he pulled his mouth free, tugging up my shirt. The cup of my bra came down and his mouth took my breast, sucking it in deep and hard, flicking the peak with his tongue. The hard metal tormented my nipple, the contrast between solid steel and hot flesh destroying my ability to think. Ruger\u2019s powerful body surrounded me. His fingers played me and I couldn\u2019t do anything but fall back into the incredible intensity of his touch on my clit.</p> <p>I was close now, panting harshly.</p><p>Ruger\u2019s mouth still held my nipple trapped. He caught the other in his fingers, tugging and jerking everything all together. I whimpered, so close I could taste it but needing just a little more to go over the edge. Then he stopped teasing and pushed down against my clit, rough and demanding. My hips convulsed as I came, twisting on the counter shamelessly. Ruger covered my mouth with his once more, kissing me softly as the tremors ran through me, leaving me limp in his arms.</p><p>Then he lifted his head, meeting my eyes.</p><p>The hunger in his face was intense, more than I\u2019d ever seen on a man. I\u2019d stopped stroking him in the thick of things, but I still held his cock. He\u2019d gotten thicker, and now I pumped his length hard. His fluid coated everything and my fingers slipped across his pierced head as he arched in my hand. We stayed like that, locking gazes, as I worked him faster and faster. After a minute his face darkened and his breath quickened.</p><p>Then he reached between us, pushing down his jeans and pulling his c**k fully free, hand covering mine. He started jerking our joined hands up and down together, much rougher than I\u2019d do on my own. The heel of my hand caught his pierced head each time, and he growled, primal and hungry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me f**k you, Sophie,\u201d Ruger gasped, his voice full of pain. I shook my head, closing my eyes because I didn\u2019t want him to see how close I was to giving in.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, almost crying because it hurt so bad to say it. \u201cI\u2019m not going to screw you and then watch you with other women. I can\u2019t do it. I know myself, Ruger. Unless you can tell me right here, right now that you want to seriously try to make something together, I can\u2019t sleep with you. Let me finish this and then it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand, squeezing it tight around his c**k and closed his eyes, shuddering. Then he pulled my hand away with visible pain and twisted it behind my back, jerking my body forward into his, transforming me from lover to prisoner so casually it terrified me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no lie here,\u201d Ruger said, voice grating. His face flushed dark red and his chest heaved, eyes burning. Every part of him was rock hard, from his chest crushing my br**sts to the naked c**k pressed into my belly. \u201cNo manipulation between us. It is what it is. But I\u2019ll give you the ride of your life, Soph. That I guarantee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ride of my life?\u201d I asked, the words hitting me like cold water, breaking through my fog of stupidity.</p><p>Holy hell. What was I doing?</p><p>I\u2019d lost my f**king mind.</p><p>Ruger might be a great uncle, but I couldn\u2019t trust him for shit with my body, let alone my heart.</p><p>\u201cZach already gave me the ride of my life, Ruger,\u201d I said, making every word count. \u201cI learned my lesson from him. Sex is short and it changes everything. That\u2019s something men like you can\u2019t begin to understand.\u201d</p> <p>He jerked away from me, mouth tight and eyes hard, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you\u2019re a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bitch,\u201d I replied, and it took everything I had to keep my voice steady. \u201cI\u2019m a mother. I can\u2019t afford to play games with you, Ruger. You\u2019ll break me, and that will break Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d he muttered, slamming his hand next to me on the counter. I jumped, almost scared as he reached down to tuck himself back into his pants, visibly pained. He refused to step away or allow me any kind of escape, taking my shoulders in his big hands with a jerk.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 is changed,\u201d he said, eyes burning with anger and frustrated need. My breath caught\u2014Ruger had always been scary ... But because there\u2019s something wrong with me, seeing him this angry turned me on, too. He leached the common sense right out of my body. \u201cYou go to that party, you keep your hands off. That\u2019s a f**kin\u2019 order. No flirtin\u2019, no makin\u2019 out, no touchin\u2019, nothin\u2019. These aren\u2019t Boy Scouts, and they won\u2019t be happy if you start something you don\u2019t plan to finish. You\u2019re off bounds. We clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI understand you completely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank f**k for that,\u201d he muttered, letting me go and stepping back. Finally. I took a deep breath, dizzy with relief. He ran a hand across his hair, glaring a hole through me. \u201cNow get your ass out of my house. Go for a car ride, go shopping, whatever the f**k you want, but don\u2019t come back until you\u2019ve picked Noah up from school. I\u2019ll be gone by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seriously think that\u2019s any of your business?\u201d he asked, raising his brows. \u201cBecause we aren\u2019t f**k buddies, you aren\u2019t my old lady, and I sure as f**k don\u2019t remember puttin\u2019 you in charge of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d I said. But you don\u2019t get to control me, either, I thought, way too chicken to say it out loud. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. You aren\u2019t anything like Zach. I know that. But this isn\u2019t just about us, it\u2019s about Noah. He\u2019s not losing another home because we can\u2019t keep our pants on, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever done anything\u2014anything\u2014to hurt that child?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d do it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the f**k out before I change my mind, Sophie. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>I got the f**k out.</p> <p>KIMBER: No f**king way!!!!! Ur f**king with me!!!!!! His dick in ur hand and u still said NO?!??</p><p>ME: I wish it was a joke.

You told me to stay awy from him, rmemember?</p><p>KIMBER: Um, it\u2019s worse already, dumbass, u blew it. Ur screwed and there\u2019s no out. Sex is just the symptom. This is about u guys being all twisted up with each other. He wants u way more than I thought</p><p>ME: No shit</p><p>KIMBER: U are so dens. This morning was gamechanger. Remember\u2014I kno him. He\u2019s not like this with other women. I take back what I said about it being a bad idea. U should have sex. Mite as well get the fun if ur paying the price\u2014it\u2019s already f**ked up past the point of no return</p><p>ME: Thats the truth. Weirder every day.

See you tonight &lt;3</p><p>My eyeballs were going to explode.</p><p>Or maybe just pop out of my head?</p><p>I\u2019d never tasted anything quite like the flaming shot prepared by my new best friend, Em. I nearly snorted it out my nose, but managed to hold on to token dignity as my throat ignited and my eyes watered. The circle of women around the deck table burst out cackling like a bunch of witches, so I flipped all of them off.</p><p>They laughed louder.</p><p>My morning encounter with Ruger might\u2019ve been bizarre and tense and frustrating as all hell, but the evening had shaped up nicely. Four lady Reapers had arrived a little after seven\u2014Maggs, Em, Marie, and Dancer. They brought pizza, beer, and a bunch of those tiny bottles of hard liquor, the kind you get on airplanes. I\u2019d been a little overwhelmed at first, trying to keep everyone straight, but by now I\u2019d figured them out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maggs was Bolt\u2019s old lady, and he was in prison. She looked very normal for a woman with a man in jail, and not \u201cold\u201d at all. I didn\u2019t think much of this whole \u201cold lady\u201d business, but the Reaper girls seemed to use it with pride. Maggs had shaggy, shoulder-length blonde hair full of wild curls. She was petite and perky and had such an infectious smile you couldn\u2019t help but smile back at her.</p><p>I really, really wanted to ask why her man was locked up, but managed to keep my mouth shut for once.</p><p>Dancer was tall and elegant, with bronzed skin and long, straight hair. Had to be part Indian, I decided. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe? I didn\u2019t want to ask, but it seemed likely, since she\u2019d grown up here. She was married to a guy called Bam Bam, and Horse was her half brother, born right after her mother married his father when she was two years old. Em was young, probably younger than me. She had the most amazing sky-blue eyes with dark rings around the edges of her irises. She was about my height and had brown hair pulled back in a messy bun. She was Picnic\u2019s daughter, whoever he was.</p><p>The last of the old ladies was Marie, a short girl with lots of long, brown, wavy hair and a bright, bubbly personality. She was with Horse, which I found hard to picture. He was huge\u2014you\u2019d think he\u2019d break her or something. She wore an unusual engagement ring, a blue stone surrounded by sparkling diamonds. Apparently the wedding was at the end of the month. The big, intense biker I\u2019d met in Seattle hardly seemed like the type to get hitched, but he was obviously ready to sign on the dotted line for Marie.</p> <p>She made it clear I was invited to the wedding and her bachelorette party, the likes of which would put the Reaper men to shame.</p><p>Attendance was not optional.</p><p>When they\u2019d rung the front doorbell on arrival, it was the first time I\u2019d come back upstairs to see the ruins of the kitchen and living room. Surprisingly, Ruger had cleaned up quite a bit since that morning. The place didn\u2019t shine like before, but the bottles were gone and he\u2019d put the love seat back on the floor. The women came through the door in a wave, all hugs and smiles and bags of food and drink. I showed them downstairs and introduced them to Noah, who\u2019d spent the afternoon picking wildflowers in honor of our dinner together. My grubby little boy melted them instantly, of course.</p><p>\u201cI have a son who\u2019s a year older than you and another who\u2019s a year younger,\u201d Dancer told him. \u201cMaybe you can meet them sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have Skylanders?\u201d Noah asked, never shy. \u201cIf they have Skylanders, we should play at your house. Otherwise they should come here, because I want to show them the pond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ll talk to your mom and get it figured out,\u201d Dancer said.</p><p>Noah shrugged and took off outside again. He wasn\u2019t one for wasting time on useless conversation.</p><p>The only awkward moment was when Kimber arrived, shortly after I put Noah to bed. She marched down the stairs smiling brightly, but when they saw her, Maggs and Dancer got funny looks on their faces. Whatever they knew about her, Em and Marie clearly weren\u2019t aware of it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Kimber,\u201d my friend said, setting a blender on the counter. She surveyed the room and crossed her arms, planting herself firmly. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. I used to work at The Line and I screwed Ruger and a lot of other guys. Mostly customers, but a few from the club. Anything else we need to talk about, or does that about cover it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Em said, eyes wide. \u201cYou make a hell of an entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better if I could carry the vodka and mix with me in one trip with the blender,\u201d Kimber replied seriously. \u201cNow\u2014you girls into huckleberry margaritas? I\u2019m kind of a margarita artist, or so I\u2019ve heard. We can hang out and have a great time and drink together if you like. Or you can take turns calling me a whore, which is a lot less fun for all of us, but still doable. Either way, I\u2019m not leaving, so let\u2019s process and move on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou screw Bolt, Horse, or Bam Bam?\u201d Em asked, clearly fascinated. The tension in the air suddenly grew heavy.</p><p>Kimber shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t even know who Horse is. Met Bolt and Bam Bam a few times, but never got close to them. They\u2019re whipped\u2014at least that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the sound of that,\u201d Dancer murmured, a slow smile crossing her lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll just skip the whore thing, then?\u201d</p><p>The tension broke, and Kimber demonstrated that she was, indeed, something of a margarita artist.</p><p>Now it was nearly midnight and we\u2019d progressed past blender drinks. Kimber had been queen of the party girls in high school, and clearly she hadn\u2019t given up her title entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand,\u201d she said, her voice grave as we sat in a circle around Ruger\u2019s deck table. \u201cI love being a mom. But I need to get out sometimes, you know? I had no idea their little bodies held so many fluids!\u201d</p><p>Dancer started laughing so hard she almost fell out of her chair.</p> <p>\u201cKnow the feeling,\u201d she gasped. \u201cSometimes it starts spraying out and out and out and you\u2019d think they\u2019d deflate or something!\u201d</p><p>I gave Kimber a loud high five, happy she had a kid she loved and even happier mine was mostly past the spraying phase.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not having babies anytime soon,\u201d Em declared. \u201cLose your freedom and your mind, apparently. You\u2019re pathetic, all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta have sex first to have a kid,\u201d Marie said, waggling her eyebrows dramatically as she poked Em\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI keep telling you, we need to just go out and get you laid. Get it over with, punch that V-card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I get ten punches, do I get a free pizza?\u201d Em asked her. \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m waiting at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t bother waiting for Painter,\u201d Maggs said, rolling her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s had his full patch for three months now. He hasn\u2019t manned up yet, it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>Em frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI was into him, okay? Liked him a lot, actually. But he blew it. He cares more about not pissing off my dad than being with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, your dad has a bit of a reputation,\u201d Dancer said, her voice dry. \u201cHe shot your last boyfriend. Thinking about that\u2019s gotta mess with a man\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Em with new interest, trying to remember who her dad was. Oh, yeah. Her dad was Picnic. Picnic? What kind of name was that? Almost as weird as Horse ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with all these names?\u201d I demanded abruptly, swaying in my seat. They all looked at me blankly. \u201cPicnic? Bam Bam? Horse?!? Who names their baby Horse? And what the hell is Ruger all about? His name is Jesse, for God\u2019s sake. I met his mom and she told me.\u201d</p><p>They all burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I asked, feeling put out. It was a serious question.</p><p>\u201cYou thought they were real names!\u201d Marie asked, losing it again. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I know exactly how you feel. I asked the same question. Horse is a f**king ridiculous name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that a trick question? I don\u2019t want to insult the guy you\u2019re marrying. Also, he\u2019s scary. He has a metal bat and likes to carry around duct tape. All he needs is black plastic garbage bags and he could be a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward and jabbed a finger to make my point.</p><p>\u201cI know these things. I watch TV.\u201d</p><p>Marie snorted so hard margarita came out her nose.</p> <p>\u201cHorse\u2019s real name is Marcus,\u201d Dancer said, giggling and rolling her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother, by the way. Horse is just his road name\u2014like a nickname, you know? Most of the guys have \u2019em. Girls, too. Dancer\u2019s my road name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d Dancer replied primly.</p><p>\u201cAgrippina,\u201d Em declared proudly. \u201cI shit you not.\u201d</p><p>Dancer blew a stream of frozen margarita at Em through her straw.</p><p>\u201cTraitorous bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you f**king with us?\u201d Kimber asked, looking between them. \u201cAgrippina? After Agrippina the Younger or Agrippina the Elder?\u201d</p><p>We all looked at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cMom had a thing for Roman history,\u201d Dancer said after a pause. I shook my head, trying to follow the conversation. The drinks weren\u2019t helping. Oh, yeah. Road names.</p><p>\u201cSo why is he called Horse?\u201d I asked. Marie blushed bright red and looked away.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Dancer said, smacking the table for emphasis. \u201cHorse says he\u2019s called that because he\u2019s hung like one. But I know the real reason. When he was a kid\u2014like three, four years old maybe?\u2014he used to carry around this little stuffed horsie all the time, slept with it and everything. One day he and I got in a fight and he started hitting me with it, over and over again. Mom took it away from him and gave it to me. He started following me around crying, \u2018Horsie, Horsie,\u2019 all the time, and it stuck.\u201d</p><p>Marie\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king serious?\u201d she asked. Dancer nodded, her face full of the kind of evil glee only an older sister can express. \u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s hysterical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis dad insisted it was because he had a big dick, right to the day he died,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I swear to you\u2014it\u2019s because of that stuffed animal of his. Don\u2019t let him fool you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever give it back to him?\u201d Em asked breathlessly. Dancer shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI still have it,\u201d she declared. \u201cAnd I promise you this, Marie. The day you marry his stupid ass, I\u2019ll give it to you. That\u2019ll keep him in his place.\u201d</p><p>We all lost it again. Kimber poured another round of margaritas from the king-sized pitcher she\u2019d found in Ruger\u2019s kitchen. This party wasn\u2019t ending anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cSo are all the names like that?\u201d I asked when I could speak. \u201cI mean, shouldn\u2019t bikers have cool names, like Killer or Shark or Thor\u2019s Revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThor\u2019s Revenge?\u201d Maggs asked, raising a brow. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just silly,\u201d Em broke in. \u201cRoad names stick because something happens to make \u2019em stick. You know, a funny story or something stupid someone does. You earn them\u2014just like any nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmy Lou Who, for example,\u201d Dancer said, blinking innocently. Em\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up, Agrippina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, they also serve a purpose,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cIf people don\u2019t know your real name, makes it harder for them to rat you out to the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s \u2018Ruger\u2019 all about?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe\u2019s been called that forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Dancer said, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him\u2014Ruger is a gun brand, that might be it. Picnic got his because he threw a guy through a picnic table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of ...\u201d Marie said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finished talking about Em\u2019s situation. You need to get your dad to back off, babe. Nobody will date you so long as he keeps shooting your boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t shoot him because he was dating me,\u201d Em snapped. \u201cIt was a hunting accident and he\u2019s fine. The fact that he was cheating on me is a total coincidence.\u201d</p><p>The women burst out laughing again, while Kimber and I stared.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and keep telling yourself that,\u201d Dancer murmured.</p><p>I made a mental note to learn this story as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else,\u201d Em declared. She looked around the table, searching for a new victim. Her eyes reached me, filling with sudden, unholy glee. \u201cLike ... hmmm ... So tell us, Sophie. What\u2019s the scoop with you and Ruger? You guys f**king or what?\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2014even Kimber\u2014looked at me. Kimber stared, silently urging me to speak. I kept my mouth shut and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cShit, I have to do everything,\u201d she burst out. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the whole story.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later they knew far too much about me and Ruger, and I\u2019d silently vowed never to tell Kimber anything again. Ever. Not even where I stored the toilet paper, because that\u2019s how untrustworthy she was.</p><p>\u201cAnd he just tucked in his dick and walked away?\u201d Em asked for the third time, clearly awed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even start yelling or throwing shit?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I should\u2019ve been embarrassed, but I was a little too drunk to fully appreciate my humiliation. Stupid Kimber. Backstabbing bitch.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man-whore,\u201d Kimber declared, shrugging. \u201cWho knows why guys like that do anything? Instead of wondering why he did it, we need to focus on the real problem. How do we get them into bed with each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said. \u201cI am not sleeping with him. Didn\u2019t you get the whole point of the story? That would f**k things up for me and Noah living here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, it\u2019s already f**ked up,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was all in favor of avoiding him, but then you crossed the Rubicon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMeans we need to adjust our plan of action. Avoidance is no longer an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what the hell is a Rubicon?\u201d I asked her. Kimber sighed heavily, clearly frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the river that separates Cisalpine Gaul from Italy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s where Roman generals used to leave their armies before returning home, as a sign they weren\u2019t a threat to the Roman Republic. Two thousand years ago, Julius Caesar had to make a decision whether to obey the Senate or bring his troops home with him, starting a civil war. His legions crossed the Rubicon, which led to the end of the Republic. Not officially, of course. Augustus was the first to acknowledge dicatorship openly. Fuckin\u2019 turning point in Western civilization, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>We all stared at her, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you learn all that?\u201d I asked her. Kimber rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCollege,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a history minor. Christ, is there a law that strippers can\u2019t read or something? Now, please, focus. All of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom would like you,\u201d Dancer said. \u201cShe would like you a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Kimber shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThis whole situation is like a great big zit that needs popping,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe damage is already done\u2014your face looks like shit and no concealer\u2019s gonna cover it. You might as well squeeze hard and get your money shot. You\u2019ll both feel better afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwwwww ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the least sexy thing I\u2019ve ever heard anyone say about sex,\u201d Maggs announced. \u201cFor the first time in two years, I\u2019m kind of glad Bolt\u2019s in jail, because there\u2019s no damned way I\u2019d touch his c**k tonight after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it like I see it,\u201d Kimber declared. \u201cNow, let\u2019s figure out the best way for Sophie to start screwing Ruger without letting him think he\u2019s won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKimber,\u201d I growled, lunging toward her. I bumped the pitcher of huckleberry margaritas instead, which splashed across the table, dousing Maggs, Dancer, and Marie with sticky, sugary, boozey deliciousness.</p> <p>Everyone burst out laughing again, and this time Dancer actually did fall off her chair, which made it even funnier.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for making fun of my historical analogies!\u201d Kimber howled at us gleefully. \u201cI am the QUEEN. You do what I tell you, bitches!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d I announced, dipping a finger into the puddle on the table and tasting it. Sooo good. What a waste. \u201cBut you\u2019re right about one thing. I may be a petty, selfish person, but I don\u2019t want him to win. He always wins. I think you might be right about popping the zit, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an important discussion,\u201d Maggs said solemnly, holding up a hand to halt us. \u201cAnd as the senior old ladies present, Dancer and I will moderate it as soon as we get changed. Is it okay if we dig through your closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cHere, let me come help you find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Dancer said, giggling. \u201cWe\u2019ll find it. We know our way around the apartment already.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her happily.</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d I told them all. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how amazing it was to come here and find everything all fixed up. Noah loves his room, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we do,\u201d Maggs said. Marie grinned at me, then shivered, rubbing her arms up and down.</p><p>\u201cThis stuff is cold. Let\u2019s get changed,\u201d she said, and the three women took off down the outside stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some hot water to pour over this mess,\u201d I said, contemplating the Great Margarita Lake. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something we can use in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>We trooped into the house, and I rummaged through Ruger\u2019s kitchen cupboards until I found two big mixing bowls, which we used to pour hot water over the table. Then we flopped back in the chairs and Kimber made herself useful for once, asking the question that\u2019d been eating at me all night.</p><p>\u201cSo, you really a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Em said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOooh, mostly,\u201d Kimber said, leaning forward, practically quivering with curiosity. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to that in a minute. Now tell me what\u2019s up with the V-card. How old are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-two,\u201d Em said. She didn\u2019t seem to mind the questions at all. Kimber wasn\u2019t the only one with boundary issues. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a virgin because I haven\u2019t wanted to just do it with some random guy to get it over with. But every non-random guy I meet is scared of my dad. To be fair, he really is scary. My sister stands up to him, but it seems like I never can. Now I\u2019m stuck at home, while she\u2019s loving life in Olympia. She\u2019s my little sister\u2014still can\u2019t figure out how that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always lived at home?\u201d Kimber asked, her eyes wide with something like horror. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re a virgin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I lived in Seattle for my first semester of college,\u201d Em explained. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to be, and as soon as word about my dad got out, the guys stayed away from me. Didn\u2019t help that he showed up at my dorm one day and made a public announcement that any guy who tried to get me naked would lose his dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I muttered, eyes wide. Kimber swallowed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard-core,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Em rolled her eyes and threw up her hands in disgust.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dad. Mom used to keep him under control, but she\u2019s been gone for a while now. He\u2019s the club president, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone to stand up to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this Painter guy?\u201d I asked. Em groaned and dropped her head to the table, banging it dramatically.</p><p>\u201cPainter,\u201d she said. \u201cPainter is a pain in my ass. He was a Reapers prospect until a few months ago. Got his patch now. He seems to like me, he\u2019s flirted with me, and he\u2019ll scare off other guys who come around me, yet when I tried to jump his bones in the dark he ran away like a f**king chicken. Every. Single. Time.\u201d</p><p>Kimber shook her head knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYup, scared of daddy,\u201d she said. \u201cLost cause, babe. You need to find someone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Em said, her voice wistful. \u201cI could kind of understand it back when he was a prospect, so I cut him some slack. Prospecting\u2019s hard work. But he\u2019s got his colors now. He needed to put up or shut up, so that\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned straight,\u201d Kimber said, banging her fist down on the deck table. The whole thing rattled and we all jumped a little. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Spokane next weekend, the three of us. The way I see it, Maggs, Marie, and Dancer have to rat you out, because they\u2019re part of the club. But me and Sophie? We\u2019re free agents. Let\u2019s get your card punched with someone disposable, and then work on finding you a man who\u2019s not a f**king pu**y. This Painter guy is full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been talking to someone online,\u201d Em admitted, flushing a little. \u201cI really like him. A lot. We\u2019ve been chatting for a couple months, but we just started calling each other sometimes. I\u2019m pretty into him, but I kept hoping Painter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew Painter,\u201d Kimber declared. \u201cHe\u2019s not a real man. Maybe your online guy isn\u2019t either, but we\u2019ve got your back. See if he\u2019s available next week, let\u2019s get this thing done. We\u2019ll meet up in a public place. Get our own hotel rooms, so we can make sure you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p> <p>Em\u2019s eyes grew bright. The whole idea seemed sort of half-cocked to me, and I frowned.</p><p>\u201cOkay ...\u201d she said. \u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to do this. But what about Sophie? I don\u2019t think Ruger would want her going out like that.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I didn\u2019t care how stupid it sounded. Ruger wasn\u2019t in charge. Fuck him. Nothing quite like flaming shots to give a girl courage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d I declared. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Em asked, peering at me in the darkness. \u201cWe\u2019d really just go out and do this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? Ruger\u2019s not my boss. And Kimber needs to get out sometimes, too. We\u2019ll check this guy out and make a call for you about whether he\u2019s worthy. There\u2019s always more guys if he\u2019s not. Trust me, if Kimber can\u2019t find you a man, he doesn\u2019t exist. She\u2019s like a sexual bloodhound. Always has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned straight,\u201d Kimber said without a trace of embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Ryan if he can watch Noah for you, Soph. He owes me. He gets to play poker every single week, and when I was pregnant I told him that if I was sober, he should be sober, too. He totally ignored me. Also, he bought me a minivan. A f**king minivan. What kind of man does that to a woman?\u201d</p><p>I started giggling. Em joined me, and then all three of us were laughing, and I\u2019m still not entirely sure why. We were still cackling like drunken hyenas when Marie, Dancer, and Maggs got back. They looked funny in my clothes, particularly Dancer, who was way too tall and more than a little too curvy. She\u2019d found some yoga pants and an old T-shirt, both of which were extremely tight in critical areas.</p><p>\u201cBam is going to love this,\u201d she said, twirling for us and shaking her ass dramatically. \u201cIf he\u2019s home tonight. Anyone know the schedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty tonight for the brothers coming in,\u201d Marie said. \u201cGuess some kind of big club meeting is going down? Horse will be here in about an hour to give us rides home. Me and Maggs are throwing together breakfast tomorrow, if anyone wants to help. They\u2019ve already lined up a pig to roast for the afternoon, so all we need to worry about is snacks and sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do a Costco run in the morning,\u201d Dancer said. \u201cEm, wanna come with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cDad said they\u2019ll be done with church around four. You can come out anytime after that, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurch?\u201d I asked, startled. Dancer snickered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they call their meetings,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo idea why, just always been that way as long as anyone can remember. Nothing to do with us, though\u2014club business. Don\u2019t worry about that. Your job is to have fun at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to the party,\u201d I said, losing some of my bravado. \u201cAfter Ruger\u2019s little tantrum, I think it might better if I stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Dancer said firmly. \u201cWhatever\u2019s between you two\u2014and don\u2019t think we\u2019ve forgotten, that conversation was interrupted just when it was getting interesting\u2014needs to be resolved. Otherwise you\u2019ll kill each other at this rate. Going to the party is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019ll either lose his shit or he won\u2019t,\u201d she replied. \u201cI mean, some guy is going to talk to you at some point. Ruger loses it, we\u2019ll see some action and you\u2019ll get things figured out. He doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re off the hook and life can get back to normal. Either way, we\u2019ll be there to watch it all, and in the end, it\u2019s really all about us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, this may shock you, but Ruger can be scary,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him losing his shit. It\u2019s happened before and it wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Maggs assured me. \u201cThese things work out at the Armory, no worries there. Maybe a good fight will clear his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Marie said. \u201cGet it out in the open. If you\u2019re in front of the club, he\u2019ll have to claim you as his property or let you go. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t find it even a little bit creepy to be called property?\u201d I asked. They all burst out laughing again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different world, Sophie,\u201d Marie said finally. \u201cTrust me, I get how weird it sounds. When Horse first asked me to be his property, I dumped his ass. I didn\u2019t get it back then\u2014it\u2019s like their own language. To bikers, being property means you\u2019re important, special. Being an old lady is an honor and they treat it with huge respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I wonder,\u201d Kimber broke in. \u201cI know a little about club life from working at The Line, but I\u2019ve never figured this one out. If your whole identity depends on your relationship to a man, isn\u2019t that a little f**ked up?\u201d</p><p>Pretty good question.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Dancer admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m not too worried about it. My identity is all my own. Always has been, always will be. It\u2019s true that the club is for men and they usually call the shots when they\u2019re playing with their friends. At home, though? Not so much. Bam pisses me off, I\u2019m not suffering from a shortage of ways to make him pay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Dancer smirked and raised a knowing brow.</p><p>\u201cYou really have to ask? Even the virgin girlie gets that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Em groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get tired of discussing my sex life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Reaper women chorused, and we all burst out laughing yet again.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing\u2014it\u2019s up to you to decide what works and what\u2019s a deal breaker,\u201d Maggs said when the fit of giggles died down. \u201cYou lay it out for Ruger, Sophie. Either he\u2019s on board or not, but the most important part is that you stick to your guns. If it\u2019s a deal breaker, you\u2019re done with him. Do whatever it takes to draw the line. I\u2019m serious. You may have to find somewhere else to live if that happens, but don\u2019t let him convince you there aren\u2019t options. There\u2019s always options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what she really needs to do is screw him and dump his ass,\u201d Em said, shivering with delicious glee. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, she should just nail him. Is he any good, Kimber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d I warned my friend, holding up a hand to her face. \u201cMouth. Shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute! Party planning aside, we\u2019re forgetting an important part of why we\u2019re here,\u201d Marie said suddenly. She turned to me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t talked about work, Sophie. Sex is just way more interesting. Has Ruger mentioned a job?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, more than ready for a change of subject. \u201cI\u2019m going to start looking on Monday. He said something about working for the club, but it seems a little weird to bring it up after this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI manage a coffee shop for a friend,\u201d Marie told me. Maggs, Em, and Dancer sobered, exchanging glances I couldn\u2019t quite read. \u201cI could really use some help in the mornings, if you have a way to get Noah to school. You\u2019d be done by the afternoon when he gets home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I can look into it,\u201d I said, wondering if my neighbor would help get Noah on the bus for me. Or maybe they had one of those morning drop-off programs?</p><p>\u201cI think she should be a stripper at The Line,\u201d Kimber piped up. Marie\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she said, her distaste visible. \u201cThat place is disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to earn money,\u201d Kimber insisted. \u201cPerfect for a single mom. She could work two nights a week and be with Noah every day. How is that a bad thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, the part where she sucks some stranger\u2019s cock?\u201d Marie asked. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Ruger would just looove that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI thought we were talking about dancing. No sucking cocks. Deal breaker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are talking about dancing,\u201d Kimber said, rolling her eyes. \u201cNobody makes you work the VIP rooms. Totally your choice. Or you could waitress. They don\u2019t make as much money, but they still do pretty well. Especially if you\u2019re nice to the dancers. They\u2019ll tip out if you treat them right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not want to work there,\u201d Marie insisted. \u201cSeriously, most of those girls are whores. Not talking about you, Kimber, but the rest of them? You can\u2019t trust that place for shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was a whore,\u201d Kimber announced blithely. \u201cIf by \u2018whore\u2019 you mean I got guys off for money. Mostly hand jobs, but if he\u2019d pay enough I\u2019d go down on him. Now I own a gorgeous house, I have a degree, and I even started a college fund for my kid. I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>We all looked at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, seriously?\u201d she asked, rolling her eyes. \u201cYou girls live in a f**king motorcycle gang. You really think you should judge me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClub,\u201d Em said. \u201cIt\u2019s a motorcycle club. Being part of a club isn\u2019t a crime, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kimber replied, waving her hand. \u201cI own my body. It\u2019s totally mine, and what I do with it is my business. I danced for guys, I touched them sometimes, and they gave me lots of money. How many women get groped every day by strangers? At least I got paid up front for it. I\u2019d do it again, and I think Sophie should, too, if she really wants to provide for Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWorking at The Line isn\u2019t a bad idea,\u201d Maggs said, surprising me. \u201cI tended bar there and did pretty well. That\u2019s how I met Bolt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did anyone bother you?\u201d I asked. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a controlled environment,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody gets in without security knowing. They keep an eye on everything. Even in the VIP rooms, security\u2019s always right outside the door. I was probably safer there than I am at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ... I can\u2019t think of a better way to ask this, so I guess I\u2019ll just spit it out. Did you have to walk around naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cServers at The Line are like furniture from IKEA. Okay to look at, but not what you want to draw attention to. I wore a black bustier, a short black skirt, and dark tights. Blended right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad,\u201d I said. Marie scowled and shook her head, but Maggs grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to the manager tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be at the party. And you\u2019re coming\u2014no negotiation. If you don\u2019t figure things out with Ruger, maybe you\u2019ll come home with a job.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>RUGER</p><p>\u201cHuge f**kin\u2019 mistake,\u201d Deke declared. He stood in the center of the Armory\u2019s second-story game room, surrounded by officers from almost every Reapers charter. Usually they had church downstairs, but there wasn\u2019t enough space for all the visiting brothers below. This group included both national and local chapter officers, and whatever decisions they made would be binding on the whole club.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust them, we all know that,\u201d Deke continued. \u201cWhat kind of dumbfuck sticks his head in a noose? We do this, we deserve everything we get.\u201d</p><p>Picnic sighed and shook his head. Ruger leaned against the wall behind him, wondering how much longer they\u2019d be going over the same points. He wanted this over with, because he\u2019d been wound up tighter than hell since yesterday morning.</p><p>Sophie tied him in f**kin\u2019 knots.</p><p>Not even a blow job from one of the club whores had helped. She\u2019d barely gotten his pants open when he\u2019d started thinking about Sophie and Noah, and it was all over. Last night he\u2019d been surrounded by thirty of his best friends and brothers, more booze than he could drink, and free pu**y on tap, and he was still f**kin\u2019 bored. All he really wanted was to go home, read Noah a bedtime story, and then f**k Sophie\u2019s brains out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Picnic shifted, the sound of his chair scraping pulling Ruger out of his thoughts.</p><p>They\u2019d been at it for nearly two hours, and so far nobody had changed their positions on the truce. Most of the men wanted to give it a shot. Ruger agreed. He thought the Jacks were walking, talking bags of shit, but at least they were a known quantity. They understood the lifestyle, and all other issues aside, they were still bikers. He wasn\u2019t ready to throw down for a Devil\u2019s Jack, but backing off for the duration? That made sense.</p><p>Deke disagreed.</p><p>Strongly.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone else want to talk?\u201d asked Shade. The big man with spiky blond hair and a nasty scar across his face was the national president, a position he\u2019d held for less than a year. Ruger didn\u2019t know him well, but what he\u2019d heard was good. Shade lived in Boise, although he\u2019d made noises about moving farther north.</p><p>\u201cI got somethin\u2019 to say,\u201d Duck announced, boosting his big body up off the couch. In his late sixties, Duck was the oldest member in Coeur d\u2019Alene. One of the oldest members in the entire club, actually. He wasn\u2019t an officer, but nobody was stupid enough to tell him he couldn\u2019t talk. Ruger knew whatever he said could be the tipping point.</p><p>\u201cI hate the Jacks. They\u2019re cocksuckers and ass**les, we all know it. That\u2019s why it hurts me so much to admit this, but I think we should give the truce a shot.\u201d</p><p>Ruger cocked his head\u2014hadn\u2019t seen that coming. A Vietnam vet and fighter from day one, Duck had never been the voice of peace.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Duck continued. \u201cThat little prick Hunter is onto something. We\u2019re the same kind of men where it counts. We know what life is really about, and that\u2019s the freedom to ride and live on our own terms. We joined this club because we don\u2019t give a shit about citizens and their rules. I\u2019ve always taken what I wanted when I wanted it, no apologies. I live free. Any laws broken along the way are just collateral.\u201d</p> <p>Brothers around the room murmured in agreement\u2014even Deke.</p><p>\u201cThese kids moving in, though, they\u2019re not like us,\u201d Duck said, looking around, pinning each man with his eyes in turn. \u201cThey\u2019re. Not. Like. Us. They got no freedom and no reason to live, aside from making money. They wake up every morning plannin\u2019 to break the law, which means the law rules their lives. I\u2019m not scared to fight, you all know that, but why fight when we can let the Jacks do it for us? Live to ride, ride to live. Not just words, brothers. Anything gets in the way of living and riding is a waste of my time, and that includes fighting the cartel.\u201d</p><p>Men all over the room voiced their approval. Deke shook his head, and Ruger knew him well enough to realize he was pissed. He\u2019d been beat, and Deke wasn\u2019t used to losing. And Toke? He was practically vibrating, he was so pissed off. At least he kept his mouth shut\u2014kid like that had no business speaking here.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all gonna pay for this,\u201d the Portland president said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve hashed it out. No reason to keep talking at this point. Let\u2019s vote and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone got a problem with that?\u201d Shade asked. Ruger shot a look at Toke, concerned. Nobody spoke up. \u201cOkay, then. All in favor?\u201d</p><p>A chorus of \u201cayes\u201d echoed around the room, which held close to forty men.</p> <p>\u201cOpposed?\u201d</p><p>Only six guys disagreed, four from Portland and two from Idaho Falls. No surprise, Toke was one of them. That was unfortunate, Ruger thought, given Hunter\u2019s location. Not that he gave two f**ks about the man, but he liked him better than any other Jack he\u2019d met. What he\u2019d told them about the cartel added up\u2014it was a big problem, one they\u2019d have to deal with sooner or later. Ruger didn\u2019t want their shit in his territory, and neither did his brothers. Might as well let the Jacks be their cannon fodder.</p><p>\u201cWe gonna have a problem here?\u201d Shade asked Deke bluntly.</p><p>\u201cThey keep out of our way, we won\u2019t have a problem,\u201d Deke said after a pause. \u201cRight or wrong, we\u2019re Reapers. We stand together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna hold you to that, brother,\u201d Shade replied.</p><p>\u201cThe girls have been workin\u2019 hard, putting together food for us,\u201d Picnic said, rising to address the room. \u201cPig won\u2019t be ready for another hour, but the kegs are tapped. Thanks to everyone for comin\u2019 up here. We always appreciate the company. Reapers forever, forever Reapers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReapers forever, forever Reapers!\u201d echoed through the room, rattling the windows. Toke didn\u2019t look happy, but Ruger knew he\u2019d do his part. Men stood to talk, some heading downstairs to the party, others standing in clumps.</p><p>\u201cA word?\u201d Picnic asked Ruger before he could escape. He stopped, turning to his president.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEm\u2019s pretty hungover this morning,\u201d Pic said, eyes speculative. \u201cHow about your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my girl,\u201d Ruger grunted. \u201cAnd no idea\u2014didn\u2019t go home last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Pic asked, raising a brow. \u201cThat \u2019cause you had business here or \u2019cause things are f**ked up at the house? Em seems to think they\u2019re f**ked up. That gonna be a problem for the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm sure talks a lot,\u201d Ruger said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEm still hasn\u2019t figured out she can\u2019t fool her daddy when she\u2019s drunk,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to me. She seems to think you\u2019re claiming this girl for your property. Says you told her she can\u2019t talk to any other guys. What\u2019s the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d Ruger replied, his tension growing. \u201cSophie knows the situation and so do I. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, so long as we don\u2019t have any misunderstandings,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cIf she\u2019s yours, fine. She\u2019s not? Lot of guys here today, guys who aren\u2019t usually around. You can\u2019t explain the situation to me, how do you plan on explainin\u2019 it to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ruger replied, his voice firm. \u201cMade things clear to her and she knows what she needs to do.\u201d</p><p>Picnic eyed him thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cSend her home,\u201d he said. \u201cBring her around for a family party, start small. See how it goes. This is throwing her into the deep end and that\u2019s gonna backfire on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScare her off, you mean?\u201d Ruger asked. \u201cThat might be best. I don\u2019t know what the hell I want with her\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to f**k her,\u201d Picnic said bluntly. \u201cYou can tell when your dick gets hard, did you know that? Probably tough for you to understand, seeing as most of the time you\u2019re just jacking off, but most men like to stick their cocks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up,\u201d Ruger said, wondering whether it\u2019d be a bad move to punch out his president in front of so many witnesses. Probably. Might be worth it.</p><p>Picnic laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo you gonna send her home?\u201d he asked. Ruger shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI send her home, she wins,\u201d he said. Picnic raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, junior high? You\u2019re the man, lay it out for her.\u201d</p><p>Ruger took a deep breath, forcing himself to think instead of just lashing out. He needed a good fight or something, some way to blow off the tension. There\u2019d be boxing later. That would do it ... hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI lay it out, she wins,\u201d he admitted finally, scowling and running a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. She called me on my bullshit and I can\u2019t talk my way out of it. I make her leave, it\u2019s like I\u2019m saying she was right about the club being dangerous and a bad influence for Noah. Not to mention making me look like a f**kin\u2019 pussy in the process, because I can\u2019t handle having her around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, you\u2019re a dumbass,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cTwo, she\u2019s right. Club is dangerous for an unclaimed woman, particularly tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna protect her. You got a cure for the dumbass thing? That part\u2019s kickin\u2019 my butt, gotta admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Pic said, clapping a hand to Ruger\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut I know something that\u2019ll make you feel better about the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulled pork sandwich,\u201d Pic replied. \u201cBeer. Then\u2014if you\u2019re smart, which I\u2019ll admit is a stretch\u2014you\u2019ll take your girl somewhere and f**k her \u2019til she can\u2019t walk straight. She may win, but who gives a damn, \u2019cause she\u2019ll be suckin\u2019 your c**k for the foreseeable future. I find that works wonders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a f**kin\u2019 asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d</p> <p>SOPHIE</p><p>I wasn\u2019t horribly hungover the next day, but I wasn\u2019t eager to start drinking again, either. This was probably just as well. Despite my alcohol-fueled tough talk, I really didn\u2019t want to make trouble at the party. I Googled the address, then drove out to the Armory early that evening, after I dropped off Noah with Kimber. She\u2019d ended up spending the night on my couch, waking up more than a little worse for the wear.</p><p>I suspected she\u2019d be in bed about five minutes after she got the kids down.</p><p>I was nervous driving out to the party. The Reapers\u2019 clubhouse was a couple miles off the highway, toward the end of an old state road. I passed a group of four motorcycles headed for the highway, ridden by men dressed a lot like Ruger. Tattoos, jeans, boots, and black leather jackets. Loaded saddlebags.</p><p>They didn\u2019t appear to be happy campers.</p><p>The building itself surprised me. I guess I hadn\u2019t expected the Armory description to be so literal, because this was an honest-to-God converted National Guard building. Three stories tall, walls built to withstand tanks, and an enclosed courtyard with a gate big enough to drive a large truck through.</p><p>There were quite a few people there already. Lots of guys, all of them wearing their distinctive colors. They had different states or towns on their lower patches, but the Reapers\u2019 symbol and name were the same.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there were lots of motorcycles, but also quite a few cars, most of which had been parked in a gravel lot off to the side. A younger guy wearing a cut without very many patches waved me over in that direction, so I pulled in next to a little red Honda. Four girls who\u2019d clearly been drinking for a while poured out. They were young, slutted up, and ready to party. Last night I\u2019d noticed that the club women weren\u2019t afraid to show off their bodies\u2014Dancer rocked a pair of jeans and backless top in a big way\u2014but the Reapers\u2019 old ladies looked somehow more classy and confident than this bunch.</p> <p>Maybe it was about the attitude? I got the impression these girls were on the prowl, and that they weren\u2019t necessarily planning to be too picky.</p><p>They ignored me entirely, giggling and taking shots of each other with their phones. I guess I didn\u2019t rate their attention, which was both depressing and a bit of a relief. Not that I cared how I looked\u2014I\u2019d gone with a basic T-shirt, my standard cutoffs and a pair of flip-flops. Despite my fight with Ruger yesterday morning (not to mention my margarita-fueled belligerence last night), I really did want to keep things low-key.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect at a Reapers party but I figured I\u2019d be fine if I stuck with my girls.</p><p>I\u2019d sent a text to Ruger letting him know I was coming. He\u2019d replied with a reminder about our conversation, which almost convinced me to change into something sluttier just to spite him. Then I pulled my head out of my ass. Ruger losing his shit was not something I wanted see, no matter how satisfying it would be to defy him.</p><p>Defy him? Christ, how old was I?</p><p>I also texted Maggs, Em, Dancer, and Marie. They said to come straight through to the back, where they were setting up the food outside. They\u2019d asked me to stop off and buy a bunch of extra chips, so I\u2019d hit Walmart on the way.</p><p>Now I trailed behind the slut brigade, their big hair, loud makeup, and microscopic clothing providing plenty of cover as we walked toward the big gate in the courtyard. A couple of guys stood outside, obviously monitoring the entrance. The gaggle flirted with them and then passed on through. They probably thought I was a total hag in comparison, I realized glumly. A little lip gloss wouldn\u2019t have killed me. Apparently giant shopping bags full of chips counted for something, though, because the men welcomed me enthusiastically enough.</p><p>Sex appeal is great, but there\u2019s nothing quite like food to win a man\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ruger\u2019s almost-sister-in-law,\u201d I told one of the guys, who nodded me on through. I followed the narrow driveway that ran along the side of the building until I reached the main courtyard out back\u2014a broad, open space that was a mixture of parking lot and grass. Loud music blasted through giant box speakers, and evergreen-covered mountains surrounded us on all sides. It really was a gorgeous place\u2014much nicer than I\u2019d expected.</p><p>A good-sized group of children darted through clumps of adults and took turns playing on a giant, clearly homemade swing set, complete with a fort at the top. There were men everywhere, far more men than women, although another group of girls followed me. I guessed the men had been there earlier and now the rest of the guests were arriving? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruger was nowhere to be seen. I spotted a row of long folding tables near the back wall of the building covered with a mismatched series of tablecloths. Off to one side stood a black-barreled BBQ smoker almost as big as my car, mounted on a trailer. Smoke drifted out and the scent of roasting pig filled the air.</p><p>\u201cSophie!\u201d Marie called, waving me over toward one of the tables. I moved quickly toward her, trying not to stare at anyone, but it was hard. The guys were almost all at least a little scary-looking. I mean, some of them were regular enough, I guess, but somehow rougher. They had tanned skin and a disproportionate number of beards. Others were less normal-looking. I saw a lot of tattoos and piercings, and very few shirts, although they all seemed to be wearing their leather vests. All of them were Reapers and most seemed to be in a pretty good mood.</p><p>I also noticed a few of the little boys wearing their own tiny vests. Not real ones, but play ones clearly meant to copy their daddies\u2019. Shit. Knowing my luck, Noah would be begging for one of those if he saw them. Good thing I hadn\u2019t brought him along.</p><p>\u201cWant some help with the bags?\u201d a man asked. I opened my mouth to refuse, then looked up and realized it was Horse. I smiled, relieved to recognize someone besides just the girls I\u2019d met last night.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI met Marie. She\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d he replied, offering me a movie-star grin. Damn, but he was beautiful. \u201cWorth every penny I paid for her.\u201d</p><p>That caught me short. I stopped, wondering if he could possibly be serious. He didn\u2019t look like he was joking.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d he asked, glancing back at me. I pulled myself together and started walking again. What the hell had he meant by that?</p><p>\u201cSophie!\u201d Em called, spotting me from behind one of the tables. She darted forward and gave me a big hug.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re going out next weekend,\u201d she whispered in my ear. \u201cI talked to Liam this morning about meeting in real life, and he\u2019s all over it. Thank you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I replied, pulling back to look at her. She was so pretty this afternoon, the excitement in her eyes bright and shining. \u201cJust remember, we\u2019re going to stay safe. Don\u2019t tell him where you live or anything. We\u2019ll check him out, and if he\u2019s a creeper, we\u2019ll ditch his ass.\u201d</p><p>Em laughed.</p><p>\u201cActually, telling him my address would be perfectly safe,\u201d she answered. \u201cRemember who I live with? Our house is a fortress. Which reminds me, I want to introduce you to my dad.\u201d</p><p>She took my hand and pulled me across the courtyard to the giant black BBQ. Several men stood around it drinking from red plastic cups. They turned as we walked up, openly checking me out. Clearly, subtlety wasn\u2019t a highly valued trait here at the Armory.</p><p>\u201cThis is my dad, Picnic,\u201d Em said, stepping forward to wrap her arm around the one standing closest to us. He pulled her close, offering her an indulgent smile. He was tall and fairly well-built. He shared her piercing light blue eyes and his hair was a couple months overdue for a trim. I could tell he was older by the faint lines around his eyes, but his hair held only a hint of gray at the temples. And his body? Nice. Em\u2019s dad was hot for an old guy.</p> <p>Not that I\u2019d tell her that\u2014who wants to hear that their dad\u2019s hot?</p><p>The most compelling thing about Picnic, though, was his air of command, mixed with just a hint of menace. I would\u2019ve known he was club president even without the patch on his cut to tell me.</p><p>No wonder guys were scared to ask her out.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is Sophie,\u201d Em continued. \u201cShe\u2019s Ruger\u2019s ... Um, what are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of his stepsister-in-law,\u201d I said, smiling awkwardly. \u201cHis stepbrother, Zach, is my son\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned you were back in town,\u201d Picnic said. His face gave away nothing, and I couldn\u2019t tell if he was happy to meet me or annoyed I\u2019d crashed their party.</p><p>\u201cThis is Slide and Gage,\u201d Em continued, nodding toward the other men.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said. Slide was a short, middle-aged guy with a bit of a gut and a beard that wasn\u2019t totally white, but close. He didn\u2019t actually look old enough for such white hair, so maybe he was just one of those guys whose hair changes early? He had a real Santa vibe going for him. Well, if Santa wore ripped jeans and carried a giant knife on his belt.</p> <p>Gage was another hottie. He had dark hair, so dark it was almost black, and his skin held just enough color to make me think his ancestors hadn\u2019t all been of the milky-white variety. Latino or Indian, most likely. Because sometimes God is generous and kind, Gage wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt, offering me glimpses of his bare chest, which was every bit as ripped as Ruger\u2019s. He had fewer tattoos, though. His cut had a little patch under his name that said \u201cSgt. at Arms,\u201d which surprised me. I guess I hadn\u2019t expected bikers to have so many officers and such. It just seemed so ... organized?</p><p>Not only that, they obviously had to pass some sort of minimum hotness test to join up.</p><p>\u201cYou Ruger\u2019s woman?\u201d he asked, breaking the spell I\u2019d fallen into. I blushed, hoping my pervy thoughts weren\u2019t totally written all over my face. The smirk on his face wasn\u2019t comforting.</p><p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d I said, glancing over at Em. She grinned. \u201cBut he\u2019s letting us stay in his basement. I have a seven-year-old. Our old place in Seattle wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d</p><p>That was the understatement of the year, for sure.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d he asked, glancing around.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with a sitter,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is my first club event, and I sort of wanted to check things out for myself before dragging him along.\u201d</p><p>Picnic raised a brow, and I realized I\u2019d probably just insulted them. Great.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I hear the parties go pretty late,\u201d I added quickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to leave just when things were getting fun. A friend offered to watch him, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>Em grinned at me and I gave a sigh of relief. Okay, apparently my quick save had actually worked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you get bored, come and see me,\u201d Gage said, offering a slow smile. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to show you around, maybe even take you for a ride later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, thanks,\u201d I replied, Ruger\u2019s warning ringing through my head. Gage was cute, but despite the fact that I didn\u2019t acknowledge Ruger\u2019s right to give orders, I also didn\u2019t want to get into a huge fight with him. \u201cNice to meet you all. I\u2019m gonna go find Marie and Dancer now. I want to make sure they don\u2019t need any help setting things up or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with,\u201d Em said, popping up on her toes to give Picnic a quick kiss on the cheek. For all her whining about him, she obviously adored the man. I felt a twinge of jealousy. Even before they\u2019d kicked me out, my parents were never the kind of people you\u2019d just casually walk up to and kiss.</p><p>Nope, not in the Williams household. I\u2019d been devastated when they said they\u2019d have nothing to do with a daughter who was a whore, let alone her bastard. Now I realized I was way better off without them. Noah\u2019s circle might be small, but everyone in it loved him unconditionally, and they weren\u2019t afraid to show it.</p><p>My parents didn\u2019t deserve to meet their grandson.</p><p>We found Dancer, Marie, and Maggs arranging a mountain of food on the tables, laughing and smacking hands playfully as guys tried to steal bites before it was ready.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for picking up the chips,\u201d Maggs said. I noticed all three women wore black leather vests.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said only guys could be club members?\u201d I asked, nodding toward them.</p><p>\u201cOh, these aren\u2019t club cuts,\u201d Dancer said. \u201cCheck it out.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and I saw a patch on the back that said \u201cProperty of Bam Bam,\u201d along with a Reapers symbol. My eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the property thing was so ... literal ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe guys have their colors and we have ours,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cCivilians don\u2019t get it, but all the patches mean something. The guys fly their colors because they\u2019re proud of the club, but their cuts tell stories, too. You can learn a lot about the guy by the patches he wears. It\u2019s like a language or something. Everyone knows where everyone else stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe great thing about a property patch is that you\u2019re totally covered,\u201d Dancer added. \u201cThere\u2019s not a man here who\u2019s gonna touch me, no matter how drunk or stupid he gets by the end of the night. Not that I\u2019m too worried here at our own clubhouse, but we go on runs where there are hundreds of riders, even thousands. Everyone who knows a damned thing about the MC world takes one look at this and they know not to f**k with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Em said. \u201cYou f**k with one Reaper\u2019s property, you better be ready to take down every guy in the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I said, trying to sound noncommittal. I liked the idea of protection as much as anyone, but there was something very uncomfortable to me about a woman choosing to call herself property. Shades of Zach and how possessive he was, maybe. But Maggs and the others didn\u2019t seem too terribly oppressed, either.</p><p>I glanced around, taking in how many women were starting to fill the courtyard. Only a handful wore property patches.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rest of them?\u201d I asked. Em shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not important,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cSome of them are sweetbutts and club whores, which means they\u2019re around a lot\u2014the guys share them. Some are just random girls looking for a walk on the wild side. But none of them really count, not compared to us. They\u2019re all fair game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree pu**y,\u201d Maggs said, her voice matter-of-fact. \u201cThey\u2019re just here to party, and if we\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll help clean up. They give anyone shit, their asses are out the door. Good news is, they know their place. Half these girls work at The Line anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d I asked, unnerved. \u201cI don\u2019t have a patch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll stick with us,\u201d Dancer said, her voice serious. \u201cDespite his general dickitude, Ruger\u2019s right about one thing. You really don\u2019t want to f**k around with the brothers. Don\u2019t flirt if you aren\u2019t interested in following through. And for f**k\u2019s sake, don\u2019t go off alone or into the Armory with anyone, particularly upstairs. There\u2019s some wild shit that happens up there. You don\u2019t want to be part of it, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re gonna scare her,\u201d Em said, frowning. \u201cLook at it this way\u2014would you go to any party or bar without taking some basic safety precautions? Only take drinks you\u2019ve poured yourself, or ones that we\u2019ve given you. You ever been to a frat party? Think of it that way. Dad, Horse, Ruger, and Bam Bam are safe. Don\u2019t go off with someone you don\u2019t know, though. Stay in public areas. Use common sense and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Oookay.</p><p>\u201cHey, the good news is I saw Buck earlier,\u201d Em added. \u201cHe manages The Line. I\u2019ll introduce you at some point, you can ask him about waitressing. I\u2019m definitely not on board with you stripping, but waitressing could be a pretty good gig.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you work there?\u201d I asked her. Em burst out laughing, joined by Maggs and Dancer.</p><p>\u201cMy dad would kill me before he let me work at The Line,\u201d she said when she finally caught her breath again. \u201cOr maybe his head would just explode? He\u2019s still trying to convince me I shouldn\u2019t work at all. He\u2019d love it if I just stayed home and kept house for him, maybe did some charity work on the side. He hasn\u2019t decided to join us in this century quite yet.\u201d</p><p>I thought about the tall, stern man I\u2019d just met and had to smile. I could totally see him being overprotective like that.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he want grandkids some day?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a middle step, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s thought that far ahead,\u201d Em replied with a giggle.</p><p>The whistle of a firework shooting off cut through everything, and we all looked up to watch an explosion of red, white, and blue above the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that illegal?\u201d I asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Dancer told me. \u201cWe\u2019re so far out nobody gives a shit. And if they did, they\u2019d just call the sheriff\u2019s department, and we\u2019ve got a good relationship with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Reapers get along with the cops?\u201d I asked, stunned.</p><p>\u201cNot all of them,\u201d Dancer said. \u201cBut the sheriff is a pretty good guy. What a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that there\u2019s always gangs trying to move into the area. The sheriff can\u2019t begin to keep up with them. Even if he knows about them, he can\u2019t do shit without evidence. The Reapers help keep some of those problems under control, in our own special way. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement, no question. City cops are a different story, though. They hate us.\u201d</p><p>Another rocket shot up, this one exploding with a mighty flash and a bang. It wasn\u2019t dark yet, but the light was fading enough for it to mess with my vision. When I stopped blinking from the bright light, I saw Ruger watching me from across the courtyard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d I muttered to Maggs. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since we had our little blowup. You think I should go over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cGotta face him sooner or later. Remember what we talked about\u2014you lay it out, and if he won\u2019t play, leave. You\u2019ve got choices. Always.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Ruger\u2019s face was completely unreadable as I approached, and for one horrible moment I thought he might not talk to me.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, feeling nervous. Seeing him should\u2019ve pissed me off or maybe even scared me. My body didn\u2019t get the memo, though, because standing close to him mostly turned me on. I think his scent was a big part of it\u2014nothing got to me like that hint of sweat and gun oil. He\u2019d taken off his shirt, leaving only jeans, boots, and his cut. His tan told me he\u2019d spent a lot of the summer that way.</p><p>Then I caught a glimpse of that panther tat disappearing down into his pants and I shit you not, it made me feel a little light-headed. All that blood rushing downward, you know?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. I tilted my head up to look at his face, reminded once again just how much physically larger he was than me. \u201cSo, we gonna f**k around here or just get to the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... Not quite sure I follow,\u201d I admitted, still off balance. What woman would seriously be able to pay attention, confronted with a body like that? Ruger grunted, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna follow my rules tonight?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf not, you need to get your ass in your car and leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow the rules,\u201d I said slowly, eyes catching on his chin. He hadn\u2019t shaved that morning, leaving just enough stubble to make a light burn on a girl\u2019s skin. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow, clearly skeptical.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me why you\u2019re being so controlling,\u201d I said, laying it out. The girls had been right. Either he was with me or he wasn\u2019t, but one way or another I\u2019d be taking charge of the situation. \u201cIs it because you\u2019re jealous and you want me to yourself, or because the Reapers are too dangerous?\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, his face thoughtful. Then he seemed to come to some sort of decision.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he told me, and it wasn\u2019t an invitation. He grabbed my hand and dragged me almost roughly across the courtyard, toward the large shop built against the back wall. Enclosed on three sides, the front was open to the elements, almost like a supersized carport.</p> <p>Inside the air was much cooler, and it gave a sense of privacy. One half of the building held bikes in varying states of repair, including several that seemed to be little more than frames. Counters lined the back, and every tool imaginable hung from the walls. There were also some larger pieces of power equipment, including a huge drill press, a grinding wheel, and others I couldn\u2019t begin to identify. A track had been mounted on the ceiling, with a rolling hoist hanging from it.</p><p>Filling the other side of the building were a panel truck and an old cargo van. The counters extended into that area, along with hooks for more tools. Ruger tugged me over between the van and the far wall. Despite the fact that the party continued a couple hundred feet away, we felt totally isolated. I thought about the warning I\u2019d been given not to go off anywhere.</p><p>Did that apply to Ruger, too?</p><p>My gut instinct said I wasn\u2019t safe with him right now ... Not physically unsafe, of course. He\u2019d never hit me. But I was pretty damned sure I\u2019d be sorry I\u2019d come in here with him.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d given me much of a choice.</p><p>Ruger raised his hands, framing my face and studying me closely. He licked his lips, drawing my eyes to that ring of his once more as he stepped forward into my space, pushing me toward the van. It threw me off balance, and I stumbled. Ruger reached down and grabbed my ass, boosting me up and bracing me against the vehicle, my sex pressed to his, my br**sts flat against his chest. I reached around his neck and my legs gripped his waist for balance.</p><p>\u201cYou really want me to answer your question?\u201d Ruger asked, his voice low and matter-of-fact. \u201cOr you want to leave the party while you still can?\u201d</p><p>I should leave.</p> <p>I knew that. But his c**k was already hard against me and every bit of blood in my body raced downward, away from my brain. Self-preservation gave way to raw lust.</p><p>\u201cI want the answer,\u201d I whispered. Ruger smiled, and it wasn\u2019t a nice smile. It was hungry as hell and utterly merciless, just like him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous as f**k,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cThat\u2019s not really my thing, but it\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t much like the idea of some other man touchin\u2019 your sweet ass, and if one of them tries to stick his c**k into that pretty little cunt of yours, I\u2019m gonna cut it off. And, Soph?\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I answered, a thousand thoughts running through my brain. How did I feel about this? What should I say? The girls told me to lay down the law and stick to my guns. The look in Ruger\u2019s eyes, though ... That wasn\u2019t the face of a man who was interested in respecting my limits.</p><p>Who was I kidding? I couldn\u2019t even remember what those limits were supposed to be right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead serious,\u201d he continued, leaning his head down, scenting me. I felt it like a bolt of electricity, all the way through my body, right down to my toes. \u201cAnother man touches you, I\u2019ll cut off his c**k and feed it to him. That\u2019s not a threat, that\u2019s a promise. And you f**k someone? He\u2019s dead, Soph. Four years ago I made two serious mistakes. I didn\u2019t protect you from Zach\u2014I\u2019ll regret that every day for the rest of my life. And then, because I felt guilty as f**k, I did the right thing and let you go.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews flash, Soph,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s about f**kin\u2019 time we talked about it, because it\u2019s hanging between us and I\u2019m tired of pretending it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>I started squirming, trying to twist free. Everything in me screamed to run, because he was about to take us to the bad place.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Ruger ordered, his voice harsh. I kept squirming, so he pushed into me harder, forcing me to still. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna deal with it, Soph. Deal and move on, because things are gonna change for you now. My mistake wasn\u2019t touching you that night, and it sure as shit wasn\u2019t making you come. The mistake was doing it without taking out Zach first. If I\u2019d known ... why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI really, really don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d I hissed, trying to ignore his soft breath in my ear, the hard length of his c**k pushing against me. My ni**les were tight and my entire body screamed for me to open to him, but deep inside my brain lurked a cloud of darkness and fear that threatened to tear free with every word.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve killed him for what he did to you,\u201d Ruger said, eyes full of frustrated regret. \u201cBut then he was in jail and I didn\u2019t want to do that to Mom, so I let him live. You left and I\u2019ve hated myself ever since. I can\u2019t go back in time, but I sure as f**k won\u2019t make the same mistake twice. This time you\u2019re not gettin\u2019 away, Soph.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to calm my hormones enough to think. Then it hit me. I should tell him the truth. If that wasn\u2019t enough to convince him this was a lost cause, nothing would.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d I said, the familiar wave of self-disgust washing over me.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, Zach beatin\u2019 the shit out of you was not your fault,\u201d Ruger said, his voice like ice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, looking him right in the eye. \u201cIt was my fault, Ruger. I planned it. When you starting kissing me\u2014touching me\u2014I knew Zach was coming over. He\u2019d texted me, wanted to make sure I had food ready when he got there. I knew he\u2019d catch us. He was so jealous of you, Ruger. Drove him crazy. I knew if he caught us together, he\u2019d lose it. I wanted him to hit me hard, because then I could make it end.\u201d</p><p>Ruger inhaled sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach had to leave bruises,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI was so scared all the time, Ruger. I never knew what he\u2019d do. Some days he was great and things were fine, like they were before Noah. Then I\u2019d drop my guard and he\u2019d turn on me. I tried calling the cops, but he never left marks, so they wouldn\u2019t do anything. He told me he\u2019d kill me if I left him.\u201d</p> <p>Ruger took a deep, ragged breath and his eyes went dark.</p><p>\u201cWhen you came over that day, I saw my chance,\u201d I admitted, disgusted with myself. \u201cThis tension\u2014lust, whatever the hell you want to call it\u2014it was between us by then. I felt it every time I saw you. And you were so good with Noah, always coming around, fixing my car or mowing the yard for us. I\u2019d bring you a drink and you\u2019d look at me like you wanted to throw me down on the ground and f**k me until I screamed. You know what? I wanted you to do it. So I let it happen.\u201d</p><p>Ruger gave a dark, harsh laugh that had nothing to do with humor.</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe, I remember that part,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we never did get to my happy ending, what with Zach comin\u2019 home. You seriously telling me that was planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered, my eyes filling with tears. \u201cI knew seeing us together would drive him crazy. I knew he\u2019d lose it. Noah was safe at your mom\u2019s house. So I let him catch us and have his little pissing match with you. He took off, you took off, and I waited for him to come back and punish me, like always. But this time he was finally worked up enough to leave evidence\u2014I made damned sure of it. I told him how much better you were than him. I told him I\u2019d been f**king you all along. For a while I thought he might kill me, and you know what? It would\u2019ve been worth it, just to make it end. You know the rest. He got arrested, I got my restraining order, and me and Noah were finally free.\u201d</p><p>Rugers eyes narrowed as emotion rippled across his face. Anger. Outrage. Disgust? For a second I thought he might actually hurt me, he seemed so angry.</p> <p>No, I realized. That was the difference between Ruger and Zach. Both men had tempers, but Ruger? Ruger would never hurt me.</p><p>Never. No matter what.</p><p>\u201cHe beat the shit out of you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou almost died, Soph. Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I would\u2019ve f**king killed him for you. You didn\u2019t have to let it get that bad. You should\u2019ve told me the first time he hurt you. I can\u2019t believe this was happening and I was too f**kin\u2019 stupid to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s your brother!\u201d I said to him, tears running down my face. \u201cYour mother loved him, Ruger. What he did to me almost destroyed her. If you\u2019d lost it, if you\u2019d gone after him, you\u2019d be in jail right now and your mom would\u2019ve died alone and miserable. What kind of hateful bitch would I be if I let that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve gone to one of those places for women,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I gave a harsh laugh.</p><p>\u201cDamned straight you don\u2019t get it\u2014it was his word against mine,\u201d I said, willing him to understand. \u201cI had no evidence, nothing. Sure, I could go to a shelter, but he\u2019d still have a right to visit with Noah, maybe fight me for custody. You think I\u2019d risk my baby alone with Zach? Nobody could help me until he took it up a notch, so I made it happen. I\u2019m not an idiot. A woman who\u2019s being controlled by a man can\u2019t get shit for help unless she\u2019s got evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose weren\u2019t just bruises,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cThree broken ribs and a punctured lung are not bruises. And why the f**k do you think I would\u2019ve gone to jail, hmm? Look at me, Soph. Do you think I\u2019m the kind of man to do time when I don\u2019t have to? He would\u2019ve just disappeared. Poof. Problem solved. I dare you to look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s one f**kin\u2019 reason that a man like Zachary Barrett should still be breathing, because I\u2019m comin\u2019 up blank. I nearly had him taken out while he was locked up, but I figured a dead guy couldn\u2019t pay child support.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Sophie,\u201d he said, sounding almost tired. \u201cI\u2019m f**kin\u2019 serious. Christ, I\u2019m the first thing Noah saw in this world. I caught him with my own hands on the side of the road, babe, and then he opened those eyes and looked right at me. From day one, I can say with a clear conscious that there is nothin\u2019\u2014not a f**king thing\u2014on this earth I wouldn\u2019t do to protect him or you. How long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was Zach hurtin\u2019 you before it all went down?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, looking away, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t big stuff,\u201d I said finally. \u201cNot at first. He\u2019d yell at me, make me feel like shit. Then he started doing it in front of Noah.\u201d</p><p>His entire body stiffened, his jaw clenching spasmodically. I stared at his chin and forged ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had to do something, Ruger. I couldn\u2019t let my son grow up that way. And then you came over to help out with the water heater. I kept watching you and I died just a little bit inside, because I knew I was stuck with the wrong brother. Then you looked back at me and it all came together in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Ruger muttered, leaning his forehead down against mine. I was still wrapped around him, back against the van, enclosed in his arms and his scent. \u201cYou\u2019re just full of surprises, now aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to move out of your basement?\u201d</p><p>Ruger pulled back, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cI just told you I\u2019ll kill any man who touches you and you think I want you to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I told you what I did. I used you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer one question for me\u2014total truth,\u201d he said slowly. I nodded. \u201cWas it real? Yesterday, when I kissed you, when I sucked on your tits and f**ked you with my hand? How about when I went down on you four years ago and you screamed my name? Before Zach found us and it all fell to shit. Was that fake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAside from Noah, that\u2019s the only part of those years I want to remember, because it was beautiful, Ruger. Whatever else happened, you gave me beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, f**k me,\u201d he muttered. I felt his hands tightening on my butt, his hips tilting more firmly into mine, sending twinges of desire washing through me. I\u2019d felt safe in his arms back then and I felt safe in them now.</p> <p>That\u2019s when it hit me. I didn\u2019t just lust after Ruger.</p><p>I loved him. I had for years.</p><p>I tightened my arms around his neck, raising myself up to brush my lips across his. He didn\u2019t respond, so I brushed his lips again, sucking the lower one into my mouth and nibbling on it.</p><p>That set him off.</p><p>One of his hands came up, fingers twisting in my hair as he took my mouth in a long, hard kiss, tongue punishing me in a mixture of anger and desire. I couldn\u2019t blame him for whatever he might be thinking, because I\u2019d used him and it was wrong. My arms tightened around his neck and I tried wiggling my hips, desperate for the friction of his c**k against my clit. He stilled suddenly, pulling back and looking down at me, eyes burning intensely.</p><p>\u201cSerious mistake, babe.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened. My body ached for him, the rough leather of his cut torturing my ni**les. Every part of me yearned for his touch, which explained why my brain wasn\u2019t working so well.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways I could interpret that,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou just admitted you\u2019re mine,\u201d he replied slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve been wonderin\u2019 if I could take you\u2014whether I should take you. I keep thinkin\u2019 about Noah and whether it\u2019s right for him, but now I get none of it matters, because you\u2019re mine already. You\u2019ve been mine for a hell of a long time and I just didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to make my own life. I don\u2019t belong to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many men have you f**ked?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d he demanded. \u201cHow many men have you f**ked? How many dicks have been in your cunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow would be a real good time to answer, babe,\u201d he said, grinding into me deliberately. \u201cSeein\u2019 as I\u2019m the one with the power here. This is my club. Whatever the f**k I do to you, they\u2019ll cover my ass. Don\u2019t push.\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t hurt you. Answer the f**kin\u2019 question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve slept with three men,\u201d I said. \u201cZach, a guy in Olympia, and another guy in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey make you come? You dump them or the other way around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dumped them,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you belonged to me,\u201d Ruger said, satisfaction filling his eyes. \u201cWe f**ked around, wasted time, and you\u2019ll never know how sorry I am about Zach. But I\u2019m done now. You\u2019re mine, Soph, and it\u2019s about time we figured that out. I\u2019ll let the club know and we\u2019ll be finished with this bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to be your girlfriend?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed. We can\u2019t afford to get involved and then have it go sour. Noah deserves better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not askin\u2019 you anything,\u201d he said, deliberately grinding his hips against mine. I groaned out loud. What the hell was it about this man that tied me up in knots? Maybe I had some sort of primitive hardwiring running the show, attracting me to a man strong enough to care for my child ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re my property, babe. I\u2019ll take damned good care of you and Noah. You\u2019ll take care of me. But only one c**k goes into that pu**y of yours\u2014mine\u2014and that\u2019s the end of it. Got me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t looking to settle down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lookin\u2019 to take care of you and Noah,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither of us wants to f**k up Noah\u2019s life. But you know what? I\u2019m good for Noah. It\u2019s a fact. Boys need men in their lives and I love the crap out of him. We\u2019ve been all twisted up in each other forever and now it\u2019s all out in the open anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be your whore,\u201d I muttered. Ruger grunted, a touch of humor entering his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I don\u2019t put this much time and effort into whores,\u201d he said, his voice rueful. \u201cWhores are nothing. You\u2019ll be my old lady, my property. I know this is all new to you, but it\u2019s a big f**kin\u2019 deal in my world.\u201d</p><p>I turned that over in my head, which was difficult, because he leaned down and started kissing my neck, boosting me higher so he could reach. Not his usual hard and brutal invasion ... No, this was slow and seductive, and then he started sucking gently and I wanted to cry, it felt so good. I squirmed against him, my hips desperate for more stimulation, but he wouldn\u2019t give it to me. Instead he nibbled along my chin before finding new places on my neck to suck and nip.</p><p>I heard the music from the party in the background, the sounds of people laughing and talking, but here in the cool darkness of the shop it felt like our own separate world. Ruger surrounded me with his smell and strength and the sheer, vibrant energy that defined him as a man overwhelming my senses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one got to me like he did.</p><p>He pulled me away from the van, carrying me across the shop without pausing in his attentions to my neck. I found myself laid back on the counter behind the panel truck, Ruger\u2019s body covering my own. My hands clutching his head as he kissed down my throat, pausing every few seconds to suck, his fingers reaching between my legs to rub slowly up and down along the inside of my thigh.</p><p>I\u2019d worn a black T-shirt with a V-neck, which proved no barrier to him at all. Ruger tugged the shirt up and flicked open the front clasp on my bra with disturbing speed. Then his mouth sucked in my nipple\u2014the hard metal ball in his tongue almost painful\u2014and my back arched up off the counter.</p><p>The hand between my legs unzipped my fly, and he lifted my hips just enough to slide off my cutoffs and panties. I felt the cool metal of the counter on my bare ass as Ruger\u2019s roughened fingers rubbed up and down along my clit.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that feels good,\u201d I muttered, trying to wrap my brain around everything he\u2019d said. This wasn\u2019t the plan, not even a little bit. For one, I hadn\u2019t planned on unpacking and sharing all that old baggage about Zach. Not now, not ever. The girls had told me to confront Ruger directly, set out my requirements and then stand up for myself.</p><p>Instead he gave the orders and I melted like a damned puddle all over a dirty bench in a shop.</p><p>What if someone walked in on us?</p><p>I\u2019d opened my mouth to protest when Ruger pulled away from my breast, shoving his fingers into me hard at the same time. He dropped to his knees, lips finding my clit, and my brain shorted out completely.</p><p>His tongue flicked over my most sensitive spot, teasing me with the unholy combination of his soft tongue and that hard metal ball. Throw in the steady suction of his mouth and it was nearly enough to send me over the edge. Then his finger pressed deep, finding that perfect spot on my inside wall, sending shudders racking through my body. He kept up a steady pressure, rubbing back and forth as his tongue drove me slowly insane.</p><p>Then Ruger pulled away long enough to say, \u201cPlay with your tits.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t occur to me to argue.</p><p>I moaned and reached up, taking my ni**les and rolling them between my fingers, pinching and tugging like he\u2019d done the morning before. I\u2019d held out against him then\u2014I\u2019d put Noah first, because any relationship between me and Ruger would be a disaster, and the fallout could leave us homeless again.</p><p>This time I wasn\u2019t strong enough to say no.</p><p>There\u2019s only so much self-control any woman can call upon before she melts. Mine was officially used up. Those fingers of his, rubbing across my G-spot, placing a strange, terrible pressure on me from within ... That flicking tongue with its hard little knob ... The strength of his shoulders as they supported my draped knees ...</p><p>I wanted to squirm and kick and push against him. Instead, Ruger took his free hand and held it down across my stomach, controlling me. He drew me to the brink three times, utterly sadistic, and I hated him when he pulled away to catch his breath. Then I heard voices in the distance and reality broke through my haze.</p><p>There were people around\u2014lots of people.</p><p>People who could walk into this shop at any minute. It didn\u2019t even have a door. I opened my mouth to tell Ruger we needed to stop, but he chose that exact instant to suck me in again, hard, plunging his fingers deep. Instead of protesting, I felt my back arch as I exploded in a deep climax, trying my hardest not to scream, with mixed results.</p><p>Ruger stood up slowly between my legs, running his hands along my body, from my br**sts to my thighs, eyes full of dark satisfaction. I lay there, almost dizzy as he leaned over and caught my hands. He pulled them tightly over my head, whipping out his belt and wrapping it quickly around my wrists, securing them to something behind me.</p><p>The whole process took about thirty seconds\u2014Ruger was a little too proficient at tying someone up for my comfort. I tugged my wrists, realizing it wasn\u2019t just for show. He had me. Completely. My eyes widened. Ruger gave me a hard, feral smile as he unzipped his fly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re mine now,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t come until I say you can.\u201d</p><p>I heard more voices, turning my head to look for them. Were they in the shop? I opened my mouth to protest, but Ruger reached up and put a finger over my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me, Soph,\u201d he said, his voice low and merciless. His hands reached down between us and then I felt the head of his c**k rubbing up and down along my clit, slow and deadly. Holy shit. Kimber hadn\u2019t been lying\u2014there was definitely something metal down there and it felt f**king fantastic.</p><p>Given that I\u2019d already come, you\u2019d think Ruger would be in rougher shape than me. Instead I found myself super-sensitized. If I\u2019d thought his fingers felt good, they had nothing on his c**k sliding along my clit. He teased me until I hovered right at the edge again, eyes fixed on the hoist hanging from the ceiling. Then he leaned down, sucking my nipple in so hard it almost hurt, and sensation burst through me. I tried to wiggle my sex against his cock, but he held me pinned and immobile.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t come until I say,\u201d he repeated, letting my nipple slide free, giving it a quick lick. \u201cWe clear?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Ruger demanded. I did, finding his face full of grim satisfaction. He slid his c**k up and down my clit again, one, two, three times. I grew wetter with every pass and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t remember why I\u2019d been against this.</p><p>Then he centered his c**k on my opening and pushed it in.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>RUGER</p><p>He slid his c**k into Sophie\u2019s sweet pu**y as slowly as possible, savoring every inch. She was f**kin\u2019 tight, like a clamp around his dick, the tug at his barbell making things just that much better. He could actually feel her heartbeat. If he didn\u2019t know for a fact she\u2019d given birth to a child, he\u2019d think she was a goddamned virgin\u2014hot and swollen and perfect.</p><p>Maybe he should\u2019ve felt guilty, taking her like this.</p><p>She was all worked up emotionally, and vulnerable as hell. Understandable. Her little confession about Zach had floored him. He still couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d been so blind, but he\u2019d already decided one thing.</p><p>Next time he saw his stepbrother, he\u2019d kill him.</p><p>As for Sophie ... He\u2019d f**ked up by not keeping a closer eye on her and Zach, and f**ked up even worse by letting the law step in to fix the problem. He hadn\u2019t been ready to admit Sophie was his responsibility four years ago, despite what\u2019d happened between them at Noah\u2019s birth. He\u2019d spent too long playing the good uncle, ignoring what he felt because he knew it wasn\u2019t the best thing for her. She deserved to be free, and who was he to take that away from her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, f**k that.</p><p>He was a jealous ass**le, and the thought of some other man\u2019s c**k in her juicy little cunt ... Picnic was right\u2014he needed to claim her or let her go, and that sure as f**k wouldn\u2019t be happening. Ever. Sophie might not be ready for a property patch, but that didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d patched her a different way, with a ring of slowly purpling marks around her neck. His very own collar, branding her and declaring to the world that she had a man who owned her.</p><p>God, he loved the sight of her laid out on the bench, hands tied with his belt, tank and bra pushed high, boobs shaking every time he slammed home. Better than he\u2019d ever imagined, and f**k, he\u2019d spent a lot of time imagining her just like this. He tried to be careful, but when she started whimpering and convulsing around him it was too much. Ruger drove deep, loving the little scream she gave, blowing his self-control. Something primal and powerful broke free.</p><p>He grabbed her hips, digging his fingers into her ass. One hand slid closer to her rear and he thought, what the hell, sliding in his finger. She stiffened and shrieked, interior muscles convulsing around him so hard he had to stop and hold steady, trying not to explode on the spot.</p> <p>That hadn\u2019t been a shriek of pain, thank f**k.</p><p>Sophie stared at him with wide eyes, panting so hard her tits practically danced. It was f**king hot. He\u2019d remember this moment as long as he lived. Ruger started moving again, savoring the clench of her muscles with every stroke, wondering if it was possible to die from pleasure.</p><p>Seemed pretty likely, all things considered.</p><p>He used his finger deep inside, and his hand on her hip, to control her position. He knew from her gasp that he\u2019d hit exactly right. Now every stroke ground the rounded head of his barbell against her G-spot. Making a girl come while playing with her clit was fine, but he f**kin\u2019 loved the way it felt if he got them off from the inside.</p><p>He wanted that from Sophie\u2014total convulsion, total submission. She stiffened and moaned. Fucking close.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, baby,\u201d he said, watching her face. She\u2019d closed her eyes, head turned to the side, back arching as she strained toward him. He should\u2019ve patched her years ago. What the f**k had he been thinking, missing out on this? \u201cBlow around me, show me what that sweet pu**y of yours can do.\u201d</p><p>In the background, Ruger heard voices, and knew some of the brothers had come into the shed. The thought of them seeing him like this, watching him brand Sophie, almost sent him over the edge. This wasn\u2019t just about f**king her\u2014although f**king her definitely kicked ass. No, this was about claiming her once and for all, and the more people who saw it, the better.</p><p>Ruger slammed into her harder, loving the little grunting noises she made with every thrust. He knew she was close, damned close, so he pulled out just enough to center his c**k head on her G-spot and started a series of hard, short, unrelenting strokes. She came with a scream, hips jerking and tits shaking. Her pu**y felt like a damned vise, and that did it for him. Ruger pulled out at the last second, spraying his come across her stomach.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>She\u2019d never been more beautiful\u2014at his mercy, covered in his seed, and marked so that any man who saw her would know she was f**king owned. He wanted to tattoo his name across her ass and keep her tied up like this all day, ready and waiting for his cock.</p><p>Somehow, he doubted she\u2019d be on board with that. Ruger bit back a grin. Sophie opened her eyes and looked up at him, dazed.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Ruger replied, wondering if any man in history had ever felt half as satisfied as he did in that moment. Probably not. He dropped a hand down to her stomach, rubbing his come slowly up her body toward her ni**les.</p><p>Yup, he was a pretty sick f**k, because even that turned him on.</p><p>Having an old lady wasn\u2019t half bad, he decided. Not half bad at all.</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>Holy shit on a stick. That was ... unprecedented.</p><p>Ruger had asked how many men I\u2019d been with and I\u2019d told him three. But compared to him? I wasn\u2019t sure the others even qualified. I\u2019d never felt anything quite as good as what he\u2019d just done to me. Not even close. Now he gazed down at me with lazy, hooded eyes, smug as all hell.</p><p>He deserved to be.</p> <p>I grinned right back at him. Maybe this wasn\u2019t such a huge mistake.</p><p>\u201cDamn, she squealed like a f**kin\u2019 pig,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said off to the right. I went from afterglow to pure horror in less than a second. Not only was I splayed on the counter, totally exposed, but my hands were tied up, too. I thrashed, trying to get free, hoping to hell they\u2019d just heard me, rather than watched the whole show.</p><p>Ruger laughed, which was not an acceptable response. Not even a little.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d he said, turning toward the three men who\u2019d come up next to the van. He didn\u2019t sound pissed, though. He sounded pretty damn pleased with himself. \u201cThis one\u2019s mine. Go screw your own girl.\u201d</p><p>The men laughed and wandered over to the far side of the shed to look at the motorcycles, as if they hadn\u2019t just seen me getting publicly plowed.</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>\u201cRuger, pull down my shirt and let me go,\u201d I hissed. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and straightened my bra and T-shirt, then tucked his c**k back into his pants. This wasn\u2019t cutting it\u2014I wanted my arms free and my shorts on. Now. Instead, he leaned down over me, standing between my legs, elbows braced on either side of my body.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we got things clear now?\u201d he asked. I glared up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I hissed. \u201cJesus, Ruger, let me go. I need to get on my clothes. I can\u2019t believe they saw me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve got anything they haven\u2019t seen before?\u201d he asked, smirking. \u201cYou worry too much, Soph. These are bikers, they\u2019ve seen people f**king. And it\u2019s a damned good thing they saw, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause now they know you belong to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so f**kin\u2019 worried about Noah, I didn\u2019t figure it out until today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure what out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat this thing between us is already out there and it\u2019s already real. We can\u2019t make it go away. We\u2019re together and we\u2019ll make it work. Or we won\u2019t. Sex is the least of it, though. This goes way past sex.\u201d</p><p>Sudden hope hit me, then I shook my head, reminding myself not to be stupid. This was Ruger. I might love him, but I wasn\u2019t blind ...</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you care about me?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cLike, really care?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he said, wrinkling his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve always cared about you, Soph, no secret there. I mean, I f**kin\u2019 held you on the side of the road while you pushed out a baby. Don\u2019t wanna sound like a dick here, but the fact is not every guy would do that. Somethin\u2019 happened that night. We pretended it didn\u2019t for a long time. Now we\u2019re done pretending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a giant slut,\u201d I said flatly, hating the words even though they needed to be said. \u201cI won\u2019t be with a guy who sleeps around, yet here we are at a party where some random couple f**king in a shed doesn\u2019t even hit the radar. You plan to keep it in your pants?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dark and cool, and I knew my answer before he even opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bring anyone home,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I can\u2019t imagine wanting to f**k anyone but you. But this life, it\u2019s about freedom. I became a Reaper so I could make my own rules. Not looking to put my dick on a chain and hand it off to some woman like it\u2019s a damned puppy or something.\u201d</p><p>Pain ripped through me, and I thought about what Maggs had told me.</p><p>Lay it out for him. Either he\u2019s on board or he\u2019s not.</p><p>Clearly, Ruger wasn\u2019t on board, which meant this was one big, fat dead end. My missing sense of self-preservation finally kicked back in. God, I was such an idiot.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna untie that belt or what?\u201d I asked, forcing myself to detach. Ruger and Zach might be very different men, but they had one thing in common. They both saw me as a thing to own, a possession. Ruger narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all pissy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I plan to sleep around, but I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me up, Ruger,\u201d I said, my voice soft. \u201cI need to put on my clothes and get cleaned up. Then I want to go visit with my friends and pretend this didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me up.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at me, but he reached over and loosened the belt. The instant my hands came free I sat up, pushing at his big, stupid chest to get him out of my way. I hopped off the counter and grabbed my panties and shorts, sliding them on. Then I started walking away. I needed to find a bathroom, clean myself up. He hadn\u2019t even worn a f**king condom.</p><p>Shit. SHIT.</p><p>How stupid could I be? At least I was on the pill ... No little brothers or sisters for Noah, thank God. Still, I\u2019d need to get tested. Idiot. Thankfully, I knew he usually wore condoms\u2014I\u2019d certainly found enough of them around his house.</p><p>I\u2019d talk to him about that later.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cSophie, I said to f**kin\u2019 stop,\u201d he said, his voice harder. One of the men across the shed glanced up, speculation in his eyes. Great. I guess giving the locals the first show wasn\u2019t enough. We were still on Ruger\u2019s turf, though, so I\u2019d follow his rules. For now.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re together now, you get that, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Soph. You\u2019re my property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m my own property,\u201d I said slowly and clearly. Time to make a break before things got even worse. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan for this to happen, but I have to give you credit. You\u2019re pretty good at getting a girl off. I enjoyed every second of it. And I think you\u2019re right about Noah, too. He needs a man in his life. But us actually screwing doesn\u2019t really change anything\u2014we\u2019re not working out. That doesn\u2019t mean he needs to suffer. You guys keep doing your thing together. I won\u2019t get in your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation is finally working for the first damned time.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, resolute.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s going to happen in the next few days,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to find a job, and then I\u2019m going to find a cheap place to live. Get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f**kin\u2019 bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat\u2019s reality. You want the freedom to sleep around. I\u2019m not willing to give you that\u2014I want more. Sounds like we have a fundamental difference of opinion here, and I\u2019m not going to try to change you. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing, Ruger\u2014I deserve to be with someone who gives a shit about me, as a person. Someone who values me enough not to f**k other women. I\u2019d rather be alone the rest of my life than settle for what you\u2019re offering. Consider yourself a hell of a booty call, but that\u2019s it. We clear?\u201d</p><p>With that I walked away from him, hoping I didn\u2019t look too much like I\u2019d just gotten my brains screwed out.</p><p>Not that it really mattered.</p><p>As much as I hated to admit it, I probably wasn\u2019t going to be seeing any of these people again anyway. So far as I could tell, women were only part of the club when they were attached to a man, and I considered myself officially detached. I\u2019d be collecting my purse and my keys from the food table and then I\u2019d be getting the hell away from the Reapers MC for good.</p><p>Too bad about the girls. I really liked them a lot.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, what happened to you?\u201d Maggs demanded. She looked me over and burst out laughing. \u201cLadies, check this one out.\u201d</p><p>I blushed, wishing I could disappear. So much for nobody guessing what I\u2019d been up to.</p><p>\u201cI see you and Ruger had your little discussion,\u201d Dancer said, peering closely at me. \u201cWhat the hell is he, a damned vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have hickies all over your neck,\u201d Em said, smirking. \u201cBig ones. He did it on purpose\u2014no way a person could do that by accident.\u201d</p><p>Fucking ass**le.</p><p>\u201cHe is such a dick,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is news?\u201d Marie asked. \u201cThey\u2019re all dicks. It\u2019s sort of a defining characteristic of men, babe. You know, that dangly thing between their legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d</p><p>Maggs stopped laughing and put her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou are so not going home,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely not. Wasn\u2019t this the plan? To figure out what he really wanted from you? Looks like he stepped up. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t stick around and have fun with your girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know what he wants from me,\u201d I muttered, feeling miserable. \u201cHe wants me to be his property.\u201d</p><p>The women all squealed, and Marie tried to give me a hug.</p><p>\u201cThat kicks ass!\u201d Em said. I shook my head, and they sobered, confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe told me that if I sleep with another guy he\u2019ll cut off his dick and feed it to him,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then he told me he wouldn\u2019t make any promises about not sleeping around himself. He did say he wouldn\u2019t bring anyone home, so I guess I\u2019m supposed to feel good about that? Um, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Marie muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Maggs replied. \u201cAlthough I see where he gets it. Some of these guys, they f**k anything that moves. They have their old ladies at home, ass on the side, and everyone just pretends it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone think that\u2019s okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it, either,\u201d Marie said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really my business, telling other people how to live. I know what I\u2019d do to Horse, though. He\u2019d be praying for death by the time I finished with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would be,\u201d Em added grimly. \u201cMarie\u2019s real good with a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019d shoot his dick right off, one inch at a time,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cAnd trust me, he knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t care how other people live,\u201d I said. \u201cIf they want to let their men sleep around, that\u2019s their business. But I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll put up with it. Not good enough for me, and no way I want Noah growing up thinking that\u2019s how you treat a woman. Ruger can take his offer, stick it on a fork, and shove it up his ass. Now I need to find a job and somewhere to live, because I\u2019m sure as hell not living with him any longer.\u201d</p><p>Maggs nodded, reaching into her back pocket and pulling out a tiny flask.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s medicinal,\u201d she said gravely. I twisted off the lid and took a quick sniff, which led to a sneezing fit.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own special mix,\u201d she said, waggling her eyebrows. \u201cTrust me, it won\u2019t solve a thing, but you know what it will do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistract you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be too busy trying to put out the fire in your throat. Bottoms up!\u201d</p><p>I took a swig. Damned if she wasn\u2019t right.</p> <p>Four hours later, my throat still burned from Maggs\u2019 special medicine. I\u2019d decided not to leave\u2014the girls convinced me that I shouldn\u2019t let him win by running away.</p><p>Making sure Ruger didn\u2019t win was extremely high on my list of priorities.</p><p>The party was surprisingly fun. Maggs and I stuck together, seeing as both of us were man-free. She wore Bolt\u2019s property patch so guys left her alone. I wore a ring of hickies that darkened and grew nastier as the night progressed, which may or may not have served the same purpose. It would\u2019ve been totally humiliating, except I\u2019d already decided I didn\u2019t give a flying f**k about any of the Reapers or their sluts.</p><p>And there were a lot of sluts floating around, including Blondie from the kitchen. She gave me a nasty little one-finger wave. More showed up every minute, multiplying like rabbits. To be fair, most of them seemed like pretty nice people, but I was heavily invested in hating them.</p><p>I kept wondering which ones Ruger had f**ked.</p><p>The old ladies\u2014there were about ten total\u2014were a different group entirely. I liked them a lot and was sorry I wouldn\u2019t be getting to know them better. Maggs and Marie must\u2019ve spread the word about my situation, because nobody asked me any nosy questions. The girls kept me so busy I hardly had time to think about my humiliation.</p><p>I did learn a few interesting things, though.</p><p>For one, Maggs shared why Bolt was in jail. It was an ugly story. Apparently he\u2019d been convicted of raping a girl who worked at The Line. We were sitting in a couple of camp chairs over by the playground, watching over the kids, when Maggs started talking about it so matter-of-factly that I thought I hadn\u2019t heard her right at first.</p> <p>\u201cUm ...\u201d I said, desperately searching for some kind of response. What do you say when someone tells you her man\u2019s in jail for rape?</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cHe got set up.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, wondering how a woman who seemed so smart could be so stupid. Who stays with a ra**st? If he\u2019d gone to prison, odds were good he\u2019d done the crime.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, taking my hand and squeezing it. \u201cI can see what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s not like that. I was with him when it happened, hon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell the cops?\u201d I asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut the girl ID\u2019d him and there was another witness who said they got into a car together. They never tested the DNA, although we\u2019ve got a lawyer working on that. He says it\u2019s just a matter of time before we get him out. It\u2019s not Bolt\u2019s DNA, but the state lab is so far behind it takes a f**king miracle to get them to lift a finger. The cops said I was lying to cover for him. Made me look like a criminal and a whore on the stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible, Maggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d she said, her face sober. \u201cI love him so damned much. Bolt is a wonderful man. He\u2019s done some crazy-ass shit, but he\u2019s not a f**king ra**st, you know? But being a biker\u2019s old lady? To the cops, that means you\u2019re nothing more than a club puppet. My testimony meant jack shit by the time they finished with me. He\u2019s up for parole in a year anyway, but I want his name cleared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they processed the DNA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d she said. \u201cNew excuse every day. Fucking prosecutors.\u201d</p><p>Huh ...</p><p>I didn\u2019t know where to put that, so I fell quiet. What I didn\u2019t do was get up or look away, because while I\u2019d only met Maggs recently, I believed her. She wasn\u2019t stupid and she wasn\u2019t weak.</p><p>Scary to think the system could be so corrupt.</p><p>\u201cThey definitely screwed Bolt,\u201d Marie said, plopping down next to us. \u201cBut the local prosecutors aren\u2019t all bad. I got off on self-defense last year, after things went down with my brother.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at her, curious, but she seemed lost in thought. That story could wait for another day, I decided. If we had another day. The girls were being supportive, but whether they\u2019d be friends long-term was iffy. I got the impression that once you left the club, you were out ... and I was out before I\u2019d even gotten in.</p><p>We settled in to talk about other, happier things as the sky darkened. By nine, the kids were all gone and things started getting wilder. The music went up and women\u2019s shirts started coming off, none of which fazed my new friends. Then the guys started a big bonfire and broke out a fresh keg. Couples started disappearing into the darkness. I tried not to look too closely, afraid Ruger had already found someone new to screw. He was free to do whatever the hell he wanted. Didn\u2019t mean I needed to watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That seemed like my cue to leave, except I still hadn\u2019t talked to Buck about a job. The more I thought about working at The Line, the less realistic it seemed. Maybe I should just let it go ... I mentioned this as I helped Marie, Maggs, and Em clean up the food tables. Dancer had taken her boys to her mom\u2019s house a while ago and hadn\u2019t gotten back yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to Buck and decide after that?\u201d Maggs suggested, piling half-eaten bags of chips into a cardboard box. \u201cI\u2019ll help you find him. Let\u2019s get this finished first, though. All this shit needs to go into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, give me the box,\u201d Marie said, reaching for it. \u201cSophie, can you grab that other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, picking it up. Marie was really sweet\u2014she\u2019d spent half the night talking about her wedding, which was just three weeks away. She\u2019d made it very clear that she wanted me to come, no matter what was up with Ruger.</p> <p>Now I followed her into the Armory through a back door, leading past a set of bathrooms into the large kitchen area. It wasn\u2019t anything special\u2014not a professional kitchen. Still big, though, like you\u2019d find in a church. Three fridges, lots of counter space, and a big, round garbage can that had overflowed onto the floor.</p><p>We both stopped, staring at it.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I cannot believe what pigs these boys can be,\u201d she muttered. \u201cTake the f**king garbage out when it\u2019s full. Doesn\u2019t take a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we can handle it?\u201d I asked, considering the can. It was packed hard and looked heavy.</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d she replied. We set down the food, stuffed in as much of the spilled garbage as possible, and then each grabbed a side. It wasn\u2019t easy, but we wrestled it out through the kitchen and into the main lounge of the Armory, which I hadn\u2019t seen yet.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I said to Marie, eyes wide. The place was full of men drinking and women walking around all but naked. There was a bar with a naked chick giving body shots. My eyes skittered away only to land on another girl whose head bobbed up and down over a man\u2019s lap. He sat on a ratty couch, leaning back with his eyes closed, one hand wrapped tight in her hair.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore it,\u201d Marie muttered, rolling her eyes. \u201cBunch of dumbasses. The Dumpster\u2019s out in the front, across from the parking lot. The geniuses who designed this place didn\u2019t put in many external doors. Built to be a fortress. Annoying as hell.\u201d</p><p>We lugged the garbage across the room, and I felt my cheeks burning. Then a man came up and grabbed the heavy can on my side.</p><p>\u201cYou girls should\u2019ve asked for help,\u201d he said, smiling at me. He was kind of cute, I realized. A little older\u2014probably in his thirties. He had a long beard, tattoos (they all had tattoos, I figured it must be in the bylaws or something), and he wore a cut with one of those little diamond 1% patches. His name read \u201cD.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Marie said brightly. \u201cGrab the door for us, will you, Soph?\u201d</p><p>I opened the big main door leading out into the front parking lot. There were more guys out there, sort of standing around\u2014the guys I\u2019d seen earlier, who didn\u2019t have very many patches on their vests.</p> <p>\u201cProspects, get your asses over here and take care of this garbage,\u201d D.C. yelled, and two of them jumped up to grab the can.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to go back in the kitchen when they\u2019re done,\u201d Marie told D.C.</p><p>\u201cNo prob, babe,\u201d he replied. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>Marie and I exchanged glances. I could tell she didn\u2019t want to introduce me, but neither of us wanted to be rude, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sophie,\u201d I said, taking the pressure off her. \u201cI\u2019m just visiting. In fact, I\u2019m heading out soon.\u201d</p><p>Marie opened her mouth to add something. Suddenly a giant man came up behind her, swinging her up and twirling her around before throwing her over his shoulder.</p><p>Horse.</p><p>\u201cI need f**ked, woman!\u201d he declared, smacking her ass. Then he carried her back into the building as she shrieked in protest.</p> <p>I suddenly found myself alone in the dark with D.C. and the prospects. None of the younger guys looked me in the eye, and I thought very hard about the warnings I\u2019d been given earlier.</p><p>Yup\u2014I was in the negative on every detail.</p><p>\u201cNice brands,\u201d he said. He reached up to trace the stupid hickies Ruger had given me. \u201cYou belong to someone?\u201d</p><p>Now that was a loaded question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I replied, glancing around. I don\u2019t know what I was looking for. Kimber would know what to do at a time like this, I thought darkly. \u201cI need to get back inside, find the girls. I\u2019ll just ... go over there,\u201d I added, nodding toward the big gate in the wall to the side of the building. The gate I\u2019d come in before. No way I would be walking back through that clubhouse by myself, not after what I\u2019d seen in there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d D.C. said, wrapping his arm around my shoulders and tucking me in tight next to his body. I smelled booze on his breath.</p><p>Shit. SHIT. SHIT!</p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d Em yelled, waving at me from the gate. I\u2019d never been so happy to see someone in my life. She walked over to us, her smile bright and sweet. \u201cThanks for finding Sophie, D.C. I need to get her back now\u2014Ruger\u2019s up next in the ring, and he\u2019ll be super pissed if she misses his fight. They live together, you know.\u201d</p><p>D.C. let me go and I ran over to Em. He frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cTold you it was complicated,\u201d I said, my voice wavering. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>He snorted as he turned and walked back into the Armory, slamming the door behind him. The remaining guys looked everywhere but at me and Em.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I could kill Marie for leaving you with him,\u201d Em muttered, grabbing my arm and dragging me across the parking lot toward the gate. \u201cAt least she yelled at me to go get you as Horse carried her past. Never leave a sister behind, you know? That could\u2019ve gotten ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, she didn\u2019t really have much choice,\u201d I said. \u201cHorse just grabbed her and carried her off. It happened really fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll Horse thinks about is sex,\u201d Em snapped, her voice heavy with a mixture of disgust and what sounded suspiciously like jealousy.</p><p>\u201cAt least Marie sent you out here,\u201d I said. \u201cWould he have hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said, her voice smooth. \u201cBut odds are good he\u2019s drunk. You get a guy drunk enough, he doesn\u2019t always hear the word \u2018no.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes that happen?\u2019</p><p>\u201cRape?\u201d she asked, bluntly. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s considered okay or anything, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s happened here. It happened in my college dorm, too. Anytime you put people together, some of them are going to do horrible things. And you get enough horny men drinking enough alcohol, it can lead to bad shit. I\u2019ll tell you one thing\u2014I feel safer here than I have at some frat parties. Reaper parties might get wilder than college ones, but we have rules and trust me, they\u2019re enforced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you grew up around this?\u201d I asked. \u201cWasn\u2019t that ... scary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI grew up with twenty uncles,\u201d Em said, smiling brightly as we passed through the gate. She raised a hand to the guys standing there and they all waved back. Clearly, Em was loved. \u201cAll of them would\u2019ve done anything for me. I had aunties all over, too, and a bunch of kids to play with\u2014kids I\u2019d known all my life. You saw how many children were here earlier, and they were all having a great time. Of course, we send them home before things get too crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what age did you start staying later?\u201d I asked. She rolled her eyes and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDad told me to leave about half an hour ago,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to grow up. Not that any guy here would lay a finger on me. That\u2019s the thing\u2014this is a family. Family takes care of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all these women running around?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat D.C. guy wasn\u2019t interested in me as family.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell, and she sighed.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t family,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re Ruger\u2019s family and you\u2019ll be treated with respect\u2014D.C.\u2019s not from around here, and he had no idea who you were\u2014but if you\u2019re serious about not being Ruger\u2019s property, you\u2019ll never be a real part of the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you hate me if I told you I don\u2019t want to be part of the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cBelieve me. I just wish it could be different for you guys. I wouldn\u2019t settle for what Ruger\u2019s offering either, though. No f**king way. You want to get out of here? My dad\u2019s gonna see me sooner or later, so I might as well bug out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I really do,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go watch a movie or something,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can come over to my place if you like. We have a killer home theater setup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, that sounds good,\u201d I replied, sort of surprised. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny. I don\u2019t think of a motorcycle club president as being the kind of guy who\u2019d have a home theater.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019d have a virgin daughter, either,\u201d she said, regaining some of her humor. \u201cFuck this, let\u2019s go. Last time they had a party this big, I walked in on my dad screwing this chick I graduated with. It was disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Back out in the courtyard, a circle had formed beyond the bonfire. People cheered, yelled, and groaned every few seconds.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that all about?\u201d I asked, craning my neck.</p><p>\u201cFights,\u201d Em said shortly. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you have too many penises concentrated in one place. Oh, and I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said Ruger was up next\u2014he\u2019s out there right now. For some reason they think it\u2019s fun to hit each other. Let\u2019s find Maggs. Maybe she\u2019ll come watch movies with us.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, then spotted Maggs. She stood near the fire, staring deep into the flames. I walked over to her but she didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and crossed her arms, frowning.</p><p>\u201cPeachy,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just sick and f**king tired of being here without my man. The club\u2019s great and all, but it\u2019s not like having Bolt in my bed.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do, so I hugged her. She hugged me back. I really wanted to stay friends with these women, despite the whole Ruger situation.</p><p>\u201cHey, you want to come and watch movies with me and Em?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m sick of Ruger, Picnic says Em has to leave, and you\u2019re lonely. Sounds like God himself wants us to get out of here and eat some chocolate ice cream.\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cIce cream\u2019s no substitute for a man,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>\u201cWe can have whipped cream on it,\u201d I said, waggling my eyebrows. \u201cYou can pretend you\u2019re licking it off him instead of the spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dork,\u201d she replied, but she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cBut I\u2019m a dork who knows her refrigerated toppings, and that\u2019s mission-critical tonight. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to meet Buck first,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to ask him about a job.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Did I really want to work at a strip club\u2014especially one owned by the Reapers? Didn\u2019t seem like the best way to distance myself ...</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cJust talk to him, and then we\u2019ll get back to what\u2019s really important\u2014ice cream and chick flicks. A sad one, please, because I\u2019m definitely in the mood for a good cry. Let\u2019s just talk to him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you have anything to lose,\u201d Em added, coming up beside us. \u201cFind Buck, then we\u2019ll ditch this place. I\u2019m ready for a three-way with Ben and Jerry.\u201d</p><p>Maggs took my hand and pulled me toward the crowd surrounding the fighters, Em trailing us like a puppy. I couldn\u2019t see much of the fight, what with the wall of bikers cutting us off, but Maggs wormed her way through them like an expert. Soon we stood on the edge of the \u201cring,\u201d which was just a line traced in the dirt. She was looking around for Buck, but the sound of a fist hitting flesh caught my full attention.</p><p>Ruger stood in the center of the circle, naked to the waist, hands bare, expression hostile. He was facing off against a man I didn\u2019t know. He looked a little younger than Ruger, and based on the blood dripping down his face, Ruger was kicking his ass.</p><p>Em stumbled to a halt next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does Painter think he\u2019s doing?\u201d she muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s fighting Ruger. That\u2019s f**king stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, eyes glued to the men circling each other. I could see the top half of Ruger\u2019s panther tattoo above his jeans. It really was perfect for him\u2014every movement was lithe and smooth and utterly predatory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRuger\u2019s really good,\u201d Em said shortly. \u201cHe\u2019ll slaughter Painter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the one ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, her voice grim. \u201cThat\u2019s him. The guy who won\u2019t put out for me. I hope Ruger kicks his ass.\u201d</p><p>Ruger chose that moment to plow his fist into Painter\u2019s stomach, and the crowd roared. Painter gasped but he stayed upright, recovering surprisingly fast, at least to my uneducated eye.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s over there,\u201d Maggs said, grabbing my arm again. I looked at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wanted to talk to him about a job, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d I said, forcing myself to look away from the circling boxers. What kind of idiots fought like this on purpose? Maggs dragged me through the crowd some more, coming to a halt next to a big man watching the fight with his arms crossed. He didn\u2019t look too happy.</p><p>\u201cHey, Buck,\u201d Maggs said brightly. He glanced down at her and raised a brow. I swallowed.</p> <p>\u201cUm, we can do this a different time,\u201d I leaned in and whispered to Maggs. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just like that,\u201d she said. \u201cRight, Buck? You\u2019re always kind of a dick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The big man actually smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re always kind of a bitch, but I like you anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ready to ditch Bolt\u2019s ass and f**k a real man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jade might have a problem with that, and she\u2019s a helluva good shot.\u201d</p><p>This time the smile reached his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the f**kin\u2019 truth,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, but she can be a bitch. Never boring. So who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Sophie,\u201d she said, jerking me forward. From the ring I heard the crack of flesh hitting flesh, and saw Painter staggering in the corner of my eye. Ruger circled him like a cat playing with its food. I forced myself not to pay attention, focusing on Buck instead. Talking to him couldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s looking for a job,\u201d Maggs added.</p><p>\u201cDancing?\u201d he asked, raising a brow. His eyes crawled down my figure, assessing me closely in a new way\u2014all business now.</p><p>\u201cI want to waitress,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve waited tables in bars before. Never a strip club, but I\u2019m a hard worker. I hear it\u2019s a good place to work.\u201d</p><p>He studied me, face thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to anyone?\u201d</p><p>Maggs and I looked at each other, and I shook my head.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Maggs,\u201d he said, although his tone wasn\u2019t mean. \u201cShe can\u2019t talk for herself, she\u2019s got no place in my bar. So what\u2019s the story, you belong to someone or not?\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden flurry of activity between the fighters, a series of fast blows that I couldn\u2019t quite follow in my peripheral vision. Based on the crowd\u2019s reaction, things were getting interesting.</p><p>\u201cYou this slow takin\u2019 drink orders?\u201d Buck asked. \u201c\u2019Cause I don\u2019t need a slow waitress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, gathering myself. \u201cRuger is my son\u2019s uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe give you that ring around your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I said, grimacing. \u201cAnd I live with him. Nothing between us, though. I just really need a job.\u201d</p><p>Buck eyed me speculatively, then glanced at Maggs. She smirked and rolled her eyes. Buck nodded slowly, then leaned over to the man next to him.</p><p>\u201cHundred bucks on Painter?\u201d</p><p>The man stared at him, brows raising.</p><p>\u201cYou f**kin\u2019 insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Buck said. \u201cWe got a bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take your money. Kid\u2019s almost finished.\u201d</p><p>Buck turned back to me.</p><p>\u201cShow me your tits,\u201d he said.</p><p>My eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking to dance,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cJust wait tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I need to make sure you\u2019ll fill out the uniform right. You can leave your bra, but lift that shirt if you want a job.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Maggs, who nodded reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, bright eyes darting between me, Buck, and the men fighting. \u201cYou need a decent rack to waitress at The Line. Go ahead, nobody will care.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, reached down, and pulled up my shirt all the way.</p><p>Two seconds later I heard a huge crash. Suddenly Ruger was between me and Buck, fist slamming into his face. Buck went down and Ruger followed, pounding him brutally.</p><p>I screamed as Maggs jerked me to the side, both of us ducking our heads and huddling together. Three guys jumped on Ruger, pulling him off Buck. He fought against them, cussing and growling. Picnic appeared, followed by Gage, who carried a bat.</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up, everyone,\u201d Picnic yelled. \u201cRuger, pull your shit together! You\u2019re out of the ring, you forfeit. Now stop thinkin\u2019 with your dick, jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d Ruger growled.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna pull your shit together?\u201d Gage asked. Ruger nodded tightly and the guys let him go. Gage reached down to Buck, giving him a hand up. \u201cWe got a problem here?\u201d</p><p>Buck spat out some blood and grinned, the bright red outlining his teeth horrifically and dripping down his chin. He looked like a serial killer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d he said, licking his lips. \u201cAsshole just won a bet for me. Too f**kin\u2019 easy.\u201d</p><p>Then he glanced at me, still crouched next to Maggs, utterly stunned.</p><p>\u201cNo job,\u201d he said. \u201cGot enough bitch drama at the bar already. At a fight, though? Perfect. Ruger always wins, f**kin\u2019 beautiful moment. Thanks, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, okay,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI think I\u2019d do better working somewhere else anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ruger glared at me, chest heaving, his entire body covered with a sheen of sweat.</p><p>\u201cYou asked him for a job?\u201d he demanded, grabbing my arm and jerking me through the crowd. I tried to break away, but he didn\u2019t even notice.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>Ruger dragged me over to the courtyard wall and pinned me up against it, putting a hand on either side of my head as he got down into my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of this is so f**kin\u2019 complicated?\u201d he asked, as angry as I\u2019d ever seen him. Well, almost ... \u201cYou don\u2019t just go around flashing your tits. It\u2019s not a difficult concept, Sophie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaggs said he needed to check me out for the waitress job,\u201d I told him quickly. \u201cShe said it wasn\u2019t personal, not a big deal at all.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cWhen a man asks to see a woman\u2019s tits, it\u2019s always personal,\u201d he said slowly and clearly. \u201cAnd yours belong to me. No f**kin\u2019 way I\u2019m letting you work at The Line. And keep your damned shirt on. Christ, it\u2019s like I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to myself half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d I said, not bothering to argue. Pointless. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this club, I\u2019m leaving. Em and I plan to watch movies and eat ice cream.\u201d</p> <p>Ruger stilled, then reached out and brushed my hair behind my ear, his touch gentle. I felt myself relax a little. Maybe he wasn\u2019t as angry as I\u2019d thought. Then his fingers slid deeper into my hair and his eyes hardened.</p><p>His hand tightened painfully as he jerked my mouth into his. His tongue stabbed deep into my mouth, possessive and dominant. His other hand caught my arm, jerking my body forward into his as he twisted it up and behind me. One knee shoved between my legs, and he slanted his head, taking everything he wanted and more.</p><p>My body loved it, the faithless bitch.</p><p>The fight had left him sweaty all over, sending out pheromones so strong it\u2019s a wonder I could still stand upright. I wanted to wrap my arms around him but he held me too tight, controlling every move.</p><p>I was starting to sense a pattern with Mr. Don\u2019t-Come-Until-I-Tell-You.</p> <p>Finally he pulled away, both of us gasping for breath. He still held me tight, completely incapable of movement even if I\u2019d wanted to get away, which I didn\u2019t. My brain had checked out a while back. His hips ground into me, c**k more than ready to finish things off.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to me,\u201d he said, voice harsh.</p><p>\u201cRuger\u2014\u201d I started, but a sudden, loud, feminine scream tore through the air.</p><p>Ruger dropped me and spun around, covering me with his body as he scoped out the situation. The screaming continued, and then I heard a roar of masculine rage. In the dim firelight I saw a man tear across the courtyard, with about ten more guys chasing him. He hit the far wall, jumped high and caught the top with his hands, pulling himself over.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cStay out of the way,\u201d Ruger said, turning to me. His eyes were deadly serious, and for once I had every intention of doing exactly what he said. \u201cI\u2019ll send one of the girls over, then you get the f**k outta here. Walk to your cars together. Got me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we call the cops?\u201d I asked as the screaming died down. Now I heard crying and angry shouting. \u201cSomeone\u2019s hurt. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea what happened,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll get help, no worries. But don\u2019t call the cops. We handle things ourselves, within the club. Do what I say for once and wait for me to send someone over. Then go home and stay there. I can\u2019t deal with this and worry about you, too.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and he kissed me hard, then ran off toward the Armory gate. In the distance I heard bikes roar to life and then a gunshot. I slid down the wall and sat, knees drawn up tight against my chest, and did my best to obey Ruger perfectly.</p><p>Maggs came over ten minutes later. Her face was grim and she had streaks of blood on her arm. I stood and threw my arms around her, clutching her tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cFucking Toke,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of club shit going down. They voted on it today, supposed to be a done deal, but Toke\u2014he\u2019s out of Portland\u2014had a few too many beers and decided there should be a recount. He started fighting with Deke and pulled a goddamned knife, waving it around like a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was screaming?\u201d I asked. I pulled away and looked down at her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re all bloody. Who got hurt?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes hardened.</p> <p>\u201cEm,\u201d she said. \u201cCocksucker caught Em with his knife.\u201d</p><p>Shock hit me and I felt myself sway.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone call an ambulance?\u201d I asked, glancing around the courtyard. Beyond the fire I saw someone sitting on the ground, surrounded by women.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, thank God,\u201d Maggs said, her voice harsh and angry. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad cut at all. We\u2019ve got a guy who\u2019ll give her a few stitches, keep the whole thing off the radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that gunshot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPic wasn\u2019t too happy about his baby girl getting cut,\u201d she said, which I figured was a bit of an understatement. \u201cHad to be him. Toke took off, right over the wall, and I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s setting a new land-speed record right now. If he\u2019s smart, he won\u2019t stop \u2019til he hits Mexico. Em\u2019s a special girl, everyone loves her. Not to mention pulling on his own president. This is more than a fight\u2014it\u2019s club business. Toke just stepped in a giant, steaming pile of shit.\u201d</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cThey want all the girls cleared out. Marie and Dancer\u2019ll stick with Em, but the rest of us are no longer welcome. We need to stay out of the way. Hell, at this rate we\u2019ll be posting bail ... Be sure to sleep with your phone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou serious?\u201d I asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cIf Pic catches Toke, shit\u2019ll get ugly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry\u2014our boys are smart. They\u2019ll keep the situation under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bail thing? That was a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep your phone close, okay?\u201d</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>My hands shook so hard I had trouble getting the keys into the ignition. Maggs offered to follow me home but I wanted to go by myself. I had a lot to think about and I didn\u2019t feel like company. Clearly, Ruger and I had different definitions of what normal, appropriate behavior looked like.</p><p>For one, I felt that long-term relationships should be monogamous. He felt they should be monogamous for me and open for him. Another issue? My parties usually wound down when people ran out of food and got tired.</p><p>His occasionally ended with stabbings and high-speed chases.</p><p>And last, but certainly not least, I tended to think sex should be private. He liked rubbing his sperm on my stomach in front of his friends after branding me with hickies.</p><p>I needed to move out.</p><p>Immediately. No more messing around.</p><p>The more I thought about what had happened, the angrier I got. Em could\u2019ve been killed. I might already have a f**king STD, seeing as I screwed the King of the Man-whores\u2014condom-free\u2014in a damned shed, because I\u2019m classy like that. Oh, and what\u2019s-his-name might\u2019ve raped me in the darkness, just because I\u2019d had the nerve to take out the trash when it needed emptying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell was wrong with these people?</p><p>Two hours after pulling into Ruger\u2019s driveway, I\u2019d nearly finished packing up our stuff. We\u2019d only been at his house for a week, so it wasn\u2019t exactly hard. I just threw shit into boxes and then hauled them out to my car. I could probably get it all in one trip, seeing as Noah was still at Kimber\u2019s. I\u2019d call her first thing in the morning and ask if she could put us up for a couple of days.</p><p>Fuck Ruger. Fuck his beautiful house and f**k the Reapers. Fuck their motorcycles, too. I hoped they all got food poisoning at one of their damned pig roasts.</p><p>I\u2019d already finished packing my clothes, the living room, and the bathroom by the time I heard Ruger\u2019s bike pulling into the driveway. Well, wasn\u2019t that just craptastic ... I\u2019d planned to be gone before he got home, but if he wanted a fight, I\u2019d give him one. I might not have my life entirely together, but I was pretty sure about one thing\u2014parties that ended with stabbings weren\u2019t part of the long-term plan.</p> <p>Neither was being tied to a man in prison, working as a stripper, or worrying about whether or not I was safe without a goddamned brand across my back like a f**king cow.</p><p>I\u2019d started throwing Noah\u2019s clothes into the suitcase when Ruger\u2019s boots thudded down the stairs. He paused in my kitchen and I heard the sound of water filling a glass. So, now it wasn\u2019t good enough for him to put me in danger and invade my privacy? He had to get my glasses dirty, too? I threw Noah\u2019s stuffed dragon, Puff, into the case with a disgusted thud.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Why the f**k should I care where he got water?</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be here to wash the damned dishes. Wasn\u2019t my house. The ridiculousness of the night, the horrible way the party ended, packing to move God-knew-where at three in the morning\u2014it all hit me at once. I grabbed Puff and slid down next to the bed, laughing at my own craziness.</p> <p>Why had I ever, for even a second, thought we could live in Ruger\u2019s basement?</p><p>I laughed as Ruger walked down the hall. I laughed as he came in the room, and I kept laughing when he knelt down in front of me. I ignored the waves of frustrated anger rolling off him because I just didn\u2019t give a damn. He reached out and caught my chin, forcing me to look into his eyes. They cut through me accusingly\u2014like he had the right to an opinion?</p><p>I stopped laughing and gave him my most evil smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m packing,\u201d I told him, holding up the dragon for him to see. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. I\u2019m not your whore and Noah\u2019s not your son. Your club is insane and I don\u2019t want a damned thing to do with any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I said coming to the party was a bad idea?\u201d he asked me, raising a brow.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I remember that,\u201d I snapped. \u201cBut you know what would\u2019ve really driven the point home? Mentioning that when your parties get wild, girls get stabbed ... Because I\u2019m pretty sure we didn\u2019t cover that part. I would\u2019ve remembered, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get her justice,\u201d he said, eyes darkening. \u201cToke will pay. Deke and Picnic are on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, hate to break it to you, but Em doesn\u2019t need justice,\u201d I pointed out, voice heavy with sarcasm. \u201cShe needs to not get cut with a knife in the first place. Women are finicky that way\u2014we like not getting cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a horrible accident,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cAnd despite whatever crazy shit you\u2019re imagining, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever happened before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me with a straight face that you never have fights at your clubhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, speaking slowly and clearly. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that they don\u2019t usually involve innocent women. Two men want to fight, that\u2019s their business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about women who aren\u2019t so innocent?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere do you draw the line on that one? Do you like to hit girls, Ruger? Is that okay in your stupid club?\u201d</p><p>The air changed between us, growing cold. Oh, that got to him ... A whole new level of angry rolled into the room between us, and I suddenly realized taunting him might not be such a great idea.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about the club like that,\u201d he said, face like stone. \u201cShow respect if you want to be treated with respect. And you know what? Damned straight I\u2019d hit a woman, if she hit me first. I\u2019m not a knight in shining f**king armor, Sophie. What part of this don\u2019t you get? I\u2019ve been honest with you all along, no bullshit. And yeah, a woman who attacks a man deserves what she gets. She wants to act like a man, she can damned well fight like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d I asked him. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot a bit. You want equality, babe? That\u2019s equality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re practically a feminist,\u201d I muttered. \u201cEm wasn\u2019t fighting, Ruger. She\u2019ll have a scar the rest of her life. And how is it women have equality when it comes to taking a hit but the rest of the time they\u2019re just some guy\u2019s property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking shit about things you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he growled. \u201c\u2018Property\u2019 is a term of respect. It\u2019s part of our culture. You start judging us for that, you better start judging every woman who changes her name the day she gets married, because it\u2019s the same damned thing.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, running a hand through his hair, clearly frustrated.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re someone\u2019s property, you\u2019re a woman the brothers will die to protect,\u201d he continued, his voice softening. \u201cThey\u2019ll die to protect your kid, too. Don\u2019t turn that kind of loyalty into something ugly because you don\u2019t like the words we use. Dancer, Marie, Maggs? They\u2019re proud to be property, because they know what it means. Nobody forcing them to do anything.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, processing that.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me this,\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy did Horse tell me that Marie\u2019s \u2018worth every penny he paid for her\u2019? Because that sounded a little f**ked up, and I don\u2019t think he was joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at the clubhouse for less than a day and you\u2019ve already heard about that?\u201d he muttered, almost to himself. \u201cJesus. A little f**kin\u2019 discretion would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, don\u2019t want to scare away the new girls with reality, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he replied. \u201cMarie and Horse are fine, and they\u2019re getting married next month, so I think it\u2019s a moot point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoly shit, did he really buy her?\u201d I asked, eyes widening. \u201cRuger, that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t even have words for that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, maybe you\u2019ll shut up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, I have an update on Em for you. You know, your friend you\u2019re so worried about? Maybe a little more important than lecturing me about women\u2019s rights, ya think?\u201d</p><p>I froze, shamed. Ruger was right. I\u2019d been more focused on fighting with him than on Em. How shitty was that?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to hear how she\u2019s doing,\u201d I said. I tossed Puff to the side and rose to my feet. He stepped forward into my space, doing that intimidation thing he was so good at. \u201cSo how is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he said after a long pause. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of a cut. About three inches long and not deep at all. We got a friend of the club who came by, gave her some stitches to make sure she stays all pretty when it heals. Antibiotics, just to be careful. Last I saw her, she was high as a kite on oxy and singing some kid song about kittens and mittens. Picnic\u2019s not feelin\u2019 quite so festive, gotta admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news,\u201d I replied, staring at his chest blankly. He really was way too close. \u201cI got a text from Maggs an hour ago, but I wasn\u2019t sure if she was downplaying things or not. I don\u2019t like your parties, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst part wasn\u2019t half bad,\u201d he said slowly, a knowing smile stealing across his face. \u201cYou know, in the shed?\u201d</p><p>He reached out and touched my neck lightly, then wrapped his fingers around it.</p><p>\u201cMy marks look good,\u201d he continued. \u201cMight keep \u2019em on you long term, haven\u2019t decided yet. But you need to learn not to flirt with other guys, babe. You\u2019re claimed now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne, take your damned hand off me, because I am not claimed,\u201d I said. He ignored me. \u201cAnd two, I didn\u2019t flirt with anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flashed your tits at the whole damned club,\u201d he said. His hand tightened ever so slightly on my neck. Not hard enough to hurt\u2014just enough to show he could.</p><p>Oh, I didn\u2019t like that at all ...</p><p>\u201cTake. Your. Fucking. Hand. Off. Me,\u201d I growled. This time he did, but at the same time he pushed me forward with his body, unbalancing me. I fell back on Noah\u2019s bed, almost hitting my head against the wall. Before I could roll away, Ruger dropped down over me, trapping me just as surely as he had back in my Seattle apartment.</p><p>\u201cI was wearing a bra and Maggs told me to do it,\u201d I hissed, not bothering to fight him. That\u2019d probably just turn him on. Perv. \u201cShe said he needed to check me out if I wanted to waitress at The Line. I need a damned job, Ruger. Didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. Half the women there weren\u2019t even wearing shirts. It\u2019s not like I took off my bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a f**kin\u2019 idiot,\u201d he snapped. \u201cOf course Buck checks out potential waitresses ... at the club. During business hours. He did that to piss me off and get me out of the ring. He played you to win a bet, Soph\u2014he\u2019d never hire you without my permission, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did Maggs say it was okay, then?\u201d I demanded. Damn, he was heavy. He smelled good, too, which I hated. Predictably, my body wasn\u2019t listening to my brain again, because I had the urge to spread my legs and wrap them around his waist.</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know, but she did it on purpose,\u201d he growled. \u201cMight want to ask her about that. She set you up, and that means she set me up. I\u2019ll have words with her later.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou leave Maggs alone,\u201d I said, glaring. \u201cIf someone needs to \u2018have words\u2019 with her, it\u2019ll be me. If you and Horse had a problem, would you want me involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a pain in the ass,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a disgusting pig man. No respect for me at all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect you,\u201d he said, frowning. I snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll bet you f**k all the women you respect in public? And what the hell was that shit about coming on my stomach? I\u2019m not a damned p**n star, Ruger\u2014I\u2019m still all sticky and disgusting. Kinda hard to clean up in a Porta-John.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis house has three showers, babe. Not my fault you haven\u2019t taken one yet. I like the idea of me all over you, so no rush on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was busy packing! I wanted to get out of here before you got home, ass**le!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I see that,\u201d he muttered. He leaned down, his face so close our lips almost brushed. \u201cYou\u2019re not moving out, babe. You\u2019re mine. We covered this. Done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m definitely moving out,\u201d I told him. \u201cNot even you can think this is healthy, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me with the eyes of a predator.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s healthy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhole damned world\u2019s unhealthy. You think all those people living in giant houses on the lake have happy, pretty, perfect lives? You think those bitches aren\u2019t backstabbing each other while their husbands f**k interns on their lunch breaks?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cMy friend Kimber\u2019s not like that. Her life\u2019s nice and normal and not crazy at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s one in a thousand,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause I swear to you, sometimes the nastiest shit happens behind the prettiest doors, while everyone laughs and smiles and pretends everything\u2019s okay. Here\u2019s the thing about my world. We\u2019re f**ked up. We own it. We take care of business and move on. In twenty years those \u2018healthy\u2019 people you\u2019re so jealous of will still be backstabbing each other, and their kids will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ruger scowled and pushed himself up abruptly. Then he grabbed me and threw me over his shoulder like a sack of wheat. I squawked as he carried me out of the room and up the stairs to his loft, kicking and punching him the entire time. Didn\u2019t do a bit of good. I don\u2019t know what I expected\u2014maybe that he\u2019d throw me down on the bed and ravish me, like a movie or something. He didn\u2019t. Instead he carried me into his big bathroom, dumped me in the shower and turned on the faucet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d I shrieked as cold water hit me, still fully clothed. Ruger grabbed the shower hose and started spraying me down with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showin\u2019 you respect,\u201d he yelled back at me. \u201cSo sorry I got you all messy earlier. Just doing my best to make this relationship healthy and clean, because that\u2019s so f**kin\u2019 important to you. Aren\u2019t I a f**kin\u2019 prince?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d I screamed, lunging for the hose. He laughed and sprayed my face. I lashed out and slipped. In a flash, Ruger caught me, then pulled me tight into his body. I found myself looking up at him, my wet clothes soaking both of us, one of his arms wrapped around my waist and his other hand tight in my hair.</p><p>We glared at each other.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you f**k with my head,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cMy c**k gets hard just thinkin\u2019 about you. You\u2019re in my dreams every night. I wake up in the morning and all I think about is you in my house, you and Noah finally mine. My family. It\u2019s even better than ridin\u2019 my bike. I\u2019m crazy for you, Soph.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, stunned. I didn\u2019t believe him. I couldn\u2019t afford to.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that to control me,\u201d I whispered, not sure whether I was talking to myself or him.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, you just don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d</p><p>He took my mouth in a fast, hard kiss and I fought him for about two seconds. Then I gave in, because my body recognized him, needed him. Suddenly there were too many clothes between us. Our hands scrambled and I discovered that water-logged jeans\u2014even cutoff ones\u2014must be the least convenient thing on earth to wear when you need quick access.</p><p>Still, I managed to get them down and kicked away just as he grabbed my waist, spun me around and leaned me against the counter. I looked up to see him in the mirror, face flushed red with need, eyes capturing mine as he slammed his c**k deep inside. It filled me fast and hard, stretching me until it bordered on pain. I gasped, the sound a mix of pleasure and pain.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt anything better in my life.</p> <p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 crazy for you,\u201d he muttered, fingers digging into my skin. \u201cAlways have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuger ...\u201d</p><p>Then he took me, forcing me to brace myself with both hands as he pounded me from behind. One hand steadied my hips while the other reached around to my clit. That piercing of his slid along my G-spot, the hard little knobs of metal on the top and bottom of his c**k head carrying me to a whole new level of sensation. My orgasm hit with agonizing speed and I screamed, pulsing around him.</p><p>Ruger thrust three more times and then he came, too, hot seed spurting.</p><p>Shit. We\u2019d forgotten the condom again.</p><p>He pulled out of me slowly and we looked at each other in the mirror, our chests heaving. He was fully clothed and I still wore my T-shirt. My hair was sopping wet and scraggly, and eye makeup ran down my face.</p> <p>I was a hot mess without the \u201chot\u201d part.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any diseases?\u201d I asked, my brain valiantly fighting for control. He shook his head, still watching me in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI always use a condom,\u201d he said. \u201cNever f**k a girl without one, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucked me without one twice,\u201d I said, my voice dry. \u201cWanna rethink your answer?\u201d</p><p>He offered a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re on the pill,\u201d he said. \u201cSo pregnancy\u2019s not the issue. Also know you\u2019re clean. You\u2019re my woman, so why shouldn\u2019t I feel you around me? And I swear to you, babe. I have never, ever f**ked anyone without protection before. I even donated blood about two weeks ago\u2014all clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d I said, straightening. I looked around for my panties and shorts. They\u2019d landed near the toilet, dripping water everywhere.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m on the pill?\u201d I asked, reaching for a towel to wrap around myself.</p> <p>\u201cFound \u2019em in your purse,\u201d he said without a hint of shame. I looked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in my purse?\u201d I asked, not pleased.</p><p>\u201cTo get your phone,\u201d he replied, tucking himself back into his pants. \u201cI wanted to set up the GPS on it.\u201d</p><p>I stopped cold.</p><p>\u201cYou have GPS tracking my phone?\u201d I asked, incredulous. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? You want to chip me like a dog, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be able to find you if there\u2019s an emergency,\u201d he said, his face growing serious. \u201cI know it sounds paranoid, but we had a real bad situation last winter ... Marie and Horse would be dead right now if I hadn\u2019t had GPS on her. Nearly died as it was. Now I do it for all the girls in the club. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t spy on you or anything. But it\u2019ll be there if you ever get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d I said, closing my eyes. I was exhausted, I realized. No wonder my brain wouldn\u2019t kick in and tell me what to do.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired. You\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep downstairs,\u201d I told him, clutching the towel as I reached for my clothes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sleep up here with me,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou can fight me on it and lose, which is more work for both of us, or you can just give in. Gonna end the same either way.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and knew he was right. I\u2019d set him straight later\u2014right now I needed rest.</p><p>\u201cCan I borrow something to wear?\u201d I asked, trying not to yawn. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to go get dry stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you sleep naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you go f**k yourself, but seeing as that\u2019s not an option, can I borrow something to wear?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out. Shirts are in the top drawer, underwear in the second one down.\u201d</p><p>I left the bathroom and looked around to find his dresser. Sure enough, the top drawer held a variety of T-shirts. I found one with a Reapers symbol on it and pulled it out. Then I moved down to the next drawer. Most of his stuff was black or gray, but a flash of pink in the back caught my eye.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I pulled out a pair of silky, pink panties.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ruger,\u201d I said. \u201cIs there anywhere in this house women don\u2019t leave their lingerie? It\u2019s like a damned Victoria\u2019s Secret in here!\u201d</p><p>I turned to him, holding the panties out with two fingers, disgusted. He cocked his head and gave me a strange smile.</p><p>\u201cThose are yours, actually,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cYou left them behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat first night,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Zach. You left them in my apartment. Had \u2019em ever since.\u201d</p><p>I froze, and studied them more closely. It\u2019d been a long time, but they did look familiar. I\u2019d been so sad to lose them, because I\u2019d bought them special ...</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s just a little bit creepy or really, super creepy,\u201d I said finally, glancing over at him. He shrugged, eyes holding mine steady. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou asked me the other night if wanting you was a new thing,\u201d he said, his face free of mockery for once. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing, babe. Not a new thing at all.\u201d</p><p>I woke suddenly, wondering where the hell I was. A strong, masculine arm lay across my stomach, pinning me down. A vaulted cedar ceiling rose overhead. I turned to see Ruger lying facedown next to me, and it all came back in a rush.</p><p>I needed to get out of here before he woke up and started in on his you\u2019re-my-woman-and-I-own-you bullshit. I couldn\u2019t afford to play around anymore\u2014Noah had been through enough already.</p><p>Lifting his arm cautiously, I rolled out of bed and turned to look at his sleeping form. Ruger\u2019s back was half covered by the sheet, and for the first time I had the chance to study his ink in full light. His perfectly sculpted body wasn\u2019t just sexy. It was literally a work of art. His arms were a mass of patterns and designs so intricate I had trouble following them, but dominating his right bicep was a picture of what had to be Noah\u2019s Ark. The animals marching away from it were fantastical, dragons and demons and snakes, but the Ark itself was unmistakable.</p> <p>My breath caught. How had I never noticed that before?</p><p>He shifted in his sleep, the sheet slipping lower. I couldn\u2019t allow myself much time ... I wanted to leave before he woke up and we started fighting. Given our track record, I\u2019d have sex with him again if that happened. My clit perked up and sent an urgent memo to my brain endorsing that option. Screwing a man-whore had one advantage\u2014he certainly knew what he was doing.</p><p>As for the pink panties I wore? I didn\u2019t know what to think about that. It should\u2019ve grossed me out, but it mostly just turned me on. All those years I\u2019d been lusting after him, and he\u2019d been lusting after me, too. Not enough to stay faithful, of course. But he\u2019d still wanted me.</p><p>My ni**les joined my clit in petitioning for another round.</p><p>I ignored both of them.</p> <p>Nothing had changed. The party, Em, all the reasons I should avoid the Reapers. Ruger and I simply couldn\u2019t be together. But for a few minutes, while he still slept, I let myself study the incredibly sexy man who\u2019d been an unofficial father to my son. Across the top of his back was a broad, curved banner of ink matching the patch on his cut that said \u201cReapers.\u201d Their symbol\u2014the Reaper himself\u2014covered the center, and I saw just a hint of the bottom rocker, which I knew would say \u201cIdaho.\u201d</p><p>Strange as it sounds, the combination of his club colors and the Ark illustrated Ruger\u2019s contradictions perfectly.</p><p>Strange spots covered his shoulders, and along his side I saw just a hint of the panther\u2019s claw reaching around from his hip.</p><p>He shifted and I froze, reality crashing back down.</p><p>I needed to get out or we\u2019d have another fight. Realistically, we\u2019d have another fight regardless, but a little break would be nice. I went downstairs and found my phone, checking the time. Seven in the morning. It took me less than thirty minutes to finish the last of my packing. Then I carried everything out to the car, loaded it, and climbed in.</p><p>I turned the key in the ignition, feeling sad and just a little wistful.</p> <p>Things would turn out, I told myself firmly. I was doing the right thing. As if to prove my point, the sun was already high and bright. Birds were singing like in some stupid Disney movie. I turned out of the driveway onto the road and saw Elle, Ruger\u2019s neighbor, walking along with her dog. She smiled as she saw me, waving me down. I pulled over.</p><p>Elle\u2019s eyes flicked over the car, noting the presence of boxes and the lack of a child.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>I smiled ruefully and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d I replied. \u201cRuger and I live in different worlds. I realized it doesn\u2019t matter how cheap the rent is, staying isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d she asked, and it wasn\u2019t one of those questions that\u2019s actually a passive-aggressive accusation in disguise. My mother had been the master of those ... I could tell Elle was genuinely concerned.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I guess that\u2019s okay. Every time I make plans they fall apart anyway. Noah\u2019s with my friend Kimber, and she\u2019s got a spare room. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll put us up until I pull something together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she replied, pursing her lips thoughtfully. She glanced over at Ruger\u2019s house, then cocked her head at me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over and have some breakfast? There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\u201d</p> <p>That startled me.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t want to sound rude, but I\u2019m sort of trying to get out of here before Ruger wakes up,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be too happy about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it,\u201d she said, that dry tone back in her voice. \u201cHe may be a big, bad biker, but he\u2019s still just a man, and men are notoriously stupid. You can\u2019t see my house from the road and he probably won\u2019t come looking for you there, anyway. I have a shotgun if he does. I also have caramel rolls.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped. Hadn\u2019t seen that one coming.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied, suitably impressed.</p><p>Half an hour later we sat at her kitchen table, eating sweet rolls and discussing my crazy life. Somehow, she managed to bring out the humor in the situation, making things seem less scary. I wanted to be Elle when I grew up, I decided. She was smart, funny, cynical, and pretty sexy for a woman pushing forty.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve got a bit of a problem,\u201d she said finally, the queen of understatement. \u201cYou\u2019re smart to move out. I agree with you one hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I think Maggs set me up last night. She\u2019s trying to push us together, I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s together and there\u2019s f**king,\u201d Elle said, delicately slicing a cantaloupe wedge.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of freaks me out when you do that,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cDo what? Eat melon? Orange fruits and vegetables are extremely healthy, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I giggled and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, act all ladylike and then cuss like a sailor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy late husband was in the navy,\u201d she said, smiling softly. \u201cAnd I assure you, his language would make your motorcycle club friends cry like little girls. Ruger actually reminds me of him in a way. So wild and violent, but contained, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss him?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, her tone sharpening. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but miss a man like that. But here\u2019s the thing, Sophie. I gave up everything for him. We moved every couple of years, so I had trouble making close friends. I thought about having a child, but I didn\u2019t want to raise one by myself and I knew he\u2019d be gone half the time. Then he went and died on me and now I\u2019m all alone. Sometimes I hate him for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t quite know what to say, so I took another bite of my roll. Elle sipped her tea and then sat back in her chair, looking at me very seriously.</p><p>\u201cI did something very stupid when I was your age,\u201d she said. \u201cI let a man make the decisions for me. I have no idea if you and Ruger belong together, but you need space to figure things out. You can\u2019t let yourself be dependent on someone unless you can truly trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust Ruger,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI trust him with Noah, at least. I also trust him not to change, which is sort of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen rarely do,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s possible, I suppose. As I said before, I think I may have a solution for you. Did you know there\u2019s an apartment in my barn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour barn?\u201d I asked, blankly. I looked out the window toward the wooden structure behind the house. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you used the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThis farm belonged to my great-aunt, and she had part of the barn converted to an apartment for my cousin. He was developmentally delayed. She wouldn\u2019t let them put him in a home, but he couldn\u2019t live on his own. The apartment gave him some freedom and independence, but also kept him safe. He passed two years ago and it\u2019s been empty ever since. I\u2019m sure it needs cleaning, but I\u2019d like to offer it to you and Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have offered it otherwise. It\u2019s not being used and I like both of you. Noah deserves a decent place to stay, and it\u2019s definitely better than crashing on someone\u2019s couch. Only one bedroom, but you don\u2019t need to live there forever. It\u2019s furnished. Just until you get back on your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for in terms of rent?\u201d I asked cautiously.</p> <p>She thought for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could help me with the yard work,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been having trouble keeping up with it lately.\u201d</p><p>I met her eyes across the table and neither of us said anything for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very nice person,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d she replied quietly. \u201cI have no idea whether things will work out between you and Ruger, but this way Noah can stay in the same school and still be within walking distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s a good idea for me to be this close to him?\u201d I asked bluntly.</p> <p>\u201cGood luck finding somewhere he can\u2019t follow you,\u201d she replied wryly. \u201cIt hardly matters how far you go. Like I said\u2014I have a shotgun. The barn has a good lock. Between the two I think you\u2019ll do all right. Would you like to go and take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>ME: Thanks again for watching Noah this weeknd. All moved in now, still cant believe Elle had this place just sitting here. Good luck for me!!!!</p><p>KIMBER: No prob. So ... have u seen HIM yet?</p><p>ME: Who? :-&gt;</p><p>KIMBER: Don\u2019t be a dumbass. Thats Rugerss job. Did he freak?</p><p>ME: Thats the creepy part. He didn\u2019t</p><p>KIMBER: Seriosly?</p> <p>ME: No. He texted and asked me if I was ok. I said yes. He asked where I was</p><p>KIMBER: U tell him?</p><p>ME: Yes. He\u2019d figure it out anyway</p><p>KIMBER: Huh ... thats weird. After what happeed Sat night, that\u2019s a total turn around. I expected him to come chase u down and drag you back\u2014you know, like a cavman or something</p><p>ME: I know. I was expectign more too. Makes me nervous</p><p>KIMBER: Ha! U WANTED him to be pissed!</p><p>ME: No ... maybe? Its stupid. I have a job interview tomorrow afternoon. Recpetionist at a dental clinic. Right near the school</p><p>KIMBER: Woooot wooot!!!!! Dont change the subject</p><p>ME: Hey! I need a job more than I need to talk about Ruger</p><p>KIMBER: This is about ME, babe. I need gossip. U owe me. Iwatched ur kid AND I got you drunk. Entertain me</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cSophie, I\u2019m so sorry, but Dr. Blake is still running late. Can you stick around a little longer, or should I see if he can reschedule? I hate to pressure you, but he\u2019s really hoping to make a decision tonight, and you\u2019re the last interview ... We\u2019re pretty desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I said, smiling brightly at the flustered hygienist behind the counter. It was a big f**king problem. Noah would be out of school in an hour and I needed to be there to pick him up. But I also needed to be able to buy food to feed him, too, and after the first three months this job came with health care and sick leave ... not to mention dental. I hadn\u2019t had my teeth checked in four years.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked the hygienist. Her name was Katy Jordan, and for the past hour I\u2019d been sitting in the waiting room, watching her juggle patients and the phone. Apparently their old receptionist left without giving notice because of a family emergency, the temp was a no-show, and the doctor\u2019s assistant had gone home at ten that morning throwing up. A mother with two kids sat next to me, obviously impatient. She\u2019d been waiting nearly forty minutes for her appointment to start and things were getting tense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a quick phone call,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Summers? Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>The woman beside me stood and coralled her children, herding them into the back. I stepped outside the office, which was in a low-lying, mixed-medical building. Kind of like a mini-mall for doctors, although classier, with fancy landscaping, cedar siding, and covered walkways.</p><p>I tried Elle first. No answer. I tried Kimber, too. Nothing. I called the school to see if he could go to the after-school program for a day, only to learn he needed to be formally enrolled to participate, something I\u2019d have to do in person, at the district office.</p><p>That left me with the girls from the club or Ruger ... and the girls from the club weren\u2019t authorized to pick him up at the school. I could change that, of course. All I had to do was fill out some paperwork at the school office.</p><p>In person.</p><p>That left Ruger.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had any communication with him since Sunday morning, aside from that one text asking if I was okay. I punched his number and waited. The phone rang long enough, I thought I\u2019d get voice mail. Shit ... Then he answered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound particularly friendly or welcoming. More like the old Ruger, the one who looked through me like I was furniture. I suppose that\u2019s what I wanted. It didn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>\u201cUm, hey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to do this, but I have a favor to ask. For Noah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, you always have favors to ask,\u201d he said, his voice almost a growl. \u201cYet I still answer the damned phone when you call. Tryin\u2019 to figure out why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you working this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance you could duck out long enough to pick up Noah at school? They keep moving back my job interview. If I have to leave, I\u2019m probably going to lose my shot here.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can move things around here,\u201d he said. \u201cHow late do you think you\u2019ll be?\u201d</p><p>I paused, hating every second of this.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I finally said. \u201cAt this rate, it might be toward the end of the day. I need to meet with the doctor. He had some sort of emergency earlier and now they\u2019re running behind. He\u2019s just trying to fit me in between patients at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take the rest of the day off, bring him back to my place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said, hanging up. I looked down at the phone, wondering how such a great guy could be such an ass**le slut at the same time.</p><p>Then I pasted my \u201cHire me, I\u2019m friendly and competent!\u201d smile back on and returned to the waiting room.</p><p>By four thirty I still hadn\u2019t done my interview. I\u2019d pretty much given up on it, because there\u2019d been a second emergency. A high school girl knocked out half her front teeth during soccer practice. She\u2019d been hysterical when her coach rushed her in, bloody towels pressed to her face. The other patients watched in fascinated horror as Dr. Blake himself came out to fetch her, bustling her back into the treatment room.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later he reappeared.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to reschedule everyone,\u201d he announced to the room, looking exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t have anyone here to help you right now. We\u2019ll need to call you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>There were several frustrated sighs, but it wasn\u2019t like people could complain, given the circumstances. Dr. Blake\u2019s eyes caught on me. He was a handsome man, although older than me. Probably in his late thirties or early forties?</p><p>\u201cAre you one of my patients?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sophie Williams,\u201d I answered, straightening the scarf I\u2019d tied around my neck. \u201cI\u2019m applying for the job as your receptionist. I\u2019m guessing that interview isn\u2019t going to happen today?\u201d</p><p>The phone started ringing. Again. Then the door opened and a UPS deliveryman came in, followed by a woman with three children.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dr. Blake!\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all ready for our checkups. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d the doctor replied, offering her a pained look. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had a little complication in the scheduling today. This is our new receptionist, Sophie. She\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, I had a job.</p><p>I felt proud of myself when I turned the car down Ruger\u2019s drive that night. I\u2019d jumped right in at work, and while I didn\u2019t know how to use the scheduling program, I still managed to look up the last two patients for the afternoon and call them to cancel. I\u2019d also handled the phone and even talked to a potential new patient. I still needed to fill out paperwork, but Dr. Blake had been thrilled.</p> <p>Just having an income source changed everything ... The fact that it came with benefits, sick leave, and vacation? Amazing.</p><p>I\u2019d never had a job with paid vacation before.</p><p>Of course, that good feeling ebbed as I pulled up to the house. I hadn\u2019t seen Ruger since I\u2019d snuck out of his room three days ago. I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d expected from him. But I\u2019d expected something. This silent acceptance of what I\u2019d done, after what a huge deal he\u2019d made about \u201cowning\u201d me? That made me very nervous.</p><p>Making matters worse, he\u2019d saved my ass this afternoon. Again. That meant I owed him even more than before\u2014just one more complication to our already twisted relationship.</p><p>I knocked on the door but nobody answered. I\u2019d texted him around four thirty to give him an update and he\u2019d replied that they\u2019d gone fishing, so I walked around the side of the house to his deck and made myself comfortable at the table to wait. Well, as comfortable as I could, given our recent interactions. I still had my key, but using it felt wrong under the circumstances. It was a little after six already. I hoped he\u2019d be back soon. Noah needed dinner and a bath before bed.</p><p>Ten minutes later I saw them walking up toward the house across the meadow from the pond, the big man and little boy looking like something out of a country-living postcard. Ruger carried the fishing gear and Noah bobbed along next to him like a puppy, holding a string of three tiny little fish.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d he yelled, spotting me. He took off running toward the house and I met him at the bottom of the steps. He jumped at me and then I was holding him as the fish slapped against my side in all their slimy glory.</p><p>Ewww ...</p><p>\u201cMom, I got three fish,\u201d he told me, eyes wide with excitement. \u201cUnce Ruger and I went to the pond and we even got to dig up some worms and they were really, really squirmy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that sounds like fun,\u201d I told him, wondering if I\u2019d be able to get the fish smell out of my interview outfit. I couldn\u2019t get upset about it, though\u2014not with him so happy. Sometimes I forgot just how much I loved my little boy, because seeing him again after a long day apart nearly made my heart explode.</p><p>\u201cI have good news, too,\u201d I told him, smiling big.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama got a job!\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be working at a dentist\u2019s office right by your school. I\u2019ll be able to drop you off every day, and then I\u2019ll pick you up from the after-school program. No more working at night! What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f**kin\u2019 great, Mom!\u201d he said, eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cNoah! Do we use that word?\u201d</p><p>His face fell and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cUncle Ruger told me not to say it in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Ruger set the fishing gear down under the deck and I turned to him.</p><p>\u201cNoah says you told him not to curse in front of me?\u201d I asked, raising a brow.</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not gonna get into it with you, so you can either let it go and enjoy some grilled fish with us for dinner or get all worked up. Result will be the same.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glared at him as Noah started wiggling to get down. I let him go and he held the string of fish up, so proud he practically glowed.</p><p>\u201cUncle Ruger and I are going to cook dinner,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe\u2019re eating my fish. You can share!\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the three tiny little rainbow trout, smaller than could possibly be legal. Then I looked up at Ruger, questioning.</p><p>He shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some salmon marinating in the fridge,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll grill it with corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought Noah his favorite macaroni and cheese,\u201d I replied. \u201cWant me to cook that up while you get the grill going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was a little awkward, but not as bad as you\u2019d think, under the circumstances. I\u2019d busied myself doing the macaroni and prepping the veggies while Ruger and Noah cleaned the fish. I wouldn\u2019t have trusted Noah with a knife, but Ruger guided him carefully, explaining each step as he slit the fish open, gutted them, and then rinsed them out. We wrapped everything in foil and threw it on the grill while Noah ran off to play and I set the table.</p><p>\u201cSo, you got the job today?\u201d he asked, leaning back against the railing, a casual eye on the food. It was almost like things hadn\u2019t blown up between us over the weekend. Okay. I could work with that. Denial had always been an excellent strategy for me.</p> <p>\u201cYup,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good one. They do full benefits after three months and I\u2019ll have a week of vacation starting next year. Thanks again for grabbing Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s hard to be around, if you can get him off the whole Skylanders thing. He ever get tired of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I saw a spark of humor in his eyes and I smiled back. At least we had Noah between us, I realized, no matter how f**ked up everything else was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a hell of a good job with him,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cI want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, startled. \u201cWhat brought that on? I thought you were pissed at me?\u201d</p><p>Shit, did I just say that out loud? Why did I have to go and stir things up, right when we were starting to get along? He didn\u2019t jump all over me, though. Instead he just gave me a slow smile, which was strangely worse.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>He stepped over and rotated the corn while I studied him, suspicious. He stayed quiet, pulling out his phone and checking his messages. Yup, definitely worse. At least when we fought I knew where we stood.</p><p>On the bright side, Noah\u2019s little trout were pretty tasty\u2014all three bites. He turned down salmon to eat SpongeBob-shaped macaroni and cheese, no huge surprise there. Ruger startled me by bringing out a bottle of sparkling cider to celebrate my new job. Noah was ecstatic, drinking half the juice by himself out of a real wine glass. I have to admit, I was touched. After dinner we cleared the dishes while Noah took off again, with a stern warning that we\u2019d be heading home in ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou start work tomorrow?\u201d Ruger asked as I loaded the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cNine on the dot,\u201d I replied, feeling a little rush of excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. I can\u2019t believe how things worked out. Thanks again for helping today\u2014you have no idea how much it meant to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI note you didn\u2019t follow up on the job at The Line,\u201d he said, cocking a brow. I frowned and looked away.</p><p>\u201cUm, I wasn\u2019t really serious about that anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for the club.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you made your feelings about the club clear,\u201d he said. My mood deflated a little. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a loaded statement,\u201d I replied, my voice flat. He smirked, and I felt better. It wasn\u2019t an angry smirk.</p><p>\u201cDirty mind, Soph?\u201d he asked. \u201cSeriously, this is important. Come on into the living room.\u201d</p><p>I followed him, then sat in a chair. He sat on the couch, then patted the seat next to him. I shook my head. He held up a thick, business-sized envelope.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get your surprise if you don\u2019t come over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll want it,\u201d he said, clearly pleased with himself. I got up and walked over to him slowly. He grabbed my hand, pulling me down and across his lap. I gave a token struggle, but he handed me the envelope and curiosity took over, so I let him win.</p><p>Also, it felt kind of nice to sit on his lap. Yeah, I know. Stupid. But I\u2019m only human.</p><p>I opened the envelope and saw cash. A very large wad of cash. My eyes opened wide and I pulled it out, shocked. I didn\u2019t count it, but it seemed to be all hundred-dollar bills ... there had to be three or four thousand dollars in here.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I asked, looking at him. He gave me a grim smile.</p><p>\u201cChild support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d I gasped. \u201cHow did you get this out of Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Mom\u2019s estate,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cI paid him out and then he paid you out. In exchange, he gets to keep living. Everybody wins.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look at him, shocked.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked. Our faces were about two inches apart, and his eyes flicked to my lips. I licked them nervously and felt something stir under my butt. His arms came around my waist, holding me loosely, and my ni**les hardened.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cPretty hard to get more serious,\u201d he told me. \u201cOld friend tracked down Zach for me in North Dakota and I rode over there Sunday afternoon, got back early this morning. We had words. Then we went to the bank. I didn\u2019t give him the promise to let him live in writing\u2014that\u2019s just a little side incentive. I\u2019ll revoke it if he ever gets within ten miles of you or Noah again. Mom would\u2019ve wanted this anyway. She never stopped loving him, but she sure as shit stopped trusting him.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know the details ... But I couldn\u2019t feel sorry for Zach. He\u2019d earned everything he got and then some.</p><p>\u201cHow much money is in here?\u201d I asked, flipping through the wad of cash.</p><p>\u201cNot all of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just last year\u2019s. The rest is in transit. Dealing with that much cash gets complicated. Needs to be cleaned up a bit, and then we\u2019ll find a way to get it to you that won\u2019t leave an ugly trail. The trade-off is, we agreed on your current monthly rate, and it\u2019s not like you can take him to court to ask for more if he gets a great job or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even get him to pay what he owed already,\u201d I said. \u201cHealth and Welfare won\u2019t do shit, either. I don\u2019t think upward adjustments were on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of what I figured,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo I\u2019m real glad you got a job, but you won\u2019t be living paycheck to paycheck anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d I whispered, looking back down at the envelope. \u201cI have to ask ... Is it going to come back on me and Noah? Am I going to get arrested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough cash to catch any IRS attention, and Horse is working on getting the rest of it to you all safe and legal. He\u2019s a damned good accountant, and he\u2019ll work with our lawyer. Fuckin\u2019 shark. If Zach ever tries to cause trouble about it, you call me and I\u2019ll make him go away.\u201d</p> <p>His arms tightened around me, hinting at his strength, and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cThis is another case of you doing my dirty work for me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Noah\u2019s money,\u201d Ruger said, his face serious. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you, Sophie. It\u2019s about Zach taking care of his son\u2014and it\u2019s not like it even came out of his pocket. That insurance settlement came out of nowhere. Noah has a right to this money, and my mom would shit if she knew Zach was starving you guys out. I fixed the problem. Don\u2019t think about it anymore, just use the money to take care of our boy, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, leaning my head against his chest. He kissed the top of my head and rubbed up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cSo Horse is an accountant?\u201d I asked after a minute. \u201cI find that hard to picture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d just as soon you not picture Horse at all,\u201d he muttered, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered. I\u2019d never seen that much money in my life. Hell, at this rate we\u2019d have the fancy macaroni and cheese all the time! And the rest? If I saved it, I\u2019d be able to pay for Noah\u2019s college.</p><p>My kid would go to college. I felt tears well up in my eyes, which bugged me because I hated crying.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want to thank me, give me a blow job,\u201d Ruger said, his voice light. I straightened up and smacked his shoulder, and he burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to say things like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were getting all soft and sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you get like that I really want to f**k you. But Noah\u2019s right outside and this is shit timing. Riling you up takes care of that soft and sweet crap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d I told him, trying to get up. He held me down, though, and riling me up clearly wasn\u2019t making him less interested in sex. The evidence under my ass was getting harder by the second.</p><p>\u201cHow about this,\u201d he said. \u201cOne kiss. Give me one kiss and we\u2019ll call it even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re up to something. You can\u2019t let me win, can you?\u201d</p><p>Ruger grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up to something. And I\u2019m never going to let you win, so you might as well give up now.\u201d</p><p>With that his lips came down over mine in another of those kisses that destroyed my ability to think. He explored my mouth softly and I explored right back, wishing like hell that Noah was with a babysitter. Heroin. The man was pure heroin. Heroin kills people, my brain screamed. My body flipped off my brain and kept kissing Ruger. Finally he let my lips go and pulled back, smiling and looking smug as hell.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, might as well give up, Soph,\u201d he said. \u201cSooner or later I\u2019m gonna win this little game of ours.\u201d</p><p>I sat up slowly, shaking my head. How did he do that to me? I wanted him so bad I couldn\u2019t see straight, and he turned it off, just like that. Noah ran up across the deck and looked at us through the window, pressing his mouth wide open against it and making a blowfish face. Then he started laughing wildly and ran off again.</p> <p>Okay. That turned it off.</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep your own place for a while,\u201d Ruger said, touching my cheek softly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to understand that. It\u2019s all happening fast and that\u2019s scary. But you\u2019re still mine, Soph. Don\u2019t think for one minute I\u2019ve forgotten that or changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning to keep your dick in your pants at the club?\u201d I asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning not to keep it in my pants,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve told you\u2014I\u2019m not a one-woman man. I won\u2019t lie to you or make promises I\u2019m not sure I can keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there we have it,\u201d I replied, shaking my head. \u201cFuck off, Ruger. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>RUGER: What time do you get off work?</p><p>ME: 5. Why</p><p>RUGER: Want to come over and check your place out for security</p><p>ME: No</p><p>RUGER: You haven\u2019t figured this out yet? I\u2019m going to do it. Rather do it when it\u2019s convenient for you but happens either way. What time? I\u2019ll bring pizza</p><p>ME: We get home around 6. Noah likes his pizza plain</p><p>RUGER: Plain? Like nothing?????</p><p>ME: Plain. Be happy. Used to be he wouldnt let them put sauce on it</p><p>RUGER: Plain it is. See you at 6</p><p>ME: He\u2019s invading my space</p><p>KIMBER:?????</p><p>ME: Ruger. He\u2019s invadng my space. Coming over tonight to check out security on new place. Bribing us with pizza</p><p>KIMBER: Control freak much? What\u2019s security</p><p>ME: He likes my apartments to have alarms. Checks for bad windows and locks. Deadbolts.That kind of thing</p><p>KIMBER: thats sweet tho! He wants u safe</p><p>ME: He\u2019s the biggest danger</p><p>KIMBER: Be happy. U have a hot guy coming over and he\u2019s bringing dinner. Women have killed for less</p><p>ME: Whose side you on?</p><p>KIMBER: Mine. Haven\u2019t u figured this out yet?</p><p>ME: Bitch</p><p>KIMBER: Ho</p><p>ME: At least I don\u2019t drive a minivan</p><p>KIMBER: See if I make YOU margaritas again! LOW BLOW!!!!!!</p><p>ME: &lt;3</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money to keep a place safe,\u201d Ruger told Noah, his voice serious. They crouched together as Ruger installed a new deadbolt on our exterior door. We had two\u2014one leading outside and the other leading into the rest of the barn, which was pretty cool in its own right. Among other things, it had a loft complete with mounds of old hay for Noah to jump in. Even better, there were stairs leading up to it and a railing, safety features I assumed they put in for Elle\u2019s cousin.</p><p>\u201cIf you have empty pop cans, you can make an alarm by stacking them in front of your door,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cThe goal is to make noise, so that you know if someone tries to come in. Most bad guys will run away if there\u2019s noise. That\u2019s why I put those little alarms on the windows. If you ever see a bad guy, don\u2019t be quiet. Start screaming. And don\u2019t yell help\u2014yell \u2018Call the cops!\u2019 as loud as you can, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to scare him,\u201d I said from the couch, debating whether I should eat the last slice of pizza. Between Ruger and Noah, it\u2019d disappeared pretty fast.</p><p>\u201cYou scared, Noah?\u201d Ruger asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Noah said. \u201cRuger\u2019s smart. He\u2019s teaching me all kinds of safety stuff. He says you need to stop texting on your phone when you walk places, Mom, and pay attention to the people around you. He also says there\u2019s this little stick you need to start carrying around. It\u2019s called a cuburtron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKubaton,\u201d Ruger corrected, looking over at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a little baton for your keychain. Very effective, very safe. You should come take the self-defense class at the shop, Sophie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a self-defense class,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes. \u201cI have my own personal stalker to protect me already. It\u2019s almost Noah\u2019s bedtime\u2014you planning to go home at some point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I finish up,\u201d he said. \u201cBath time, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Noah did the obligatory whining and begging to stay up, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it. Bath went fast, with Ruger finishing the lock just as Noah got out.</p><p>\u201cWill you do my story tonight?\u201d he asked Ruger.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, little man,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cWhat are we reading?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMagic Tree House,\u201d Noah replied. \u201cI can read it by myself, but I like it when you do it.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the small living room as Ruger read to Noah. We had a futon for a couch, which was where I slept. Normally I\u2019d start setting it up by now, but I didn\u2019t want to give Ruger ideas. After half an hour, he came back out, closing Noah\u2019s door behind him softly.</p><p>\u201cKid\u2019s out,\u201d he said. \u201cFell asleep halfway through the chapter. I think he\u2019s doin\u2019 great, but he\u2019s been through a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help,\u201d I said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019re your new keys,\u201d he said, tossing them toward me. \u201cI replaced all the locks, so you\u2019ll need to give a set to Elle. Her old ones won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, that\u2019s great,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cCan I have Noah for a while on Friday afternoon?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m headin\u2019 out on a run this weekend. Might not be back for four or five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cI need him by seven, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said. He crossed his arms and leaned against the wall casually. \u201cSo how long are we gonna do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand and gestured around the little apartment.</p><p>\u201cHave you and Noah live here when you could be over at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d I protested. \u201cIt\u2019s clean, it\u2019s safe, and I don\u2019t need to worry about the landlord attacking me in the night. It\u2019s not happening between us, Ruger. Not. Happening.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and I watched him warily. He was up to something ... I could smell it. Suddenly he pushed off from the wall and walked over, catching me around the waist. Then he threw me over his shoulder, just like he\u2019d done that weekend.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to haul me off whenever you don\u2019t get your way!\u201d</p><p>He smacked my ass.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake up Noah. If he comes out here, he\u2019ll see you like this, and then you can figure out how to explain it to him. If he asks me, I\u2019ll tell him the truth. Mommy\u2019s been a bad girl and she needs a spanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ass**le,\u201d I hissed, kicking and smacking his back as hard as I could. Maybe I should take one of those kube-thingie classes. I could\u2019ve shoved it up his big, dumb ass as he carried me out of the apartment and into the barn.</p><p>Ruger ignored my struggles, which pissed me off even more.</p><p>He carried me through the barn and up the stairs to the hayloft. I sensed a pattern. At least there wasn\u2019t a bathroom up here, so no cold water spray. Small comfort. He dropped me down on a pile of straw so hard I lost my breath, looming tall as he unbuckled his belt and ripped it through the loops on his jeans. Then he folded it between his hands and snapped it. I glared at him, scuttling backward across the hay like a crab.</p><p>\u201cI need to tie you up again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing this,\u201d I declared, even though my brain had already started the familiar shutdown his presence seemed to cause. God, I loved how he smelled. Not to mention the feel of his c**k deep down inside ... those little metal knobs made a hell of a difference. \u201cGo to hell, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. We are definitely doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I can f**k some sense into you. Words obviously don\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>With that he pulled off his shirt and tossed it aside. I glared at him as he opened his fly and pulled off his jeans without another word. He knelt forward in the hay and caught my hands, pinning them on either side of my head. His head lowered as he scented me, kissing the fading bruises on my neck, nibbling and sucking like he\u2019d done at the party.</p><p>Damned distracting. Shit, that felt good.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fading,\u201d he said, pulling away just enough to meet my eyes. I didn\u2019t like his expression, not at all. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll give you some new ones. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a raging ass**le.\u201d</p><p>Ruger laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I think you\u2019re a bitch, but my c**k likes you, so we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>He caught my mouth again, but this time the kiss wasn\u2019t hard and brutal. Nope, he changed tactics, because now his lips whispered over mine, nipping and sucking, drawing them apart gently as I tried to ignore him. Then he tugged my hands together over my head, freeing a hand to slide down between us. His fingers drifted across my stomach before reaching the top of the yoga pants I\u2019d put on when I got home.</p><p>He starting pulling them down, and I realized this was it.</p><p>Ruger was about to win again, because Ruger always won, and I always let him because my body wanted him more than my brain hated him. I raised my hips, making it easier for him to take off my pants, which was just another nail in my f**king coffin. Then his fingers slid into me and I shuddered.</p><p>The damage was done already anyway, I justified. What difference would it really make? When he finally stopped kissing me, we stared at each other, panting. His fingers stroked down below, grazing my clit, and I twisted, wanting more.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you piss me off,\u201d he murmured. \u201cGood thing your cunt\u2019s so f**king hot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call it that.\u201d</p><p>His lip twitched.</p><p>\u201cGood thing your vagina\u2019s so gosh-darned hot,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBecause I really, really want to stick my penis in it and have repeated sexual intercourse, bringing us to a mutually satisfactory culmination of our desires. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost dirtier,\u201d I said, mouth quirking. Fucking ridiculous. All of it. I wanted to kill him and screw him and scream at him, so now he made jokes? I almost laughed, but his fingers rubbed right up against my G-spot while his thumb played with my clit. I couldn\u2019t figure out how he made me so wet, so fast, every single time.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s dirtier,\u201d he told me, nuzzling me again, tugging on my ear with his teeth. \u201cIf I let go of your hands, are you gonna try to get away?\u201d</p><p>I considered the question seriously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut this is a one-time deal. We\u2019re never having sex again after this time.\u201d</p><p>Ruger gave me that lazy panther smile of his and didn\u2019t answer. He did let me go, though, and I reached up, pushing him over and back down into the hay. Then I straddled him. I had one shot at this, I realized. One last chance to play with Ruger\u2019s body. What should I do with it?</p><p>I went for his nipple ring, sucking it deep into my mouth as he groaned, hands twisting into my hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Soph,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut could you grab my dick while you\u2019re at it? All I can think about, it\u2019s f**kin\u2019 killing me.\u201d</p><p>I reached down and found him, hard steel bound in silk. I trailed my fingers over the head of his cock, catching the barbell, brushing back and forth.</p><p>\u201cHoly f**k,\u201d he groaned. \u201cToo much, babe. Just the shaft for now, okay?\u201d</p><p>His hand covered mine, showing me exactly how he wanted it\u2014slow and deep, with a bit of a twist that should\u2019ve been painful. I remembered he liked it rough so I didn\u2019t hold back, and soon his hips arched under me.</p><p>That\u2019s when I gave his nipple a final flick and started working my mouth down his stomach. Ruger wasn\u2019t like some guy in a magazine ad. He had a model\u2019s perfect abs, but he also had just enough hair to remind me I was dealing with a real man, not some pre-fabbed fantasy of clean, waxed sexuality. I rubbed my chin against the dip of his navel, savoring the power I held over him before going lower.</p><p>Some girls love giving head.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been one of them, so I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience to work with. What I did have was a hell of an imagination, and I\u2019d been thinking about taking his c**k into my mouth since that first night on his deck. I remembered sitting there, seeing him outlined in front of me through the thin flannel of his lounge pants, wanting to touch him more than anything.</p><p>Now I could.</p><p>Ruger tilted his head up, one arm folded back and under his neck, watching with hooded eyes as I rubbed the head gently against my cheek, considering my next move. I reached out my tongue and flicked the notch at the bottom of his glans. Then I swirled it around the little metal knob.</p><p>Ruger\u2019s breath hissed and I felt a surge of pure, feminine power.</p><p>I licked it again, playing with his piercing before sucking him in hard. The metal post was weird, but it wasn\u2019t like I planned to deep-throat him, so it didn\u2019t matter. I started bobbing my head up, working him with my hand at the same time. His fingers burrowed deep into my hair, guiding me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Soph,\u201d he muttered, groaning. \u201cStop. I\u2019m gonna come if you don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I liked that idea. For once it would be nice to see Jesse \u201cRuger\u201d Gray lose control. But just when I\u2019d decided to make it happen, his fingers tightened in my hair, dragging my mouth away from his cock.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>Oh, I could work with that ...</p><p>I climbed over him, reaching down to guide him into my body. Even though I was probably wetter than I\u2019d ever been in my life, taking his full length went slowly. From this angle I felt every inch of him, stretching me so wide it almost hurt. I stopped several times to let myself adjust, his eyes boring into me the whole while. When I finally had all of him I stilled, catching my breath.</p><p>Ruger still watched me, his face full of need and intensity and desire. He leaned up on one elbow, the flex of his stomach muscles almost painful against my oversensitized clit. He reached out and caught a strand of my hair, tucking it behind my ear, and then cupped my cheek, his face almost tender.</p><p>I closed my eyes.</p><p>Angry Ruger? Fine. Horny Ruger? I\u2019d gotten used to that, too. But Ruger as a gentle lover? I didn\u2019t have room for that in my head, not if I wanted to survive and move forward with my life. I started rocking back and forth on him, the movement ever-so-slight but almost painfully pleasurable. His hand dropped from my face to my hip, urging me to go faster, so I did.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to bring him back to the edge. At some point I leaned forward on his chest for leverage, digging my nails into his pecs, which seemed to turn him on even more. Ruger liked a touch of pain, I decided, so I did my best to crush him with my inner muscles.</p><p>I\u2019m generous that way.</p><p>I was close to coming myself when he lost patience, rolling me over and taking control again. He grabbed my legs, shoving them up and over his shoulders. Then he pounded me hard until I screamed out my orgasm.</p><p>Ruger followed right behind, and when he came, he called out my name.</p><p>I fell asleep with him wrapped around me, both of us on our sides, one of his hands resting lightly against my stomach. He\u2019d gone downstairs and grabbed a blanket, covering the hay and creating a nest for us.</p><p>At some point I woke to find Ruger\u2019s hand between my legs, slowly stroking me as I drifted. He rolled me to my stomach, spread my legs, and slid into my body gently and carefully. I sighed, the delicious pressure building and exploding with a subtlety I\u2019d never experienced before.</p><p>Then he wrapped himself around me again and I drifted back into sleep. I woke up when my cell rang at six the next morning, finding myself alone on my futon, surrounded by his smell. I didn\u2019t recognize the name and the caller hung up. Fucking wrong number.</p><p>I rolled to my side and saw the empty pizza box, still sitting on the coffee table.</p><p>Damn. What the hell was I supposed to do with a situation like this? Insane. All of it.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cGod, I love dancing,\u201d Kimber said, sucking on a cigarette. It was just shy of midnight on Friday, and we stood on the sidewalk outside a club in downtown Spokane. I had a nice buzz going.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy feet are gonna hurt so bad, but totally worth it,\u201d I agreed, swaying a little. I felt my cheeks flush, which was funny, so I started laughing. Kimber shook her head at me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you anywhere,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cLightweight. Where the hell did Em go? I want to check out this guy of hers. I thought the deal was we\u2019d look him over and decide whether he\u2019s worth her time. She\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. Bitch. I hate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too,\u201d Kimber replied, stabbing the air with her smoke for emphasis. \u201cHow am I supposed to live the single life vicariously if I don\u2019t get any details?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head and shrugged mournfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my part. I tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think I don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d she said, tearing up slightly. We gave each other a drunken hug.</p><p>We\u2019d hit the first bar around ten, and by ten thirty Em had disappeared to meet her online hottie, Liam. She was supposed to bring him inside to meet us, but they snuck off to a bar down the street instead. I would\u2019ve suspected kidnapping and murder by eleven thirty, when we moved on to the next club, but she\u2019d been sending us regular text messages that made it clear she was enjoying her evening.</p><p>Long story short\u2014Liam was gorgeous, we\u2019d get to meet him in a while, she was definitely going to sleep with him, and she was pretty sure he could handle her dad. Apparently Liam was Em\u2019s perfect man.</p> <p>She promised not to leave the other bar without us, so we called it good.</p><p>\u201cHopefully they\u2019re in some corner booth making out,\u201d I said glumly.</p><p>\u201cNot too much,\u201d Kimber said darkly. \u201cIf she f**ks him before I give my approval, she\u2019s losing her margarita privileges.\u201d</p><p>Talking about making out reminded me of Ruger, and thinking of Ruger made me want to drink more. I still couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d f**ked him. Again. I couldn\u2019t shake the man. Thank God we didn\u2019t need to be back in Coeur d\u2019Alene until noon, because I had a lot more alcohol to drink. Kimber\u2019s husband was definitely taking one for the team tonight, watching both kids. I needed to bake him cookies or something ...</p><p>\u201cIs it creepy that I want to bake for your husband?\u201d I asked her. She burst out laughing and I started laughing, too, and then my phone buzzed.</p><p>EM: I want to go back to the hotel. He\u2019s defintely THE ONE</p> <p>I read it and squeed, handing the phone over to Kimber. She started thumb-typing furiously.</p><p>Kimber: Dont u dare! We have to chck him out frist. Ur NOT follwing the plan</p><p>EM: Yu\u2019ll meet him in a minut come down to Mick\u2019s and we can head from there. We\u2019ll wait outside</p><p>I yanked my phone back and glared at Kimber.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine! I get to yell at her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t yell at her in front of Internet Hottie!\u201d she told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a cockblock. We\u2019ll yell at her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I considered this.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I still call dibs on first yelling once we ditch his ass.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t see them outside Mick\u2019s. It was a tiny hole-in-the-wall place we almost missed because it was next to a good-sized club with a long line. I texted Em and got no response.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably just peeing or something,\u201d Kimber said, eyeing a group of collegey-looking guys standing in a clump on the sidewalk. They eyed her back and she smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I hissed. \u201cMarried, remember?\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just looking, don\u2019t be so uptight. I promise not to touch, okay?\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzed.</p><p>EM: Heading out</p><p>We stood on the sidewalk for another five minutes. Nothing. I started getting a little nervous. I texted again. No reply.</p><p>Another ten minutes passed and I\u2019d had enough. This didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go check on her,\u201d I told Kimber. She\u2019d lost interest in the college boys when they\u2019d come over and tried to pick us up. They\u2019d been pretty to look at, but not exactly brilliant conversationalists.</p><p>She nodded, concern on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait out here,\u201d she said, looking up and down the street. \u201cJust in case they show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you outside by yourself,\u201d I replied. She jerked her chin toward the bouncer at the club next door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything happens, I\u2019ll scream for him. Go find our girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, my voice grim. \u201cBut when I find her, we\u2019re kicking her ass. This isn\u2019t cool.\u201d</p><p>The place was small and dark\u2014just a tiny, narrow little bar, way rougher than I expected. No wonder the college boys stayed outside. The men in here would crumple them up and throw them away like used ... um ... something. Straw wrappers? No, something worse. I shook my head, foggy from the booze. Focus. There were more men than women, and most kept their eyes on their drinks. My quickly sinking opinion of Liam went down another notch. What kind of guy took a girl to a place like this?</p><p>We shouldn\u2019t have let Em out of our sight, I realized.</p><p>I didn\u2019t find her in the main bar so I wandered to the back, where a long hallway led past some grotty-looking bathrooms and an office. It ended with a fire door that had been propped open with a brick.</p><p>I texted Kimber.</p><p>ME: Any sign of them?</p><p>KIMBER: No this is bllshit</p><p>ME: Not in bar. I\u2019ll look in the ally then com back</p><p>I stepped up to the fire door cautiously. Would Em really go out there with a guy she didn\u2019t know? Except she probably felt like she did know him. They\u2019d been calling each other for a while now. Hell, I\u2019d gone on dates with guys I\u2019d only met a few times. Still ... I pushed the door open and peeked outside to find a tall, dark-haired man in faded jeans and motorcycle boots leaning against the side of a battered cargo van.</p><p>He smiled at me like a shark and winked.</p><p>Oh my God. I recognized him. It was one of the guys from that other club, the Devil\u2019s Jacks. The ones who\u2019d come to my apartment in Seattle.</p><p>Hunter.</p><p>What was he doing here? Holy shit ... Coincidence?</p><p>Or were Hunter and Liam the same person?</p><p>I opened my mouth to scream when someone shoved me from behind, knocking me out into the alley. I stumbled and nearly fell. Then Hunter\u2019s arms caught me, swooping me up and carrying me toward the back of the van. I shrieked as loud as I could\u2014kicking and fighting as he tossed me in\u2014but the pounding music from the club next door almost guaranteed nobody heard me. Em lay on the floor, arms cuffed behind her back, a bandana gagging her mouth. Her legs were tied tight with what looked like white clothesline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter climbed in after me, wrestling me down and wrenching away my phone. Within seconds my own mouth was gagged and he\u2019d closed another set of cuffs around my wrists. I lay facedown on the floor, eyes wide and staring at Em, who stared right back at me. I felt someone else climb in and heard a door slam, and the engine roared to life.</p><p>Hunter spoke, his voice cool and detached.</p><p>\u201cSorry, girls. Hopefully this won\u2019t get too ugly and you\u2019ll get to go home soon.\u201d</p><p>The van started moving.</p> <p>RUGER</p><p>His beer had gotten warm.</p><p>For once, there wasn\u2019t a party at the clubhouse or a barbecue or anything happening, which was a f**king shame because all he could think about was Sophie out dancing in Spokane with her slut of a best friend. He should be focusing on his trip to Portland tomorrow, but he really couldn\u2019t bring himself to give a damn.</p><p>Jesus, he\u2019d nearly shit his pants when he realized who she was going out with tonight. Kimber\u2019s stage name had been Stormie, and the bitch was famous for having a mouth like a vacuum. Even he\u2019d taken her home one night ... It\u2019d been okay, but not worth breaking his no-repeats rule.</p><p>Now he wondered if she\u2019d been filling Sophie\u2019s head with stories about him all along. Also explained why she\u2019d been interested in working at The Line\u2014Kimber had made a goddamned fortune there, one of their most popular dancers.</p> <p>She\u2019d been an even bigger hit in the VIP rooms.</p><p>He\u2019d considered simply physically stopping Sophie from going, but figured that would do him more harm than good in the long run. She\u2019d been dodging him since their night in the hayloft and he\u2019d let it go. The first week of a new job was stressful, so he\u2019d given her a break. This ladies\u2019 night thing had caught him off guard. He\u2019d only found out because Noah had a big mouth.</p><p>Kid was full of all kinds of useful information.</p><p>Picnic walked into the main lounge with a girl trailing him. She looked about sixteen, although Ruger knew she had to be older. No jailbait in the Armory\u2014that was trouble they sure as f**k didn\u2019t need. Pic wore the look of man who\u2019d gotten well laid, and he sent her on her way with a smack on the ass. Then he walked over to Ruger.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d he asked, dropping into one of the mismatched chairs across from the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d Ruger said, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cAnd apparently I\u2019m getting old, because my neck hurts from sitting at my bench today, taking care of that special order.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**kin\u2019 pathetic,\u201d Pic said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear your girl moved out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we can talk about something else now.\u201d</p><p>Picnic laughed shortly.</p><p>\u201cFirst Horse and now you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhole damned place is turnin\u2019 up pu**y-whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, ass**le,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m sitting here right now instead of f**kin\u2019 her face is I\u2019m not willing to hand her my c**k on a leash. And you should talk. Screwing kids younger than your daughter? Creeps me out, thinkin\u2019 of your old ass doing a chick like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I got laid tonight,\u201d Pic answered mildly. \u201cUnlike some.\u201d</p> <p>His phone rang. He pulled it out and looked at the ID.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Em,\u201d he said shortly, standing and ambling across the room. Then Pic froze, his body language screaming tension. Thirty seconds later, Ruger\u2019s phone rang.</p><p>Sophie.</p><p>\u201cYou better not be\u2014\u201d he started, but she cut him off.</p><p>\u201cShut up and listen,\u201d she said, her voice tight. Ruger sat up. \u201cThose guys you met in Seattle? The Devil\u2019s Jacks? They\u2019ve got me and Em. We\u2019re in Spokane and they\u2014\u201d</p><p>He heard her scream as someone grabbed the phone. Adrenaline slammed through him, taking him from relaxed to ready for action in a heartbeat. Instead of acting on it, he forced himself to stay calm and listen with everything he had. They\u2019d need every clue they could to find Sophie ... and Em? What the f**k? Jesus, Em should know better than to go out without giving Pic a heads-up. How had Em gotten mixed up in this?</p><p>\u201cRuger,\u201d a man said. \u201cThis is Skid. From Seattle. We got a bit of a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d Ruger replied, his voice flat, and he meant it. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Picnic grab a bar stool and smash it against the wall. Horse was on his feet, pushing a trio of girls out the door as Painter grabbed a sawed-off shotgun from behind the bar.</p><p>Slide wandered in from the bathroom and glanced around, brows rising.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll talk about my death later,\u201d Skid said, sounding bored. \u201cListen up. Your boy in Portland\u2014Toke\u2014he went apeshit on two of our brothers a coupla hours ago. Just broke into the damned house and started shooting. There\u2019s cops everywhere, a couple of bitches who saw it all go down, total clusterfuck. Girls are talkin\u2019 to the cops, too, just to make things perfect. Docs are working on one guy right now, no idea if he\u2019ll make it. Toke dragged the other off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit,\u201d Ruger said. Toke might be a wild card but he wouldn\u2019t ignore a vote by the full club.</p><p>\u201cProcess later,\u201d Skid snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to get your boy under control and our man back to us. Safe. Until then, we\u2019ll take good care of\u2014what\u2019s her name again? Sophie? We\u2019ll take good care of sweet little Sophie for you. She\u2019ll be just fine once we clear this up. Our boy goes down? Her prospects don\u2019t look so good. Got a real nice ass. Might tap it before I shoot her. Got me?\u201d</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ruger muttered, kicking over the coffee table as he stood up. Pic yelled as Horse and Bam Bam held him back. Ruger ignored the drama, striding down the hall, past the office, and into the large workshop where he did his special projects. He flipped open his laptop and pulled up the tracker, narrowing his search.</p><p>There they were\u2014Sophie\u2019s and Em\u2019s phones were near the river, downtown Spokane. They\u2019d be in the water soon. By the time he could get there, the Jacks would be in the wind, along with their girls.</p><p>Goddamnit. Ruger turned and punched the wall, smashing through the sheetrock. Sharp pain hit, helping him focus. He pulled an unregistered .38 semi-automatic out of his bench drawer and shoved it into his ankle holster, then grabbed extra clips. Then he turned and went back down the hall to find Picnic and the others arguing over what they should do. Pic wanted to ride now\u2014Horse, Bam Bam, and Duck all wanted to take the time to make a plan, which Ruger knew needed to happen. Couldn\u2019t do shit in Spokane until they had more info. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Toke had lost the vote but he\u2019d won the battle.</p><p>The Reapers and the Devil\u2019s Jacks were going to war.</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we rode in the back of the van. It felt like forever. Then I heard the sound of a garage door opening. We pulled in and it shut behind us. Hunter and the driver stepped out of the van, coming around to open the back doors.</p> <p>Hard hands\u2014not Hunter\u2019s\u2014grabbed my ankles, pulling me out roughly. My cheek scraped, and if the kidnapping hadn\u2019t fully sobered me, the pain finished the trick. He half carried, half dragged me into the house. Then he dropped me down on the couch and I struggled to sit up. Hunter set Em down next to me, far more gently. He stepped back and joined his friend. Guy number two was Skid\u2014the other Devil\u2019s Jack I\u2019d met in Seattle. They stood over us, faces grim, and I knew we were well and truly f**ked.</p><p>My stomach twisted and I thought about Noah. Would I ever see him again?</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the situation,\u201d Hunter said, his cold gray eyes flicking back and forth between us. Could he actually be Em\u2019s Internet guy? She hadn\u2019t been lying. He really was hot\u2014even better-looking than I remembered.</p><p>Too bad he was a goddamned sociopath.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d done something to Liam. For all I knew, Em\u2019s online boyfriend was lying dead in the alley. Shit.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here as leverage. One of the Reapers down in Portland\u2014Toke\u2014made a real bad call tonight. He went to our house and started shooting, no warning, no provocation. He took a hostage when he left. One of our brothers is down and a second is probably getting tortured to death right now, so you\u2019ll have to excuse us for being a little abrupt about this whole thing. Your daddy,\u201d he nodded toward Em, \u201cis gonna do what it takes to get our guy back for us. That happens, you go home.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him, eyes full of betrayal. He leaned forward and pulled off her gag, whispering something in her ear. Em jerked away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead, Liam,\u201d she said, her voice utterly serious. So that was one mystery solved ... Poor Em. My heart hurt for her.</p><p>\u201cMy dad is going to kill you,\u201d she continued. \u201cLet us go now and I\u2019ll try to talk him out of it. Otherwise it\u2019ll be too late. I\u2019m serious. He. Will. Kill. You.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe,\u201d he replied. \u201cI get that you\u2019re scared and pissed, but I\u2019m not going to let a brother die just because some Reaper had a tantrum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Skid, who shrugged. Hunter sighed, rubbing a hand over his face, looking tired.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go upstairs,\u201d he said. He glanced at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll take your gag off, but either of you starts screaming we\u2019ll just have to put them back on. We\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re gonna get anywhere if you do. You two control how ugly this gets. Got me?\u201d</p><p>With that, he pulled out a Leatherman multi-tool and cut the rope on Em\u2019s feet. Then he started on mine. I heard a clicking noise and looked up to find Skid pointing a small, square pistol at us.</p><p>\u201cYou cause trouble, I\u2019ll shoot you,\u201d he said. \u201cHunter\u2019s nice. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>Hunter pulled me to my feet and I rocked nervously, trying to get circulation back. It was hard to balance with my hands cuffed behind my back. He helped Em up and then they marched us up the flight of stairs off to one side of the living room.</p><p>The house\u2019s second story was pretty typical, with a small landing at the top. Looked like there were three bedrooms, along with the bathroom, reminding me that I needed to pee in a big way. Hunter took Em\u2019s arm and pulled her into a room on the right, kicking the door shut behind them.</p> <p>\u201cOver there,\u201d Skid said, pointing to the door next to it. I walked in to find a queen-sized bed with a very plain wrought-iron frame, a battered dresser, and an old desk. There was a small window, which looked like it\u2019d been painted shut. I wondered how hard it would be to get it open. If I did, could I manage a drop back down to the ground?</p><p>\u201cStand next to the bed, facing away from me,\u201d Skid said.</p><p>Oh, shit ... The bed took on a whole new meaning. I did what he said, my body bracing for the worst. Was Skid about to rape me? Would Hunter rape Em? He\u2019d obviously been cultivating some sort of relationship with her. Was it all about the club, or was there something more?</p><p>Em was a very pretty girl. A girl who deserved better.</p><p>I trembled as Skid came up behind me, feeling the heat of his body and hoping to hell I wasn\u2019t his type. I felt his hands touch mine, then he popped open one of the cuffs.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d he said, his voice unreadable. Should I fight him, or just close my eyes and take it? I wanted to live a lot more than I wanted to fight. I\u2019d let him do it and just hope it ended fast.</p><p>I laid down on my back, focusing on the ceiling, blinking rapidly.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands up over your head.\u201d</p><p>I raised my arms as he leaned over me. He paused, looking me over, and I saw his eyes catch on the swell of my br**sts. I bit the side of my cheek, trying not to break down and start begging. I didn\u2019t want to give him that power over me. He reached down, catching my hands, and I felt a tug on the cuffs as he threaded the chain through the wrought iron. Then he snapped the second cuff back on me.</p><p>Skid stood back up and walked over to the window, looking outside, crossing his arms. My breath caught. Was that it? Was I safe for now? He glanced back toward me, thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cThe guy Toke took is my brother,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just my club brother\u2014my half brother. Only family I have. Believe me when I tell you I\u2019ll do anything to get him back. Don\u2019t think being a woman protects you. Nothing will protect you. Got me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep it up and maybe you\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked out.</p><p>I lay there forever, needing to pee so bad it hurt. I supposed I should\u2019ve asked Skid to take me to the bathroom before he locked me down. Sooner or later I\u2019d wet the bed. I didn\u2019t care. I\u2019d rather piss myself than call for Skid to come back and help me. Then I heard a scream and the sound of something shattering against the wall my room shared with Em\u2019s.</p><p>I forgot all about my bathroom situation.</p><p>\u201cYou cocksucking bastard!\u201d Em shrieked. I held my breath as I heard another thump. Oh, God. Was she fighting with him? Was he raping her? Her voice was full of pain and I felt sick to my stomach, because whatever was going on over there wasn\u2019t good. The noise died down. I lay in the dark, counting the seconds. How had something this crazy happened to someone as normal and boring as me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Goddamn Reapers.</p><p>Ruger\u2019s stupid f**king club. First Em got stabbed and now we\u2019d been kidnapped. It was like some horrible virus, creeping in and destroying everything it touched without warning.</p><p>If I got out of this alive, I was never touching Ruger again.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be with a Reaper, no matter how much I wanted him. I couldn\u2019t allow this to be a part of my life. It couldn\u2019t be part of Noah\u2019s life, either. If Ruger wanted to see my son, he\u2019d damned well leave the club out of it.</p> <p>As for me? I was done with him. Well and truly done. I knew it in my gut and in my bones\u2014any man whose reality included women getting kidnapped wasn\u2019t good enough for me. He wasn\u2019t right, no matter how he made me feel.</p><p>Period.</p><p>I closed my eyes tight as Em screamed again.</p><p>I woke with a start as the bed dipped.</p><p>Where was I?</p> <p>I heard Em\u2019s voice and it all came back.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked. I opened my eyes to find her sitting next to me. I studied her, looking for signs of abuse or crying.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like a rape victim, though. She looked pissed as hell. If anything, she was prettier than usual, her cheeks full of color and her hair wild and free. Early morning light filtered in through the window. Hunter stood in the door, eyeing both of us, face unreadable. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d actually fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cI need the bathroom,\u201d I said, my voice hoarse. God, I felt hungover.</p><p>\u201cCan she go to the f**king bathroom?\u201d Em asked Hunter, her voice cold.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, walking toward me. She stood and moved out of his way, putting as much distance between them as possible. I tried not to flinch as he unlocked me, rolling away as quickly as I could despite my aching muscles.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>Em took my hand and we walked out of the room together, her fingers squeezing mine. I wanted to ask if she was all right, find out what had happened. No way I was going to talk in front of him, though.</p><p>We turned into the small bathroom, which didn\u2019t have a window. Em shut the door behind us, pausing long enough in the doorway to glare at Hunter in some kind of silent battle. Then the door shut.</p><p>I rushed over to the toilet, incredibly relieved.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered, looking over at her. She ran her hands through her hair, then crossed her arms and rubbed up and down. \u201cHow are you? Did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pride? Definitely,\u201d she said, eyes snapping. \u201cNot physically. I can\u2019t believe this. Seriously\u2014I can\u2019t believe how stupid I was. I actually invited him to come and meet me. I made it so easy. Idiot.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply, washing my hands as we swapped places, then cupping them to take a drink. My mouth was all cottony.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d I asked. \u201cSkid scares the crap out of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d she asked, her voice sharp.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. This is a pretty f**ked-up situation,\u201d she said. \u201cToke\u2014he\u2019s the one who cut me at the party\u2014he\u2019s gone off his rocker. This shooting thing makes no sense to me at all, but if it really happened, we\u2019re screwed. Nobody knows where Toke is, not even Deke, and he\u2019s Toke\u2019s president. They\u2019ve all been looking for him since the party. Cutting me was not okay, and Dad wants to make sure he pays for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered. \u201cSo your dad couldn\u2019t give them this Toke guy, even if he wanted to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s really protective of me. When Toke hurt me like that, Dad lost it. If Dad could find him, he\u2019d be found already. We\u2019re pretty f**ked here, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll hurt us?\u201d</p><p>She considered the question.</p><p>\u201cLiam won\u2019t,\u201d she replied. \u201cI mean, he won\u2019t hurt me. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll hurt you, either.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head at her.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize he was lying to you all along, right? Just because you liked him doesn\u2019t mean you can trust him, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that,\u201d she said quickly, then shook her head ruefully. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m the f**kwit who got us into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a f**kwit,\u201d I said forcefully. \u201cHe\u2019s a liar and he\u2019s good at it. Not your fault that he targeted you.\u201d</p><p>It was the Reapers\u2019 fault, but I figured rubbing it in wouldn\u2019t be particularly helpful.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m serious\u2014I really don\u2019t think he\u2019ll hurt me. I\u2019m more worried about Skid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his brother they\u2019ve got,\u201d I told her. \u201cHis real brother. I think he wanted to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys okay in there?\u201d Hunter called through the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Em snapped, startling me. \u201cGive us a f**king minute, ass**le!\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty bitchy,\u201d I hissed. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s smart? Maybe I\u2019m reading the situation wrong here, but don\u2019t we want him in a good mood?\u201d</p><p>She snorted sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m a Reaper and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll suck up to some Devil\u2019s Jack dickwad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not a Reaper,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d just as soon not die here and leave Noah an orphan, so don\u2019t piss him off.\u201d</p><p>She looked chastened.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I guess I have my dad\u2019s temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad you don\u2019t have your dad\u2019s gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit, right? And I\u2019m the good girl in the family. You should see my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have one minute,\u201d Hunter called through the door. \u201cThen I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>Em washed her hands and we left the bathroom. I avoided making eye contact with Hunter, who stood back and jerked his head toward \u201cmy\u201d bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGo in and lie down on the bed,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>We did what he said\u2014although I could see it killed Em to obey\u2014and two minutes later he had us both cuffed to the bedstead. Thankfully, he only did one wrist each, which was way more comfortable than Skid\u2019s method.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you some food,\u201d Hunter said, tracing a finger across Em\u2019s cheek.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna buy a bright red dress to wear to your funeral, Liam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he replied, eyes narrowing. \u201cMake sure it\u2019s short and shows off your tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cKeep tellin\u2019 yourself that.\u201d</p><p>He walked out, slamming the door behind him. I bit my tongue, wondering what the hell that was all about.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Em said after an awkward pause. \u201cWe\u2019ll find our way out of this. We\u2019ll escape somehow. Either that or the guys will find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d I asked, wondering what the hell was going on between them. \u201cDid he tell you anything, give you any hints or clues about where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I waited for her to say more. She didn\u2019t, and that worried me even more.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do all night?\u201d I asked slowly. Em ignored the question.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if one of them will leave at some point,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIf we wait until there\u2019s just one in the house, I\u2019ll bet the two of us could take him. Or even if we distracted him, at least one of us could get away. Go for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019re really out in the middle of nowhere?\u201d I asked. \u201cHave you seen outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen outside, but we barely drove long enough to get out of the city,\u201d she said. \u201cThere may not be any houses next door, but there has to be something within walking distance. We just need to find a way out of these handcuffs. If we can find a paperclip or a pin or something, I can pick the lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, impressed. \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at all the things I know,\u201d she said, her voice dry. \u201cDad believes in being prepared.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Hunter came in balancing two paper plates. He had a couple bottles of water clutched under his arm and I suddenly realized how hungry and thirsty I was. My stomach growled. He set everything on top of the little dresser in the corner. Then he walked over and unlocked the handcuffs.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got ten minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>We got up and grabbed the food. It was just plain peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, along with some chips, but it tasted as good as any meal I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute, we\u2019re going to call your dad,\u201d Hunter said to Em. \u201cLet him know you\u2019re alive, and find out if he\u2019s made any progress.\u201d</p><p>Em glared at him darkly, chewing her food. He sighed, grabbing the chair from the desk and pulling it out.</p><p>\u201cYou want to sit?\u201d he asked. She shook her head. Hunter spun the chair around and straddled it himself, his face blank. His eyes never strayed from Em\u2019s face. Once we finished eating, he nodded toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cLie down again,\u201d he said. We did. Hunter started with me, locking down my right wrist. Then he walked around the bed to do the same to Em\u2019s left. As he leaned over her, I saw her free hand snake quickly around to his back jeans pocket, lifting something. In an instant she tucked it under her body.</p><p>Hunter froze.</p><p>Shit, did he feel that?</p> <p>We needed a distraction. Now. I bit down on my tongue viciously, then shrieked and started spitting blood at him as hard as I could.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he yelled, jumping away from the bed like it was on fire. Em dove right in.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, are you all right?\u201d she yelled. \u201cHunter, you need to get her to a doctor!\u201d</p><p>I stopped spitting, choking on the blood. Ughh ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tho thorry,\u201d I mumbled, trying to look embarrassed and shocked. \u201cI bith my tongue and ith thcared me.\u201d</p><p>Hunter looked at the gobs of blood and spit on his arm with disgust, then glared at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king kidding me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the f**k\u2019s wrong with you? Shit, you got any diseases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hath any ditheatheth,\u201d I snapped. Or rather, I tried to snap, which backfired on me because my tongue was swelling so rapidly that I bit it again. \u201cOwth!\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head, and Em looked at me with wide, concerned eyes. Behind them, I saw laughter dancing.</p><p>\u201cDrive me f**kin\u2019 crazy,\u201d Hunter muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a piece of ice to suck on. Jesus, that\u2019s f**king disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He left the room, slamming the door, and Em almost lost it.</p><p>\u201cThat was brilliant,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSeriously brilliant. I got his Leatherman. I should be able to get us out of the cuffs with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thucky he didn\u2019th do both handth. Thkid did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that sucks,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose at me. \u201cLet me guess, did you have an itch on your ass or something all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank fukth,\u201d I replied. Shit, my tongue really hurt. \u201cWhen will you thry to pick the lockth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I think he\u2019ll be gone for a while,\u201d she said. She grabbed the Leatherman, then rolled over and crawled up the bed on her elbows, reaching down between the iron bars to tuck it in somewhere.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s between the mattress and the box spring,\u201d she said. \u201cIn case you need it.\u201d</p><p>I frowned\u2014if I needed it, she\u2019d be gone, and the implications of that weren\u2019t good.</p><p>Hunter returned, holding a paper napkin. I sat up awkwardly as he handed it to me, scooting back against the headboard. It held an ice cube, which I popped into my mouth as Em joined me.</p><p>My throbbing tongue started feeling better immediately, thank God.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to call your dad again,\u201d Hunter told Em. \u201cI\u2019ll let you talk to him for a minute, then I\u2019ll see where the situation\u2019s headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sophie?\u201d she asked. \u201cRuger will want to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuger can f**k himself,\u201d Hunter replied. Em glanced at me, and I realized she wanted more distraction. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but I\u2019d follow her lead. I spat out the bloody ice into my hand awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cPleathe?\u201d I whined, drooling. \u201cMy boy\u2014Noah\u2014he\u2019th got a prethcription he needth, Ruger doethn\u2019t know where it ith. Let me talk to him for two minuteth. Pleathe.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a seven-year-old kid to die?\u201d Em said, her voice cold. \u201cNot enough to kill two women, now you\u2019re gonna take out a little boy, too? You\u2019re a hell of a man, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Hunter sighed.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever shut up?\u201d he asked. He pulled a cell out of his pocket, one of those cheap little flip phones you buy at grocery stores, watching us as he dialed. He put it on speaker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Ruger said, his voice full of restrained tension. Hunter nodded at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Thophie,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m here with Hunter and Em, they\u2019re lithening.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s eyes narrowed and he snapped the phone shut.</p><p>\u201cNo f**king games,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and stuck the ice back into my mouth. At least Ruger knew I was still alive ... I\u2019d decided I was done with him last night, but he\u2019d gotten me into this mess, so he could damned well get me back out before I cut him off for good.</p><p>\u201cCalling your dad now,\u201d Hunter said to Em, dialing again. \u201cBe a good girl, Emmy Lou\u2014or did you need another lesson?\u201d</p><p>Em flushed, looking away. My eyebrows rose. We heard the phone ringing through the speaker, and then it picked up.</p><p>\u201cPicnic,\u201d Em\u2019s dad said, his voice cold.</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy,\u201d Em said. \u201cWe\u2019re okay for now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the f**k\u2019s wrong with Sophie?\u201d Picnic asked. \u201cRuger says she wasn\u2019t talking right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe bit her tongue,\u201d Em said quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s fine. But you need to get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know, baby,\u201d he replied, and his voice softened ever so slightly. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, girls,\u201d Hunter said, pulling away the phone. He clicked off the speaker and put it to his ear as he walked out of the room.</p><p>Em scooted closer to me, lifting her free arm to wrap it around my neck. I leaned against her, taking comfort from the fact that at least we weren\u2019t alone. The swelling in my tongue had gone down, too, which was a relief.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get ourselves out of this,\u201d she told me. \u201cLike I said\u2014Toke\u2019s AWOL. After he cut me, there\u2019s nothing he could have done to make things right with dad. If they could find Toke, they would\u2019ve by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow should we do it?\u201d I muttered around the last of the ice.</p><p>\u201cWe should wait until there\u2019s just one guy here,\u201d she said. \u201cSooner or later, they\u2019ll have to go get groceries or something. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll move. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot, and I think attacking is too dangerous, unless you\u2019ve got some sort of secret ninja skills I don\u2019t know about. Great job with the whole spitting blood thing, by the way. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have to do our part,\u201d I said, feeling pleased with myself. \u201cYou\u2019re not half bad as a pickpocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to pay for college somehow,\u201d she replied piously. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in student loans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a nutjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she said, mustering a grin. \u201cBut everything I have, I own free and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too,\u201d I said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get a credit card to save my life. Apparently unemployed single moms are a bad risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of, I have Hunter\u2019s now,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cI lifted his wallet while you were talking on the phone with Ruger. No idea if it\u2019ll be useful, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p> <p>I sobered.</p><p>\u201cOkay, first thing\u2014you need to stop picking his pocket,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna figure it out. He almost did when you got the knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right about that one,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cSo here\u2019s my thought. I want to split up. More chance that one of us will get away and bring help. We wait until one of the guys leaves, then I\u2019ll go out the front of the house and you\u2019ll go out the back. Whoever\u2019s left can\u2019t chase us both. Hell, maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and he won\u2019t even notice us leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Hunter and Skid aren\u2019t the only guys here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I guess they\u2019ll probably catch us again,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk, because they\u2019ll punish us. This isn\u2019t a game. But we can\u2019t just sit here and hope this all works out\u2014realistically, it\u2019s not gonna be easy for the club to find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Hunter wouldn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he will,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Skid\u2019s different. Dad will find us sooner or later, but I\u2019d just as soon we\u2019re alive when it happens. I don\u2019t want to get dumped in a ditch somewhere just because Toke\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get dumped in a ditch, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we just won\u2019t get caught,\u201d she told me, offering a grin. \u201cShould be easy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention you\u2019re a nutjob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it from my dad.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>RUGER</p><p>\u201cI wish I had more to tell you,\u201d Kimber said. She looked like a raccoon, her eyes completely surrounded by tear-streaked, black makeup. She sat at a table in the Armory, obviously exhausted from her long night. Ruger still couldn\u2019t quite believe he\u2019d actually f**ked this woman. On purpose.</p><p>Sure, she had a great body, but compared to Sophie she was nothing. Not even on his dick\u2019s radar.</p><p>\u201cYou did the best you could,\u201d Horse said. It\u2019d taken them a while to find Kimber because she\u2019d gone on a rampage looking for Sophie and Em. When they\u2019d finally caught up to her, she\u2019d been holding four men hostage in the corner of Mick\u2019s bar with a canister of pepper spray in one hand and her phone in the other. She\u2019d been filming them, demanding that they tell her everything they knew \u201cfor the record.\u201d</p><p>Thank f**k she didn\u2019t have a gun with her.</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d she said. \u201cI never should\u2019ve let her go in by herself. The whole thing was a terrible idea. You\u2019ll never know how sorry I am. I hope you can believe that.\u201d</p><p>Picnic grunted, obviously unimpressed, but he managed to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good you weren\u2019t with her,\u201d Bam Bam said, his voice soothing. \u201cIf you were, we\u2019d have three hostages instead of two. Not only that, you\u2019re not one of us, so they might consider you dead weight. This is better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be okay watching Noah until we get this fixed?\u201d Ruger asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking up and meeting his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him like he\u2019s my own. You don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll come over and see him if I can. I\u2019m not going to let myself get distracted from finding Sophie, though. You need a gun?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a gun,\u201d she replied, her voice dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d Painter said, his expression cold. Something in him had changed, Ruger realized. He\u2019d always been a good man, but he wore a new sense of purpose this morning. Maybe this would motivate him to pull his shit together. He\u2019d always assumed Painter and Em would end up together. Clearly she\u2019d gotten tired of waiting. Fucking Internet dating ... might as well paint a bright red target on her head.</p><p>Ruger was seeing things pretty clearly this morning himself. He needed Sophie back, safe and sound. Needed her more than his own life. He didn\u2019t give a flying f**k about any other woman. If he\u2019d pulled his head out of his ass earlier, this wouldn\u2019t have happened, because she\u2019d have been safe at home with him, in his bed.</p><p>Once he got her back, he\u2019d never let her go again.</p> <p>Never.</p><p>She wanted commitment? He\u2019d tattoo her f**king name on his forehead if he had to. Whatever it took to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cAny news from the boys in Portland?\u201d Duck asked.</p><p>\u201cNot so far,\u201d Picnic replied. \u201cThey think Toke might have the Jack\u2014goes by Clutch\u2014out to the coast. They\u2019re looking for him, but don\u2019t exactly have a lot of leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the one he shot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCritical but stable, whatever the f**k that means,\u201d Pic said. \u201cGuess that\u2019s something to be thankful for. Okay, let\u2019s get going on this. We got two hours before our meet with Hunter. Thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me handle this one,\u201d Duck said, crossing his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re too involved, and that means your brain won\u2019t be working. You and Ruger should stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo f**kin\u2019 way,\u201d Picnic said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m the president. This is my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a father and you\u2019re running on fumes,\u201d Duck replied. \u201cYou do this and f**k it up, your girl dies. You really believe you can look this f**kwad in the eye and play nice? \u2019Cause I don\u2019t think you can. Be smart and let me handle it. You don\u2019t want me, have Horse do it, or Bam Bam. We\u2019re your brothers for a reason. We\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>Picnic shook his head again, face tense. He\u2019d started methodically loading spare magazines for his new gun, which he\u2019d been test-firing earlier. Ruger knew he planned to kill Hunter with that same gun, because they\u2019d spent close to an hour together, carefully choosing just the right weapon to do it.</p><p>Something untraceable, with a small enough caliber to do slow, steady damage for a long, long time without ending the bastard\u2019s life too quickly.</p> <p>\u201cRuger, you need to stay back, too,\u201d Horse said. Ruger glanced up at him and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going. Nonnegotiable. I don\u2019t need to be lead, but I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Horse and Duck exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cOkay, new plan,\u201d Duck said. \u201cI\u2019ll be lead, you guys come along but keep back. We can\u2019t let him f**k with you\u2014he gets you worked up, you do something stupid, he wins. Got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Pic said. \u201cJust so long as you remember\u2014in the end, he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs,\u201d Ruger corrected. \u201cHim and his friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Toke?\u201d Bam Bam asked. \u201cThoughts on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him answer to the brothers,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cWe voted, we made a decision for the club. He ignored that. Fucker needs to pay.\u201d</p> <p>SOPHIE</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to go meet with Dad,\u201d Em said, finally speaking.</p><p>Earlier Hunter had come and taken her away, only returning her about ten minutes ago. She\u2019d been gone with him for what felt like an eternity. Realistically, it probably hadn\u2019t been more than an hour. When she\u2019d first come back she\u2019d kept pretty quiet. Now she lay with me on the bed again, me cuffed by my right wrist and Em cuffed by her left.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s trying to save the situation,\u201d she said, her voice sounding a little mournful. \u201cI think he actually cares about me, Soph.\u201d</p><p>I widened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d I said. \u201cHe wants to screw you\u2014I get that, he\u2019s a guy and you\u2019re hot. But a man who cares about a woman doesn\u2019t kidnap her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Marie about that,\u201d she said, sounding uncomfortable. \u201cHorse totally kidnapped her. Now they\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>That shut me up for a minute.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know the whole story?\u201d I asked finally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to make you feel any better.\u201d</p><p>Motorcycle pipes roared outside the house and we heard the sound of someone riding away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Hunter leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I get away and Dad finds out I\u2019m safe, he\u2019ll kill him for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, looking over at her. She seemed downcast, thoughtful. Shit, we couldn\u2019t afford this. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare have second thoughts. This guy is dangerous and we\u2019re going to get seriously hurt if we stay here. We\u2019re going to escape. In fact, we\u2019re going to escape soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>We gave it an hour, or at least we thought it was about an hour. We wanted to be sure Hunter was far away before we tried our escape. Em opened the knife and popped out a tiny, thin flat-head screwdriver. Five minutes later we were out of the cuffs and taking turns peeking out the window. Hunter hadn\u2019t lied. We appeared to be in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by scruffy shrubs, open ground, and the occasional pine tree.</p><p>Only the van sat outside, no more bikes, which hopefully meant we\u2019d only be dealing with Skid. Even so, there wasn\u2019t a lot of ground cover.</p><p>\u201cIf he chases us we don\u2019t have a chance,\u201d I said, my voice grim.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t chase us,\u201d she replied. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019re going to sneak downstairs. We\u2019ll figure out where he is, then you go out one side of the house and I\u2019ll go out the other. I can see a back door from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he sees us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever he sees has to slow him down long enough for the other one to get away and find help,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo matter what it takes. And I\u2019m going to be the one going closest to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, startled. \u201cNot that I want any extra risk, but\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you have a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAll other issues aside, Noah needs you and nobody needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family, the whole club, they all need you,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to be noble here or something. If only one of us gets out, it\u2019s you. Let\u2019s not fight about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and then nodded because she was right. Noah was more important than the rest of us put together.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, but promise me something,\u201d I said. \u201cYou need to seriously try to get away. Don\u2019t let yourself get caught or something just because you want to keep Hunter safe.\u201d</p><p>She looked back outside, and for a moment I thought she might argue. How much had Hunter f**ked with her head, anyway?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll start screaming right now and let him know we\u2019ve got that knife if you don\u2019t promise me you\u2019ll do your best to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we get free, we could always give him time to get back before calling Dad, you know. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s all or nothing. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>I kept my mouth shut. If I got away and found a phone, Hunter was toast.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s no time like the present, hmm?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMight as well go now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the knife, unless you know how to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to fight?\u201d I asked, startled. She nodded. \u201cUm, no. I didn\u2019t take knife-fighting class in school. You can keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this thing,\u201d Em said, using a very fine Arnold Schwarzenegger voice. Unfortunately, it was going to take more than a silly voice to make me feel badass. We bumped fists, opened the bedroom door, and started creeping across the floor. I was terrified we\u2019d make it squeak, but fortunately it seemed solid enough. She eased the bedroom door open, and from downstairs I heard the sound of a game playing on the TV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go down the stairs first,\u201d Em whispered. \u201cThen I\u2019ll wave you on. Be ready to go whatever direction I point you, based on where I see him. If I point back at the bedroom, go up and get yourself back into your handcuff, okay? If I wave you on, that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll only get one shot, so don\u2019t f**k it up. I\u2019m counting on you to send help for me if I have to distract him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d I told her, hoping it was the truth. \u201cLet\u2019s both get out, though, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, one more thing, and this is important,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you find a phone, call my dad or Ruger,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t call the cops.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice serious. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding at all. This is club business\u2014if we get the cops involved, things will get much worse, and it\u2019ll happen fast, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cIf I get out of here I\u2019m calling nine one one as fast as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re not going,\u201d she replied. My eyes widened.</p> <p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou call the cops, Dad or Ruger might wind up in jail before this ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I was joking when I said Dad would kill Hunter?\u201d she asked slowly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. I\u2019ll try to convince him not to. I\u2019ll hope to hell it doesn\u2019t happen. But Hunter going to jail for this won\u2019t protect him, and if Dad takes him out, I don\u2019t want to lose him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I muttered, shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you won\u2019t call the cops,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the position to make a call, you\u2019ll already be safe. I have the right to make the decision for myself, though.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it for a second.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered. I didn\u2019t like it, but I\u2019d do it.</p><p>She nodded, then started down the stairs very slowly. This would be the hardest part, because we needed to pass through the living room to go anywhere else in the house. He was probably in there, because that\u2019s where the TV was. I pictured the layout in my head\u2014he\u2019d be facing away, and I didn\u2019t remember seeing any mirrors on the walls.</p><p>Just a little luck and we\u2019d pull it off.</p><p>Em looked up at me, lifted a finger to her mouth and then waved me down. I crept from step to step, trying to stay completely silent, while still moving fast enough so that we wouldn\u2019t lose our opportunity. Skid came into view as I reached the bottom of the stairwell. He sat on the couch, back to us, playing some sort of game that involved shooting at things.</p><p>Luckily, it also seemed to involve a lot of loud noises and blowing things up.</p><p>Em touched my hand and I looked at her. She pointed at her chest, then toward the front door. Then she pointed at me and toward the back of the house. She held up three fingers, then counted down with them, two, one\u2014go.</p><p>I slipped past her, walking quickly but silently toward the back of the house. Within seconds I passed out of the living room, through a dining room, and into a kitchen. I found the back door. It was locked, of course, but all I had to do was open the deadbolt. No special security or anything.</p><p>They really hadn\u2019t been planning to kidnap us, I realized. Even I knew that when you plan a kidnapping, you prep a place for your prisoners.</p><p>So far so good.</p><p>I eased the back door open, and then Skid shouted behind me. I heard Em shriek at him and then a loud, crashing noise. I took off out the door, running as fast as I could in a wide circle around the house.</p><p>There was a long gravel driveway, and since we\u2019d already been discovered, I followed it, listening for vehicles or gunfire. I didn\u2019t hear anything other than that first loud outburst. My heart pounded and my brain shut down\u2014would Skid really kill Em? I ran hard, adrenaline powering my legs.</p><p>Then I heard a gunshot.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>RUGER</p><p>Hunter had set up the meet in Spirit Lake, but Ruger got a text halfway there sending them to Rathdrum instead. The Devil\u2019s Jack waited for them in a bar that clearly stated \u201cNo Colors\u201d outside the door, forcing them to take off their cuts before going inside.</p><p>Dick. Balls of brass, though.</p><p>They walked in to find him sitting in the back, nursing a beer. Picnic started forward, but Bam Bam caught his arm, pulling him back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice low. Picnic nodded tightly as Duck took lead instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour girls are doing just fine,\u201d Hunter said as the men sat down, and Ruger realized he wasn\u2019t nearly as relaxed as he pretended. His eyes were like ice, and he looked almost feral. That wildness made Ruger damned uncomfortable. Man like that might do anything\u2014no predicting his actions. \u201cI\u2019m planning to keep it that way, so long as you do your part. Where are we on that? You got news for me on your boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we got shit,\u201d Duck said, his voice calm and matter-of-fact. \u201cHere\u2019s what you need to know. Toke\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToke slashed Em with a knife,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI saw the damage. He\u2019s out of control, and not just with us. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you see that?\u201d Picnic demanded. \u201cWhy the f**k was her shirt off?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Hunter said. Picnic lurched to his feet, but Horse caught him, pushing him back down.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Pic,\u201d Horse murmured. \u201cHold it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was her shirt off?\u201d Picnic repeated. Ruger felt his own temper rise, but he kept his mouth shut and his eyes open.</p><p>\u201cI think a better question is, why she did she get cut in the first place?\u201d Hunter asked, his voice full of carefully leashed anger. \u201cOr maybe, why was she meeting a strange man in a bar without any kind of backup? You f**ked up, old man, and I\u2019ve got her now. Looks like she needs someone new to protect her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Fuck me, Ruger thought. He\u2019s got a thing for Em.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back on track,\u201d Duck said, his tone smooth and dangerous, which wasn\u2019t like Duck at all. Usually he had a big mouth and a short temper, but the crisis seemed to have brought out something more calculating in him. He\u2019d told them stories about Vietnam, about patrols in the backcountry and sneaking behind enemy lines, but Ruger had always thought he was full of shit.</p><p>Now he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t give you what you want,\u201d Duck told Hunter. \u201cBelieve me, we want to. We\u2019ve been looking for him all week. And this shit\u2014this goes against our whole club. We voted on the truce and the decision was made. He\u2019ll answer for that to the national officers. But don\u2019t go hurting two innocent girls trying to force us to do something impossible. I promise you, either of them gets a scratch and your life will end. Got me?\u201d</p><p>Hunter sat back in his chair, studying each man in turn.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously expect me to believe you can\u2019t track down your own man?\u201d he asked, cocking his head. \u201cSounds like the Reapers got some problems of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be,\u201d Horse said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a fact\u2014we can\u2019t tell you where he is. I can\u2019t make you believe that, but no matter what you do to Em and Sophie, it doesn\u2019t change reality. We\u2019ve had guys looking for him all week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me guess, his brothers in Portland? Deke?\u201d Hunter asked sarcastically. \u201cBecause they\u2019ll cover his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just Deke,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cAnd trust me, they want his ass as much as you do. This isn\u2019t just about you\u2014he broke faith with all of us. We voted. We made a truce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Hunter. We know jack shit about Toke,\u201d Ruger said, somehow staying calm and matter-of-fact, despite the fact he wanted to jump over the table and cut the prick\u2019s heart out. \u201cI think you get we\u2019re lookin\u2019 at a war starting, right here, right now. Toke\u2019s out of control and we all know it. Whatever happens to him, he brought on himself. But you takin\u2019 our girls? That\u2019s different. When we come after you, we\u2019ll bring the whole damned club with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm and Sophie are safe,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd I promise they\u2019ll stay that way, at least for now. But you aren\u2019t getting them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout giving us one?\u201d Duck asked. \u201cSophie\u2019s got a kid. Send her back.\u201d</p><p>Picnic stiffened, but he kept his mouth shut. This wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Ruger saw where Duck was going with it, though. One was better than none, and if Hunter had a thing for Em, he\u2019d be motivated to protect her. Not only that, Em would definitely want Sophie back with Noah. Ruger glanced over at Pic and saw understanding written on his face.</p><p>Fuck ... He couldn\u2019t even imagine what Picnic was going through right now. It was bad enough they had Sophie. If somebody tried to take away Noah, he\u2019d lose his shit all over the place. Rain goddamn hellfire on them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you give me if I let her go?\u201d Hunter asked. \u201cI want something to take back to my club.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about a hostage?\u201d Painter said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019ve got one of your brothers\u2014you take one of ours and let both girls go.\u201d</p><p>Hunter gave a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d he said. \u201cYour ugly asses aren\u2019t worth shit to me. We want a Reaper, we\u2019ll pick one up in Portland.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, his eyes intense.</p><p>\u201cI want peace,\u201d Hunter continued. \u201cEven with all this, I still want peace. Nothing in our situation has changed, and if you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me Toke is rogue, give me something to take to my club and maybe we can still save the truce.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his phone, glancing down at it.</p><p>\u201cBack in five,\u201d Hunter said. He stood and walked away, holding it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cThis is a waste of time,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cDeke was right\u2014no point making peace with these f**kwads.\u201d</p><p>Ruger nodded, and he heard his brothers murmur agreement. The entire club needed to reevaluate their decision, no question. Didn\u2019t excuse Toke going rogue, but Ruger understood his motivations.</p><p>Hunter hung up his phone and turned back toward them. Almost immediately it rang again and he answered, studying their table the entire time. While his face stayed carefully blank, Ruger caught a hint of something wild in his eyes.</p><p>Then the Devil\u2019s Jack hung up the phone once more and walked toward them.</p><p>\u201cGood news and bad,\u201d he said slowly. Ruger tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Duck asked.</p><p>\u201cClutch is alive,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least for now. We don\u2019t have much information on him yet. They took him to the hospital. That\u2019s the good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bad?\u201d said Picnic.</p><p>\u201cIt was cops that found him and Toke,\u201d Hunter replied. \u201cSomeone heard something and called it in. They caught Toke hiding in a hotel, our guy chained up in the bathroom. The girls who were in our house when he attacked are cooperating, so the cops have witnesses. They\u2019ll put Toke in protective custody. Out of our reach, for now. The brothers won\u2019t be happy about that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou gonna give us back Sophie and Em?\u201d Ruger asked.</p><p>The question hung heavy between them as Hunter leaned back and took another drink, face blank.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doin\u2019 it to prove we\u2019re serious about the truce. Toke\u2019s situation still isn\u2019t resolved. But I\u2019m willing to accept he wasn\u2019t acting on behalf of the Reapers, pull that out of the equation.\u201d</p><p>Ruger felt the band around his chest loosen for the first time since he\u2019d gotten that panicked call from Sophie.</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Picnic asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Hunter replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting out of here alive first, I think. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see my concern?\u201d</p><p>Duck snorted, almost a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d be concerned in your place, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t forget this. Not sure that truce is gonna last after this little adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Hunter admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Hope you will, too. Skid\u2019ll let the girls go once I give him the word. Won\u2019t happen until I\u2019m sure I\u2019m safe, so you start trailing me, your girls stay locked up longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cMake it fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d Duck said. \u201cThe Toke situation\u2014you got any pull with those witnesses? We\u2019d like to handle this within the club as much as possible. Toke\u2019ll keep his mouth shut, sure your boys will, too.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Duck said. \u201cKeep Em and Sophie safe, got me? Otherwise I\u2019ll personally skin you and use it to make lamp shades for the Armory.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE</p> <p>Sometimes your brain tells you to do something and you know it\u2019s wrong.</p><p>My brain told me to run faster when I heard Skid\u2019s gun go off, to follow Em\u2019s plan like a good little girl. I was supposed to get out and get help. No turning back. My son needed me ... We agreed on it.</p><p>Not only that, saving Em was Picnic and Ruger\u2019s job.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t my fight.</p><p>But somehow I knew\u2014in my gut and in my soul\u2014that if I kept running, Skid would kill Em. Maybe he already had.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave her behind.</p><p>So I stopped running and turned back toward the house, creeping up on it as quickly as I could, taking cover underneath a window on the living-room side. I listened for a second, hearing the muffled sound of Skid\u2019s voice. Em answered him, her tone pleading. I figured that meant he was distracted, so I popped up for a quick peek.</p><p>Em lay on the floor, pressing against the outside of her left thigh with both hands. Bright red blood seeped between her fingers. Skid stood over her, gun pointed and ready, and the look on his face wasn\u2019t friendly. This guy would be happy to kill her.</p> <p>Fuck.</p><p>I looked around frantically, trying to think of a plan. I needed to stop him, and I needed to do it in a way that wouldn\u2019t end with someone dead. I crawled quickly around the side of the house, where the open front porch held two wooden chairs and a small table. I tried peeking in the front window to see what was happening, but shades covered it.</p><p>Then I heard Em scream.</p><p>No more time.</p><p>I grabbed one of the chairs, pleased to find that it was solid wood and had a nice heft. Then I rang the doorbell and waited, holding my chair ready.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201d Skid called.</p><p>I stayed quiet\u2014I mean, what the hell was I supposed to say? Please come out so I can hit you? Using my elbow, I rang the bell again. My muscles started to burn from holding the chair. Hurry up, ass**le.</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d Skid yelled. Em must\u2019ve done something to mess with him because I heard a crashing noise. I rang the bell five or six times in a row with my elbow like an annoying kid.</p><p>Skid threw the door open.</p><p>I clocked him hard in the face with the chair. He staggered and the gun went off, thankfully missing me. I ignored the ringing in my ears and swung the chair around and hit him again. He shuddered, then lunged toward me, blood running down his face from his smashed nose. I screamed as he grabbed the chair by its legs, jerking it away and raising it high.</p><p>Then Em was on him from behind.</p><p>She attacked like a rabid ferret, arms tightening around his neck as she bit and scratched and kicked. He lurched forward and I joined in, grabbing the second chair and swinging it at his knees. He gave a high scream as he pitched forward off the porch, Em riding him down into the dirt. I jumped after them, landing between his legs and kicking him in the crotch over and over again. Hopefully there wouldn\u2019t be any little Skidlets in his future to carry on the family legacy.</p><p>Skid screamed like a baby the whole time.</p><p>And Em? I couldn\u2019t tell if she was laughing or crying.</p><p>Ten minutes later, we\u2019d handcuffed Skid\u2019s bruised, bleeding body to a porch pillar. He\u2019d passed out from the pain, which was probably a good thing. I didn\u2019t want to look into his evil eyes or listen to whatever bullshit he might spew.</p><p>Now I sat in one of the porch chairs, his confiscated gun carefully braced against my leg, cocked and ready to shoot. I didn\u2019t want to kill him, but I\u2019d do it if I had to. I didn\u2019t doubt that for a second.</p><p>Em hobbled out of the house, her leg bandaged in strips of sheet from the bedroom. Thankfully, the bullet had just lightly grazed her thigh. Still, her face was white and drawn from the pain.</p><p>Despite it all, she managed a small smile, holding up a cell phone in triumph.</p><p>\u201cDumbass has Google maps installed,\u201d she said. \u201cI know exactly where we are. I\u2019m calling Dad to come and get us.\u201d</p><p>She dialed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad? It\u2019s me. We\u2019re okay. Could use a ride, though.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered toward Skid as Picnic\u2019s muffled voice burst out of the phone.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all good,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut you might want to bring the van. We may need some cargo space.\u201d</p><p>She gave them directions and hung up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here in about twenty minutes,\u201d Em told me. \u201cThey sounded pretty happy to hear from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Hunter with them?\u201d I asked. As soon as the question left my mouth, I regretted it. Did I really want the answer? Em swallowed and looked away.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThe meet was already over. I guess we missed him by maybe five minutes. He\u2019s got good luck.\u201d</p><p>I raised a brow, but kept my mouth shut. Em dropped the phone to the ground, then stomped on it, and I heard the crunch of glass and plastic.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I asked, startled. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGPS,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cI don\u2019t want the Devil\u2019s Jacks tracing us with it, and we can\u2019t leave it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we need it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cDad and Ruger will find us. Don\u2019t worry. By tomorrow it\u2019ll be like this never happened. In fact, I don\u2019t want to talk about it and I don\u2019t want to think about it. Got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes. Em grabbed the second chair and dragged it over toward me, sitting down.</p> <p>\u201cWant me to take the gun for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, handing it over. It was surprisingly heavy, and after the first few minutes my hand had started cramping. I stretched my fingers, looking out across the long gravel driveway into the trees.</p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut that was the shittiest girls\u2019 night out ever.\u201d</p><p>Em gave a short, startled snort of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>RUGER</p><p>They crested the small rise overlooking the house and Picnic slowed, raising a hand for the others to stop.</p><p>Ruger pulled up next to him.</p><p>Holy f**k.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Picnic said, his voice full of pride. \u201cGoddamn, did something right with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth our girls,\u201d Ruger muttered. He felt his chest unclenching, a ball of tension he hadn\u2019t even realized was there letting go. \u201cShit, didn\u2019t know she had it in her.\u201d</p><p>Em and Sophie sat on the front porch like two neighbors visiting over sweet tea, except Em held a gun trained steady on Skid. His mangled, bloody form lay in the dirt, arms stretched up behind him and wrapped around the porch pole.</p><p>\u201cThink she killed him?\u201d Ruger asked.</p><p>\u201cHope not,\u201d Picnic replied. \u201cBad enough already, without her having to live with that. Not to mention messy as f**k for us to clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth,\u201d Ruger replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dad, we\u2019re here for you!\u201d Picnic yelled down, waving at her. Em kept her eyes on Skid and her gun didn\u2019t waver.</p><p>\u201cGlad you came,\u201d she called back. \u201cI could really use some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe the only one?\u201d Pic asked.</p> <p>\u201cHunter left a couple hours ago,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt was only the two of them.\u201d</p><p>They rode slowly down the hill toward the house. Ruger studied Sophie carefully as he parked his bike, but he couldn\u2019t see any signs of serious harm. She looked exhausted, her eyes darkened with smudged makeup, but that was all. Em seemed worse off\u2014her face was pale and a bruise was starting to form on her cheek. White, bloodied strips of fabric had been tied around her leg.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, girls,\u201d Pic said shortly as he dismounted his ride. Ruger did the same, following him over to the man on the ground.</p><p>Skid was in rough shape. He wasn\u2019t moving, and Ruger saw trickles of blood seeping from his nose and mouth. More soaked the dirt, although he couldn\u2019t see where it was coming from. Ruger approached the man carefully, kneeling down to check his pulse.</p><p>Still alive. The beat was faint but steady.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>Picnic rolled Skid with a foot. Now they saw the wound\u2014he had a gaping gash on the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been bleeding, but not too bad,\u201d Em said. \u201cDon\u2019t know if he\u2019s passed out from a head injury or from shock. Sophie kicked his nuts to hell and back.\u201d</p><p>Ruger felt an instinctive shrinking in his own nether region and glanced up at Sophie. She gazed down at them, her face as smooth as a sphinx\u2019s.</p><p>Perfectly calm. Way too calm. Shock, Ruger figured.</p><p>Picnic stepped up to his daughter and held out his hand for the gun. She gave it to him, and he wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her in close.</p><p>Ruger looked to Sophie again and she turned away. Then he heard the crunch of footsteps in the driveway behind him.</p><p>\u201cHow we gonna play this?\u201d Bam Bam asked, eyeing Skid. Ruger glanced over at his president, wondering the same thing. Would they put the bastard in the ground or not?</p><p>\u201cNot in front of the girls,\u201d Picnic said, squeezing Em tight. \u201cRuger, you and Painter take them, get them safe. Call the medic. He can meet you at the clubhouse. We\u2019ll clean up here.\u201d</p><p>Em shook her head, growing tense.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do that, there\u2019s going to be even more fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about the club, Em,\u201d Picnic replied softly. She glanced down at Skid, then leaned up on her toes, whispering in her father\u2019s ear.</p><p>Picnic stiffened.</p><p>Em pulled away, eyes clearly pleading.</p><p>He shook his head at her and she crossed her arms, taking a step back. Interesting. Picnic narrowed his eyes, and the two stared at each other for long seconds. Then Picnic sighed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take him with us and dump him somewhere he\u2019ll be found,\u201d he said. \u201cSee if you can find something to bandage him up with, Bam.\u201d</p><p>Ruger looked down at Skid. Intellectually, he knew letting him live was probably a good idea. All other issues aside, Em and Sophie didn\u2019t need that kind of baggage.</p><p>He still wanted the f**ker dead, though.</p><p>They could always take him out later. If they did it right, the girls would never know.</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to feel as I rode home with Ruger, exhausted and drained from the adrenaline. We\u2019d separated from the rest of the club, which broke into different groups going different places. He\u2019d wanted me to get checked out by a friend of the club who was an EMT, but I insisted I was fine.</p><p>Which I was. Physically.</p><p>But now that it was over, I was so furious with Ruger that I wanted to scream and hit and kick his big, dumb ass for getting me into this shit. I also wanted him to hold me and make me feel safe again, which was ridiculous.</p><p>I\u2019d never be safe around him.</p><p>More than anything, though, I wanted to get back to Noah. I wanted to hold him tight and make sure we never, ever had to worry about something like this happening again. Different plans kept running through my head, including changing my name and moving to a different state entirely. But I had a good job now, one that might actually let us get ahead.</p><p>I just needed a wall between me and Ruger. I\u2019d draw the line\u2014him on his side and me on mine, with no crossover. If I did that, we\u2019d be fine.</p><p>But even angry with him, it felt right and safe to lean against his back as we drove, arms wrapped tight around his stomach. Every inch of Ruger was strong and solid. The leather of his cut lay under my cheek, broken by the embroidered fabric of his Reapers patches. His stomach was made of hard muscle that rippled under my fingers every time he leaned to take a curve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For now\u2014just for the next twenty minutes\u2014I\u2019d let myself touch him, savor his presence.</p><p>Then we\u2019d go our separate ways.</p><p>When we finally pulled around the back of Elle\u2019s barn to the little gravel parking area in front of my new apartment, I dropped my arms and let him go. I didn\u2019t let myself feel sad.</p><p>I tried not to let myself feel anything.</p> <p>He swung off the bike and took my hand, leading me over to the door, which was a good thing. I felt like I was trapped in a dream, everything distant and surreal.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I muttered, looking at the lock. \u201cI don\u2019t have my keys. They\u2019re in my purse, and I have no idea what happened to it, or my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might find your purse at the house,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cYour phone is gone. I\u2019ll get you a new one tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He let me go and turned back to his bike, digging through one of the saddlebags to pull out a small black leather pouch. When he came back and opened it, I saw a collection of strange little tools.</p><p>\u201cLock picks,\u201d he said shortly.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is just another part of your life?\u201d I asked, numb. \u201cYou just go around, ready and waiting to break into places?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at me and opened his mouth to speak. Something in my face must have caught his attention, because his expression softened.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I\u2019m a locksmith, used to be my job,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. \u201cLocksmith, gunsmith\u2014if it\u2019s made of metal and has tiny little parts, I like working with it. When I was a kid I built shit out of Legos; now I have big-boy toys. For a while I worked full-time doing lockout calls. Sometimes it\u2019s not about scary stuff, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I believed him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I murmured. The door clicked open and I walked in, looking around. Everything was just like I\u2019d left it the day before. Normal. All normal. It could almost have been a dream.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get cleaned up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Kimber and tell her to bring Noah home in an hour or so. I don\u2019t want him freaking out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he worried about me?\u201d I asked, walking over to get a drink of water. I considered offering him one, and then didn\u2019t, because f**k Ruger. The little surge of anger was good\u2014made me feel less numb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was,\u201d he replied. \u201cKimber\u2019s been with him the whole time, though. They\u2019ve been watching movies and shit. I talked to him for about five minutes this morning but I haven\u2019t seen him. I was focused on getting you back.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look at him, so big he seemed to fill my tiny living room.</p><p>\u201cSoph, we need to talk,\u201d he said slowly, looking almost nervous. \u201cI need you to tell me everything that happened. Did they ... hurt ... you?\u201d</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, they hurt me,\u201d I said, reaching up to touch my bruised cheek. \u201cThey threw me in a van, tied me up, and held me prisoner while threatening to kill me because of some bullshit with your club that I don\u2019t understand or care about. So yeah, that part kind of sucked. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they rape you?\u201d he asked bluntly. I shook my head. His face softened with relief, and he walked toward me. I held my hand up flat, halting him.</p><p>Limits. Time to set them.</p> <p>\u201cRuger, we\u2019ve been playing around, and it\u2019s over,\u201d I said, focusing my eyes on his chest. His 1% patch taunted me, reminding me exactly why this had to happen. \u201cI know I\u2019ve said that before, but everything\u2019s changed now. It doesn\u2019t matter how you make me feel or how nice you are. Your club is dangerous, and I don\u2019t want anything to do with any of you. Noah and I, we can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you might feel that way\u2014\u201d he started to say, but I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you really can\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t spend the night handcuffed to a bed, wondering if you\u2019d get raped or murdered. You didn\u2019t hear your friend screaming in the dark, or hear a gunshot when you tried to escape. We could have died, Ruger ... So here\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be from now on. I\u2019ll let you see Noah once a week. We\u2019ll make the plans in advance. You\u2019ll keep him away from your club and you won\u2019t talk to him about motorcycles. You won\u2019t wear your damned colors and you won\u2019t do anything that could ever lead to any kind of danger. You\u2019ll call me to make arrangements and you\u2019ll pick him up and drop him off when and where I tell you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened and his jaw clenched. I felt his anger and frustration in the air around me like a tangible thing, which was actually kind of funny because I didn\u2019t give a flying f**k what he thought of my plans.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll follow my rules,\u201d I continued. \u201cOr I\u2019ll never let Noah see you again. Believe me, I\u2019ll do it. In fact, I\u2019d like to do it right now, but I know how much he loves you and it would be devastating to him. So we\u2019ll try this out, and if it works, great. It doesn\u2019t work or I feel like he\u2019s in danger? You\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. He started toward me again. I stood my ground as he closed in, doing that domination thing, getting into my space. I stared up at him, his chest about three inches from my chin, and I didn\u2019t care how big and scary he was.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care about anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his mother. You have no rights. None. I let you see him because I\u2019m a nice person, and I can stop being nice at any time. Do not f**k with me, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and touched my face lightly, running his finger across my cheek. It sent shivers down my back, and just like that I wanted him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t f**k around,\u201d he said. \u201cJust so you know. I nearly lost you. I won\u2019t risk that again. I told you before I\u2019d never be a one-woman man, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I looked in his face, studying his eyes. He meant it. I thought about lying in bed with him ... I wanted to give in. I wanted him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d I said, and I meant it. \u201cI\u2019m done with you, and I\u2019m f**king serious. Get. Out. Of. My. House.\u201d</p><p>He held my gaze, then the miracle happened.</p><p>Ruger listened.</p><p>He backed away, turned, and walked out of the house. I heard his bike roar to life outside and then the sound of him riding away.</p><p>I\u2019d done it. I\u2019d finally managed to put Ruger in his place. Unfortunately, I was too tired to enjoy it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MONDAY</p><p>KIMBER: How u doing?</p><p>ME: Ok.

But please call if you need us ((hugs))</p><p>THURSDAY</p><p>DANCER: Hey. how goes it? Maybe we could let the kids play this afternoon?</p><p>ME: Um, we\u2019re pretty busy right now.</p><p>DANCER: Know how that goes ... Did you remember Maries bachelorette party? Its a week from Friday. We have a sitter, she offered to watch Noah too</p><p>ME: Not sure I\u2019ll maek it. I\u2019ll find my own sitter</p><p>DANCER: Okay. Don\u2019t hide out too long</p> <p>FRIDAY</p><p>KIMBER: This is bullshit. I get ur pissed at Ruger and Reapers but I\u2019m not one of them, u can\u2019t freeze me out. You guys come over tonight or I\u2019m sending Ryan to get u</p><p>ME: Noah and I are watching movies at home</p><p>KIMBER: No. Ur coming to my house. We\u2019re having a party. I need backup!!! NO Reapers. Nromal people. Kids too. U and Noah be here at six or I will come and get you. Not f**king around.</p><p>ME: Your a pushy bitch</p><p>KIMBER: Ya think? Get ur ass here or I\u2019ll come for u. No excuses. Bring swimsuits and a dessert</p><p>My brand-new iPhone said it was five fifty-six when we pulled up to Kimber\u2019s house. Ruger had dropped it off the previous Sunday, the day after my little adventure with Em. I wanted to tell him to go to hell, but I needed a phone, and I figured he could afford it better than I could. I didn\u2019t feel guilty about it, either. It was his fault I\u2019d gotten kidnapped in the first place, so I might as well blame him for drowning my phone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t let him into the house. Noah wanted to go to his house and I told him no. Then I shut the door in Ruger\u2019s face.</p><p>Now it was Friday night and I\u2019d caved to Kimber\u2019s ultimatum, because I knew she was serious when she said they\u2019d come and get me. I held a plate of brownies in one hand and a bag of swim gear in the other, and when Kimber\u2019s husband, Ryan, opened the door, I had to smile. He wore neon-green swim trunks and a purple Hawaiian-print shirt. On his head was an orange cowboy hat, and he held a Super Soaker in one hand.</p><p>Coming here had been a good idea, I realized.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the party,\u201d he said, smiling at me broadly.</p><p>\u201cNice look,\u201d I said, eyeing his outfit.</p><p>\u201cHey, it takes a very confident man to pull something like this off,\u201d he said without an ounce of shame.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose a bet?\u201d I asked, smirking.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he did,\u201d said another man, coming over to stand next to Ryan. He had longish, scruffy brown hair and a great smile, and the look in his eyes said he appreciated my appearance. He also held a Super Soaker, although he wore perfectly normal trunks and a T-shirt that said \u201cCode Monkey Like You.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d seen his picture before\u2014this was the guy Kimber had wanted to set me up with.</p><p>\u201cRyan and I had a little programming challenge at work, and I kicked his ass. Hi, I\u2019m Josh. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too,\u201d I said, glancing down at my full hands helplessly. \u201cUm, sorry, I\u2019d offer to shake your hand, but ...\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and then his eyes widened almost comically as he saw the brownies.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with those,\u201d he said, reaching out to grab the treats. \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Noah,\u201d my boy announced. \u201cDo you have any more of those Soakers, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a whole box out back,\u201d Ryan replied. \u201cYou want to come pick one out? We have a bunch of kids out there. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019d love to play with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d He looked up at me, eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I said, feeling almost carefree. Kimber was right. I had needed to get out, and coming to a nice, suburban party like this was just what I needed. No Reapers, no kidnappings, nothing bad at all.</p><p>I could do this.</p><p>Noah took off through the house, followed by Ryan. Josh looked down at me, offering a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, once we get this stuff settled, could I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cSo tell me, how long have you and Ryan worked together?\u201d</p><p>Three hours later I was feeling pretty good about life. Josh turned out to be a great guy, spending a good chunk of the night hanging out with me, but not so much that it felt weird. Ryan grilled burgers and hot dogs, the kids played in the pool, and Kimber\u2019s blender ran almost constantly, churning out margaritas in every imaginable flavor. I stuck with iced tea and laughed so hard I nearly cried when Ryan caught her and threw her into the pool.</p><p>The mob of kids kept growing, and I met so many people I couldn\u2019t begin to keep them all straight. Most were from Kimber\u2019s neighborhood or Ryan\u2019s work\u2014sleek, polished yoga moms and their slightly dorky husbands who worked as accountants and IT professionals. Nothing like the Reapers\u2019 party.</p><p>The first time I\u2019d met Ryan, I didn\u2019t understand him and Kimber together. He was so geeky and she was so wild and cool\u2014but they balanced each other out perfectly. I was holding Ava and sitting by the pool after eating when Josh came over and flopped into a chair next to me.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, grinning at me. \u201cI\u2019ve got a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou and Noah want to hit Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s for dinner tomorrow?\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the most romantic setting, but I\u2019ve got this theory about skee-ball that needs testing, and I figured he\u2019d be an excellent assistant.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s on a Saturday night is crazy. I bet you wouldn\u2019t last an hour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes brightened.</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re up to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too funny,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cFunny enough to get a date with you tomorrow?\u201d he said, offering a sly smile. \u201cI\u2019d go for the brooding, manly thing and try to be all mysterious, but I\u2019ve never really been able to pull it off.\u201d</p> <p>I sobered, thinking of Ruger. The two men couldn\u2019t have been more different, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not really looking for a boyfriend,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be honest\u2014you bring a seven-year-old on a date, you\u2019re probably not gonna get some at the end.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an evening,\u201d he said. \u201cNo big deal. Besides that, I\u2019ve got a deep, dark secret to share with you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward me, waving me in close. I shifted, balancing Ava as he spoke in my ear.</p> <p>\u201cI really do have an amazing skee-ball theory,\u201d he said, his voice grave and serious. \u201cIt needs experimentation. You\u2019d be doing me a huge favor.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing again, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cDoes that line actually work for you?\u201d I asked. He smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, does it?\u201d</p><p>I thought about Ruger, how he made me feel and compared it to this man. Josh didn\u2019t give me chills when I felt his breath against my ear, but he was nice to look at and seemed fun and friendly. And how much trouble could we get into on a date at a kiddie pizza place, anyway?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, feeling proud of myself. I\u2019d move past Ruger\u2014this was the perfect first step. \u201cThat would be fun. But just friendly. I\u2019m really not looking to get serious with anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he replied, grinning at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll just go and have some fun\u2014and Ryan can vouch for me. I\u2019m not an undercover supervillian, no dark secrets, nothing. What you see is what you get.\u201d</p><p>I started to reply, but a thick stream of water suddenly hit the side of my head, drenching me as Ava shrieked. I look up to see Noah running away with a small pack of boys, screeching in triumph. Little shit ...</p><p>\u201cI need to go dry off,\u201d I told Josh.</p><p>\u201cWant me to go defend your honor?\u201d he asked, holding up his Soaker.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do that.\u201d</p><p>He stood and saluted me, eyes dancing with laughter, then tore off after the mob of children shooting each other and running around the grass.</p><p>I found Ryan by the grill. He held a beer in one hand and a pair of tongs in the other, and as he shifted them to take Ava, he smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Josh\u2019s a real good guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve known him a couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, he seems nice,\u201d I replied awkwardly. Ryan laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014no pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wanted to let you know he\u2019s not a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks for having me over. Thanks for everything, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cKimber thinks you\u2019re the shit. You know, it\u2019s not that easy for her to find friends, despite what you\u2019d think. You\u2019re special to her.\u201d</p><p>That startled me.</p><p>\u201cKimber\u2019s always had more friends than anyone,\u201d I said, laughing.</p><p>His face sobered and he shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s always got more people at her parties than anyone. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. Ryan shrugged, and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cGo get dried off,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got sparklers for the kids once it\u2019s totally dark. I\u2019ll need help, and Kimber\u2019s useless after three margaritas.\u201d</p><p>I smiled hesitantly and walked inside. Off to the left was a family room, with the kitchen and a breakfast bar off to the right. My sandal caught on the doorway, pulling the strap loose, so I dropped down to fix it just inside the entry.</p><p>\u201cJesus, did you see what Ryan\u2019s wearing?\u201d I heard a woman say in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said another. \u201cAnd Kimber\u2019s not much better. Could that bikini be smaller? You know she\u2019s a giant slut, right? She used to be a stripper. I just hope they leave before Ava hits school. I don\u2019t want Kaitlyn in her class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. That\u2019s why I moved to this neighborhood\u2014I wanted all our neighbors to be normal, not trashy. And her friend ... God, she must\u2019ve been, what, ten years old when she had her kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her skanking all over Josh. Disgusting.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzed, and I pulled it out of my pocket to find a text from Marie.</p><p>Hey. I know things are weird, but I really hope you\u2019ll come to my bachelorette party next weekend. We\u2019re all hanging out tonight and thinking about how much more fun it would be with you here! xoxo</p><p>\u201cSo, my pedicure girl moved to a new salon. All Vietnamese, and I hate how they talk to each other without speaking in English. So rude!\u201d said the woman in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sooo right. I never leave a tip when they do that. They should be speaking English if they\u2019re going to live here ...\u201d</p><p>I stood up and walked through the kitchen, piercing each of the women in turn with a sweet smile. Bitches. How dare they gossip about Kimber, in her own house? I couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d get drunk on her booze while ripping her apart like that.</p><p>At least nobody was whipping out knives.</p><p>Not metal ones, anyway.</p><p>I wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, bud,\u201d Josh said, watching intensely as Noah lined up his shot at the skee-ball machine. I had to laugh. Josh had been joking about his theory ... mostly. The man really did love the game. It turned out Noah loved it, too, so things had worked out pretty well.</p><p>We\u2019d been at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s for nearly three hours, and I\u2019d had a blast. Josh was easy to be around. He didn\u2019t stress me out and he didn\u2019t scare me. We\u2019d eaten dinner, and to give him credit, he ate the nasty pizza they served without a single snide comment (not even I could pull that off). Then he bought Noah more tokens than he\u2019d ever seen before and we\u2019d hit the games.</p><p>Now it was almost nine and I knew we needed to get Noah out soon or things could get ugly. I touched Josh\u2019s arm, catching his attention. He turned and grinned at me, looking like a big, happy puppy.</p><p>\u201cWe need to head home,\u201d I said, nodding toward my son. \u201cHe\u2019s tired. Don\u2019t want to push him too hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Josh replied. He put an arm around my shoulders and pulled me close, giving me a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good kid there.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, because I knew he was right. Also because I liked his arm around my shoulder. Josh didn\u2019t make my heart explode like Ruger did, but he had a good sense of humor and was fun to be around. That had to count for something.</p><p>We fed all of the tickets we\u2019d won (and it seemed like thousands of them) into the chomping machines, which caused Noah intense delight. Then we spent another twenty minutes at the prize counter as he agonized over which tiny plastic rings or erasers to pick.</p><p>The sun had set when we finally walked outside. The pizza place was in one of those strip malls with free-standing restaurants in the parking lot. I looked over at the steak house longingly, still a little hungry\u2014I\u2019d only managed to choke down half a slice. Josh bumped my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe next time we can get a grown-up meal,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that your way of asking me out again?\u201d I asked, coming to a stop next to my car. Noah bounced around next to me happily, playing with his new treasures. I looked up at Josh and smiled. He smiled back, and I was struck by how cute he was. Geeky cute, like Ryan.</p><p>I could do a lot worse.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what the answer would be,\u201d he replied, reaching up to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cI hate getting shot down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d get shot down,\u201d I said. He leaned forward and kissed me lightly on the lips. It was nice\u2014not hot and intense, but pleasant.</p> <p>\u201cUncle Ruger!\u201d Noah yelled, and I felt him take off running. I pulled away from Ryan instantly, my mommy radar fully engaged. I bolted after him, shouting his name and yelling at him to stop. He ignored me, jumping into Ruger\u2019s arms where he stood on the sidewalk outside the steak house.</p><p>Several other guys from the club were with him.</p><p>\u201cNoah, you can\u2019t run off like that!\u201d I said, catching Noah\u2019s chin so his eyes had to meet mine. \u201cYou could get killed. You know better\u2014you\u2019re a big boy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said instantly. \u201cI forgot. I got excited. I wanted to show Uncle Ruger my prizes.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I\u2019d been so worried about Noah, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about Ruger. I looked up to find him staring across the lot.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d he asked, jerking his chin toward Josh, who gave us a halfhearted wave.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Josh,\u201d I said defiantly. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of Kimber\u2019s husband. They work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took us to Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s and we played tons of games and I got all kinds of prizes but I didn\u2019t have enough tickets to get what I really wanted so he said maybe we could come back another time and I said yes,\u201d Noah told him breathlessly. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty cool, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s eyes hardened, and he set Noah down.</p><p>\u201cStay here, kid,\u201d he said. Then he stepped out across the parking lot, obviously planning to intercept Josh. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d I said to Noah, then glanced up at Bam Bam. \u201cWill you make sure he doesn\u2019t run off?\u201d</p><p>Dancer\u2019s husband gave a quick nod, but his eyes weren\u2019t exactly friendly.</p><p>Great.</p><p>I scurried off toward Ruger and Josh.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, looking between them. Ruger\u2019s face was like stone, his eyes glinting with possessive menace. Josh looked confused and a little uncertain. \u201cJosh, this is Noah\u2019s uncle, Ruger. Ruger, this is my friend Josh. We were just leaving. Sorry about Noah bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah never bothers me,\u201d Ruger said, cocking his head at Josh, who tried to offer him a smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid,\u201d Josh said. \u201cYou must be proud of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Ruger said to him. \u201cYou need to go now. Probably be best if you don\u2019t call Sophie again.\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cGo f**k yourself, Ruger,\u201d I snapped. Josh glanced over at me, looking nervous. \u201cJosh, please ignore him. He\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Ruger said pointedly. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be leaving. You\u2019re not welcome here. Don\u2019t know what Sophie\u2019s told you, but she\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I said quickly. Josh looked between us, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cYou need a hand, Ruger?\u201d Horse called from the sidewalk. He offered Josh a wolfish smile.</p><p>\u201cNot with this ass**le,\u201d Ruger replied, holding Josh\u2019s eyes steadily. Josh broke, looking away.</p><p>\u201cUm, I gotta get going,\u201d he said, offering me a quick, sheepish smile. Then he turned and walked away very quickly.</p><p>I stared, dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your new boyfriend scares easy,\u201d Ruger murmured. \u201cDidn\u2019t even make sure you were safe with me. Wouldn\u2019t want a man like that at my back. Of course, I don\u2019t need to worry about backup. My brothers are there for me, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>He took my shoulders and turned me toward the steak house. I saw Horse, Bam Bam, Duck, and Slide standing around my son. Bam held Noah\u2019s shoulder protectively. Ruger leaned down behind me, speaking softly in my ear as his fingers squeezed my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know them, so you know Noah couldn\u2019t be safer. But your buddy Josh? He knows shit about those guys. That didn\u2019t stop him from walking away to cover his own ass while they had your son. Hell of a man you\u2019ve found.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, because I knew he was right.</p><p>So Josh wouldn\u2019t be getting a second date if he bothered to call. Probably a moot point, because I had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay out of my life,\u201d I told Ruger, watching Noah carefully show off his prizes, offering Horse one of his precious rings. Horse accepted it, sliding it a quarter of the way down his pinkie.</p><p>Noah glowed with pride.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get right on that,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cDon\u2019t take Noah out with a guy like that again. You\u2019ll send him the wrong message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll always be my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to win every single time,\u201d I told him seriously. \u201cJust because you say something, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust \u2019cause I say it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m wrong, either.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, then marched over and collected Noah, trying not to grit my teeth. I took him home and put him to bed, feeling bitchy the entire time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I fell asleep that night, it wasn\u2019t Josh I was dreaming of.

Stalk much?!?!???</p> <p>ME: No it wasn\u2019t like that. He was having dinner with the guys we ran into him in the parking lot. He had a little bullshit talk with Josh then Josh ran off. I realize he doesn\u2019t know us very well but he didnt even make sure Noah and I were safe when he left. Epic fail all around</p><p>KIMBER: Pisser. Josh loses margarita privileges. Hate wimps</p><p>ME: Meh ...</p><p>KIMBER: So u talk to Ruger at all?</p><p>ME: Nope. Fuck him</p><p>KIMBER: Gotcha. Hey u going to the bachelorette party?

We\u2019d love to have you there.</p><p>ME: Okay. Dont want to stay out too late tho. I have work on Friday</p><p>DANCER: No prob. Even a few hours would be great for Marie. Kimber, too?

I\u2019ll see if Elle can watch Noah</p><p>DANCER: You can share our sitter if you need to</p><p>ME: Rather have him closer to home. More likely to sleep.

Sucks, Ryan has to work tomorrow. Hangover and baby don\u2019t mix!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>ME: You don\u2019t have to drink, you know.</p><p>KIMBER: Shut the f**k up.

Spa or something</p><p>KIMBER: Jealous. We should do that</p><p>ME: Right after I win the lottery</p><p>KIMBER: Hmmm ... ur gonna have to start buying tickets</p><p>ME: Why don\u2019t you buy for both of us?</p><p>KIMBER: So long as I get to drink for both of us, I\u2019m down with that! SMOOCHES</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Marie screamed, spinning around. \u201cI lost my veil!\u201d</p><p>She stood up in the limo\u2019s open sunroof. It was just after midnight, and we\u2019d decided to cruise down along the Coeur d\u2019Alene lake before hitting our final destination, a karaoke bar.</p><p>About an hour ago, Marie had declared she wanted\u2014no, needed\u2014to sing \u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d before the night ended. It\u2019d been playing when she and Horse met, and apparently the world would end if we didn\u2019t sing it again tonight.</p><p>We knew this because she\u2019d been very clear: The existence of the world literally depended on successful completion of this karaoke mission.</p><p>As one of the most sober women in the limo, I\u2019d been assigned to make sure we didn\u2019t get distracted and forget. Seeing as I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sober, I\u2019d carefully written this on my inner arm with a pen as a reminder.</p><p>Now I stood next to her, watching in horror as the little white scrap of tulle she wore on her head flew through the air toward Painter, who followed us on his bike. Holy shit. Would it make him crash?</p><p>Apparently a drifting veil wasn\u2019t a serious road hazard to a bike going twenty-five miles an hour, because he avoided it easily enough. The prospect following him\u2014one I\u2019d seen at the Armory party but hadn\u2019t met\u2014pulled off to go fetch it.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good service,\u201d I told Marie. She started giggling, and then she fell down into the limo, officially drunk off her ass.</p><p>I popped back down, too.</p><p>Dancer lay back across one of the seats, laughing so hard she was crying. Maggs had her shirt up, flashing her boobs while Kimber took a picture. Wasn\u2019t sure I wanted the whole story on that one. A woman I\u2019d just met named Darcy was pouring champagne in that very slow, very deliberate way drunk people have. Unfortunately she\u2019d forgotten the glass.</p><p>I hoped whoever arranged the rental had coverage for that kind of thing.</p><p>A woman with short, curly, reddish-blonde hair sat giggling in the corner. Back when she could still speak in full sentences, Marie had introduced her as Cookie. She used to live in Coeur d\u2019Alene but had moved, and now Marie managed the coffee shop she still owned in town.</p><p>Em and I looked at each other and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>I\u2019d decided not to drink too much because I had work in the morning, but I was still in a pretty good mood. Definitely planning on a cab ride home. Em, though ... She had a haunted look in her eyes that bothered me. No wonder the girls had been worried about her\u2014something was obviously wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t they just go home?\u201d I asked Em, scooting over to sit next to her.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainter and the other guy, Banks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanks will stick with us all night,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to keep an eye on us, make sure we make it home safe. I guess Painter\u2019s just along for the ride\u2014maybe he\u2019s worried after what went down with Hunter and Skid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was watching you while you were dancing,\u201d I said. \u201cHe may not have seemed interested before, but he\u2019s definitely interested now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give a f**k,\u201d she replied, her voice flat. \u201cPainter, Hunter ... men in general. I think I\u2019m swearing off them entirely. Too bad I can\u2019t just flip a switch and go lesbian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPretty sure it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cMen really are a giant pain in the ass, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of, how\u2019s Ruger?\u201d she asked. \u201cI hear you\u2019re fighting with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, that seems a bit strong,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re just not talking much, which is what I wanted. No offense, but after what happened, I don\u2019t think I want anything to do with the club.\u201d</p><p>She sighed.</p> <p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou didn\u2019t exactly get a good intro. I know it probably doesn\u2019t seem this way, but they\u2019re actually really good guys. It\u2019s not like this shit happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>The car swayed, and Dancer crashed into us.</p><p>\u201cYou are boring!\u201d she yelled in our faces. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time here. If you don\u2019t sing me something good at the bar, I\u2019m making you ride with Painter.\u201d</p><p>Um, no. I would rather have my eyes poked out than do karaoke.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say that, though. I just smiled politely and decided this was a sign\u2014I\u2019d call a cab after Marie sang her song. I had to be up in six hours, so that was probably for the best anyway. At least I didn\u2019t have to worry about Noah\u2014Elle had taken him, offering to keep him overnight and get him ready for school the next day. That was a huge help.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Maggs squealed suddenly. We all froze. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done presents yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresents!\u201d Marie yelled, clapping her hands. \u201cI love presents!\u201d</p><p>Maggs lurched down to the front of the limo and pulled back a big basket full of unopened packages and envelopes. She grabbed one at random, throwing it to Marie.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d Darcy asked. Marie tried to focus on the writing, then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have really, really messy handwriting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me look.\u201d</p> <p>She handed it over.</p><p>\u201cThe tag was printed off a computer,\u201d I said, snorting. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a fancy script or something. You\u2019re too drunk to read. Oh, and it\u2019s from Cookie.\u201d</p><p>Marie pouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you guys bought all those shots,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could let them go to waste! That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded sagely.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right\u2014if you throw away booze at your bachelorette party, the marriage is doomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that about everything,\u201d I accused. \u201cThe marriage is doomed if she doesn\u2019t order the steak and the shrimp. The marriage is doomed if she doesn\u2019t dance with at least ten guys. The marriage is doomed if she doesn\u2019t tell us how big Horse\u2019s dick really is. How can all of that be true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know these things,\u201d she declared. \u201cAm I right, ladies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d Dancer chimed in. \u201cDarcy knows her shit. If she says the marriage is doomed if Marie doesn\u2019t drink enough, it\u2019s time to start pouring shots down her throat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now it\u2019s time to open presents!\u201d Maggs yelled. \u201cLadies, we need to focus. The marriage is doomed if she doesn\u2019t get these open before we hit the karaoke bar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Marie said, her eyes opening wide in panic. She ripped into the bag, peeked down inside, and started giggling madly. Then she pulled out a giant double-headed jelly dildo in swirling colors.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cookie,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful! How did you know?\u201d</p><p>We all burst out laughing, and Maggs grabbed another present. This one was from Darcy, and I shit you not, it was a giant, strap-on cock.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so you can put Horse in his place,\u201d she told Marie. \u201cThat man\u2019s ego needs controlling, and that\u2019s a great tool to do it with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d Marie whispered. \u201cOh, I cannot wait to try this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019d actually let you use it on him?\u201d I asked. She started giggling.</p><p>\u201cI think just the sight of it will make his head explode,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about creating the right kind of romantic mood, you know?\u201d</p><p>Em got her a beautifully illustrated Kama Sutra, Dancer got her a thong that said \u201cSupport Your Local Reapers MC\u201d on it (along with a little Reaper\u2019s skull), I got her sensual massage oils, and Kimber got her some sort of electronic thing that we all just looked at, trying to figure out what the hell it was.</p><p>\u201cRead the instructions,\u201d Kimber said. \u201cTrust me, you turn this baby on, you\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d</p><p>Marie tilted it, obviously confused, and I tried to figure out where it would even fit on a person\u2019s body.</p><p>I really, really wanted a look at those directions, but when we looked for them, nobody could find them in the piles of tissue paper cluttering the limo.</p><p>We pulled up to the karaoke bar right as she finished. It was quarter to one, which gave us about an hour before last call. Because the marriage would be doomed if she didn\u2019t have more shots, Marie had more shots. Then she got up and sang her Def Leppard song and we all joined her for the chorus.</p><p>Maggs took over the mike to sing \u201cWhite Wedding,\u201d and then Marie realized the marriage was definitely doomed if she didn\u2019t text Horse a picture of her modeling her new panties, so we all tripped back out to the limo.</p><p>That\u2019s when I decided to call it a night\u2014it was my understanding that when the bar closed, they\u2019d all be heading back to the Armory to join up with the guys. The girls didn\u2019t want me to leave, but seeing Ruger wasn\u2019t exactly one of my goals for the evening. Ten minutes later the cab pulled up and I gave him my address. I guess I\u2019d had more to drink than I realized, because the next thing I knew, we\u2019d pulled into Elle\u2019s driveway.</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d the driver said. \u201cThis where I drop you?\u201d</p><p>I looked around, trying to clear my head. I wasn\u2019t drunk, but I wasn\u2019t totally sober, either.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cJust pull around the house, okay?\u201d</p><p>He did, and I fumbled in my purse for money. I gave it to him and stepped out, digging for the keys. I\u2019d forgotten to turn on the outside light, which didn\u2019t help. Or maybe it was just burned out ... I usually left it on all the time.</p><p>The driver must\u2019ve been a nice guy, because he waited until I got the front door open before he pulled away. Too bad he hadn\u2019t waited a minute longer\u2014when I flipped on the light I nearly had a heart attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zach sat in the center of the couch.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you got back,\u201d he said pleasantly, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re drunk? Some mother you\u2019ve turned out to be, Sophie. You\u2019re nothing but a f**king slut, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Seeing him hit me like a physical blow.</p><p>I mean that\u2014if someone had punched me in the stomach, it couldn\u2019t have hurt worse. I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I had to grab the wall to stay upright. That\u2019s the thing that nobody tells you as a girl, when they warn you about guys like Zach. You hear about women getting \u201cabused,\u201d but that\u2019s such a sterile word for what Zach did to me. He didn\u2019t \u201cabuse\u201d me. He hurt me, owned me, trained me ...</p><p>Broke me.</p><p>It\u2019s like hitting a dog with a rolled-up newspaper. You do it enough times, the dog will cringe whenever it sees the roll. Obedience becomes instinct, and in that second I felt it all come back to me.</p><p>Zach\u2019s bitch. That\u2019s all I was.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d I said feebly, wondering how just seeing him could make me feel so weak. \u201cThe restraining order says you can\u2019t be here. You\u2019re supposed to be hundreds of miles away. How did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked the lock, you stupid cunt,\u201d he replied. \u201cRuger taught me when we were kids. That and how to hotwire a car. Only f**kin\u2019 thing he ever did for me ...\u201d</p><p>He stood and walked over to me, a nasty gleam in his eye. He\u2019d gotten bigger, I realized. Not taller, of course, and not fat, either. Zach must\u2019ve started lifting weights, because those were some serious muscles. Steroid-sized muscles. He flexed them as he walked toward me, grinning as he read the fear in my face. He\u2019d always had little-man syndrome.</p><p>My brain screamed at me to run, but my body wouldn\u2019t obey. I was strong during the kidnapping. I\u2019d run from Skid, but then I turned around and fought him.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I do that now?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. My body wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Instead I just watched Zach, terrified, as he came up and cupped my face in his hands, fingers holding me just a little too tight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d he said, licking his lips. He leaned forward and kissed me. Not a nice kiss\u2014no, this one was meant to punish. I locked my jaw and kept my lips closed until he reached up and grabbed my hair, pulling it back sharply. \u201cOpen your f**king mouth, bitch.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed, because I knew pulling hair was the least of what he could do. He kissed me for an eternity, tongue stabbing into mine painfully. His mouth tasted stale and nasty, like he hadn\u2019t brushed his teeth in a year. I couldn\u2019t get any air and tears built up in my eyes.</p><p>Finally, he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cCunt still sweet as that mouth?\u201d he asked. I didn\u2019t respond and he yanked my hair again. \u201cAnswer me, bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whimpered. I should try to knee him. I should fight or kick or bite or something, but seeing Zach made me feel like a helpless little girl. He knew it, too. I could tell by the gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Zach was a bully. How I hadn\u2019t recognized it from the start I\u2019ll never know, but I could sure as shit see it now.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re f**king Ruger again,\u201d Zach whispered, face turning ugly. \u201cI hear you\u2019re sucking his c**k all over town, and that you\u2019re f**king his whole club, too. Is that true, slut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not true?\u201d he asked, mouth twisting into a smile. \u201cNot true you\u2019re f**king Ruger, or not true that you\u2019re f**king his club? Because they don\u2019t just steal a man\u2019s inheritance for shits and giggles, babe. They don\u2019t do anything for free. You gotta tell me just how big a whore you are. Otherwise I won\u2019t know how much punishment you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not f**king anyone,\u201d I said. Zach burst out laughing. Seriously laughing, so hard he actually let me go and used the heel of one hand to press against his eyes, wiping away the tears.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d he said when he finally stopped. \u201cWho are you f**king? You belong to me, bitch. If you don\u2019t tell me the truth, I\u2019ll start breaking fingers.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and caught my hand between his, gripping my right index finger, bending it sharply backward.</p><p>I panicked, wishing I could get myself to think. My mind was numb, old survival instincts taking over.</p><p>Get it over with.</p><p>Do what he says.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019ll show mercy if you\u2019re a good girl ...</p><p>\u201cI had sex with Ruger,\u201d I said quickly. Then I closed my eyes, bracing for whatever might happen next. There\u2019s no preparing for something like that, though. Not really. I waited for my bone to snap, so it came as a complete surprise when he punched me in the stomach instead. I doubled over, gasping for breath. Holy shit that hurt.</p><p>Zach burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too f**kin\u2019 easy.\u201d</p><p>Silly of me, I realized, clutching my stomach and praying he\u2019d stop at just one hit. Zach never did what I expected him to do. You couldn\u2019t plan, couldn\u2019t get ready, nothing like that. He was like a tornado\u2014suddenly there, spewing evil without warning.</p><p>Zach\u2019s laughter died.</p><p>\u201cHell of long drive to get here. I\u2019m tired and hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re gonna make me something to eat. Then we\u2019ll talk some more about who you\u2019re sleeping with. Don\u2019t want to leave out any juicy details, do we?\u201d</p><p>I dug through the fridge, trying to figure out what to cook him. My stomach ached, although I didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d broken any ribs. Yet. We didn\u2019t have a lot of food, but I could fix some eggs and toast. Zach had always loved breakfast for dinner.</p><p>\u201cIt was f**king stupid of you to come back to Coeur d\u2019Alene,\u201d Zach said conversationally. He sat at the small table between the living room and kitchen, watching me and picking at his fingernails. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just keep your legs shut, could you? I\u2019ll never let him have you. Never. Thought I\u2019d made that clear?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. No matter what I said, it would set him off. I remembered that much from before. Zach had always liked lecturing me during punishments, and if I didn\u2019t listen, the punishment got much, much worse. I just had to hunker down and push through. Sooner or later he\u2019d get tired or bored and then it would stop.</p><p>At least for a while.</p><p>I\u2019d never be truly free from him, though. I\u2019d thought I could change my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you a thousand times about Ruger, but you still don\u2019t listen,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou never get it through your head, do you? I guess sluts like you can\u2019t control themselves ... You need to be trained, like dogs. Bitches. Do you want me to train you?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, then let it out, closing my eyes tight. I knew what the next step was. Our little dance was well-choreographed.</p><p>\u201cYes, Zach,\u201d I whispered, feeling my soul tuck down deep inside, hiding from what was coming. If I drew far enough away from reality, it wouldn\u2019t hurt as bad when he started really hitting me. \u201cI want you to train me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he murmured, sounding almost human.</p><p>I knelt down and opened the drawer under the oven, looking for something to cook the eggs in. I had a small, non-stick frying pan I usually used. There was also a large, cast-iron skillet that I\u2019d found when I moved into the apartment.</p><p>I\u2019d never cooked with it\u2014cast iron always seemed sort of strange and scary to me.</p><p>Huh.</p><p>Why should I be afraid of using a f**king pan? Because it was different than what I was used to? But changing how you do anything is difficult.</p> <p>I could do it, though.</p><p>I could use that pan.</p><p>Almost in a dream, I reached down and picked up the skillet. How hard would it be ...? Harder than a man\u2019s fists against your flesh? Harder than cracked ribs, blackened eyes\u2014your baby screaming for an hour because Mommy can\u2019t get off the floor to pick him up?</p><p>Changing how you react to a man hurting you is hard.</p><p>But it can be done.</p><p>The pan was heavy. Really heavy. My arms were strong, though. I\u2019d been carrying Noah for years\u2014this was nothing in comparison. I stood up and set the skillet on the stove, reaching over and turning on the burner.</p> <p>\u201cI think we need to get something clear,\u201d Zach said. He leaned back in his chair, grinning at me, all pleased with himself. Only seconds had passed as I found the skillet, but everything had changed. I felt my soul uncurling from its hiding place.</p><p>\u201cYou sent me to jail,\u201d Zach continued. \u201cThat was a very, very bad thing to do. I\u2019ll admit it threw me for a while. I let you get away with it. Then you stole my money, and that\u2019s more than a man can take. You try to fight me, I\u2019ll kill you. In fact, I won\u2019t just kill you, I\u2019ll kill Noah. Never did like that little shit.\u201d</p><p>Another gut punch. He hadn\u2019t used his fists this time. He didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>I looked down at the slowly heating skillet.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just make him disappear,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust take his little ass and dump him somewhere. You\u2019ll never find him again, always wonder if he\u2019s dead or alive. Maybe if you\u2019re really good, I\u2019ll tell you where the body is for his eighteenth birthday ...\u201d</p><p>I turned to grab eggs out of the fridge, glancing toward Zach. He was looking down at one of his hands, forming a fist over and over, flexing the muscles in his arm. I set the egg carton on the counter. Then I reached for a bowl to mix them in\u2014he liked them scrambled, a mixture of full eggs and egg whites for extra protein. I started cracking them, the hard white shells looking like little skulls.</p><p>They broke open so easily.</p><p>I flicked another glance at him. He was still gazing down at his fingers, flexing and fisting.</p> <p>Getting ready to hit me again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna f**k you in the ass, I think,\u201d he said casually. \u201cMake you beg for it. I\u2019ve missed that about you, the way you beg.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened, but I didn\u2019t let myself react to his words. I just picked up a towel and wrapped it around the hot pan\u2019s metal handle. Then I took a deep breath and thought of Noah, of what his little face would look like after Zach finished with him. Nope. Not gonna happen.</p><p>You can do this, I told myself, and I knew I was right. I could.</p><p>I lifted the pan, took three steps toward Zach and raised it high, bringing it down on his head with all my strength.</p><p>He never saw it coming.</p><p>Then I hit him a second time, just to be sure. And a third.</p><p>The smell of scorched meat filled the kitchen.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>RUGER</p><p>He felt his phone vibrate, and he seriously considered just ignoring it.</p><p>It was nearly three thirty in the morning, and the girls had arrived at the Armory an hour ago. He\u2019d never seen Marie so drunk. She wore a little white veil on her head and a white sash that said \u201cBride\u201d across her chest, and she was carrying around some weird electronic vibrating thing like a trophy. Maggs said it was a sex toy, but damned if Ruger could figure out what it was for.</p><p>Horse was drunk, too, although not as bad as Marie. He\u2019d carried his bride-to-be off not long after she arrived. They were upstairs now. That was the last they\u2019d seen of them, although Dancer was trying to convince the girls that they needed to go and rescue Marie. That kept setting them off cackling like a bunch of damned witches.</p><p>Ruger pulled out his phone and saw Sophie\u2019s name. Fuck. Now what? He was trying to give her space, but it was f**king hard to pretend everything was fine while he waited. He missed her. The Jacks had taken her away from him for less than a day, but those hours had nearly killed him.</p><p>He needed her back. He needed her back now. Wasn\u2019t sure how much more of this he could take.</p><p>\u201cHey, Soph,\u201d he said, stepping out the door into the night air. It was almost October, but it was still warm out. A perfect Indian summer night.</p><p>\u201cRuger,\u201d she said, and her voice sounded strange. \u201cUm, I have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can tell you over the phone. Would\u2014do you think you could come over? I mean, I know you\u2019re at the party ... are you safe to drive, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Double f**k. Something was really wrong. Her voice all but screamed it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good to drive,\u201d he said, and thankfully he was. Hadn\u2019t been in the mood to drink\u2014too many thoughts running through his head. He heard her breath catch. \u201cShould I bring anyone with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, we should probably be discreet,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m in some trouble here, Ruger. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s not really the worst of it ... Ruger, I\u2019ve done something bad. I think you should come over right now. I need you to tell me what to do. I know I keep asking you to stay out of my life, but I was wrong about that. I can\u2019t do this on my own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, babe. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up to her place twenty minutes later. She sat outside on the little stoop, arms wrapped tight around her knees. She looked impossibly brittle, like she\u2019d explode into a thousand pieces if he touched her. Little red dots spotted her face.</p><p>Blood spatter. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Soph?\u201d Ruger asked, crouching down. She looked at him with blank eyes. \u201cDid you fall down or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cZach punched my stomach and threatened to kill Noah, so I killed him instead.\u201d</p><p>Ruger froze.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he asked carefully, wondering if he\u2019d hallucinated what she\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cZach punched my stomach and threatened to kill Noah, so I killed him,\u201d she repeated, meeting his gaze. \u201cHe was mad at me because he\u2019d heard I was sleeping with you. He\u2019s always been crazy jealous, you know that. I don\u2019t know what set him off, but he must\u2019ve been spying on me somehow, because he knew exactly how to find me. He was inside the apartment, waiting, when I got home from the karaoke bar. He kissed me, and then he started asking questions and punched me. He said he was going to kill Noah and I knew he meant it, so I hit him over the head with a cast-iron skillet until he died.\u201d</p><p>Ruger swallowed. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for Zach, but this was one hell of a clusterfuck.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cI kept hitting him, just to make sure,\u201d she replied, far too calmly. \u201cI checked his pulse. He\u2019s definitely dead. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll tell me what to do next. I finally did my own dirty work, Ruger, but I don\u2019t know how to finish it.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. He shouldn\u2019t have left her alone. Should\u2019ve come to check on her when she didn\u2019t show up with the rest of the girls ... Fuck giving her space.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpending the night with Elle,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cShe\u2019ll get him ready for school in the morning. I\u2019ll pick him up and take him on the way to work.\u201d</p> <p>Well, that was something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go inside, check things out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll just stay out here, I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d he told her, reaching out and cupping her cheek. She leaned her head into his touch, eyes starting to water. Then he stood up and stepped past her, opening the door.</p><p>Fuck. Double f**k ...</p><p>Zach was on the floor, his hair matted with blood. A pool of it surrounded him. A horrible stench filled the air, a mixture of burned meat and scorched hair.</p><p>The pan lay next to Zach\u2019s corpse, more blood crusting the sides. It\u2019d splattered behind him, too. That would take some serious cleaning. New linoleum for sure, and they might even need to replace the floorboards underneath, he mused.</p><p>Ruger checked Zach\u2019s pulse just to be sure, but Sophie was right. His stepbrother was definitely dead. This was a mess, a big mess, and cleaning it up wouldn\u2019t be pretty.</p> <p>He was proud of her, though.</p><p>She\u2019d defended herself when it counted, and ultimately this was Ruger\u2019s fault. He should\u2019ve killed Zach four years ago. Then he should have killed him when he\u2019d collected the child support. Fucking weak of him.</p><p>He\u2019d held off because of Noah.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want to kill the boy\u2019s father. Didn\u2019t want to do that to his own mother, either. She\u2019d loved Zach, for reasons Ruger had never understood. So he\u2019d given Zach another pass, leaving his woman to finish the job.</p><p>Fucking idiot.</p><p>Ruger pulled out his phone and dialed Pic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ruger,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m out at Soph\u2019s place. Could use some help here, it\u2019s delicate. Anyone up for it? Probably gonna need a van ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow delicate?\u201d Picnic asked. He hadn\u2019t been drinking much, either, thank f**k. Neither of them had quite relaxed since the kidnapping, and that vigilance might save Sophie\u2019s ass now.</p><p>\u201cAbout as delicate as it gets,\u201d Ruger said slowly. \u201cWe should talk in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Pic replied, hanging up. Ruger went back outside and found Sophie still sitting on the porch. He sat down behind her, wrapping his arms around her body, legs surrounding hers as he pulled her close. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Soph,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling her neck. She leaned back into him and he realized she was crying softly, tears rolling down her face.</p><p>Good. Crying was better than that creepy calm she\u2019d had earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Ruger,\u201d she told him. \u201cI keep calling you in to fix things, always making you do the hard stuff. First Miranda, now this. I should\u2019ve called the cops ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo f**king way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a mess we don\u2019t need. You might get off on self-defense, you might not. Not after you kept hitting him. He was just sitting when you attacked, right? He wasn\u2019t about to hit you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Sophie replied. \u201cHe was looking at his hands and I was supposed to be cooking eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what you had to do,\u201d Ruger said, hoping she believed him. \u201cHe chose this\u2014he threatened your son, Soph. You had to protect him. That\u2019s what mothers do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe said he\u2019d kill all of us and I knew he meant it. The restraining order didn\u2019t do shit. Going to jail only stopped him for a while ... What if he hurt Noah next time? I wasn\u2019t willing to take that chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll clean this up for you,\u201d he replied, resting his cheek on her head. God, he loved how she smelled, although for once his dick had the grace to stay down. \u201cHopefully nobody knew he was coming here. He\u2019ll just disappear. If the cops ever come looking, we\u2019ll say I did it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d she tried to protest, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning on it,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cTrust me, prison isn\u2019t on my bucket list. We play things right, it won\u2019t be an issue. He wasn\u2019t here, it never happened. But if the shit hits the fan, you\u2019ll do what I tell you, what the club lawyer tells you. Got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel so bad dragging you into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a family,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe take care of each other. That\u2019s the way it works, babe. You protected yourself and Noah, now I\u2019ll protect you. My brothers\u2019ll cover my ass, and we\u2019ll all make it through just fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are a family, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head slowly, and he squeezed her tight.

Even if my mind hadn\u2019t been racing, I hurt too bad to get any rest. I\u2019d have a hell of a bruise. At least it wouldn\u2019t show anywhere. The sun was already rising when I heard him come back and turn on the shower. Twenty minutes later he padded into the bedroom and lay down next to me, pulling me into his arms.</p> <p>I turned and burrowed into him, holding him tight.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered fiercely, and I meant it. Not just for tonight, but for everything. \u201cThank you for always being here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d he whispered back. His hand came up and ran through my hair softly, soothing me.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about you,\u201d I continued. \u201cI kept saying I didn\u2019t want anything to do with you, that the club does horrible things. But I\u2019m the one doing horrible things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou survived,\u201d he replied, and his voice didn\u2019t waver. \u201cYou protected your son. That\u2019s not horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I called you, you could\u2019ve told me to f**k off,\u201d I replied. \u201cI had no right to drag you into this. Now you\u2019re an accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cLet it be over. I\u2019ll come by in a couple of days, put some new flooring in the kitchen, throw on some paint. Then it\u2019s done. We don\u2019t need to talk about it, okay? In fact, we shouldn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat about us? I feel like this changes things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to figure it out right now, Soph,\u201d he said. \u201cTry to sleep. You\u2019ve got to be up in an hour for work. It\u2019s going to be a long, tiring day, and you\u2019ve got to get through it. On the bright side, if anyone asks why you look like shit, you can say you\u2019re hungover. Plenty of witnesses to that, thank f**k.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could call in sick,\u201d I said. \u201cI suppose calling in with a hangover this early into the job isn\u2019t such a good idea, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he said. He kissed the top of my head. \u201cLike I said, we don\u2019t have to figure things out right now, but I\u2019m going to stay with you for a while. I don\u2019t want you alone.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t occur to me to argue. I really, really didn\u2019t want to be alone. I\u2019d never believed in ghosts, but I was pretty sure Zach planned to haunt me.</p> <p>Probably for the rest of my life.</p><p>A week later we still hadn\u2019t talked things through.</p><p>Ruger moved us back to his house the Saturday after I killed Zach, and this time I didn\u2019t argue with him. He put me back in my old room, and while we spent almost every evening together, he never did more than give me a quick kiss good night.</p><p>I appreciated that more than I knew how to say.</p><p>Things had changed between us in a profound way, something I think we both knew. All our fighting and nitpicking seemed so silly now. So did my endless agonizing about whether or not I should be with him. Once a man disposes of a body for you, the moral high ground has been lost.</p><p>Nothing says \u201ccommitment\u201d like accessory to murder.</p><p>Sooner or later we\u2019d be together. I just wasn\u2019t ready yet, and surprisingly, Ruger was patient. We both worried that yet another move would upset Noah, but he took it in stride\u2014apparently he\u2019d never considered Elle\u2019s place as anything more than an extended sleepover anyway.</p><p>Elle just gave a Cheshire cat smile when I told her we\u2019d be moving.</p><p>Apparently life goes on, even after you kill someone.</p><p>Marie and Horse had their rehearsal dinner the following Friday night. I wasn\u2019t originally invited to it. No reason I would be, considering I wasn\u2019t in the wedding party or a member of the family. Ruger was Horse\u2019s best man, though, so he had to be there. Apparently in his eyes, and in those of the club, we were officially a couple now, so Noah and I were invited, too.</p><p>It felt good to be included.</p><p>The wedding itself would be taking place out at the Armory, which seemed odd to me at first. They weren\u2019t getting married in the building or courtyard itself, though. Out beyond the wall was a large meadow where people camped out for club functions. It backed into a grove of old-growth trees, forming a natural canopy that was perfect for a wedding. There were already tents set up along the edges, but the center and back were marked off with neon-orange ribbon that outlined an area for the ceremony.</p><p>I offered to watch the kids during the rehearsal, including Dancer\u2019s two boys. We hit the play area inside the courtyard, and they all ran around like wild animals, shrieking and jumping off the swing set. The rehearsal dinner was in the courtyard, too, so I found myself helping the caterer set up while we waited. She was a friend of the club named Candace, and she had a wicked sense of humor.</p><p>I also met Marie\u2019s mom, Lacey Benson, and her stepdad, John.</p><p>Lacey was ... different.</p><p>She looked a lot like Marie. In fact, she could\u2019ve been Marie\u2019s sister, at least at first glance. But where Marie\u2019s hair was wild and free, Lacey\u2019s was in one of those styles you just know takes an expensive hair cut, double-processing, and a shitload of product to look so natural and perfect. Marie didn\u2019t usually wear makeup. Lacey\u2019s was flawless, and her clothes never seemed to wrinkle. She was the portrait of a stylish matron, except for the smell of cigarette smoke wafting around her.</p><p>She was poised, stunning, and utterly batshit crazy.</p><p>The crazy wasn\u2019t subtle, either.</p><p>She had a manic energy that couldn\u2019t be contained, and she hovered around Marie like a hummingbird, obviously overjoyed for her daughter. Just watching her was exhausting.</p><p>I learned that Candace was more than a nice person\u2014she might possibly be a saint. No matter how many times Lacey made her rearrange everything, she did it with a nod and a gracious smile. This was a step beyond impressive, because Marie\u2019s mother rearranged things seven times.</p><p>Then she rearranged an eighth, this time while people were actually serving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After dinner, Lacey stood up and gave a long and rambling toast, telling us stories I was pretty sure Marie didn\u2019t appreciate. We heard about how she didn\u2019t like to wear clothes when she was a toddler, and was always stripping down in the grocery store. We heard about the time she\u2019d decided to ride the neighbor\u2019s goat ... wearing spurs.</p><p>We also heard about when Lacey first met Horse, which led to an interesting side-ramble about jail, cops, anger management, her husband, and engagement guns.</p><p>Clearly feeling outdone, Horse\u2019s mother got into the spirit and we learned he\u2019d refused to pee inside the house for the first five years of his life, something his father had found hysterically funny and encouraged.</p><p>Dancer\u2019s toast put both of them to shame, though. She stood in front of everyone and called Marie up for a special presentation. Then she pulled out the little stuffed horse she\u2019d told us about the first night we\u2019d met, along with a small bedazzled harness and matching leash.</p> <p>Maggs and Em supplemented it with a tiny, toy-sized Harley for the horse to ride.</p><p>Marie laughed so hard she almost choked on her champagne. Horse smiled grimly, wrapping an arm around Dancer\u2019s neck and squeezing her shoulder in an almost-hug. It transitioned to a neck-lock and prolonged noogie. She screamed and cried and kicked, but he didn\u2019t let her go until she admitted she\u2019d made the whole thing up, which none of us believed for a minute.</p><p>Noah and I left around nine, just as things were starting to get interesting. Guests had been arriving all day, camping out behind the Armory, and they joined the party once the official dinner events had ended. I was exhausted and my whole body ached, so I was happy to leave. I still had bruises, although thankfully no broken ribs this time. I collapsed into bed alone, wishing Ruger was with me.</p><p>The morning of the wedding dawned warm and perfect.</p><p>They\u2019d taken a risk, planning an outdoor event in early October. It paid off, because there are few things more beautiful than fall in northern Idaho. The evergreen-covered hills were spotted with bright yellow and orange patches. The air had a sharp feel that made me think of that first burst of flavor when you bite into a honeycrisp apple.</p> <p>It took all I had to keep Noah inside while I got ready. I knew he\u2019d be filthy by the end of the day, but I wanted to at least start things out with him clean. Ruger hadn\u2019t come home last night. I assumed he\u2019d been partying with Horse all night, and I wondered about what they\u2019d been doing ...</p><p>There had been tons of people at the party last night, and a lot of them were female. He\u2019d told me after the kidnapping that he didn\u2019t want anyone else but me, that he\u2019d be faithful.</p><p>He\u2019d even given me a soft kiss good night when he\u2019d walked us to the car.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t quite sure what our new arrangement was supposed to be, or where the limits stood. We still hadn\u2019t talked about it. We weren\u2019t having sex. Did that mean he\u2019d been sleeping with someone else? Multiple someone elses?</p><p>Thinking about it made me feel sick.</p><p>I could just ask him. There were things he wouldn\u2019t tell me, but I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d lie. I just wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to hear the answer.</p> <p>I pulled up to the Armory about an hour and a half before the ceremony was supposed to start. There were cars everywhere, and bikes, too. The girls had been busy that morning decorating. I saw Painter as I pulled up, and he raised a hand in a friendly wave. I walked around the Armory and let Noah join the pack of children running wild out there, because the courtyard was off bounds. They were busy setting up the reception in there.</p><p>Picnic leaned back against the wall, watching the kids with a thoughtful look on his face. Then he saw me and waved me over.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d he asked. I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPretty good, I guess,\u201d I said. Looking everywhere but his face, I managed to choke out something I\u2019d meant to say the night before. \u201cThanks for helping me. I mean, last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, never happened,\u201d he said, cocking his head and studying my face. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agreed, because I owed him in a big way.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened between Em and Hunter?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cShe\u2019s not herself, and she won\u2019t say shit to me. That\u2019s not normal\u2014she\u2019s always been my girl, the one who\u2019d tell me everything. Not her sister. Now she\u2019s closed off.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and looked into his face. His blue eyes held concern, and I saw how much it hurt him to ask.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cShe was alone with him the first night, and then again for an hour the next day. She never told me what happened, but I don\u2019t think he raped her, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. She didn\u2019t seem like a victim. Em was pissed at him\u2014really pissed. That\u2019s about all I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019n she\u2019s said so far,\u201d he replied. His mouth tightened. \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs with Marie. You might as well go up, too. They\u2019re like a bunch of f**kin\u2019 harpies. I tried to go up and talk to Em earlier and they wouldn\u2019t let me in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to keep an eye on Noah.\u201d</p><p>Picnic glanced toward the pack of kids running through the grass.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not goin\u2019 anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cPlenty of adults out here already. You should be with Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know her that well,\u201d I protested. \u201cI feel kind of strange ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re in this club as deep as any of us at this point,\u201d he replied, his voice commanding. \u201cHard to get much deeper. Might as well have some of the fun, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and I found myself struck once again at how handsome he was for an old guy.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go see how they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd keep an eye on Em. If you can think of any way for me to help her, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I found Marie up on the third floor in one of the bedrooms.</p><p>Maggs had discovered me in the kitchen and recruited me to help her haul up beer. Apparently Marie had decided that marrying Horse completely sober wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s greatest idea. As her girlfriends, we were required to join her, because that\u2019s what friends do.</p><p>Let it never be said I\u2019ve abandoned someone in their time of need.</p><p>We lugged the beer up the stairs, Maggs telling me that she\u2019d never seen Marie more beautiful ... or more stressed out. I heard her yelling before we reached the room, something about being a grown-up and wanting to make her own decisions. I swung the door open and dropped the beer on the floor with a clanking of bottles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marie stood in the center of the room, wearing a gorgeous white dress\u2014very classic-looking, with a sweetheart neckline, a narrow waist to show off her figure, and a sweeping gown. Her brown hair was pinned up, cascading down in a riot of curls, and she wore flowers woven through it. No veil.</p><p>I guess she\u2019d gotten her fill of white tulle during the limo ride.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d she yelled when she saw me, although I wasn\u2019t sure she even noticed who I was. Nope, she zoned in on the beer, grabbing one and popping the top off using her engagement ring as a church key. She chugged almost the entire bottle, then set it down and turned to face her mother defiantly.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter is not wearing black leather for her wedding,\u201d Lacey proclaimed, waving the offending item in her hand\u2014Marie\u2019s vest with her \u201cProperty of Horse\u201d patch.</p> <p>\u201cHorse wants me to wear it,\u201d Marie snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s important to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go with your dress,\u201d Lacey snapped back. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. This is your day\u2014you should look like a princess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s my day, why can\u2019t I decide what I wear?\u201d Marie asked, her voice rising. Lacey\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m your mother and I know what you really want!\u201d she yelled. \u201cFuck, I need a smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my dress to smell like smoke,\u201d Marie shouted back. \u201cAnd I want my day to be about me! Give me my f**king property patch!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lacey hissed. She looked around frantically, then spotted a pair of florist\u2019s scissors on the counter. Snatching them up, she held them to the vest menacingly. \u201cStay back, or the patch gets it!\u201d</p><p>We all froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you take the patch off the vest and put it on the dress?\u201d I suggested suddenly, inspired by the scissors. \u201cThat way you can still wear it, but the vest won\u2019t ruin the lines of the dress for the pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pull off the patch,\u201d Cookie declared. \u201cThat\u2019d be like divorcing Horse. But we could make a copy of it and pin that on her.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell across the room as Marie and her mother fought a silent battle with their eyes.</p><p>Lacey\u2019s nostrils flared.</p> <p>\u201cI could live with that,\u201d Marie said slowly. We all swiveled toward Lacey. She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to accept it.\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other a moment longer. Lacey held out the vest slowly and Marie snatched it back. Dancer grabbed the vest and took off downstairs, presumably in search of the copier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go smoke and do some of my peace affirmations,\u201d Lacey said slowly, spearing us with her eyes, one by one. \u201cWhen I come back, the patch will be on the dress in such a way that it\u2019s not visible from the front, for the pictures. If I see it from the front, we\u2019ll have a problem and no peace affirmation on Earth will be enough to save your asses. We have an understanding?\u201d</p><p>She swept out of the room and Marie growled.</p><p>\u201cI need another beer.\u201d</p><p>I handed her one quickly, then grabbed one for myself. Holy shit, and I\u2019d thought her mom was crazy last night ...</p><p>Marie pounded her drink as Dancer reappeared, panting. She held a color copy of the patch up triumphantly.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d she asked Marie. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to tape it on the dress right before you head down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it on my butt,\u201d Marie said, just as I\u2019d taken a drink. \u201cSo my mother has to look at it the whole damned ceremony.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. I started giggling, which I tried to cover with a cough, forgetting I had a mouth full of beer. I ended up snorting it out my nose, and then everyone lost it. Dancer was actually crying when she finally stopped, and we all took a moment to poke at our eyes with tissues, trying to fix our makeup. Then she turned to Marie.</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of it back there,\u201d she said, biting back another laugh. \u201cI know it\u2019ll piss off your mom, and that\u2019s great. But it\u2019ll also send a nice message to Horse ...\u201d</p><p>Marie\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s how Marie ended up getting married to Horse with a property patch on her ass.</p><p>We all walked Marie downstairs, and then Dancer and Em bustled her off to wherever she planned to hide until things got started. I collected Noah and we wandered around back to the meadow, which had been transformed since the night before.</p><p>There were twice as many tents now, probably more than a hundred. They\u2019d set up a little wooden pulpit at the front, and chairs had been laid out in neat rows on either side of the aisle, just like any outdoor wedding.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t just any wedding. It was a Reaper wedding, and apparently they liked to add their own twist to the ceremony. All the guys had parked their bikes in two neat, diagonal rows on either side of the center, forming a path of shining chrome for Marie to walk through.</p><p>I had to admit, it looked cool.</p><p>As Ruger\u2019s ... whatever ... I had a place reserved for me up front, right next to Maggs, Cookie, and Darcy. We sat for about ten minutes, Noah squirming, while we waited for things to get started. Then the sound system crackled to life and the minister asked everyone to find their seats.</p><p>Horse and Ruger stepped out from the trees, coming around front to stand and wait. Both wore black jeans and bright white button-up shirts. They also wore their colors. The minister wore a vest, too, although he wasn\u2019t a Reaper.</p><p>\u201cChaplain from Spokane,\u201d Maggs whispered to me. \u201cHe\u2019s done stuff for the club before. Good guy.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then we all turned to watch as Pachelbel\u2019s Canon started wafting through the meadow. The first to come down the aisle was a very little girl I didn\u2019t recognize, carrying a basket of flower petals that she scattered as she walked. Dancer\u2019s two boys followed as ring bearers. Marie\u2019s mom and stepdad were next, and then I heard the roar of a motorcycle across the meadow.</p><p>I craned my neck to see Picnic riding slowly toward the group with Marie on the back of his bike. My eyes widened, delighted. Maggs giggled and leaned over.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t tell her mom about that part ...\u201d</p><p>I glanced quickly to the front to see Lacey\u2019s eyes narrowed and suspicious. John wrapped an arm around her shoulders and whispered something in her ear. She glared at him, then shrugged and rolled her eyes. Apparently she knew when she\u2019d been beaten. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Picnic came to a stop at the end of the aisle, where Em and Dancer\u2014as bridesmaids\u2014waited to help Marie off the bike and fix her dress. Then the two women walked down the aisle before her, side by side. We all rose as Picnic held out his arm to Marie, then slowly escorted her toward Horse.</p><p>That\u2019s when the people in the back started laughing.</p><p>Everyone around us looked confused, and I glanced up to find Horse frowning. He leaned over toward Ruger, murmuring something to him. The waves of laughter kept growing as Marie moved forward, and then I was able to see the patch\u2014\u201cProperty of Horse\u201d\u2014proudly displayed on her rear end, as promised.</p><p>Picnic stopped at the end, stepping back as Horse came to collect Marie. She whispered something to him, and he looked around behind her to see the patch. His face split in a huge grin and I glanced over to see Lacey biting her lip, trying not to laugh. She winked at Marie, silently acknowledging that her daughter had won, and the ceremony started.</p> <p>I don\u2019t remember all the details. It went fast. I kept looking up to find Ruger watching me, his face serious. I did note two very interesting facts, though. The first was that Horse\u2019s full name was Marcus Antonius Caesar McDonnell, God help him.</p><p>The second was that Marie didn\u2019t promise to obey.</p><p>Good girl.</p><p>Then the minister pronounced them husband and wife, and Horse swept Marie up into a kiss that I was pretty sure could get a woman pregnant. Def Leppard\u2019s \u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d burst through the speakers and Horse all but carried her back down the aisle as everyone cheered\u2014and bikers cheer loud.</p><p>Ruger walked Dancer back down the aisle, and Em walked by herself.</p> <p>\u201cThey left the second spot for Bolt,\u201d Maggs said to me, her eyes misty. \u201cThey always leave a spot for Bolt. They\u2019re waiting for him to come home.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at Cookie, whose face had gone pale.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked. She gave me a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I need to go check on Silvie,\u201d she said. I must\u2019ve looked blank, because she explained. \u201cThe flower girl. She\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said, but Cookie was already up and moving.</p><p>I\u2019d noticed a few things since I started getting to know the Reapers.</p> <p>They were fiercely loyal to each other. They seemed to talk in code sometimes, and they had their own rules and ways of doing things. They didn\u2019t like cops and they knew how to get rid of bodies. The Reapers didn\u2019t really shine, though, until you\u2019d seen them party.</p><p>Give them a marriage to celebrate and a pyramid of kegs?</p><p>The place blew up.</p><p>Marie\u2019s mom definitely knew how to throw a reception, too. They\u2019d gone with casual, and I entered the courtyard to find it transformed into something that wasn\u2019t quite elegant, but was definitely fun. There were lights everywhere, music blasting, and enough food for two armies.</p><p>Best of all? There was child care.</p><p>Yup, she\u2019d hired the entire staff of a local day care center to come in and set up a children\u2019s area, complete with games, prizes, face painting, and a genuine f**king pony to ride on. The kids even had their own little buffet where they could put together hot dogs and hamburgers.</p><p>Noah lost interest in me immediately.</p><p>\u201cWow, this is amazing,\u201d I said to Maggs as he took off running. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Marie came from money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarie comes from a trailer,\u201d Maggs replied, laughing. \u201cBut her stepdaddy\u2019s trying to make up for lost time, and he\u2019s loaded. What Lacey wants, Lacey gets. Today she wants a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I said.</p><p>Then Ruger\u2019s arms came around me and he leaned down into me, scenting my hair.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered in my ear. I melted. Maggs rolled her eyes as I turned in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I whispered back. Then I put my hands on his shoulders and lifted up on my toes to kiss him. We\u2019d been doing this a lot the past week. Soft, sweet, quick kisses that let me show my feelings without things getting too intense.</p><p>This time it wasn\u2019t soft and sweet.</p><p>I guess watching Horse and Marie had inspired Ruger, because he kissed me fast and hard, just like he used to. Then he pulled away and looked down at me, his face serious.</p><p>\u201cWe okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re okay,\u201d I said, smiling up at him. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too. One part of you in particular. Let\u2019s get reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>I blushed as he took my arm and half walked me, half dragged me across the courtyard. I stumbled, catching his drift but not on board with his timing.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse already said the party can wait until he\u2019s f**ked his bride, and he\u2019s a smart man,\u201d Ruger muttered, pausing next to a table to grab a backpack. Then I realized where we were headed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, jerking and tugging against his hand. \u201cNot the shed. I\u2019m not going back into that shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob,\u201d Ruger replied, changing direction without a pause. Now we headed toward the back of the Armory. I saw Dancer as we passed, and she was laughing and pointing at me.</p><p>Some friend.</p><p>Then we were in the stairwell, climbing back up to the third floor. Ruger spotted an open door to one of the rooms, and we walked in to find a woman on her knees, giving some man I\u2019d never seen before a blow job.</p><p>\u201cNeed a blanket,\u201d Ruger said to him, pulling one off the bed. The guy nodded, and then we were back out again before I could burst into embarrassed flames. Ruger took me up one more flight through a door that opened onto the roof. It was wide and open, with big parapets ringing the edges. There was a bit of a slope, but not much. We were essentially out in the open.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t much better than the shed,\u201d I said, and Ruger turned to me, raising his brows.</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king serious?\u201d he asked. \u201cI find the one place within a mile that we can have privacy and you\u2019re gonna bitch about it? Besides, it\u2019s tradition. Guys take girls up here all the time. Hell, Horse proposed to Marie on a roof.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a relief,\u201d he muttered, flinging the blanket down flat. Then his hands were tangling in my hair and his mouth covered mine.</p><p>I don\u2019t quite remember how I wound up on the bottom. I certainly don\u2019t remember what happened to my panties, although I sort of suspected Ruger stole them. He seemed to have a bit of a panty thing going on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What I do remember is trying not to scream and failing when his mouth sucked my clit in deep. I also remember when he plunged into me, stretching me open wide and reminding me that I wasn\u2019t just crazy about him because he took good care of Noah.</p><p>Holy shit, the man had skills.</p><p>We took a break after that first round of reunion sex, relocating into the shade behind the little shed housing the stairwell. Ruger lay back and made a little nest for me in his arm, and I snuggled in close. He\u2019d lost his clothes along the way, and I figured if being totally naked out in the open didn\u2019t bother him, I might as well enjoy the view.</p><p>I leaned up on one arm and started kissing his chest.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. \u201cJesus, I\u2019ve missed touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d I said. The tribal tat on his pec called to me, so I started tracing it with my tongue. I loved how he tasted, just a little salty and all male. I loved how hard his muscles were, too, and deep down inside I had to admit I loved the fact that he\u2019d do anything for me.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>I dropped lower to find the ring in his nipple, flicking it with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019s time to talk yet?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I let the ring go reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d I said, looking up at him. \u201cWe should probably get us\u2014whatever we\u2019re going to be\u2014figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make it official,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to be my old lady, pretty sure you know that. You up for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cWere you serious about being faithful? I mean, after you came to get me, when Em and I were with the Devil\u2019s Jacks? Were you serious about not sleeping around? Because that\u2019s still a deal breaker for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally serious,\u201d Ruger replied. He looked me right in the eye. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept with anyone else, babe. Not since I f**ked you in the shed. I\u2019ll admit, I thought about it, but they weren\u2019t you. Just wasn\u2019t feelin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath.</p> <p>\u201cThen why did you keep telling me you couldn\u2019t make any promises?\u201d I asked, startled. \u201cI thought you were screwing girls left and right the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways told you I wouldn\u2019t lie,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to make a promise I couldn\u2019t keep. But shit, Soph, when I thought I might lose you? It all got real clear, real fast. I don\u2019t give a flying f**k about anyone else, babe. I love you. Think I\u2019ve loved you from the first, when I found you and Zach on my couch. Spent a lot of time trying to talk myself out of it, but it\u2019s not goin\u2019 away.\u201d</p><p>I blinked rapidly. He loved me. Ruger loved me. I guess I\u2019d known that for a while now\u2014you don\u2019t take care of someone the way he\u2019d taken care of me and Noah if you don\u2019t love them.</p><p>Hearing the words was still nice.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I replied, feeling suddenly shy. \u201cI think I have for a long time. You were always there for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re crazy about someone,\u201d he said, giving me a little grin. \u201cTrust me, I wasn\u2019t helping you move, putting alarms on your windows, all that shit, outta the goodness of my heart, babe. Not running a f**kin\u2019 charity here.\u201d</p><p>I gave a little laugh. His gaze was so intense, I couldn\u2019t meet it any longer. I looked at his shoulder instead, and for the first time I really studied the tattoos there. There was a series of round dots, each trailing off a bit, almost like a line of comets.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoos on your shoulders. I\u2019ve been trying to figure them out for a while now. They don\u2019t look like anything.\u201d</p><p>He lifted, leaning back on his elbows, and gave me a serious look.</p><p>\u201cSit on my hips,\u201d he said. I raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for seconds already?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr trying to dodge the question? Let me guess, you got drunk and now you can\u2019t remember what they are?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I remember,\u201d he said. \u201cGo ahead, sit on me. Want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him suspiciously, but threw my leg over his hips. His c**k rested right against my opening and I felt a flush of desire run through me. He wasn\u2019t the only one ready for more.</p><p>\u201cNow put your hands on my shoulders,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>I did. Then it hit me.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re such a pig!\u201d I said, stunned. \u201cWhat kind of ass**le has fingerprints on his shoulders? God, are the women you screw so stupid they need a guide so they don\u2019t fall off?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and then he started laughing. I ripped my hands away, glaring at him. I tried to get off, but he sat up and held my waist tight. Then he stopped laughing and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cFirst, some of them probably were that stupid,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut those are your fingerprints, babe.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t remember, but that night you had Noah?\u201d he said. \u201cYou hunkered down on the side of the road and held my shoulders while you pushed him out.\u201d</p><p>I realized what Ruger was saying, and I reached up, laying my fingers on the tattoos again. They fit perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to explain that night to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so intense, Soph. I had no idea what we were doing. I\u2019ve never watched anything like it, never felt anything even close. You worked so hard to bring him to life. All I could do was hold you, hoping I didn\u2019t f**k something up. You squeezed my shoulders so hard they hurt for days. You dug in your nails, you left bruises, the works. Christ, you were strong.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to that night, remembering how I\u2019d crouched on the side of the road. The pain. The fear.</p><p>The joy of holding Noah for the first time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at me and grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou marked me. Big difference. That night was the most important thing that\u2019s ever happened in my life. Holding you, catching Noah\u2014it changed me forever. I didn\u2019t want to forget. So when the bruises started to fade, I went and got them inked, so I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I said, touching the spots lightly with my fingertips. \u201cI think that\u2019s the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt him harden under me, and he smirked.</p><p>\u201cSweet enough to get me laid again?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve told the story to women before, and it works every f**kin\u2019 time. Can\u2019t get their pants off fast enough after that. Hate to think you\u2019re the one girl who can hold out, considering it\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing, and then he rolled me over, pinning my hands over my head. My laughter faded as his c**k found my opening.</p><p>\u201cLove you, babe,\u201d he said, sliding slowly into me. \u201cPromise. I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered back to him. \u201cYou always have been. I love you, too, Ruger. And I swear, you tell that story to any more girls, I\u2019ll cut that ink right off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>I reached up and kissed him as he hit bottom, slowly working in and out of me, grazing my clit with every stroke. I lifted my legs to wrap them around his waist, closing my eyes against the sun and letting the sensation of his thick c**k spreading me soak through my entire being.</p><p>I loved this man.</p><p>I loved how he held me, loved how he cared for my son, and loved how he always fixed whatever f**ked up, horrible things went wrong in my life.</p> <p>As he rocked into me gently, I could hear the guests partying down in the courtyard, music drifting upward as people shouted and cheered and made the most of what had to be one of the last warm days of the year. Maggs was down there, and Em and Picnic and Dancer and Bam Bam ... It wasn\u2019t just Ruger, I realized. All of them had helped me, even when I\u2019d judged them for being Reapers.</p><p>But the Reapers were part of Ruger, and Ruger was part of me.</p><p>He hit particularly deep, and I started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d he grunted without pausing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a part of me,\u201d I said, giggling.</p><p>He paused, raising a brow. Then he rotated his hips slowly and deliberately, making me gasp.</p> <p>\u201cDamned straight,\u201d he said, smirking. I grabbed his butt, urging him to start moving again, and he didn\u2019t complain. Within seconds I\u2019d forgotten about the party below and focused on the sensations building inside. He moved faster, plunging into me, scooting my butt across the blanket with the force of his thrusts.</p><p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m close,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Ruger grunted, then pulled out of me abruptly, rolling to his back and gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cWant to give you something,\u201d he said, his voice tight. I sat up and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cNo. You have the world\u2019s shittiest timing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, although there was definitely a note of strain in the sound. He shook his head, sitting up and leaning over to dig through the backpack he\u2019d brought up with us. Then he pulled it out. A black leather vest.</p><p>A vest that said \u201cProperty of Ruger.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth dropped open, and I took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cRuger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me first,\u201d he said, eyes intent on my face. \u201cYou\u2019re not from my world, so you don\u2019t know exactly what wearing a vest like this means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay ...\u201d I said slowly, although I couldn\u2019t imagine anything he\u2019d say that would make me comfortable with it.</p><p>\u201cYou look at this and see the word \u2018property,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut what it really means is you\u2019re my woman, and I want everyone to know it. I live in a harsh world, babe. A world where bad shit happens, you\u2019ve seen that for yourself. But no matter what goes down, my brothers have my back. This vest means you\u2019re one of us. Those aren\u2019t just words, Sophie. We\u2019re a tribe, and every Reaper in the club\u2014men you don\u2019t even know\u2014would die to protect a woman wearing this vest. They\u2019d do it because they\u2019re my brothers, and because it means more than any ring ever could in our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand ...\u201d I murmured, trying to wrap my head around his words.</p><p>\u201cWhen a man takes a woman as his property, it\u2019s not about owning her,\u201d he continued, eyes searching my face. \u201cIt\u2019s about trusting her. This is my life I\u2019m handing you, Sophie. Not just my life\u2014my brothers\u2019 lives, too. It means I\u2019m responsible for everything you do. You f**k up, I\u2019ll pay. You need help, we\u2019re there. You\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve ever met that I\u2019d consider giving that kind of power to. Hell, I\u2019m not just considering it, I\u2019m desperate for you to take it. I want you to wear my patch, Soph. Will you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, then reached for the leather. It was warm from the sun, and I ran my fingers along it, feeling the strength of the stitching. It had been made to last, no question. I\u2019d be able to wear it for years. Maybe even a lifetime.</p><p>I looked at Ruger, with his strong hands that had caught my son at birth, and his smile that left me breathless. I knew my answer. No need to make it too easy for him, though ...</p><p>\u201cCan I ask one thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, and I thought I heard a hint of anxiety in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWas it really necessary to stop right in the middle of sex to have this conversation? I was almost to the good part.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI made myself a promise,\u201d he said, looking almost sheepish.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised myself the next time I f**ked you, you\u2019d be wearing my patch. I got distracted, though. You got really nice tits, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already screwed me once up here,\u201d I said, trying to keep a straight face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just finish up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a dumbass,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I realized you\u2019d be exploding around me soon, squeezing my c**k like the world was gonna end, and I wanted you to wear my patch when you did it. Just sort of came to me.\u201d</p><p>I held it up, considering it thoughtfully. Might as well torture him a bit, seeing as he\u2019d left me hanging.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a nice vest,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Sophie, I\u2019m f**kin\u2019 sure,\u201d he replied, rolling his eyes. \u201cSo what\u2019s it gonna be? Either you wear it and put us both out of our misery, or we both go home in pain and horny as hell. Because I\u2019m serious. No patch, no dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, seriously,\u201d I replied. \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised. You got a really nice dick, babe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put on the vest, savoring the look in his eyes as he watched. It chafed my ni**les a little, and I bit back a laugh. Maybe Marie could give me some pointers on dealing with that ... Then he pulled me up and over his body, lifting me just enough to slide the pierced dick in question deep inside. I braced my arms on his chest and leaned down, rocking slowly as I studied his face.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cLike how it looks on you, Soph,\u201d he said, smiling up at me. \u201cGreat view. Of course, wouldn\u2019t mind seeing it from the back. You up for some reverse cowgirl action?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst get the job done like this,\u201d I muttered. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk about getting creative.\u201d</p> <p>Ruger smiled and reached down between us, finding my clit with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThat a promise?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>FIVE YEARS LATER</p> <p>RUGER</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stick it in now.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s voice was soft and smooth, with just a hint of laughter.</p><p>Ruger smelled her special scent and felt a shot to his groin, the same as every time he\u2019d seen her since that first night in his apartment. She was so beautiful he could die, and he still couldn\u2019t believe she was truly his.</p><p>But why the f**k she thought this was a good idea he couldn\u2019t fathom. She was moving too fast. They weren\u2019t ready, he needed her to slow down, to really think about how this would change things between them. Being part of the club had opened her eyes, but there should be limits, too.</p><p>He scowled, catching her hand and stopping her mid-motion.</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just stay with me? It\u2019s always worked between us. I don\u2019t get why I\u2019m not enough for you.\u201d</p><p>Sophie rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ruger, tone back the caveman for once,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve wanted to try it for a while now, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s my first time. It\u2019s not going to change anything between you and me, babe. But I need this. You want me to be happy, you always say you want me to be happy. Sometimes that means giving up a little, taking the next step. Let me be in charge for once.\u201d</p><p>Ruger closed his eyes for a second, taking in a deep breath. Then he opened them again and gazed at the woman he loved more than anything. She grinned at him, and holy crap, he loved that grin.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe,\u201d he said, leaning forward to give her a quick peck on those soft, perfect lips of hers. He had to trust her. Ruger forced himself to pull away, taking two steps back, gravel crunching under his heels.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asked. He nodded tightly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019m gonna stick it in. Promise you won\u2019t panic?\u201d</p><p>Ruger rolled his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t panic. I\u2019m not a f**kin\u2019 baby, Soph. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, but her eyes said it all, and Ruger felt a smile creep across his face.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he admitted, holding his hands up in surrender. \u201cYou win. I\u2019m a big whiny baby and I just can\u2019t handle the thought of you doing anything fun without me. I never want you to have fun, I just want you barefoot and pregnant in the kitch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cNow I\u2019m really doing it, and you\u2019re just going to have to deal with it. Stand back. I wouldn\u2019t want my big, bad biker man getting hit by gravel or something.\u201d</p><p>With that she slid the key into the ignition, and the red-and-black Harley softail roared to life. The look on her face was pure delight, and Ruger had to admit that the sight of her on the bike was f**king hot. He couldn\u2019t decide if he wanted her wearing more leather for protection on the road or less, because damn, she looked good when\u2014</p><p>He cut off that thought. He needed to focus on his woman\u2019s safety, not her boobs.</p><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d he yelled. Sophie laughed as she rolled down the driveway, then gave a shriek of delight when she hit the road and tore off.</p><p>Goddamnit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna f**kin\u2019 kill Horse,\u201d Ruger muttered. He hated this. Hated it. \u201cKill him and that f**kin\u2019 bitch of his ... always full of great ideas. She doesn\u2019t need her own goddamn bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk like that around Faith,\u201d Noah said, standing next to him. \u201cShe starts dropping F-bombs at preschool, Mom\u2019ll shit bricks.\u201d</p><p>The kid was twelve going on thirty, and in the past year he\u2019d started shooting up into lanky adolescence. He was already getting phone calls from girls, which gave Sophie fits. Ruger was just happy Noah took after his mom in both looks and brains. Faith sat perched on Noah\u2019s shoulders, watching Ruger with big eyes, same as her mother\u2019s. She gave him a heart-wrenchingly beautiful smile, then opened her mouth and spoke solemnly.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 kiw Howse,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ruger sighed, then reached for his daughter, who climbed up him like a little spider monkey. He stuck his nose into her neck, smelling her sweet, not-quite-still-a-baby scent.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t win this one,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou know sooner or later Faith\u2019s gonna say something where Mom can hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just say she\u2019s copying you,\u201d Ruger said, narrowing his eyes. Noah laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou taught me in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little shit sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m a little shit who\u2019s willing to throw you a lifeline,\u201d Noah replied thoughtfully. \u201cIf she says it in front of Mom, I\u2019ll say it\u2019s my fault if you pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty bucks a pop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a deal.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE</p><p>The bike roared under me and the wind danced across my face.</p><p>I loved it. I\u2019d been practicing for a while, mostly out at Marie\u2019s place. She\u2019d gotten her own bike a year ago. I\u2019d never get tired of riding behind Ruger, but I loved being on my own, too. In fact, I\u2019d spent six months trying to convince Ruger I should get my own ride.</p><p>Stupid man was positive I\u2019d kill myself.</p><p>Problem was, deep down inside, Ruger was sexist as shit. Actually, it wasn\u2019t that deep\u2014he\u2019d always been pretty up front about it. But when he\u2019d decided it was time for Noah to start learning on a little dirt bike, I\u2019d had enough.</p><p>It was okay for my twelve-year-old son to ride, but not me?</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>So earlier that week I\u2019d announced I was buying a bike, and that he could either help me pick one out or live with what I got on my own. That lit a fire under his ass, and earlier today a friend of his delivered my pretty little Harley. Ruger didn\u2019t like it, but at least he knew it was a decent bike in good condition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Still, I paid for it with my own money.

I\u2019d never said anything about it, but somehow Ruger knew\u2014instinctively\u2014that I needed to feel like I could take care of myself.</p><p>Having my own money helped with that.</p><p>I planned to use most of it for school for the kids, but every once in a while I treated us to something special. I\u2019d taken him to Hawaii for our second anniversary, which had been a good investment, because I\u2019d come home with Faith as a souvenir. I\u2019d wondered if having a baby in the house would distance Ruger and Noah, but if anything they\u2019d gotten closer. Every day Noah turned into more of a young man, and Ruger was a big part of that.</p><p>After a few minutes, I reached the end of the road and considered whether or not to turn back. I hadn\u2019t really put the bike through her paces\u2014and she was definitely a she, I felt like we were sisters already\u2014but I knew this was killing Ruger.</p> <p>I smiled, feeling just a little evil.</p><p>Part of me wanted to just take off, feel the freedom and let him dangle for a while. It\u2019d piss him off, but seriously ... angry sex with my man was pretty damned good. I toyed with the idea, but turned the bike around and headed back toward the house instead.</p><p>Baby steps.</p><p>No need to scare him too much in one day, after all.</p><p>Best to save something for tomorrow, just in case he got out of line.</p>   </body></html>"]
