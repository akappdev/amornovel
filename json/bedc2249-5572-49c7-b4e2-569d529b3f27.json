There it was. She stopped and took a careful breath\u2014I can do this\u2014then straightened her shoulders and shoved the door open.</p><p>It was a typically bland room with coffee-stained, brown carpeting and off-white walls, and the scent of sweat, coffee, and overly musky cologne sure didn\u2019t help her stomach. A metal desk with a computer occupied the right side. On the left, two men sat at a small conference table, papers strewn across the surface.</p><p>One had his back to her, and with dismay, she realized why the cologne smelled familiar. Agent Preston Rhodes. Only three or four inches over her five feet five, the pale, brown-haired creep had the whiny personality\u2014and the morals\u2014of the hyenas in The Lion King. During her one-month stint in Tampa last year, he\u2019d even tried to coerce a victim\u2019s sister into bed.</p> <p>The other man had black hair and eyes, an olive complexion, and deeply carved lines bracketing his mouth. He frowned at her and asked, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d in a clipped New England accent.</p><p>Rhodes turned in his chair and scowled at her. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Renard?\u201d He glanced at the other man. \u201cShe\u2019s a victim specialist with the Miami field office.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Gabi spoke to the dark-haired agent. \u201cAre you in charge of the investigation of the women kidnapped in Atlanta?\u201d</p><p>Renard glared. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>The man silenced Renard with a look. \u201cI\u2019m Special Agent Galen Kouros. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be one of the decoys.\u201d And you\u2019re going to let me.</p><p>\u201cDo you now? Just how did you happen to hear about them?\u201d His icy voice sent an answering chill up her spine. She let her own anger wash through her.</p><p>\u201cOne of the kidnapped women is a friend, and her mother called me after your visit.\u201d Weeping hysterically, begging for help from Kim\u2019s FBI friend. Gabi had driven to Atlanta for information from Kim\u2019s mom and also the local FBI office. None of it had been good. Gabi looked away, blinking back tears. \u201cI found out another young woman had been kidnapped and shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only details released to the news were that a woman had died of a gunshot wound on the freeway. How did you get more?\u201d The agent leaned back in his chair, studying her.</p><p>\u201cThere are rumors here and there.\u201d Especially in the seething Atlanta field office. Not so easy here. But during her brief stay in Tampa, she\u2019d discovered that one of the secretaries loved to gossip. She\u2019d also told Gabi that Rhodes's very appropriate nickname was Dickhead.</p><p>Kouros pointed to a chair across from Rhodes. \u201cSit.\u201d</p> <p>New Englanders could be so brusque. He needed to meet a southern gentleman and learn some civility. But she obediently took a seat.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA total of four women, including Kim, were kidnapped in Atlanta. All members of BDSM clubs. The last one escaped on a freeway by running out into oncoming traffic. She died of a gunshot wound before the ambulance arrived. But she managed to tell a trucker a few things.\u201d She must have been in agony. Terrified. Gabi swallowed.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Kouros snapped.</p><p>\u201cApparently the kidnapper said more women were to be kidnapped in Tampa.\u201d She frowned. \u201cUm, the last delivery of women is August twenty-ninth, and then they\u2019ll hold a slave auction.\u201d They\u2019ll sell Kim. She gathered her thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re putting female agents as decoys in four Tampa fetish clubs, hoping the kidnapper will target one.\u201d It seemed a little far-fetched. Why would he go after them and not another woman in the club?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re remarkably well-informed.\u201d He hadn\u2019t moved as she talked, his stillness a contrast to Rhodes\u2019s fidgeting. \u201cI can see there are some loose tongues in this office.\u201d</p><p>Dickhead stiffened.</p><p>Ignoring him, Kouros eyed Gabi. \u201cWhat qualifications do you have for playing a decoy, Ms. Renard? I\u2019ll admit you\u2019re motivated\u2014and because of that I doubt you can be objective. You\u2019re the right age. You\u2019re pretty enough, probably smart enough. But you\u2019re not an agent; you\u2019re support staff\u2014a social worker. Why should I use you instead of an agent?\u201d</p> <p>At first she hadn\u2019t seen any way to help. She was a counselor, not a field agent. Then she\u2019d checked the agents they planned to use. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m objective or not. I\u2019m not going to work the case, just play decoy. Second, you only have three agents for decoys, not four. As far as I know, none have visited BDSM clubs before.\u201d</p><p>His face hardened at the further evidence of how much information she\u2019d obtained, and she continued hurriedly, \u201cI have experience.\u201d A little and long ago, but who\u2019s counting?</p><p>He sat forward like a cat scenting a mouse. \u201cYou\u2019re submissive?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not seriously considering using her,\u201d Rhodes burst out. \u201cShe\u2019d blow the whole operation.\u201d</p><p>As Kouros studied her, his gaze drifted over her face, lingered on her cheek. \u201cHow\u2019d you get the scar?\u201d</p><p>The ugly memory sliced her as easily as the knife had sliced her flesh. Her hands fisted. \u201cWrong place during a gang war.\u201d And she\u2019d promised herself she\u2019d never willingly get near violence again. How plans do change.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re braver than you appear.\u201d Kouros actually smiled. \u201cYou might just do, Ms. Renard. As it happens, I need a decoy for the Shadowlands.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes stared at him. \u201cYou think you could get that asshole owner to admit her? She\u2019s not an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZachary Grayson had a good point. An inexperienced, nonsubmissive woman might manage to pass in a busy public place, but the members of his club wouldn\u2019t be fooled.\u201d Kouros turned to her again. \u201cThe Shadowlands is a private, very exclusive BDSM club outside Tampa. Assuming we can talk him into it, the owner will set you up as a trainee sub.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to agree, but he held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing one vital piece of information the victim gave us\u2014and we confirmed. I want you to think twice before we go any further. You see, the kidnapper is targeting only blatantly rebellious submissives. Noisy ones. The buyers want the pleasure of breaking their spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That can\u2019t\u2014\u201d No, not Kim. Her stomach twisted.</p><p>Kouros\u2019s face softened. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting the point, Gabrielle. I\u2019m talking about your involvement. The decoys will have to demonstrate disobedient, insolent behavior. If you\u2019re familiar with the lifestyle, you know how a dom will react.\u201d</p><p>Gabi stiffened. Doms wouldn\u2019t tolerate rudeness. They might just stop the scene and let the sub go\u2014or might discipline her.</p><p>\u201cAh. I see you know.\u201d A corner of Kouros\u2019s mouth rose. \u201cGrayson says only a few Shadowlands doms like brats, so either you\u2019d end up sitting alone with no chance to attract attention or he\u2019d need to get you into the trainee program...which forces the trainer to deal with you, whether he wants to or not.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. To be dealt with. Her hands had gone clammy.</p><p>\u201cAnother fact. Despite their protests, the club owners are sworn to secrecy, so aside from the owner and Rhodes, no one else there will know you\u2019re playing a part. That includes the dom in charge of the trainees, who, according to Grayson, is a hard-ass when it comes to disrespectful submissives. Are you sure, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>She clasped her hands together, hoping to hide her trembling. Knowing she\u2019d be setting herself up as a target for a murderer had terrified her so much she\u2019d thrown up before leaving the motel.</p><p>Now this. To beg for punishment from a dom who didn\u2019t know she was playing a part? Oh God.</p><p>But for Kim? All through college, Kim had shaken her awake from nightmares of the past, listened to her, comforted her. Now Kim was living in a nightmare.</p><p>Gabi raised her chin. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Marcus Atherton walked into the Shadowlands entry and nodded at the domme and security guard across the small room. Down the center, his five trainee submissives knelt nicely in a line. He strolled around them, checking that clothing was neat, appropriate, and seductive. \u201cY'all look very nice tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Vivacious Sally, Goth Dara, and sweet, gay Austin had been there before he\u2019d taken over the program last spring. After he and the owner, Z, had talked at length, they\u2019d added Uzuri, with her gorgeous, chocolate-colored skin and the soul of a prankster, and a newer bisexual, Tanner, who wanted a mistress or a couple.</p><p>\u201cI will not be in charge of you this evening.\u201d Z\u2019s voice-mail message had requested that he free himself up tonight, but hadn\u2019t said why. \u201cSo Mistress Olivia has kindly agreed to supervise y'all.\u201d</p><p>Their unhappy expressions warmed his dom\u2019s heart. They\u2019d become as attached to him as he was to them. When he saw mischief rising in Sally\u2019s eyes, he added, \u201cYou best be nice to Mistress Olivia, or next time I\u2019ll ask Mistress Anne to watch over you.\u201d</p><p>They actually paled.</p><p>He had a mind to tell Anne\u2014the sadistic mistress would enjoy their response immensely. \u201cI\u2019ll have an eye on all of you. Don\u2019t let me down now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They murmured, \u201cNo, Sir\u201d and \u201cWe won\u2019t, Master Marcus.\u201d He nodded and stepped back to let Olivia take his place.</p><p>The hefty domme smiled at the trainees. \u201cFirst, let me run through my rules.\u201d She slapped a switch against her tight latex pants, and the movement drew every gaze.</p><p>Chuckling, Marcus stepped into the main club room and waited for his eyes to adjust to the dim lighting from the chandeliers and wall sconces. This early, no one played on the equipment against the walls; no murmur of conversation came from the sitting areas. The lingering scent of cleansers mingled with the fragrance of leather.</p><p>Within an hour, the Shadowlands would rumble to life. Odd how much he\u2019d come to love this club.</p> <p>He looked around and spotted Z. Dressed in his usual black silk shirt and tailored slacks, the owner of the Shadowlands sat at the circular bar in the center of the room, talking to the bartender and his submissive.</p><p>As Marcus walked over, Cullen grinned. \u201cHey, buddy, I met your new trainee. Great hair.\u201d The bartender\u2019s voice echoed in the huge, silent room.</p><p>\u201cWhat new trainee?\u201d Marcus gave Z a quizzical glance.</p><p>Z frowned. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you\u2019d arrive earlier, Marcus. I certainly didn\u2019t intend to spring this on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trial ran late.\u201d And had been satisfying as hell. By the time he finished his closing argument, the jury had been of one mind, and the bastard who\u2019d preyed on young boys hadn\u2019t had a chance. Guilty. The sense of satisfaction in knowing he\u2019d taken one more monster off the streets made all the late nights worthwhile. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the lack of discussion, but I have another trainee for you.\u201d Z nodded toward the back. \u201cI told her to wait for you by the chain station.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stared at him. They always talked over any addition to the trainee program. And now a new one, just like that?</p><p>Z took a sip of his drink. \u201cI appreciate you taking Gabrielle on, Marcus. She\u2019s rather misbehaved, and she\u2019s going to need a firm hand. Please keep her for a month\u2014say the end of August\u2014before you give up on her.\u201d</p><p>Anger started a sullen glow in his gut. Z hadn\u2019t asked a favor; he\u2019d given an order. What kind of bullshit is this? From the set of Z\u2019s jaw, there would be no discussion about refusing this trainee. Marcus could either take on the submissive or step aside as trainer.</p><p>But he liked supervising the trainees, helping them broaden their education as submissives, helping them find a dom to match their needs. And the volunteer position filled his need to give back to the community. He tapped his fingers on the bar and considered his options. Perhaps he should meet the new trainee before burning his bridges behind him. As he\u2019d slowly come to know the other Masters, he realized he\u2019d never found a club that suited him so well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work with her.\u201d For now. Then he gave Z a steady look and drew his line in the sand. \u201cYou are the owner, sir, but they\u2019re my trainees. I would be most grateful if you could remember that.\u201d Don\u2019t do it again.</p> <p>Gray eyes level, Z tilted his head in acknowledgement and slid the trainee\u2019s paperwork down the bar top.</p><p>With a grin, the bartender set a drink on the bar. \u201cYou know, Marcus, you say fuck you almost as politely as the boss.\u201d</p><p>Marcus huffed a laugh. No one stayed riled up around Cullen very long. He scanned the papers, giving Cullen the high points. A short summary would go on the bulletin board for the other Shadowlands Masters since they all participated in sub training. \u201cNo medical disease or problems. No phobias she\u2019s willing to admit to. She doesn\u2019t want any serious pain, piercing, scarring. Bondage and sex are okayed.\u201d Fairly normal for a trainee\u2019s choices. \u201cWould you please give me a set of trainee cuffs and ribbons?\u201d</p><p>The bartender rummaged in the shelves below the bar top, then handed over a pair of gold-colored leather wrist cuffs and a box of colored ribbons.</p><p>Marcus added the appropriate ribbons to the cuffs, the colors indicating what the trainee would permit: yellow for mild pain, blue for bondage, green for sex. No red ribbons for severe pain. \u201cMany of the choices have question marks. The information about her past experience is sketchy.\u201d He glanced at Z, hoping for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much. I\u2019m simply doing someone a favor.\u201d Z gave Cullen a faint smile. \u201cDoes that sound familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d Cullen\u2019s laugh boomed out as he glanced at his submissive, a tall, golden-haired sub tough enough to handle the giant dom. He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s even worth the effort.\u201d</p><p>Andrea wrinkled her nose at her dom and said, \u201cThanks, Se\u00f1or.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus remembered that Cullen had taken her on as a favor when he had charge of the trainees. Well, maybe this new trainee would prove as delightful. \u201cDid Gabrielle herself request that you let her into the program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted in, but a friend\u2014Galen\u2014did the asking for her. He hopes that as a trainee she can find what she needs. He says she\u2019s quite badly behaved, and he recommends you not go easy on her.\u201d Z frowned. \u201cShe might prove a challenge even for you, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>A difficult submissive. Wonderful. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can. In fact, I\u2019d best go make her acquaintance and get started.\u201d He clipped the cuffs to the back of his belt, nodded to the two men, and smiled at Andrea, remembering what a run she\u2019d given Cullen before he\u2019d reeled her in. Way too much work. Maybe Z was wrong, and this new trainee would be quiet and sweet and obedient.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t by the chain station.</p><p>Marcus frowned and looked around, finally spotting her in the hallway for the theme rooms, staring in at the medical room setup. She appeared mesmerized by the gyn table, enema bags, and shelves filled with speculums, dilators, and other fun toys. After walking over silently, he leaned a shoulder against the wall and crossed his arms, taking the time to study her.</p><p>Not ugly, but not particularly beautiful either, at least from what he could see. Medium height, nicely padded. A long blue skirt hid her ass and legs. He approved of the black bustier, which pushed up a fine set of breasts. Her shaggy-styled hair barely reached her shoulders. She was a redhead like Nolan\u2019s sub, but more of a strawberry blonde, and her coloring was so pale that she almost glowed. Not a freckle in sight. A light sunburn had pinkened her shoulders and breasts, and he smiled. How far down did the burn go?</p><p>His gaze dropped. Submissives went barefoot in the club, and she had pretty feet, but she\u2019d painted her toenails a vibrant blue. Blue?</p><p>\u201cDid you get yourself lost?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She jumped and spun so quickly her skirt wrapped around her legs. Apparently she\u2019d dyed one fluffy lock of hair on the left to match her toenails. A long scar, a shade lighter than her skin, ran from her left cheekbone to the corner of her mouth. Despite the whiteness indicating it was an old injury, the sight bothered him on a visceral level, that a sub coming into his care had been hurt.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey. Hi.\u201d She shook out her skirt and grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019m just poking around. New place and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Interesting face, he thought. Not a model\u2019s face with jutting cheekbones and sharp chin, hers was all soft curves. Not beautiful, but...friendly. When she smiled, dimples flashed in her cheeks.</p><p>But what was she doing by the theme rooms? He asked gently, \u201cWere you instructed to wait here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The grin disappeared, and a wary expression shaded her wide brown eyes. \u201cMaster Z said the trainer would come back to fetch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did he say, \u201eWait here,\" or did he give you permission to wander around?\u201d</p><p>When she blushed, her ivory complexion turned a delightful pink. If nothing else, he could look forward to enjoying that.</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u201eWait here.\"\u201d She waved her hand toward the chain station. \u201cGuess I shouldn\u2019t have moved, huh?\u201d</p><p>Had she no idea of how to address a dom? How to obey? \u201cI do believe that might have been a mistake.\u201d And so might this trainee Z had dumped on him.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The model-gorgeous guy in the suit didn\u2019t like her. Gabrielle saw that already, but no real problem. The only one she had to impress was Master Marcus, and hopefully the suit wouldn\u2019t tell on her. The man positively oozed rich and powerful, so he must be a big shot in the club. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better get back there before my boss arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Marcus. I\u2019m waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly possess a poor idea of how to wait.\u201d He stared at her for another minute, disapproval radiating from him. \u201cI have a notion that introductions are in order before you work your way further into trouble. I am Master Marcus.\u201d</p><p>She choked. Oh, no. This day is so not going well. \u201cAh.\u201d She cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cNice to meet you. Um\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd might I ask your name?\u201d he asked politely. Too politely.</p><p>She took a second look at him, at his fancy tailored suit. Dark gray with pinstripes. Oh please, like she\u2019d really believe he was a dom at all? \u201cGabrielle Anderson. Are you sure you\u2019re Master Marcus?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. The guy was way too good-looking. Tall, broad-shouldered, lean. His hair, a rich brown shading to gold on the ends, was flawlessly styled. Definitely a perfect person like her parents. Gag. Even his tan wasn\u2019t leathery, but just dark enough to set off incredibly blue eyes. Very sharp blue eyes, in fact, and turning colder by the second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would you think I\u2019m not Master Marcus?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Well, good grief. She waved a hand at him and kept the duh from slipping out. Just in case he really was Master Marcus. Maybe he hadn\u2019t changed yet or something. \u201cThe suit? Where are your leathers or latex or...biker jacket or vest? And black? Did you forget to wear black?\u201d</p><p>He stared for a second, as if she\u2019d turned into a drooling idiot, and then simply roared. Deep, full laughter\u2014amazing coming from someone who looked like he should have a stick up his ass.</p><p>She felt heat flooding her face and decided she really didn\u2019t like him. Maybe he was the club accountant or administrator or something. Shifting her weight, she looked past him. Hopefully the Marcus guy would arrive soon. She needed to get all established before the arrival of the kidnapper\u2014the unsub, as a real agent would call him. She frowned. Unsub sounded too much like fake submissive. That would be me. Maybe she\u2019d call him a perp instead.</p> <p>\u201cBest you tell me about your previous experience in BDSM,\u201d the suit said, and damn but he appeared totally different when he smiled. How many women had he destroyed with that devastating dimple in his left cheek and crease in the right? \u201cWas it mostly in downtown clubs? Perhaps of the Goth variety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeees. Why?\u201d Several years ago too, but that\u2019s not what she\u2019d written on her application.</p><p>He motioned for her to precede him down the hall, and when she stepped in front of him, his hand closed on her nape. Firmly, as if she were a stray dog. \u201cI do believe you\u2019ll find a private club a mite different. A wider age range, diverse incomes, assorted tastes. Many doms here wear leathers and black; some prefer other attire.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach sank with the authoritative way he\u2019d gripped her neck. No accountant from the back would act like this\u2014she\u2019d run into a dom. In a suit. Who called himself...? \u201cYou really are Master Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, darlin\u2019.\u201d He stopped at the place where chains hung from the low rafter and released her, only to walk around her slowly as if she stood on a display stand. \u201cIs all your experience in public clubs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d In her college days, she\u2019d pop into a club, have some fun, and maybe take someone home. But she hadn\u2019t indulged since then. She\u2019d set her sights on the FBI from day one and wasn\u2019t about to mess up her chances by doing anything less than respectable.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He tapped the ribbing on her bustier. \u201cRemove that, please.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Just like that? I only met you, dammit. She hesitated, but the merciless look in those blue eyes kicked her into gear. After undoing the hooks, she tossed the bustier onto a chair outside the ropes that fenced off the scene area. She forced her arms to stay at her sides and tried to ignore the air-conditioned draft on her bare breasts.</p><p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d When he brushed sure fingers over her shoulder, into the hollow below her collarbone, and over the upper curve of one breast, her body woke up from her breasts all the way to her pussy\u2014and that was damn disconcerting considering she didn\u2019t even like the guy. But he had that ruthless attitude going for him\u2014the dominant edge that put butterflies into her stomach as if she\u2019d swallowed fluffy bugs.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you play somewhere else?\u201d he asked. \u201cPrivately?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed. \u201cNot...really. I might have gone home with a man after, but for kinky stuff, I stayed in the clubs. More public or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see. You didn\u2019t trust any dom enough to let him restrain you without other people around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She\u2019d never thought of it like that but\u2014okay. He was right. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to have verbal answers,\u201d he said ever so softly. \u201c\u201eYes, Sir\" will serve for now.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep the shiver from running down her spine. The guy wielded a razor-sharp voice, no matter how soft it was. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds very pretty, sugar,\u201d he said, and the caress in his voice turned all her bones into a seriously mushy state. Until he added, \u201cRemove the skirt, please.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, and his eyes could be just as lethal as his tone. Why did he bother to say \u201eplease\"? She stepped out of the skirt, wishing she\u2019d done more time in the gym. Done any time in the gym. Maybe walked a little at least. Nothing like a fat ass to impress a man.</p><p>But hey, this wasn\u2019t about impressing the fussy dom. She\u2019d come here to lure a kidnapper\u2014a killer\u2014into a trap. She shivered.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you have a problem with being unclothed?\u201d</p> <p>Hell. Keep your mind on business, Gabi. \u201cNo, Sir. Just cold, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm-hmm.\u201d He walked around her again, inspecting her as if she were the star at a dog show. Totally insulting\u2014and yet she felt her nipples contracting to dagger points and a disconcerting wetness between her thighs. She shifted to put her legs closer together.</p><p>\u201cMaster Z requested I take you on. Did you read the rules for the trainees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yes.\u201d She caught the hint of ice in his eyes and added a hasty, \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>He unhooked a set of golden-colored leather cuffs from the back of his belt. After buckling them on her wrists, he carefully checked the fit and then attached her left cuff to a chain dangling from the rafter. \u201cThe safe word for the trainees is red,\u201d he said as he reached for another chain and did her right arm. He kept the chains long enough so that her arms could remain at waist level. \u201cI want for you to use it if you become overwhelmed in any way, from fear, pain...whatever. It will bring the dungeon monitors a-running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I use a safe word, does that mean everything is off?\u201d She couldn\u2019t afford to blow this.</p><p>His face softened. \u201cNo, sugar. It means I stop whatever we\u2019re doing and we sit down and chat for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Good. Um, Sir.\u201d Can I really see this through? This lethal dom wasn\u2019t anything like the ones she\u2019d played with in the downtown clubs. Fear wavered inside her, and she shoved it away. Mostly.</p><p>She saw his gaze on her and realized her fingers were tracing the scar on her cheek. He pulled her hand down and enfolded it in his warm one. \u201cGabrielle, do you have a problem with bondage you didn\u2019t mention on the application?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d When he didn\u2019t move, she added, \u201cReally. I\u2019m just a little nervous, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d He walked to the wall, and the chains attached to her wrist cuffs began to tighten, pulling her arms over her head. He stopped before she had to go up on tiptoe.</p><p>She tried to be grateful for the small concession, but suddenly she felt...naked. Really naked, much more than when she\u2019d taken off her clothes. Then she\u2019d worried about how she looked. Now...now she felt the intensity of his gaze as he strolled around her again.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fixin' to acquaint myself with my new trainee\u2019s body as we have a chat.\u201d His fingers ran over her sunburned shoulders, and he murmured, \u201cSunscreen, Darlin\u2019\u2014you best use more of it.\u201d</p><p>A pause. He shot one of those stabbing blue looks at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. That does sound nice.\u201d He played with her hair, fingered the blue streak and shook his head, then ran his finger over her lips.</p><p>As her mouth tingled, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he\u2019d taste like. Could he kiss? Would he?</p><p>He caught the direction of her stare, and his lips quirked. Don\u2019t react, she told herself, yet when he stroked his hand down her neck, her breasts seemed to swell in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cOur trainees are long-standing submissives. The membership knows that,\u201d he said and frowned at her. \u201cYour application didn\u2019t contain much information on your previous experience in the lifestyle, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re ready to jump into something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have experience.\u201d A little bit. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no easing-in period for trainees, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t treat me special or go slow or anything. I want to jump right in.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and then he shook his head and let it go. \u201cTell me why you want to be a trainee?\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped her breast, and she shivered at the gentleness of his touch and the slight abrasion of his skin. His fingers weren\u2019t soft and pampered like she\u2019d expected. Hadn\u2019t Master Z said the trainer was an attorney? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk like a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>He blinked and smiled. \u201cI grew up in a small town in Georgia. But I can sound quite lawyerly in court.\u201d He caressed her breasts for a minute. \u201cGabrielle, I do believe I asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>Oh. How was she supposed to remember a cover story when he was...groping her? Hell of an interrogation technique\u2014she\u2019d have to recommend it to the field agents. \u201cUm, I want to learn more about the lifestyle and myself.\u201d Master Z had mentioned some of the right reasons. \u201cI want to hook up with a nice dom, but in the clubs, they seemed mostly interested in one-night stands, and I was never sure who to trust.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched her intently as his thumb rubbed over her nipple. She could feel it bunching and wanted to squirm. \u201cWhat type of dom? Are you hoping to be a slave?\u201d</p><p>Do I look insane? Then again she stood here in the middle of a BDSM club. Maybe she was nuts. \u201cNo. But I\u2019d like to find someone who is more than a weekend dom,\u201d she said, and the statement might have been true if she participated in the lifestyle. But she\u2019d left her kinky side behind with college. Respectable R\u2019 Me.</p><p>His hands curved around her waist, and the fact that he was working his way...down...created all sorts of funny feelings in her. Would he actually touch her...?</p><p>\u201cYou marked yes to sex on the trainee form,\u201d he said.</p><p>God, talk about getting right to the point. She hadn\u2019t thought it through until Master Z had bluntly explained what she could expect if she checked yes for that option. And she\u2019d decided absolutely not. But during the briefing talks, Special Agent Rhodes, the asshole, had carefully avoided the subject of her having sex, but repeatedly mentioned that all the kidnapped submissives had had public sex in the clubs. She couldn\u2019t afford prudish behavior.</p><p>Besides, she\u2019d done incredibly stupid things in her teens and in college, including one-night stands just for a thrill. She could damn well manage to have sex with a few strangers now if it meant she might save Kim.</p><p>It still made her feel a little...dirty. I\u2019m not that kind of girl anymore. \u201cSex is okay. Sure.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve just run smack-dab into one of my rules: don\u2019t lie to your dom. If you\u2019re feeling uncertain, say so.\u201d He stroked his fingers down and across her hips. \u201cTry again, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed, trying not to get distracted as his hand massaged her butt. Sex. Right now her body yelled for it. But her head... Dammit, she couldn\u2019t let her squeamish behavior derail this operation. \u201cIt\u2019s only nerves, Sir. I want sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d He avoided her pussy and knelt to slide his hands down her legs, hopefully not seeing the dimples and bulges in her thighs. At least she had good calves and ankles. He touched her blue toenails and snorted softly.</p><p>A stiff, conservative lawyer. Just like her father.</p><p>As he rose and his firm hands ran back up, he ordered, \u201cTell me about your experience with oral, vaginal, and anal.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he show some conservatism with his questions? Whatever happened to modesty? Privacy? With a sinking sensation, she knew the man wouldn\u2019t allow any, either physically or emotionally. Pull up your big-girl panties, Gabi. \u201cYes to the first two. I\u2019ve... One guy wanted to do the other, and I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo you have had some experience. We\u2019ll discuss anal sex some other time.\u201d He stroked a finger over the tender crease between her hip and thigh and then patted her pussy. \u201cI will require you to keep yourself bare with no stubble. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Her life was changing faster than she found comfortable. Would the Internet have instructions on how to shave down there without slicing off something essential? \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo continue: how about other doms touching you? Or taking you? Or women? Members can request a trainee for a scene, which might involve anything from light sensation play to bondage, pain, and/or sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He touched her pussy, and she gasped as the low heat inside her turned to flames. He gave her a devastating smile that creased his right cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re wet, Gabrielle. I do like that.\u201d He drew his finger up slowly, stopping on the very top of her clit, and she could almost feel it pulsing against his touch. She swayed, grateful for the support of the chains.</p><p>He\u2019d only touched her. Hell, she\u2019d had sex with guys and not gotten this turned on.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, how am I supposed to remember what you asked?\u201d</p><p>His chuckle sounded as low and smooth as his voice. \u201cYou might not, but here\u2019s your next rule: a submissive is always, always respectful to a dom. Any dom, but especially her trainer...if she knows what\u2019s good for her.\u201d</p><p>His damn finger remained right there, making her world spin. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her gaze. Held it. \u201cI will punish you if you rile me up by being disrespectful, Gabrielle. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d If she moved, just a little, pushed her hips toward his hand, would he notice? Would it make\u2014</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying not to whine like a baby. Mean bastard to get her worked up and not finish the job.</p><p>\u201cNow answer my question.\u201d</p><p>What the hell had he asked? Oh, other doms, touching, taking, women. \u201cThe thought of doing anything with a woman squicks me out. Didn\u2019t I mark that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to double-check what subs write,\u201d he said. He straightened, moving closer until she could feel the heat of his body, until his eyes filled her world. \u201cYou\u2019ll scene with different doms, you realize. How about more than one man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected the variety of doms.\u201d Master Z had warned her, again and again. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never had two at the same time.\u201d Except once. The horrible memory shriveled everything up inside her. Could she tolerate more than one man touching her? And yet, what if she liked the men? A tiny bit of excitement slid through her, and she couldn\u2019t tell if her shiver came from disgust or anticipation.</p><p>His keen eyes didn\u2019t miss her reaction. \u201cIf I put you between two doms, what will you do, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>Hell. She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m not sure... I guess I\u2019ll try?\u201d</p><p>His smile warmed her right to the bone. \u201cGood answer.\u201d He tugged on her hair, still smiling. \u201cYou had any experience with flogging? Canes? Spankings?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cSpanking. A really soft flogger. Not...the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You had question marks beside most of the impact play. When I see question marks on a limit list, I take it as a request to explore further.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went damp. She\u2019d seen a lot of scary stuff on the application, and yet, as he watched her with utter self-confidence, she figured\u2014maybe\u2014she might manage okay. Somehow he made her feel as if she could trust him not to go too far.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t seen him angry yet. How would he react when she disobeyed him? She had to behave like a bratty submissive; that was the whole point.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d he said.</p><p>Wanting to get a hint of how he\u2019d respond, she scowled and said, \u201cI thought you told me not to move.\u201d</p><p>Although he slapped her thigh lightly, the sting ran right to her clit. \u201cBest apologize, and do as I asked. I do not like and I will not tolerate bratty behavior.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, he wasn\u2019t going to give her much leeway at all for acting as a decoy. Her worries ratcheted up another notch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master Marcus.\u201d</p><p>Her thigh burned, and despite her anxiety, excitement fizzed through her veins, even more than when he\u2019d touched her clit. More? Because he\u2019d swatted her? Please tell me I didn\u2019t like getting whacked.</p><p>As if he had all day for her to think about things, he waited with his arms crossed. When she finally opened her thighs, he gave her an approving smile. Curving his fingers over her hip, he got a firm grip. His other hand touched her pussy, and she tensed as her anticipation ratcheted up a notch. His fingertips grazed over her lightly, spreading licks of flame that converged on her clit.</p><p>He slid his finger between her labia, opening her more, and pushed firmly inside her. She gasped as pleasure zinged across her nerves, sending her up on tiptoe. She tried to jerk away. Too intimate. Too much.</p><p>His grip only tightened as he thrust farther, in and out, side to side, each movement increasing the seething tension growing in her body.</p><p>Dammit, he was studying her again, like a specimen, and she shook with the feeling of being just some object. Can I do this?</p><p>\u201cEasy, sugar,\u201d he said and released his grip on her hip to cup her cheek instead. With his hand cupping her pussy, his finger still inside her, he brushed his lips over her mouth, and she sighed at the gentleness. How could he act so...ruthless and yet comforting at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only checking your size, your response.\u201d His lips curved, creating a dimple in his left cheek. \u201cI do hate to get the wrong size toys.\u201d</p><p>Toys? Her vagina clamped down around his finger, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cTook a shine to the idea, did you?\u201d After pulling his finger out, he pushed in two, stretching her. Then three.</p><p>Too much. She squirmed, unsure if the fullness felt erotic or just uncomfortable. He set a hand on her bottom, holding her there for a minute as her pussy throbbed around him.</p><p>\u201cYou have a snug little pussy, sugar,\u201d he murmured and withdrew. After licking his fingers as if tasting a new kind of ice cream, he smiled. \u201cAnd you taste very nice.\u201d</p><p>Something inside her relaxed. He liked her taste. And wasn\u2019t that another one of those stupid female fears? Why didn\u2019t guys ever worry about things like that?</p><p>At least his touch lessened some of her concerns, not only about sex with strangers, but about sex, period. It hadn\u2019t interested her in quite a while. But if Master Marcus wanted to take her now\u2014and the tailoring of his pants couldn\u2019t disguise his huge erection\u2014she was completely ready. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To her surprise\u2014and dismay\u2014he released her from the chains without doing anything else. She wanted sex, and he didn\u2019t? \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>Ah, the expression on the little submissive\u2019s face was priceless. She\u2019d just encountered the first of the lessons she\u2019d have to embrace.</p><p>As she stared up at him with beautiful brown eyes, Marcus pressed his palm between her legs again, enjoying the telltale wetness. \u201cYou will arrive dressed appropriately for a fetish club, but I may remove some or all of your clothing. Your body is mine to play with as I please\u2014unless I give another dom permission.\u201d</p><p>He paused then continued. \u201cYou are not to touch yourself. You are not to climax without my permission. That includes both here at the club and any other time, including when you\u2019re at home. I\u2019ll put a limit on it though\u2014for the next two weeks, all pleasure for you will come at my command or not at all.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, and he felt the involuntary clenching of her pussy. \u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He picked up her clothing from the floor and handed it to her. She wasn\u2019t a long-standing member of the club, so he\u2019d start from scratch with protocol instructions. He quickly ran through what she\u2019d need to know for tonight: respectful behavior, appropriate ways to address a dom, kneeling, the meaning of her ribbons, and how much touching other doms could do. Seeing the mixture of dismay and arousal on her face, he wondered again at her request for training. She didn\u2019t seem as...wholehearted...as most subs who begged to be trainees. \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do sound like a lawyer sometimes,\u201d she said under her breath, and before he could react, she asked, \u201cWill I do any scenes tonight or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to me. Entirely.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the clothing in her hands and back up with a pleading look in her eyes. Big, appealing puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>He shook his head no.</p><p>The little sigh she gave made his lips quirk. Truly she was rather cute, bless her heart. She had her work cut out for her though. Protocols, an attitude of service, holding back orgasms, various types of play and toys. Preparing for anal play. Instruction in oral if needed. He eyed the blue streak in her hair. People who followed the rules rarely put blue in their hair. She\u2019d already earned a swat on the leg at a time most subs would try their utmost to appear sweet and obedient. He understood Z\u2019s concern over her attitude.</p><p>His mouth tightened. His ex-wife had loved to indulge in full-blown bratty behavior, not because she was inherently ornery, but for the show. She wanted the attention\u2014not his, but everyone else\u2019s. Of all the subs, he particularly disliked the insolent and ill-disciplined ones.</p><p>At the bar, Andrea smiled at him. \u201cMaster Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tuck away Gabrielle\u2019s clothes until later.\u201d He nodded at Gabrielle to hand her clothing over. She did with another little sigh. Just to check her reaction to being touched in public, he clasped her breast. His arm behind her back prevented her retreat as he caressed and teased her nipple to a stiff point. Her hands had fisted. They\u2019d have to work on that, but she hadn\u2019t moved. She flushed with embarrassment, but after a minute, her body relaxed and she unconsciously leaned into his touch.</p><p>\u201cGood job, little subbie,\u201d he said in an undertone for her ears.</p><p>She looked up at him, desire and surrender in her eyes, and then stiffened as if surprised at her response\u2014as if displeased with it.</p><p>Thanks for the challenge, Z.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>For a good part of the evening, Gabi served drinks as Marcus had explained each trainee did for part of the night. She still wasn\u2019t sure exactly why. He never gave her clothing back, so she stayed naked and all too conscious of how her breasts and butt jiggled and drew attention from the men...and sometimes the women too. The doms did more than look. As they gave their drink orders, they\u2019d touch her. Never on her breasts or pussy, but running a hand up and down her arm or massaging her butt lightly. One had stroked his fingers up her inner thigh, stopping an inch short of the V between her legs.</p><p>It left her in a state of constant excitement. As she walked through the club, the air would brush over her skin and call her attention to the dampness of her pussy.</p><p>Every now and then, she\u2019d catch sight of Agent Rhodes as he wandered around, pretending to watch the scenes and trying to appear as if he belonged there. He\u2019d probably never set foot in a BDSM club before, and he was so not a dom.</p><p>Had he spotted anyone suspicious? Rhodes and Kouros had told her not to look for the perp, but she\u2019d tried anyway. Unfortunately she couldn\u2019t figure out how she\u2019d differentiate him from any other man. All the doms intimidated her\u2014hell, the whole place did. She\u2019d never seen a club like this. The dark Goth clubs she\u2019d visited in college compared to the Shadowlands like SpongeBob cartoons to a Hitchcock movie.</p><p>Ominous atmosphere? The Shadowlands did it with style.</p> <p>Leather everywhere: the heavy couches and chairs, the floggers and whips and tawse hanging on the walls, the bondage tables and spanking benches. Black iron chandeliers and wall sconces sent flickering light over members who wore everything from nipple clamps to skintight, head-to-toe latex and stiletto boots. Master Marcus had sure told the truth about the range of styles. He wasn\u2019t the only dom in a suit, and a couple of dommes dressed that way too. Not every dom wore black, but she\u2019d noticed the ones who didn\u2019t still had an aura of sheer self-confidence and command.</p><p>The roped-off scene areas stayed busy, giving her a fast education in the lifestyle. Floggings she\u2019d witnessed before, but this place had a special, extra-large area for whip play. Talk about scary. She\u2019d never seen nasty-looking electrical things pushed inside vulnerable places and turned on. Or needles stuck into nipples for fun. Fun? Or sex in every way, shape, and form.</p><p>As she headed away from the bar with her drink orders, she saw a woman lying on a sawhorse bench. And...dear heavens, two guys, one man thrusting into her pussy, the other getting a blowjob. The sub\u2019s arms were strapped down\u2014she couldn\u2019t prevent them from doing anything they wanted. Gabi totally forgot to serve drinks, gawking like a virgin at a strip joint.</p><p>Why did watching this seem so erotic? She tried to imagine herself there, and a flash of terror ran through her and was burned away by the heat. Boy, talk about confusion...</p><p>She caught Marcus\u2019s masculine scent of amber and musk a second before he stopped behind her. Looking over her shoulder at his stern jaw, she tensed, expecting he would berate her for taking a break. Instead he wrapped an arm around her waist and touched her\u2014intimately\u2014right out there with all the spectators.</p><p>Oh God. She squirmed as his fingers slid through the wetness of her pussy, and realized she\u2019d grown even damper while watching the scene.</p><p>\u201cWell, sugar,\u201d he murmured in her ear, \u201cobviously a m\u00e9nage is one I\u2019ll add to your list to try.\u201d</p><p>His touch zinged across her nerves, increasing her arousal like fanning a flame. She squeezed her drink tray as she tried to hold it steady, and she couldn\u2019t figure out if she wanted to push him away\u2014or grab his hand and move it up an inch to reach her clit, and that was just wrong. I\u2019m here to do a job, to act like a bratty sub. Get to work, Gabi. \u201cTry two men? No way, Jose. Ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d she said loudly, expecting another swat on her thigh for rudeness.</p><p>He smacked her mound. The light stinging slap sent fire and pain ripping through her. She almost dropped the tray as she tried to jerk away. He hauled her back against his chest with frightening ease.</p><p>He said in a level voice, \u201cBe respectful, trainee.\u201d He released her and walked away, leaving her much, much hotter than a minute before. Her abused clit burned, her labia stung, and the glasses on the tray she held rattled.</p><p>She not only felt hotter, but inadequate too. Marcus sounded like her father\u2014cold and controlled. Her shoulders hunched at the memories. Never good enough for him or Mother. Not good enough for here either. Marcus already thought he\u2019d gotten a loser of a trainee, yet she hadn\u2019t attracted a kidnapper. Had she? She glanced around uneasily, wondering if the perp watched her.</p><p>No matter. I can only do my best.</p><p>After a slow breath, she forced herself back into action and served drinks, although her pussy was so swollen, she probably appeared bowlegged.</p><p>When she finished, she set her empty tray on the bar with a sigh of relief. Maybe she\u2019d make a quick trip to the restroom and give her nerves a chance to calm down.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle.\u201d Master Cullen waved her closer, then finished drawing a beer. He nodded to two drinks on the bar top. \u201cPet, be a good girl and run these over to the couple sitting by the suspension area.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an easygoing grin that had her smiling back. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d A few steps from the bar, she realized she should have smarted off to him. Duh, Gabi.</p><p>At the suspension area, two doms had trussed a submissive in an elegant array of ropes, and she dangled in midair. Nearby a muscular, black-haired dom in black leathers observed the scene. His sub sat beside him, very pregnant and very cute, looking rather like a fat poodle next to a wolf.</p><p>Gabi steeled her nerve. \u201cHere go, dude.\u201d She slapped the two drinks down on the coffee table hard enough to send liquid sloshing over the sides. \u201cOops. My bad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze stopped on her gold-colored wrist cuffs, and his face hardened into solid rock. \u201cHere go, dude?\u201d he repeated softly; then his voice turned cold. \u201cWhat is your name, trainee?\u201d</p><p>Oh crap. \u201cI\u2019m Gabrielle\u201d\u2014don\u2019t say Sir, don\u2019t say Sir\u2014\u201cSir.\u201d The respectful term slipped out; she just couldn\u2019t hold it in under his ruthless stare. Damn, he and Master Marcus had this intimidating stuff down to a science. Don\u2019t let him psych you out. She tsk-tsked at him. \u201cMy grandmother said you shouldn\u2019t frown like that because your face might stay that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a death wish,\u201d he said under his breath. Rising\u2014and oh, joy\u2014the guy was as tall as Marcus. He gripped her arm and glanced at his sub. \u201cWait here, Kari. I\u2019ll return in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d his sub said and gave Gabrielle an appalled look.</p> <p>After glancing around, the dom dragged Gabi across the room to a station where a domme caned a potbellied, older man. Gabi winced as the man\u2019s gag-muffled groan followed each whacking noise. The nasty dom didn\u2019t plan to borrow that cane, did he?</p><p>He pulled Gabi farther, heading straight toward...Master Marcus. Hell.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s smile faded when he saw Gabi. \u201cIs there a problem with the trainee, Master Dan?\u201d</p><p>Oh, this is not good.</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d The dom stared down at Gabi. She hadn\u2019t realized brown eyes could look so pitiless. \u201cEither incredibly poorly trained or simply insolent. I think insolent, myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Master Marcus\u2019s gaze dropped to her. \u201cThat would be a downright pity, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Okay, blue eyes could definitely turn colder than brown ones. A tremor shook her body as the dom passed her off, and Master Marcus\u2019s equally merciless grip closed around her upper arm. \u201cI do thank you for bringing her to me, Master Dan. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>One corner of Master Dan\u2019s mouth curled up. \u201cGood enough.\u201d He gave her a dismissive look as if she were a puppy that had peed on his kitchen floor, and walked away.</p><p>She shifted her weight and peeked up from under her eyelashes at the suit.</p><p>Arms folded over his chest, he studied her with disapproval. \u201cWell, you got yourself in a heap of trouble. Did you not understand my instructions as to the behavior of a trainee?\u201d</p><p>Why did she feel as if she\u2019d let him down? Making him happy wasn\u2019t her job. The cheerleading team in her brain started chanting brat, brat, brat, and she said in an irritating whine, \u201cI\u2019ve served drinks all night, and my feet are tired, and I just wanted to have a little fun. He didn\u2019t have to be such a jerk about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour feet are tired, and you want to have fun. I see.\u201d His lips curved slightly. \u201cThen we might should get you off your feet.\u201d</p><p>His hand closed on the back of her neck again as he headed over to a small sitting area where a younger dom and one with silvery gray hair sat talking. The older one glanced up. \u201cMarcus, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite well, thank you, sir.\u201d The warm reply was a vast contrast to how he\u2019d sounded a second ago. \u201cMaster Sam, I would like to offer y\u2019all a coffee table for your comfort. She complained her feet are tired, so I have a notion that resting on hands and knees would suit her better.\u201d</p><p>Coffee table? When Gabi tried to pull away, Master Marcus slid her legs right out from under her so quickly she\u2019d have belly flopped if he hadn\u2019t caught her. \u201cHands and knees, please, Gabrielle,\u201d he said and set her on the floor.</p><p>This was...just wrong. Avoiding the legs beside her, she sidled around far enough her butt was toward the wall at least.</p><p>He sighed and picked her up, setting her back down with her ass toward the center of the room, then shoved a foot between her knees, forcing her legs apart. Exposing her more fully. \u201cYou stay right there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, boss,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Stinging pain slashed across her bottom, and she yelped.</p> <p>\u201cSilence, sub,\u201d the old guy said, motioning with the switch he held. A switch. Hell, no wonder it'd hurt. His pale blue eyes examined her without any compassion at all. \u201cI dislike noisy coffee tables.\u201d</p><p>Marcus ran his hand over the burning spot. When she winced, he chuckled. \u201cGabrielle, you will serve as a coffee table until I return. I would recommend you hold very still\u2014anyone whose drink you spill can have a blowjob from you.\u201d</p><p>A blowjob? She stared up at him in disbelief, a solid knot forming in her stomach. I don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t want to be here.</p><p>He paused, and his voice took on a deeper, cutting edge. \u201cAm I clear?\u201d</p><p>She really, really didn\u2019t have the guts to challenge him\u2014not when he used that tone. Tears blurred her vision. \u201cY-yes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He bent and stroked his hand over her hair. \u201cMuch better. I\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t find this a comfortable time, sugar.\u201d The sympathy in his voice made her want to lean into him. To beg him not to leave her.</p><p>But he did. He walked away. She dropped her head, not willing to look at anything or anyone. Naked, on hands and knees, her butt exposed. A second later, the old man set his beer on her back. The cold, damp bottle made her jump, and thank God, he\u2019d kept hold of the drink or she\u2019d have knocked it right off. The younger man put his can of beer on her too. They must keep the refrigerator here at subzero temperatures, she thought as goose bumps rose on her skin.</p><p>She stayed in place, not moving a muscle, and realized after a few minutes that having her legs spread helped her balance. Not that she\u2019d ever forgive Mr. Perfect anyway.</p><p>The two men talked, arguing over Tampa\u2019s baseball team, over a recent suicide off the Skyway Bridge, over Master Z\u2019s mouthy sub and her latest infraction. They picked their drinks up, set them down, paying as much attention to her as if she really were a coffee table.</p><p>Then she realized Master Sam had set his drink right on the edge of her shoulder blade. Feeling the bottle teeter, she stopped breathing. It settled. Tiny little breaths. Don\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI do think she makes a fine piece of furniture.\u201d Marcus\u2019s voice came from behind her, and she startled, just a tiny bit, caught herself...and the bottle tipped. The glass hit her back, and cold beer drizzled off her ribs and downward to pool at the base of her spine. Horror ran through her, and her fingernails dug into the hardwood floor. No no no. At least the other man had already picked his can up or she\u2019d have spilled them both. She pushed herself up to a kneeling position, and the cold beer trickled down between her butt cheeks, making her anus pucker.</p><p>\u201cHell, I hadn\u2019t finished yet,\u201d came the gruff tones of the older man.</p><p>\u201cTruly a shame.\u201d Marcus shook his head at her. \u201cWell, she\u2019ll do better next time, I assume.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t fair. You guys set me up, you bastards. Gabrielle saw the older guy unfasten his leather pants, and she closed her eyes. Oh no. They wouldn\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cShe any good at this?\u201d Sam asked Marcus.</p><p>\u201cFirst night here. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cDo you prefer me to direct her, or will you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need any stinking directions. But she sure wouldn\u2019t smart off to Marcus right now\u2014giving a stranger a blowjob was bad enough. I don\u2019t want to do this.</p><p>\u201cFeel free.\u201d Sam sheathed himself with a condom, glanced at her. \u201cI prefer being covered. Get up here, girl.\u201d He leaned back and closed his eyes, his cock rising from his leathers like a flagpole.</p><p>She blinked up at Marcus, wanting to break down and beg.</p><p>He simply waved his hand toward Sam in a \u201cget on with it\u201d motion.</p><p>She crawled over and knelt between Sam\u2019s legs. Biting it off would probably come across as a little too defiant. Satisfying...but stupid. Her heart pounded, and her hands had gone clammy. She combed her hair back. I\u2019ve done oral sex before. I\u2019m actually pretty fair at it. After wetting her lips, she took a firm hold and started to put his cock into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSlower, sugar,\u201d Marcus murmured.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>He\u2019d taken the empty armchair next to Sam. Leaning back, he crossed his legs at the ankles, as if he\u2019d settled in for a Sunday football game. \u201cLick him like an ice cream cone. Tease him a smidgeon before you get down to business.\u201d</p><p>Tease him? She\u2019d planned to get him off as quickly as possible. But from the implacable set of Marcus\u2019s jaw, the dom figured to draw this out. Or maybe he considered it part of instructing a trainee. Her heart sank\u2014she had told him she wanted to jump right in. With a silent sigh, she licked up Master Sam\u2019s cock.</p><p>He\u2019d used an orange-flavored condom. A giggle escaped her. He opened his pale blue eyes and winked before closing them again.</p><p>After that, somehow, it wasn\u2019t difficult to do a good job. Marcus supervised the entire time, murmuring soft instructions. \u201cCircle the tip.\u201d \u201cSuck hard.\u201d \u201cMassage his balls with one hand.\u201d \u201cGrip the base tightly.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t felt excited about doing this, but somehow having Marcus watch set her pulse racing. Her breasts tingled where they rubbed against Sam\u2019s pants, and she flushed. How could she get excited by this...this humiliation? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth had started to tire when Sam stiffened and came.</p><p>\u201cVery nicely done, sugar,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop yet. Ease him down gently.\u201d</p><p>When Sam\u2019s cock softened, Marcus pointed to a small stand discretely camouflaged by the ferns in the planter. \u201cFetch some wipes. Clean him up and dispose of the condom.\u201d She started to rise, and he added, \u201cYour response is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she snapped before thinking. She came to attention, saluted, and included a glare for good measure.</p> <p>As she stalked away, she heard Sam\u2019s gravelly voice. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a fun time with this one, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>Probably just as well she didn\u2019t hear Marcus\u2019s reply. When she\u2019d finished cleaning Master Sam, he ruffled her hair. \u201cGood job, girl.\u201d After tucking himself back into his faded leathers, he rose and headed for the bar.</p><p>Gabrielle hesitated. What now?</p><p>Before she could stand, Marcus leaned forward, grasped her around the waist, and pulled her between his knees, her back to him. With firm hands, he adjusted her position until she knelt, bare bottom resting on her heels, knees widely spread, and her palms on her thighs. As his hands covered hers, she saw white scars and thickened skin over his knuckles. A lawyer that got in fights?</p><p>Leaning forward, he squeezed her shoulders, and his cheek brushed against her hair as he spoke softly in her ear. \u201cWhen I say kneel, this is the posture I wish you to take. Concentrate on getting here quickly for now. We\u2019ll work on gracefulness later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she said, not wanting to fight. His legs enclosing her felt...good, as did his warm hands on her chilled skin and his cheek against her ear. Safe. And maybe he even liked her a little bit.</p><p>He reached around her to caress her breast. She bit her lip, wanting to push into his touch, and that just didn\u2019t make any sense. Why did it feel as if he had the right to fondle her? With anyone else, she\u2019d feel as if she were being groped.</p><p>When he slipped his other hand between her open legs, she stiffened. He simply continued, sliding his fingers in her wetness, and pleasure flooded her senses.</p><p>\u201cWell, sugar,\u201d he whispered, one finger tracing circles around her clit. \u201cYou might act like you didn\u2019t enjoy making Sam happy, but you seem a tad aroused. Might that be true?\u201d</p><p>A mortified flush scalded her cheeks. True, she hadn\u2019t wanted to start, but sucking on Sam\u2019s cock, hearing Marcus\u2019s firm instructions\u2014and imagining his cock instead\u2014had sizzled her veins.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, sugar.\u201d He pinched her nipple, a small admonishment, and dammit, she was hot enough the tiny pain sent a shot of electricity straight to her pussy. It sure didn\u2019t help her focus that his finger kept sliding up and over her clit.</p> <p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s true,\u201d she said sullenly.</p><p>The lack of a Sir earned her another pinch, on her clit this time, and she yelped. \u201cSir. Yes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, you seem to have difficulty following the rules. Are you sure you want to be here? I do think a trainee position is demanding too much of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it.\u201d Maybe. However, physical punishment might be easier than him turning her on as easily as if he\u2019d flipped a switch. And her emotions were...off. She wanted to stay right here with his arms around her. But that wasn\u2019t the job. Decoy. I\u2019m a decoy.</p><p>\u201cYou are a stubborn little thing.\u201d He released her. \u201cStand on up now.\u201d</p><p>Already missing the safety and the warmth of his embrace, she rose to her feet. Off to one side, a group of both submissives and doms were observing and laughing. She\u2019d acquired an audience. Time for bratty sub to emerge.</p><p>But...oh God, she didn\u2019t want another one of his punishments. She wrapped her arms around herself, feeling cold. Alone. Wanting him to hold her again. Stupid her, for wishing he\u2019d like her.</p><p>Stupid her for thinking about anything but the task at hand.</p> <p>As Marcus stood, Gabi motioned to the audience and said loudly, \u201cEveryone else in this place has on clothes. This isn\u2019t fair, S\u2014\u201d She barely kept herself from saying Sir. What the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>His mouth thinned. \u201cWell now, I reckon we can find you something to wear.\u201d As she stared at him in surprise\u2014he\u2019d caved in?\u2014he led her back to the bar.</p><p>The giant bartender wandered over. \u201cWhat can I get you, Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe I could use some thick nylon rope and upper decorations, paper and a marker.\u201d</p><p>The bartender rummaged under the bar. As he set out a coil of rope and the rest of Marcus\u2019s requests, he shook his head at her. \u201cHave you been a bad sub, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just being pissy,\u201d she said and got a snort of laughter from the bartender. She frowned at the items on the bar. Rope? \u201cBut...but I wanted clothes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be here? Then show me.\u201d Master Marcus\u2019s cold voice shriveled her willpower to nothing.</p><p>Under his pitiless blue gaze, she couldn\u2019t find...anything...to say. Staring up at him, she realized that despite Z\u2019s assurance that Marcus would keep her for a month, this dom might refuse to work with her. And he was the only trainer. \u201cI do want to be here.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth turned up, as if he saw her uncertainty. \u201cThen wear your...clothing...politely for the remainder of the night.\u201d Marcus wound the rope around her, his sure hands twining it under and between her breasts, pulling it until the pressure caused her breasts to stick out and the skin to tauten.</p><p>It felt...strange. Snug as if the ropes held her in an embrace. And as he touched her, as his intent eyes studied her, she tingled and her nipples bunched into little points.</p><p>Once finished, he nodded in satisfaction and opened the small plastic envelope on the bar top. Two beaded pieces of jewelry fell into his hand.</p><p>She frowned, recognizing them a second before he bent and put his mouth over her left nipple. He set a hand behind her butt and prevented her from stepping back. Oh my God.</p><p>He sucked forcefully, his tongue swirling around the crest. As her breast swelled, the ropes seemed to compress even more, and the feeling of his mouth...pulling...sent pleasure spiraling to her pussy. He straightened and rubbed her nipple, keeping it erect as the skin dried. By the time he stopped, she was ready to moan.</p><p>Until he put a clamp on the very swollen, sensitive peak.</p><p>She squeaked, tried to grab her breast to yank the damned thing off, and he caught her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll settle in a minute, but as contrary as you are, I got a notion you won\u2019t leave these in place,\u201d he said, his eyes on her face. \u201cLet\u2019s just remove the temptation.\u201d He forced her hands behind her back, and one snick later, he\u2019d locked her handcuffs together. And oh, God, the position squeezed the clamp until it felt like fingernails were biting into her nipple.</p><p>Under the feel of the cuffs, the control he took over her, she couldn\u2019t hold back her whine. \u201cPlease, Sir.\u201d</p><p>His head tilted and he studied her. \u201cPlease release you? Or give you more?\u201d</p><p>The accuracy of his question stabbed right through her. The clamp hurt and yet... More. I want more. Push me, control me... \u201cRelease.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t free her, neither from the restraints, nor his gaze for a long, long minute. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not being truthful with me...and you\u2019ve also proven you have no discipline whatsoever.\u201d He bent and sucked on her other breast, squeezing the areola between his teeth. Fire shot down into her pussy. Again he teased her with his fingers until her nipple dried.</p><p>The second clamp went on, and she hissed at the stinging, burning pain. She twisted and yanked on her cuffs to get free. \u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>He studied her face. \u201cYou have a safe word, Gabrielle. You could use it about now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t he? \u201cNo,\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>His eyes hardened, and he tugged on one clamp. \u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d Damn you to hell and back. She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your arousal, sugar,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDo not continue to sass me, or I will bend you over a bar stool and take you right now so everyone else can see how excited you are.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>But from the unyielding look in his eyes, she knew he would. And the image, the thought of how it would feel to be taken here by him made liquid pool in her lower half. How could this merciless lawyer be the first man to excite her in...forever?</p><p>Even knowing she should keep poking at him, she bit her lip and kept silent. I really, really don\u2019t want to play the brat anymore. Besides, she had the people around the bar avidly watching, so maybe she\u2019d done enough for now. She\u2019d definitely annoyed Mr. Lawyer, after all.</p><p>He wrote on the paper and tucked it under the rope. She tried to see, but her breasts blocked her view of the writing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to serve drinks any longer tonight. Go and walk ten laps around the bar. Since you appear to enjoy attention, you can let the doms admire your...clothing.\u201d</p><p>He waited. With a sigh, he tugged on a clamp strongly enough her response broke right out of her. \u201cYes, Sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake yourself off then.\u201d</p><p>Agent Rhodes was sitting off to one side, sipping his drink and watching. As Dickhead's gaze traveled over her roped and clamped breasts and his mouth twisted into a sneer, she felt cheap. Dirty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She firmed her lips and continued on, trudging toward the back of the bar, wishing she could leave. But she couldn\u2019t. This is for you, Kim. And when you\u2019re home, we\u2019ll go out and laugh about what I did to get you back. We will.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder and realized Master Marcus hadn\u2019t moved. As he talked with Cullen and another dom, he watched her as if wondering what she\u2019d do next. Yet his expression didn\u2019t make her feel dirty\u2014just powerless, which somehow melted her insides.</p><p>A second later, a young dom stepped into her path. \u201cCool jewelry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d She tried to detour around him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rude one.\u201d He grasped one dangling nipple clamp in one hand, using it like a painful leash as he cupped her other breast.</p><p>Owwww. Hands clenched, she held still, knowing Marcus watched. Had given permission. Somehow that made this stranger\u2019s touch feel right, even disconcertingly exciting. The dom fondled her breasts until they burned, and let her go.</p><p>Two more doms did the same. What had Marcus written on the paper?</p><p>It didn\u2019t stop. Her snapping and insults simply resulted in the clamps getting tugged until her breasts cried for relief. She tried walking faster, but doms still slipped off the bar stools to stop her. Two laps. Three. And all the time she walked, she felt Master Marcus studying her.</p><p>Eight laps...</p><p>Ten laps. Oh thank God, she\u2019d made her ten. She looked around. With the club almost empty, she didn\u2019t need to play decoy any longer. Her night was over, and she wanted to go home so badly she shook like an addict needing a fix.</p><p>Marcus still sat on the bar stool, sipping a drink, his face unreadable.</p><p>She stopped in front of him, saw no one stood close enough to hear. \u201cPlease, Sir. Can I get these off? May I go home now?\u201d If he said no, she\u2019d probably cry.</p><p>The fine lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. \u201cSugar, since you asked so prettily, I\u2019m happy to do that little favor for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected him to free her wrists first. Instead he pinned her between his knees. He set one hand on her left clamp and said, \u201cBrace yourself, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He removed the clamp.</p><p>\u201cAaaaah!\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the wail from escaping as blood rushed into her abused nipple. Locked securely behind her back, her arms jerked futilely. Her breast burned as if he\u2019d covered it with acid.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He bent and licked lightly over the sore peak, easing the burn slightly, and soon each circle of his wet tongue sent erotic pulses to her pussy.</p><p>As the ache receded and the heat inside her increased, she realized she was panting. She tried to retreat.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo, stay here, sugar.\u201d He tucked an arm around her waist, an iron bar imprisoning her.</p><p>Before she had a chance to get ready, he detached the other clamp\u2014the sadistic bastard\u2014and gently touched her breast with his tongue. The sensations roiling inside her were too much: pain and need and confusion. Like an earthquake, a shaking started in her stomach and worked its way out until even her knees trembled.</p><p>He straightened, his hands on her waist keeping her from falling. After studying her for a moment, he unclamped her cuffs and pulled her into his arms. She laid her head in the hollow of his shoulder and felt as if the world around her were crumpling. What was wrong with her?</p><p>His arms tightened, his rock-hard body a place of stability. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Darlin\u2019. Shhh.\u201d</p> <p>The pain eased to a low throbbing, and her trembling diminished as she rested against him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had on nipple clamps before, have you?\u201d he murmured. \u201cNever done a public blowjob, never had rope work, never really submitted. Was anything on your application honest?\u201d</p><p>He knew. Closing her eyes against the sense of failure, she swallowed. \u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the lies?\u201d His voice was level, and his arms firm around her. His chest rose and fell slowly and evenly with each breath.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure you\u2019d take me as a trainee.\u201d At least that was honest.</p><p>As if he could tell, he sighed. \u201cMeans that much to you, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Anxiety ripped at her. Must he keep asking questions? \u201cI-I can\u2019t explain really. It\u2019s just something I want\u2014I need.\u201d For Kim.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He didn\u2019t move for a minute. Two. \u201cAll right, Darlin\u2019. If Master Z is willing to give you a chance, I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>Oh thank God, he wasn\u2019t going to make her leave. Relief brought tears to her eyes, and her voice thickened. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me again, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d have to lie to him her entire time here. She had a moment to get her expression under control before he set her back, holding her for a second to ensure she could stand. She kept her gaze lowered so he wouldn\u2019t read the guilt in her eyes. Let him think her embarrassed or ready to cry or whatever.</p><p>After removing the paper from under one rope, he set it on the bar. He unwound everything quickly, making the throbbing in her breasts increase again. When she tried to touch them, he brushed her hands aside, and smiling slightly, he massaged them, ignoring her moan of pain, giving her a level look when she clasped his wrists to make him stop.</p><p>She let her arms fall to her sides, although her hands fisted. Pain mingled with pleasure as each brush of his fingers on her nipples sent need shooting to her clit. She bit her lip, feeling the heat rising within her. When she chanced a peek at him, he was studying her\u2014her face, her hands, her shoulders. A slight smile curved his lips.</p><p>\u201cSo, Gabrielle.\u201d His thumbs circled her distended, very sensitive nipples, somehow making her clit throb as well. \u201cWhat did you learn from this lesson?\u201d</p><p>That I\u2019ve never known I could be so turned on. No. Bad answer.</p><p>She glanced at the writing on the paper he\u2019d tucked under the ropes: ENJOY THE PRETTY BREASTS. ENJOY THEM LONGER IF SHE ISN\u2019T RESPECTFUL. MASTER MARCUS.</p><p>No wonder the doms had manhandled her. I\u2019ve learned how really mean you can be didn\u2019t seem like a good answer either. \u201cNot to demand clothing.\u201d</p><p>His mouth thinned slightly. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to demand anything and to show respect, Sir.\u201d Thank God the place had emptied. Even Agent Dickhead had left. He\u2019d wait in the parking lot to trail her discretely to her apartment, undoubtedly hoping the kidnapper would act during his watch.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d His lips curved up. \u201cGive me a kiss and thank me for your lesson in manners.\u201d</p><p>Gee, boss, thanks for torturing me?</p><p>His hands closed around her arms, and he pulled her forward.</p><p>She winced when her nipples mashed against his suit\u2014thank God the material wasn\u2019t rough, she thought, before his lips closed over hers. Velvety and firm. Competent and gentle.</p><p>And then he took her deeper, so hard and fast her head spun. His grip on her arm kept her in place; his other hand cupped her jaw as he plundered, finishing off his lesson of just who was in charge.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The lion\u2019s deep-throated roar sent a chill down Gabi\u2019s spine. Holy hell, she hadn\u2019t been here in a while, and she\u2019d forgotten what they sounded like up so close. The sweat under her arms wasn\u2019t totally from the heat. A voice in her head scrambled around like a mouse, screaming, Run run run! He\u2019ll chomp me down in one bite. She hauled in a breath, smelling the ammonia of cat urine mixed with the tropical flowers and the moist morning air. After checking the lush undergrowth and moss-covered trees for any stalking felines, she hurried to catch up to her group.</p><p>While the mix of men and women listened attentively to the guide, Gabi trailed behind, not paying attention. After all, she\u2019d taken Big Cat Rescue tours before. Today she just wanted to enjoy the cats and not think about last night.</p><p>One out of two wasn\u2019t bad.</p><p>In the next cage, a panther relaxed on a thick tree limb and regarded the group with a poise that reminded Gabi of Master Marcus. And that was the problem. Instead of taking her mind off Marcus, the tawny-colored cats kept reminding her of him. Sleek and smooth and self-confident. Marcus even had the same stalking gait and measuring gaze.</p><p>In contrast she felt like a dog. A round cocker-spaniel puppy tripping over her fat, fluffy feet. Licking everything in sight. She grinned, remembering how she\u2019d licked Master Sam\u2019s orange-flavored cock.</p><p>Yeah, she was doing a fine job of thinking of something else. With a resigned sigh, she stretched, trying to get her body to wake up. She\u2019d gotten back last night hours past her usual bedtime.</p><p>And today she felt just plain tired...and sore too. Even her silkiest bra rubbed painfully on her sensitive, swollen nipples. One more thing to remind her of that damned dom...and how his touch had been so sure and a little rough.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed about him.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t Z have given her to a different dom? One who wasn\u2019t so cold...and then so warm. One minute Marcus had instructed her as if she hadn\u2019t left grade school, and the next he\u2019d kiss her... His lips had been firm, and he\u2019d held her as if he had a right to take what he wanted. She closed her eyes as a full-fledged hot flash turned the air to a sauna\u2019s temperature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dammit. This was not the time to get excited over a guy. As a decoy, she\u2019d fully expected to get swatted or be embarrassed for misbehaving, even to get groped and have sex with people she didn\u2019t know, but she\u2019d never conceived of wanting someone. Of course Marcus was gorgeous, yet she\u2019d never found all that chiseled handsome stuff so hot before. But Mr. Stuffy Lawyer somehow turned her on just by looking at her.</p><p>Maybe due to her lack of recent activity. After Andrew, she\u2019d lost interest in dating, since when she\u2019d broken up with him, she\u2019d realized she\u2019d once again picked a man her parents would approve of. You\u2019d think she\u2019d learn. That kind of man liked her in the beginning, then started getting more and more critical. She never lived up to their expectations\u2014never lived up to her parents\u2019 expectations either. She\u2019d never be perfect.</p><p>Marcus is...and dammit, I don\u2019t like perfect people. Well, it didn\u2019t matter. After another night or so of her insolence, Marcus would hate the sight of her.</p><p>That just made her feel even more miserable.</p> <p>Behind her, from the parking area, the peacocks screamed, recalling her to reality. A bad reality. Grumpily, she trailed after the group, scuffing her sneakers on the dirt path. In a nearby pen, a panther chirped, the sound an octave lower than her cats\" voices.</p><p>Her poor kitties. When she\u2019d moved into the cheap apartment the FBI had obtained for her, her two boys had sulked, displeased at leaving all their well-marked furniture behind. She understood totally. This job made her feel like an animal in a zoo\u2014stuck in a tiny, ugly enclosure under all sorts of rules, with someone watching all the time. It was probably why she\u2019d thought of visiting here this morning, to sympathize with the other trapped beasties.</p><p>She shared another bond with the big cats here. They knew all about hunting.</p><p>Despite the scorching sun, Gabi shivered. I\u2019m prey. Hopefully the kidnapper had taken the bait and was stalking Gabi right now. If not, or if he didn\u2019t try for the other decoys, the investigation would stall until he made a move\u2014undoubtedly in some other city. Part of her wanted to be his chosen one, the hapless victim who'd lure him into a cage of FBI agents. Another part, scared shitless, begged to go home and curl up with her cats.</p><p>How many women had he ripped from their lives and sold? Kouros said the guy could have been doing this for a while. She felt her fingers rubbing the scar on her face and pulled her hand away. I don\u2019t want to be his target. But she had no better way to help her friend. What would happen to Kim\u2014to all the other women\u2014if he wasn\u2019t caught? Stay the course, Gabi.</p> <p>The tour had stopped as the guide talked about a tiger rescued from a zoo. While they watched, an attendant threw a watermelon into a pond. Gabi giggled as the huge cat sprang down a slope and launched himself after it. Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>As she walked to the parking lot, still grinning, she turned her cell phone back on. Two missed calls from Rhodes. Before she\u2019d made it to her car, he called again. Oh joy.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t cutting it, Renard...\u201d He continued on in full Dickhead mode. She hadn\u2019t done a good job or been noticeable enough... \u201cTwo other women made more of a splash than you did last night, Renard. A blonde and a little brunette. Better looking than you too, so tell me why the kidnapper would choose you if he could grab one of them?\u201d</p><p>Well, that hurt. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t, since she knew she wasn\u2019t especially pretty, but still... She bit back her first response. As a social worker, she\u2019d learned that calling someone a sorry-ass loser tended to screw up any chance of cooperation. A shame the scum-sucking dipwad couldn\u2019t grasp the concept. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cBut bear in mind if I\u2019m too badly behaved, they\u2019ll wonder why Z doesn\u2019t boot me out of the trainees. But I\u2019ll try to be louder tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will damn well be louder.\u201d</p> <p>Or what? You\u2019ll take me off this job and get a person with no clue of how to behave in a club? She changed the subject. \u201cDo I have someone watching me during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s always one agent somewhere near you. Just go about your business and leave the work to us.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clamped on the phone. Work, huh? She\u2019d far rather serve as the backup. Maybe she should stick clamps on his dick and let him discover the joys of decoy duty...if anyone could find what was probably an itty-bitty dick. She grinned. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>She snapped the phone shut. He sure hadn\u2019t changed since last year. She grimaced. After a school shooting in Tampa, the authorities had called in victim specialists from other areas, including her Miami office. Dickhead had headed up the investigation, and they\u2019d butted heads over his crass behavior toward women, like the sisters of the shooters\u2014ones who felt they couldn\u2019t say anything. Due to his high connections, her complaints got ignored. He was such a bastard.</p><p>But right now, the bastard had a point. She needed to ramp up her bratty act.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. To think she had competition for the brattiest in the club. Unfortunately the most disobedient sub wouldn\u2019t receive a trophy, but slavery instead. Her amusement died.</p><p>She had agents watching her back, but the other two submissives in the Shadowlands didn\u2019t. If the kidnapper took those women because Gabi hadn\u2019t made a good enough effort... How could she live with that?</p><p>So...must be louder, nastier. She flipped the phone open and shut, trying to think of showy ways to demonstrate she was a badass submissive. Rude attitude, check. Insults? Hmm.</p> <p>She smiled. The teenage victims she counseled sure had good ones. Maybe make a list and memorize some.</p><p>What else could she do to show her brattiness? She slid into her car, then giggled, remembering one of Marcus\u2019s orders.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to shave down there anyway.</p><p>After lifting weights for an hour, Marcus walked into the locker room of the fitness club. He nodded at the lanky college student changing into a karate uniform. \u201cTim, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, man, good.\u201d Tim finished knotting his brown belt. \u201cSensei asked if you\u2019d arrived yet. He wants you to mentor a couple of new boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Marcus frowned. He\u2019d cleared some of his cases, had a closing argument to prepare, another court date after that. As a prosecuting attorney, he never lacked for things to do, but he\u2019d much prefer to guide the next generation in the right direction rather than skewering them in court. He\u2019d find the time. \u201cPlease tell him I would be happy to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood deal. Their mama brought them in\u2014sounds like they\u2019re sliding into a gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d As the young man headed out, Marcus shook his head. Damn gangs. Well, he\u2019d give the sensei a hand with getting the boys onto a better track.</p><p>Pulling on his gi, Marcus glanced at the wall clock. After class, he\u2019d have just enough time to shower and change before heading to the Shadowlands.</p><p>He smiled, looking forward to the evening. He enjoyed working with the trainees and doing scenes with the various subs in the club, but Gabrielle had added a sense of challenge he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. Hadn\u2019t realized he missed.</p><p>And yet he didn\u2019t like misbehaving submissives. As he tied his black belt, he pondered on his anticipation. The new trainee had an appealing little body, soft and curvy. Her face had character, which he believed more attractive than mere beauty, although she was pretty too, with those rich brown eyes and the pale skin warmed by her red hair. So yes, her appearance attracted him.</p><p>Her personality? She had a quirky sense of humor and a soft, sultry giggle that made him laugh. Definitely smart. And she had an easygoing charm\u2014at least when she wasn\u2019t trying to be obnoxious.</p><p>She\u2019d tested him all evening. But the few times he\u2019d seen her submit had been heady. He\u2019d wanted more. Wanted her in bondage, with willing surrender in her eyes.</p><p>What would she be like in bed? When she\u2019d kissed him, she\u2019d focused her entire attention on him. Not worrying about other people, her clothes, her hair\u2014just giving her all. That kind of concentration was as sexy as it was compelling.</p><p>A man had to wonder if she\u2019d concentrate on fucking as completely.</p><p>He started to harden and gave an exasperated snort. Having a woody in a karate class? Bad idea. Besides, it was too early to think about taking the little sub. Too soon to even make solid plans on how to train her. As unpredictable as she was, he\u2019d need to play it by ear. Hopefully he\u2019d figure out why she had such a rebellious attitude, and then he could center some scenes around the problem.</p><p>Smiling, he slammed his locker shut and snapped on the padlock. Any way he looked at it, he doubted he\u2019d be bored tonight.</p><p>Boot camp, Shadowlands-style. The wood floor hurt Gabi\u2019s knees as she knelt in the entryway with the other trainees for Master Marcus\u2019s inspection before the evening began. As he strolled down the line, she kept expecting him to bark out, Is your rifle clean, Private? She stared at the floor. Don\u2019t giggle, dummy.</p><p>Shoes appeared, nice charcoal gray slacks, a suit coat, and... When she met Marcus\u2019s intent gaze, her amusement disappeared\u2014along with the rest of her mind. He held her, frozen in place, with only the power in his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he smiled. \u201cWelcome back to the Shadowlands, Gabrielle. Stand yourself up now.\u201d</p><p>Feeling gawky after the smooth grace of the others, she scrambled to her feet and imitated the stance they\u2019d taken. Feet shoulder-width apart, hands clasped behind her back, straight posture, chin up. Sir, yes, Sir. But as his razor-sharp gaze scrutinized her body, she flushed and her nipples contracted into peaks, thankfully concealed by her vest. Surely that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen in boot camp.</p><p>\u201cYou look very nice,\u201d he said in his deep, molasses-slow voice, and his approval made her feel as if she\u2019d gotten a gold star on her spelling paper. Of course, she deserved a gold star for her attire. She\u2019d gone for a barbaric appearance with a laced-up leather vest and matching short leather skirt. Knowing she\u2019d be barefoot, she\u2019d painted her toenails a garish red. Temporary tattoos of swords and thorns circled her upper arms.</p><p>He ran his hand over one tattoo, and his eyebrows quirked. As his calloused palm continued down her arm, her knees weakened. How could a man\u2019s touch\u2014just his damned touch\u2014mess with her like this?</p><p>His gaze intent on her face, he lifted her hand and nibbled her fingers.</p><p>When her toes curled, he smiled slowly. \u201cTonight you\u2019ll waitress on the dance side of the room. Remember, you may not play with anyone without my permission, but you\u2019re encouraged to stop and talk.\u201d His bourbon-smooth voice spiraled around the top of her spine and slid straight down to her groin like a sip of hundred-proof sex. \u201cWith all the instructions you had last night, I\u2019m not sure I explained this well. Master Z could easily hire waiters, but serving drinks means you meet the doms without the pressure of finding something to say. Make sense, sugar?\u201d</p><p>He paused. Unfortunately she wasn\u2019t here to meet doms, except for one kidnapper. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen off you go.\u201d</p><p>Midway through the night, Gabi\u2019s skin had started feeling too small for her body. Serving drinks should have bored her. But the doms flirted with her. Touched her in a way that would get them tossed out of a normal bar, often caressing the bare strip of skin between her vest and skirt. One even wrapped a big hand around her thigh as he talked to her. Always polite, yet making it clear they might someday ask permission for her...company.</p><p>As she wandered across the Shadowlands with another set of drinks, the music from the corner dance area throbbed against her with an almost sexual rhythm, punctuated by shrieks and moans from the scenes around the room\u2019s perimeter. A lot of the screams came from where Master Sam of the orange-flavored condom was whipping a submissive at the chain station. His nasty-looking, short black whip left long red marks on the woman\u2019s tanned skin.</p><p>Gabi edged closer and cringed at how each pause between strokes seemed calculated to cause the most pain.</p><p>The sub screamed again, the sound higher than before. Sam stopped and talked to her, stroked her hair, and checked the chains and cuffs holding her arms over her head. When the sub mumbled something and smiled, Sam chuckled, kissed her lightly, walked back to his place...and resumed.</p><p>Resumed. God, it was terrifying to watch. I so don\u2019t like pain. Yet the bond between Master Sam and his sub grew as he continued until it was almost visible. He focused on her response to each blow so thoroughly the building could have fallen down without him noticing. That kind of attention was...compelling. Exciting.</p><p>Nonetheless, each crack of the whip made her flinch. No whippings for me, thank you very much. In fact, she really, really hoped to play the brat without getting any painful punishments.</p><p>At the bar, Master Cullen took her tray, a smile on his craggy face. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well, pet, and your serving duties are over. You\u2019re to join Master Marcus now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d She saw his raised eyebrows and amended, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Join Marcus. As she remembered her dream from last night and where Marcus\u2019s hands...and mouth...had been, heat ran through her. She licked her lips. What would he do today? Would he play with her in a scene? Her insides melted like ice cream on a summer afternoon.</p><p>A second later, the excitement faded away, leaving her cold inside. She wasn\u2019t here to have fun. On the contrary, she was here to get noticed...somehow...and she hadn\u2019t succeeded very well so far. Although she\u2019d sassed the members, a bratty waitress didn\u2019t get much notice. She needed to be obnoxious in a dom-sub scene, which meant she\u2019d have to defy Marcus. She pressed a hand over the nauseating knot forming in her stomach.</p><p>The huge bartender leaned a thick forearm on the bar top. \u201cLittle sub, you look worried about something. Is your problem with Master Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d But I\u2019m going to be his problem shortly. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Master Cullen studied her face for a second. \u201cThen talk to him about it, love. That\u2019s what he\u2019s here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She hurried away, unable to insult him after his concern for her. Only she should have been rude anyway. Get over being a nice person, Gabi.</p><p>As she searched the room for Marcus, she stayed alert for anyone who acted too interested in her\u2014although the kidnapper probably didn\u2019t wear a sign saying BAD GUY, and as a new trainee, she attracted attention from everyone.</p><p>She eventually found Marcus watching a scene at the stocks. A male submissive was bent forward with his hands and head secured. His domme wore a strap-on cock and thrust it into his ass as vigorously as any man Gabi had ever seen. Gabi gulped and took a step back. That looked just strange. Fascinating but strange.</p> <p>Although the sub\u2019s moans sounded as if he were dying, his eyes glowed bright with excitement, and his jutting cock seemed ready to burst. \u201cPlease, Mistress,\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease let me come.\u201d</p><p>Poor guy.</p><p>Gabi turned her attention to Marcus. He stood so relaxed, yet had an aura of owning the space around him. Somehow he never seemed off balance, and she never seemed to find hers. With a sigh, she joined him.</p><p>He smiled down at her and ran a finger along her jawline, sending every nerve into \u201cgimme more\u201d entreaties. \u201cYou\u2019re doing well, sugar. Although I hear you\u2019re a tad sassy, the members think you\u2019re a wonderful addition to the trainees.\u201d</p><p>Great, how was she supposed to be a hard-ass when that ass wanted to melt right into a puddle? \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d Then the meaning of what he\u2019d said registered\u2014all her work and they only considered her sassy? Not disobedient? Not disrespectful? Hell.</p><p>\u201cNow rest here a spell and give me your impressions of the scenes you witnessed this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Okay.\u201d She nodded to the strap-on scene. \u201cI can see he\u2019s enjoying himself, but a guy begging doesn\u2019t do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>A corner of Marcus\u2019s mouth tipped up. \u201cNo,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI reckon you\u2019re definitely a submissive.\u201d</p><p>Submissive. The way he said the word sounded like a caress, but somehow in this place, it was a lot more frightening to admit to. In bondage games before, she\u2019d never given up anything except mobility. Here...just the look in Master Marcus\u2019s eyes made her breath stop\u2014the look that said he\u2019d demand more of her than just her physical freedom. The thought was exciting...and terrifying.</p><p>When she instinctively edged away, he curled his hand around her nape and moved her back. The warmth of his palm spread outward until her skin burned. \u201cContinue, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She wet her dry lips and forged ahead. \u201cWell, watching Master Sam whipping someone bothered me. The whip, the pain made me want to crawl under a table and hide.\u201d</p><p>Marcus chuckled. \u201cGood to know. Sounds like there was something that attracted you?\u201d</p><p>The dom could give lessons in observation. \u201cI... The interaction between them? I can\u2019t describe it.\u201d She\u2019d felt that kind of encompassing...communication...just once. Her first time in a club, an older dom, and a short scene. And she\u2019d never found anything close again. Until now.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cThat\u2019s the heart of a scene. Very good. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. The two girls and one guy... I\u2019d have enjoyed it better without the extra girl.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. And waited.</p><p>She tried to retreat again, but his hand still held her in place. This sharing of...private feelings...the more she did, the more uncomfortable it was. She\u2019d told him about the scenes that hadn\u2019t affected her much, but now...</p><p>His thumb stroked the hollow at the base of her skull, giving her goose bumps. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know you. And talking about this stuff is too personal. Answering your questions yesterday was bad enough.\u201d But now he wanted to dig into her fantasies, dammit.</p><p>His hand still curled around her neck, he turned her to face him more fully. The crinkle of the sun lines said he understood, but the set of his jaw said he wouldn\u2019t relent. \u201cYou\u2019re correct. This isn\u2019t a normal dom-sub relationship, and someday I hope you will have a real one. For now, I am responsible not only to watch over you, to teach you, to help you find a good dom...but also to see to your needs.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou... I don\u2019t have needs. I mean, I\u2019m just here\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEveryone has needs, Darlin\u2019. That you think you don\u2019t means we\u2019ll just have to explore longer.\u201d</p><p>This time the goose bumps came totally from his words and the implacable look in his eyes. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cTell me about other scenes.\u201d He regarded her as if he could see right into her heart and soul, and that was just scary. He was demanding more from her than she wanted to give...to anyone.</p><p>No choice. She drew herself up, pretending he wasn\u2019t touching her and that his masculine scent didn\u2019t turn her brain to mush. Think. \u201cThe man locked in the cage creeped me out.\u201d That was safe enough to say. \u201cThe wax play was...\u201d She choked, trying to figure out what to call it. Definitely don\u2019t say interesting and scary erotic. Acting rude when strapped down to a table with wax dripping onto her skin sounded past masochistic. \u201cFrightening.\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWas it now?\u201d Why didn\u2019t he appear convinced?</p><p>\u201cAnd the sub seemed out of it, like she\u2019d had too much to drink or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called subspace, sugar. You could call it drunk on endorphins, maybe. It\u2019s a good thing\u2014a kind of euphoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Huh.\u201d She considered the picture again. The sub had been smiling, obviously close to coming, and higher than a kite. A happy kite. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Better stop while I\u2019m ahead.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen on the scene with the dom taking his sub in the ass?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She swallowed. Oh, had she. The woman had come so violently, she\u2019d screamed louder than the submissive Master Sam had whipped.</p><p>\u201cI see you did.\u201d He put a finger under her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. \u201cAre you interested in trying anal sex, Darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>God yes. No. \u201cUm. Maybe? No.\u201d She rubbed damp hands on her skirt. The thought of him behind her, pushing... \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His right cheek creased. \u201cWell then, we not only need to work on your honesty, but we\u2019ll need to get that pretty asshole of yours prepared.\u201d</p> <p>What? Her \u201cpretty asshole\u201d puckered in terror. And her breasts tightened with arousal. Why did she have so much trouble remembering this was just a job? I\u2019m so confused.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of preparation, you\u2019d best show me your pussy. I forgot to check your work during inspection.\u201d</p><p>Lift her skirt up so he could look at her down there? She flushed, and then the rest of his sentence registered. \u201cCheck your work.\u201d Oh God. Her breath caught, and her stomach dropped right out of her body. She hadn\u2019t shaved. She deliberately hadn\u2019t shaved, but now she really, really wished she had. He\u2019d be so unhappy with her. Disapproving. Like her father, who acted as if she never did anything right.</p><p>I\u2019m not supposed to care about Marcus\u2019s reactions. Bratty sub, bratty sub, bratty sub. She dragged up her inner diva and tossed her head. \u201cWhat work?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as if he saw how much effort it took to put on the rebellious act. \u201cLift your skirt, Gabrielle. Now.\u201d</p><p>The power of his voice swept through her, and she wanted to\u2014needed to\u2014melt into a puddle at his feet. She realized her hands had already gripped the bottom of her skirt and started to lift. No no no. She forced her fingers open, let the skirt drop. What I do must attract attention. Be rude. Blatant. Hauling in a quick breath, she blew a raspberry. \u201cLift it yourself, big boy.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence from him. Then he shook his head. \u201cI believe I will do just that.\u201d He gripped her arm, dropped down into the chair behind him, and yanked her facedown over his knees.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d The realization of what he planned to do hit her. Spank her? As if she were a kid? Humiliation scraped her insides like sandpaper, increasing as she remembered how many people stood nearby. They\u2019d see... The shame and horror and fury tangled into a foaming brew. She kicked frantically and tried to push back to her feet.</p> <p>He shifted her until she had no leverage, and hooked his right leg over her ankles. She felt her leather skirt lifted, a brief wash of air, and then he slapped her bottom. Hard.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Fury won, and she yelled it. Make a scene? If he wanted to spank her, he\u2019d just see what kind of a nightmare a poorly disciplined sub could create. Spank her? \u201cYou fucking dipwad!\u201d</p><p>His voice remained perfectly controlled, but she could feel his anger simmering. \u201cI\u2019m getting downright weary of your ornery behavior. Yesterday, being as you were new, I didn\u2019t take you much to task. But you\u2019re trying to rile me up on purpose, and I do believe you\u2019ve bit off more than you can chew.\u201d</p><p>He paused as if to let her speak, but she had nothing she could say.</p><p>\u201cYou best count for me. If you show me you\u2019re sorry, I\u2019ll stop at ten. Otherwise I\u2019ll spank you until the cows come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dumb-ass idea.\u201d She was too angry to curb her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re a dumb-ass.\u201d She tried to kick and got nowhere. \u201cEven Jesus thinks you\u2019re a dumb-ass.\u201d</p><p>She heard a snort of laughter. Then his way-too-hard hand slapped her left butt cheek.</p><p>Burning pain. \u201cOw!\u201d He can\u2019t do this to me, dammit. \u201cYou dickweed! Are you always stupid, or is today a special occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, I got a notion I might enjoy walloping you. Let me know when you\u2019re fixin\" to start counting, subbie.\u201d Then the blows rained onto her bottom like all hell crashed down on her. And each slap hurt\u2014really, really hurt.</p><p>She kicked and screamed. She needed to make him stop, to do something to hurt him back\u2014she bit his leg.</p><p>He stopped and grabbed her hair before she got a good grip, then yanked her head away from his calf. Ow ow ow. \u201cNo, Gabrielle,\u201d he said firmly as if to a child, and a flash of shame raced through her. She\u2019d tried to bite him?</p><p>He held her head up long enough for her to get the point, then released her hair and spanked her again. Even more harshly. When everything around her seemed to pulse with red-streaked pain, he stopped for a second. \u201cYou want to count, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne!\u201d She sucked in a breath, mad enough the words slid right out. \u201cYou asshole, one!\u201d</p><p>Marcus clenched his teeth together to keep a bellow of laughter from escaping. Nolan and Dan had stopped to watch, and their shoulders shook with the same effort. Damn, how could he want to beat her curvy ass and still think she was so cute?</p><p>He waited until his voice steadied. \u201cBad-mouthing your dom isn\u2019t respectful, subbie. I do believe your count is at zero.\u201d As she squirmed, he caught flashes of her curly pubic hair. He sighed and gave her three more swats, this time on the tender undercurve of her cheeks.</p><p>She let out half a growl, half a shriek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. One! One, okay? One, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cThat does sound better, Gabrielle. One, then.\u201d</p><p>Anger gone, she pressed her face against his leg and began to cry.</p><p>His gut twisted. He enjoyed giving erotic spankings. And although fighting with a screaming little subbie was fun, hurting a crying one was entirely different. This felt too much like kicking a puppy. But backing off would be the wrong choice. She had to learn at gut level that her behavior had consequences.</p><p>Still, he lightened his blows and slowed enough so she could count: \u201cTwo, Sir. Three, Sir...\u201d</p><p>When the count reached ten, he looked at her poor bottom and shook his head. He hadn\u2019t struck her nearly as forcefully as he did masochists and spanking addicts, but her fair, fair skin glowed a fiery red. She might even have a bruise or two just because her soft ass wasn\u2019t accustomed to punishment. He sighed and stroked her back, giving them both a second.</p><p>He noticed Nolan\u2019s sub when she trotted up and handed her dom a tube of lotion. Nolan caught Marcus\u2019s eye and wiggled the tube, then ran his knuckles over Beth\u2019s freckled cheek, her skin almost as pale as Gabrielle\u2019s. The dom had obviously run into the problem before.</p><p>Marcus nodded.</p><p>Nolan came over, flipped open the lid, and squeezed some lotion on Marcus\u2019s palm.</p><p>Wintergreen and the milder sunflower-like scent of arnica drifted in the air. Very nice. \u201cThank you, Nolan.\u201d</p><p>The dom\u2019s rough face held sympathy. \u201cIt really does help,\u201d he said quietly, then led his sub away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, sugar,\u201d Marcus warned Gabrielle. Dammit, this would hurt almost as much as the spanking. He set one hand on her lower back to hold her and started to massage the ointment into her reddened skin.</p><p>Her soft sobs broke into a thin scream, obviously from between gritted teeth.</p><p>Marcus winced. \u201cThis will help the bruising, sweetheart,\u201d he said, and despite her squirming, he did a thorough job.</p><p>Done. Marcus closed his eyes and exhaled. Damn Z for putting him in this position. This little sub should not be in the trainees. He waited another minute, stroking her gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Darlin\u2019,\u201d he said finally and helped her stand. Her face was tear streaked and red from crying, and his heart squeezed.</p><p>He pulled her down to sit on his lap, leaning back so she could get most of her weight off her tender bottom. She still gave little hiccuping sobs, and he cuddled her close. Damn, he hated having to punish a sub, no matter how well deserved, and this time seemed worse than normal. Despite all her insolent behavior, she was a very likable woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked her hair. Why are you here, little sub? \u201cYou could use your safe word, Gabrielle. You don\u2019t need to stay.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Her chin firmed despite her quivering lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and rubbed his cheek on her silky hair, inhaling a feminine fragrance of rose and amber. \u201cAll right, Li\u2019ll Miss Stubborn.\u201d In that case, he needed to reinforce the lesson she\u2019d just learned. Hopefully learned. \u201cRespect, Gabrielle. A submissive must be polite and respectful. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She sighed like a weary child and whispered against his neck, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad. I don\u2019t think either of us wants a repeat of this.\u201d He held her as she settled and relaxed into him, accepting his comfort, which helped them both feel better. As a submissive needed the security of a dominant\u2019s arms, the dominant needed to provide it.</p><p>For some reason, with Gabrielle, his instincts cried out for him to hold her, to shield her, to protect her. Did she seem more vulnerable than most, despite the smart mouth, or was he pulled to her cheerful warmth like a winter fire? He tipped his head back and stared at the dark ceiling rafters. Damned if she wasn\u2019t getting to him. God help me.</p><p>She felt so soft in his arms. Her breathing evened out, and her slender fingers unclenched; one hand rested on his shirt over his heart. His shoulders relaxed as he realized she was snuggling. How long since he had held a woman who snuggled against him?</p><p>With a silent sigh, he pressed a kiss to the top of her head. \u201cUp you go, Darlin\u2019.\u201d When she rose, he steadied her on her feet. \u201cNow show me your pussy.\u201d</p><p>This time she not only didn\u2019t smart off but looked downright frightened. Slowly she lifted her skirt and showed him the red curls still adorning the mound he\u2019d ordered her to shave.</p><p>When Master Marcus shook his head in disapproval, Gabi took a step back and tried to blink away the tears filling her eyes. Her butt hurt so bad, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d survive more punishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fixin\" to spank you again, Gabrielle,\u201d he said and rose, \u201calthough I am disappointed.\u201d Without further words, he hooked her cuffs together behind her, guided her to the submissives\" sitting area, waited for her to kneel, and attached a chain from the floor to her cuffs.</p><p>\u201cYou just set here awhile. I\u2019ll send for you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how much she loved the molasses-thick warmth in his voice until it had turned cold. She lowered her head, unable to summon any ambition to act like a brat.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Well, that had been amusing. The spotter for the Harvest Association sipped his bourbon as Marcus dragged the redhead to the area for chaining up submissives when their masters had duties elsewhere. Delightful show she\u2019d put on, but now she appeared rather subdued. If one good spanking knocked the defiance out of her, she wouldn\u2019t do at all.</p><p>Fairly pretty, although a shame about the scar. Marred goods brought a lower selling price. But she was a decent age. Young enough to appeal, old enough to have some reserves. The ones inexperienced in life tended to shatter like glass. The Harvest Association prided itself on offering quality stock, and for the upcoming auction, they were selling an attitude, essentially promising that a master would have a good amount of fun before he finally broke his new slave.</p><p>Well, no hurry to make a decision. He\u2019d already targeted two subs from the Shadowlands. They could pick this one up in the next harvest if she proved satisfactory.</p><p>He smiled. He did have a fondness for red hair.</p><p>Marcus would take requests from doms to scene with her. Might be fun to sample the goods beforehand.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s knees hurt. Her butt hurt. Her eyes felt swollen from crying, and her running mascara undoubtedly made her look like a raccoon. But inside she felt...content. Warm like when the kitties lay on her stomach.</p><p>He\u2019d spanked her.</p><p>Damn him, she told herself, trying to find a spark of true anger. None there. She\u2019d pushed him. Mostly as her bratty decoy dictated, but...part of her had wanted to see how far she could go. How far he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>Not far at all, and he\u2019d corrected her instantly. Painfully. He sure hadn\u2019t done the constant, silent disapproval like her parents. And then he\u2019d held her as if the spanking had wiped her slate clean.</p> <p>Had she hoped he wouldn\u2019t put up with her crap? Would take charge and punish her?</p><p>After fifteen minutes or so, she still hadn\u2019t discovered any explanation for her weird emotions. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a flash of red.</p><p>In a short red vinyl skirt and bustier, the brunette trainee who always seemed so energetic trotted over. \u201cHi, Gabrielle. I\u2019m Sally, if you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Gabi straightened and pulled herself together. \u201cYou can call me Gabi. It\u2019s a little easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Gabi.\u201d The brunette leaned against a chair and massaged her foot. \u201cDamn Master Z\u2019s rules that subs either go barefoot or wear \u00fcbersexy stilettos that would leave us crippled. More crippled.\u201d</p><p>Gabi managed a smile. \u201cMy feet haven\u2019t hurt like this since I waitressed in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, girlfriend, if your feet are the only things hurting at the end of an evening, you\u2019re in good shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So I\u2019ve found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really pounded on you good.\u201d Sally gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cWhen he took us from Master Cullen, I thought he\u2019d be a pushover. He\u2019s such a gentleman, you know. So polite and he never raises his voice, but damn, he\u2019s strict.\u201d</p><p>Gabi grimaced. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s death on bratty behavior. I heard him tell Nolan that his ex-wife acted out a lot, and we\u2019ve noticed he chooses only the super-obedient ones for himself. Like his girlfriend\u2014she makes you want to gag, she\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>He wanted his subs obedient and sweet. The information sent a pang through Gabi. He\u2019ll never like me then. Even if she wasn\u2019t acting defiant for the FBI, she\u2019d still never be considered amenable. That just wasn\u2019t part of her makeup.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, he wants you in the medical room. Do you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the back, down a hallway on the right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Sally unhooked the chain and unclipped Gabi\u2019s cuffs, freeing her hands.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Trying to imagine what Marcus planned, Gabi threaded her way across the room, around a knot of arguing doms, past a crying sub with a domme whispering, \u201cThere, there.\u201d She dodged a gay couple working out their upcoming scene. Every man got a quick look to see if the perp might somehow give himself away. No such luck.</p><p>She passed the Goth-looking trainee and received a disapproving stare...as if her insolent behavior reflected badly on the other trainees. Gabi hadn\u2019t thought about how the other subs would view her actions, and a stab of guilt made her wince. Sorry.</p><p>In the hallway, she approached the medical room with increasing apprehension. Last night she\u2019d seen all the nasty-looking equipment...and Marcus was angry at her. She stopped in the doorway, absently rubbing clammy fingers over the scar on her cheek.</p><p>The gynecological table took up the center of the room. A sink and cupboards occupied the left, shelves at the rear, and a rolling stand with an enema bag hanging from it stood in one corner.</p><p>By the sink, Master Marcus was removing his coat. He tossed it over the back of a chair and rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt, baring disconcertingly muscled forearms. Spotting Gabi, he patted the exam table. \u201cUp here, sugar. On your back.\u201d</p><p>Her feet stuck to the floor as if someone had covered the hardwood with adhesive. Last night she\u2019d been appalled to see a woman getting an enema. It hadn\u2019t looked like fun at all. Surely he wouldn\u2019t...would he? She didn\u2019t even have to fake her defiance this time. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re planning, I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI believe I instructed you in the proper response to a command?\u201d</p><p>The authoritative look in his eyes killed her rebellion dead. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She moved toward the table so slowly he huffed a laugh and grasped her by the nape again as if she were a cringing cur. Yet the feel of his warm, firm hand settled some of her nerves, making it easier to jump up onto the table. Her sore bottom met the cool leather, and she squeaked.</p><p>He chuckled. Then with his hand behind her back and another between her breasts, he firmly pushed her flat. Her heart jammed itself up in her throat, and she couldn\u2019t help glancing at the pole with the enema bag.</p><p>A crease appeared in his cheek, and he ran his hands up and down her upper arms. \u201cRelax, Darlin\u2019. I\u2019m not going to put long tubes up your pussy or ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sir,\u201d she said fervently. He laughed, and damn, he seemed so different when he smiled that she wanted to say something, anything to keep the curve on his lips. He had a tiny crease off the corner of his\u2014</p><p>\u201cHowever, I am going to strap you down fairly tightly.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot up.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, I\u2019m fixin\u2019 to shave that little pussy of yours.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. No way. \u201cI rather do it myself. Really.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and pushed the metal tray table toward her feet.</p><p>\u201cListen, I appreciate the offer, but I\u2019m not interested in your help.\u201d He\u2019d touch her, look at her down there, and the lighting here was way too bright. Her insides curled right up into a tiny little ball. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask your opinion.\u201d His steady gaze pierced her. Then his lips quirked up. \u201cYou act nervous as a long-tailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs.\u201d</p><p>With good reason, dammit.</p><p>At the foot of the table, he set her feet into the stirrups. When he strapped her ankles in, her eyes widened. Her gynecologist never did that. Oh, this isn\u2019t good.</p><p>After pushing her skirt up to expose her lower half, he slid her down the smooth leather until her butt rested on the edge of the table. A wide strap across her body just below her breasts pinned her arms to her sides. Then he secured another one across her waist and nodded. \u201cThat looks just fine.\u201d</p><p>Just fine? She wiggled, and as the full realization of her helplessness zinged through her, a thin sweat broke out on her body. She couldn\u2019t lift her arms, and her dread rose with each thwarted movement.</p><p>Arms folded, he watched her struggle. \u201cGabrielle.\u201d He spoke just the one word, his voice deep, breaking her out of the panic.</p><p>She looked into his steady eyes. He was utterly self-confident. Controlled. Dominant. A weird, glowy feeling lit inside her like a candle, melting her fears.</p><p>And heating her instead. She tried to close her legs, testing the restraints without success. Her pussy was completely exposed, and he\u2019d be putting those lean, powerful hands on her most private parts. Oh God. More heat poured into her as if the candle had set something aflame.</p><p>He smiled and said softly, \u201cThere we go.\u201d</p><p>A metal stand held a bowl of water, razors, and bottles. After pushing it to the foot of the table, Marcus sat on a rolling stool and stationed himself between her legs. With a tsking sound, he pushed the stirrups father apart, opening her completely.</p><p>She stiffened, unnerved at the way he\u2019d repositioned her. Not asking, just doing. He\u2019d do to her just as he pleased. Excitement tingled across her skin, and she felt her nipples bunching so tightly they hurt.</p><p>The hum of conversation drew her attention to where people stood in the hallway, looking through the huge windows. At her. At her exposed pussy. She moaned and closed her eyes.</p><p>A warm hand stroked over her calf, a soothing, petting gesture. \u201cTrainees are often on display, sugar. Can you handle that?\u201d</p><p>His concern made her breath catch. How long since anyone had worried about her feelings? She tried to push the thought away. Don\u2019t get caught up in this sub stuff, girl. You\u2019re here as a decoy, nothing else.</p><p>And aside from the craving to run screaming out of the place, she was handling it just fine. Handle it better. What if the kidnapper stood out in the hallway with the other people? The thought chilled her and spurred her into action. She rattled the stirrups and snapped, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like I have much choice, now does it? Do you tie up all your girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>Silence. The stool squeaked as he rose. He walked slowly to her side and looked at her for a long minute, and then the sternness in his gaze faded into such understanding that her eyes burned. He cupped her cheek, his thumb stroking over her lips. She had to firm her chin to keep it from quivering.</p><p>\u201cDo you get more mouthy when you\u2019re scared, Darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, trainees have a lot more experience in the lifestyle, and they want what the Shadowlands offers. You, however...\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, jolted into awareness that she might have pushed him too far. She hadn\u2019t even made it through two nights, and he wanted to boot her out. But Z said he couldn\u2019t if she refused to go. \u201cI do, Sir. I want it.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You know, if anyone but Master Z had admitted you...\u201d He sighed. \u201cIf I asked you to leave right now, would you?\u201d</p><p>She set her lips and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re biting off more than you can chew, but so be it.\u201d He looked at her a minute longer, then touched his finger to her nose. \u201cStubborn.\u201d</p> <p>She inhaled in relief as he returned to his stool. A second later, a warm washcloth landed on her pussy, making her jump.</p><p>Marcus frowned through the entire shaving process. He could usually get inside the head of a sub and figure out what made them tick, what they wanted and what they needed as well. But this little one...</p><p>Not used to being handled intimately. Not comfortable with public display although he believed her when she said she\u2019d played in clubs before. The Shadowlands, however, was more personal than a horde of strangers.</p><p>He finished shaving the top of her mound, then inserted two fingers into her vagina, ignoring her gasp. Hot and silky. Very nice. Again he noted her tightness\u2014as if she hadn\u2019t had a man in a long time. He doubted her hiatus from sex came from a low sex drive since she was definitely aroused right now.</p><p>Thrusting unhurriedly in and out of her soft cunt, he felt her muscles constrict around his intrusion. His cock hardened, demanding he intrude farther, but he couldn\u2019t do that. Although he\u2019d arrange scenes for her with other doms, he\u2019d wait for a while before taking her himself. She needed to know she could trust her trainer.</p><p>Eventually though...he looked forward to playing with her. Her sassiness didn\u2019t annoy him, not in the way he\u2019d thought it would. It was more of a challenge. And in between her idiotic rebellions, her cheerful personality drew him like a fire on a cold mountain morning. A few burns from sparks might prove worth the chance to get warm.</p><p>After withdrawing his fingers from her vagina, he pulled the skin taut on her outer labia. She had pretty curls, the same golden red as on her head. A natural redhead. The fiery color was well suited to her personality. The razor scraped her clean, exposing skin the color of rich cream. Plump pink inner folds peeked out from the center.</p><p>He drew her buttocks apart, smiling at her instinctive stiffening, and removed the scant hair closer to her anus. The puckered bud would obviously need some preparation before she accepted a cock there.</p><p>After rinsing off the shaving cream, he massaged in gel to decrease the irritation and considered his problem. Unlike the other trainees, Gabrielle hadn\u2019t been a part of the Shadowlands for months. To make the situation worse, her previous club play had been light. And because of her constant defiance, they\u2019d gotten off to a bad start.</p><p>No wonder Z\u2019s friend considered her a problem. No dom would put up with such excessive insolence for long. Or one might consider it an excuse to whip the hell out of her. The thought turned his stomach, yet he had few choices here. She needed to want to please him more than she wanted to defy him, but until she did or he figured out what would motivate her, he\u2019d have to discipline her.</p><p>It seemed like punishing her was all he\u2019d accomplished tonight. He stroked her thigh and felt the faint quiver. Her eyes were closed, her breathing a little fast, nipples in taut peaks. Needy. Already restrained. Marcus smiled. He\u2019d very much like to give her as much pleasure as he had pain, and nothing made a woman more vulnerable or created a bond faster than giving her an orgasm.</p><p>Leaning forward, he framed her pussy with his hands and ran his tongue up and over her clit.</p><p>She\u2019d known he\u2019d finished when he rubbed in a cool gel and stroked her thigh comfortingly. Gabi relaxed. She\u2019d worried for a minute when he\u2019d pushed his fingers into her pussy, but then he\u2019d simply resumed shaving her. He\u2019d let her up now, and maybe she could leave. She really, really wanted to go home and try to get her emotions back under control.</p><p>She saw him lean forward, felt his hands pull her labia apart, and...something hot and wet slid right over her clit. She jerked so hard the straps pinched her skin. Oh my God! He was licking\u2014licking\u2014her. The blast of heat ran through her like a forest fire.</p><p>His tongue worked inward, stroking newly bare areas never before touched like this, then playing with her clit, teasing the hood and grazing over the very top. Her entire body hit complete need as if she\u2019d turned into a sports car, zero to a hundred in eight seconds.</p><p>She gasped when he pushed two fingers inside her, ruthlessly stretching her open, sending pleasure deep into her core. He pulled back slowly, circled her entrance, then thrust his fingers in and out, setting up a fast, driving rhythm. Dear God, this wasn\u2019t sex play, this was a total you-will-come-now, done by someone who knew just how to make it happen. Her hips kept trying to rise, defeated by the strap across her waist. Pressure formed low in her belly and coiled tight...tighter. She hovered on the peak for just a second.</p><p>And then he pulled her clit into his mouth and sucked, sliding his tongue over the most sensitive spot.</p><p>Everything inside her exploded, shooting pleasure outward so strong and fast that her head should have shattered. More waves of heat burst through her until her fingers tingled.</p><p>His tongue lapped her gently, making her vagina clench again and again, each time meeting the solid fingers inside her. God, she couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t escape, and every time she tried and failed, another wave would sweep over her.</p><p>When the roller coaster finally stopped, he removed his fingers, and she shuddered at the feeling of loss. For a minute, he stroked her thigh, easing her down, and then walked around the table.</p><p>\u201cYou come quite nicely, Darlin\u2019,\u201d he said softly. He put an arm on each side of her shoulders, and she had a moment to see those thick forearms before he bent to nuzzle her neck. His wonderful scent, a subtle amber and musk, surrounded her. When his beard shadow scraped the hollow under her ear, goose bumps bloomed across her body. He kissed her gently, nibbled her lips, and plunged in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could taste herself and then only him as he took her mouth, demanding a response in the same way he had her orgasm. She melted inside under the heady knowledge that he could take what he wanted from her\u2014and she\u2019d give him whatever he wanted.</p><p>When he pulled back, his eyes were heavy-lidded. \u201cYou kiss as nicely as you come, Gabrielle. Next week we\u2019ll have more time together, but I didn\u2019t want to leave you uncomfortable until then.\u201d</p><p>The sound of a high voice drew her notice, and she realized people still stood in the hallway, watching. Audience. She had a job to do, even though she\u2019d rather lie here and soak up his attention\u2014his approving attention that made her feel as if he liked her. Damned if she didn\u2019t really want him to like her.</p><p>No, Gabi. Think, think. Must act like a brat for the audience. A little difficult to do, considering how she was tied down. And she\u2019d just come. Then again, she could attack the man where it would hurt the most\u2014on his performance. \u201cYou think I got off? That was a hiccup from too much lunch,\u201d she said loudly and heard a few gasps as well as a titter of laughter.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAn ornery one, aren\u2019t you? Trainee, I believe you\u2019d best have no confusion over what you\u2019re feeling. Perhaps a lesson is in order.\u201d The expression on his face wasn\u2019t angry, quite, or annoyed, quite. Not even determined. He acted as if she\u2019d merely confirmed his expectations. Without explanation, he turned and took gloves and lube from the shelves beside the sink.</p><p>Glove? Lube? Wait. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, sugar, I think it\u2019s time for another hiccup.\u201d Still standing, he grasped the table\u2019s stirrups and ratcheted them upward until her feet were not only widely spread, but as high as his shoulders. The position lifted her butt an inch, but the strap around her waist kept the rest of her body flat on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s just right.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head to see what he was doing, but he held his hands below the level of the table. Giving up, she laid her head down, wanting to take back her words, yet oddly excited at not knowing what he\u2019d do next. Nothing about him was predictable; she had a feeling he never would be. He was...smart. Maybe too smart for her, and that was an uncomfortable thought.</p><p>After resuming his seat on the stool, he glided his tongue and lips over her pussy, slower this time. Her head started to spin. When he licked over her clit, she clenched her hands at the sudden return of need. He bit her labia, and the strange, stinging pain somehow made everything else more intense. He kept teasing her, and she realized he planned to make her climax again. If she thought to prevent it... Well, she couldn\u2019t, she realized, as her clit hardened under the firm attention of his tongue. No matter what she wanted, he would have her coming again in front of all these people.</p><p>Then something slick and round circled her anus. \u201cWait\u2014I didn\u2019t agree to this. Hey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I planned to explore anal sex in your training later,\u201d he said and pressed his finger against the puckered circle of muscle, making her squirm. \u201cBut things change. You have a tight little asshole, sugar. Push back against me now, and you\u2019ll find it easier.\u201d</p><p>She pulled in an unhappy breath and, realizing she had no choice, did as he asked. A merciless gloved finger penetrated where no lover had ever gone before. A tremor shook her at the way he\u2019d relentlessly done as he wanted.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze.</p><p>He watched her face as his finger eased farther in. Not quite pain. The cool lubricant made him very slick, yet even the slightly increased girth of his knuckle stretched and burned. As he took possession of a place that was so very private, her insides felt funny\u2014as if he\u2019d taken possession of her inner self as well. She tried to squirm away and failed. \u201cNo...please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. You don\u2019t have the reins, sugar.\u201d The controlled power in his low voice slid into her; his steady eyes pinned hers, forcing her to focus on him...and yet his finger didn\u2019t stop moving, the lesson inescapable. He could touch her anywhere.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this. It was too intimate, left her feeling exposed and\u2014</p><p>His eyes released her. He smiled and lowered his head. Oh God, he wouldn\u2019t...</p><p>A whine escaped her when he licked her clit again, so hot, so wet. Before she could adjust to that added stimulation, he slid two fingers inside her vagina, ruthlessly creating a counterpoint of thrusts with the finger in her bottom. His tongue rubbed its demand on one side of her clit, then the other, then the top.</p><p>Sensations blasted through her from too many places, and her arousal grew, building high and hard. Somehow, as if a switch flipped, the uncomfortable sensations in her anus changed into a dark pleasure, merging with the slick sliding in her vagina until her whole pussy\u2014her whole lower half\u2014felt like one giant clit about to explode.</p><p>Every muscle in her body contracted. Her hips lifted futilely against the strap, trying to get closer. Her breath froze, waiting for just a little more, anything more...</p><p>His low chuckle vibrated against her labia, and then he licked insistently right over her clit, his tongue staying on it, wiggling right...there...and everything inside her spasmed in a giant tsunami of sensation, sweeping her away. The sensations from her anus added a whole new dimension until even her skin seemed to expand, billowing outward. God God God.</p><p>As the waves lessoned, and her brain clicked back on, she could still hear her yelping screams echoing around the room.</p> <p>Laughter and some applause came from the hallway. She opened her eyes, blearily realizing that people had definitely watched her. Oh hell.</p><p>\u201cNice hiccups, Gabrielle.\u201d Master Marcus\u2019s final tonguing sent a shudder up her center.</p><p>She bit her lip. I am totally not going to taunt him right now.</p><p>With baby wipes from the tray, he proceeded to clean her so thoroughly, front and back, that a mortified flush heated her face.</p><p>When he finally helped her off the table, her head spun as if she\u2019d ridden a merry-go-round for an hour, and he caught her with a powerful grip before she did a face-plant. Chuckling, he wrapped a blanket around her and sat her in a chair to one side while he cleaned the room.</p><p>He pulled on his suit jacket and stood in front of her for a second, then shook his head and scooped her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cJesus, wait, you can\u2019t carry me,\u201d she gasped. What if lifting her strained his back? What if he dropped her?</p><p>He only laughed. Hell, he wasn\u2019t even watching where he walked.</p><p>She struggled to get out of the confining blanket, and he said in a firm voice, \u201cLie still, Li\u2019ll subbie, or you\u2019ll have a different type of lesson.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that definitely sounded like a threat. She stilled. As he carried her out of the hallway and into the club, she stared at the distant floor, cringed, and looked up at his face instead. He had a stern jawline. His white shirt was opened a couple of buttons, displaying his corded neck. Against her shoulder, his rock-hard bicep bunched, yet he didn\u2019t act as if he carried anything heavier than a...a poodle or something.</p><p>She tried to relax, unsure if she liked the sensation of being cared for\u2014whether she wanted to be or not.</p><p>At a small sitting area hidden from the main room by a row of plants, he settled into an oversize leather chair. She glanced around. Completely private...she wouldn\u2019t have to perform right now.</p><p>He tipped her against his chest, settling her head into the hollow of his shoulder. \u201cThere we go,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAre you comfortable, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered. He was being so nice. Unexpected and unwelcome tears prickled her eyes. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>He pushed her hair back behind her ear, then put a finger under her chin, lifting her face. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u201ethis\"? Holding you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And...and getting me off when you didn\u2019t...and shaving me...and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very inexperienced in true dom-sub relationships, aren\u2019t you?\u201d With her head against him, she could hear the laugh rumbling in his chest. \u201cMany reasons, sugar. First, I\u2019m holding you now because you needed to be held.\u201d He kissed her lips softly. \u201cAs your trainer and dom, it\u2019s my job to see that you get what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wanted down.\u201d</p><p>His mouth turned up in a faint smile. \u201cWhat you need, sugar, not what you want.\u201d</p><p>Why did that send a tremor through her yet make her snuggle closer? Why did an iron-hard arm behind her back feel like safety?</p><p>But as her parents complained, a more argumentative person than Gabrielle had never lived. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to get off.\u201d Hadn\u2019t even thought about it.</p><p>\u201cYou need to learn that pleasure as well as pain comes from your dom\u2019s hands.\u201d His eyes met her, level and confident. \u201cAnd you need to know, right down to the bone, that I have access to every part of your body.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d shaved her, such an intimate task, and touched her, controlled her, forced an orgasm from her. He\u2019d put his finger into her bottom and made her come again. Even now, his arms held her so firmly that she realized she remained under his control.</p><p>Her whole body started to shake as if she\u2019d been sitting in the snow, and her breath thickened, forcing her to work for air. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d signed on for. He kept taking...more, like with a Monopoly game, seeing her hotels and land disappear piece by piece until the banker owned her. I don\u2019t want him to own me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t...</p><p>She tried to get up. His arms caged her.</p><p>He rubbed his chin on the top of her head, enjoying the light feminine scent. He\u2019d discovered the lingering fragrance in the crease of her hip and in the hollow of her neck. Her lotion matched her shampoo. Her clothing today was coordinated, and yesterday her toenails had been the same blue as her hair. She liked pushing against rules, but in her own life, she liked...consistency? Order?</p><p>So maybe her need to rebel wasn\u2019t to reject rules entirely, but just those imposed by another.</p> <p>Her reaction to his control\u2014the way she trembled now\u2014worried him. So new to domination. She shouldn\u2019t be a trainee. What the hell are you doing, Z? Her fetish club visits had probably given her a few thrills. A sub\u2019s first time under command, no matter how lightweight, could be a revelation for her. But she had no experience with surrendering not only her body but her emotions as well.</p><p>Is that why she kept defying everyone? She wanted to submit, yet it frightened her? No. Maybe. He frowned. Sometimes she appeared uncomfortable with her own behavior, as if she didn\u2019t want to disobey. Other times her sassiness seemed true to her personality.</p><p>And right about the time he wanted to write her off, she\u2019d respond so sweetly she\u2019d rouse every dominant instinct in him.</p><p>He tightened his arms around her for both control and comfort and simply held her. Because that\u2019s what she needed now\u2014and so did he. The memory of spanking her didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>A man didn\u2019t hurt a woman, not where he came from. In BDSM, he\u2019d learned many submissives loved being given pain to heighten their pleasure. It had taken him longer to understand that pain dispensed for punishment could often fill a submissive\u2019s emotional needs.</p> <p>Other aspects of BDSM had proven easier to accept. Domination. Bondage... He definitely enjoyed bondage, watching a little sub squirm, then give him...everything.</p><p>How long before Gabrielle reached that point?</p><p>Probably a while. She was quite the piece of work.</p><p>At the sound of soft footsteps, he looked up to see Celine mosey past the sitting area. Although he\u2019d dated the lovely blonde a few times and occasionally topped her here, he hadn\u2019t called her in a month or so. Not since he\u2019d realized his income and his status in the club interested her more than his personality.</p><p>She glanced over, pretended surprise at seeing him, and came to kneel at his feet. \u201cCan I get you a drink, Master?\u201d</p><p>Dammit, her use of master grated on him. The title, used without his name, implied he was her master, a relationship encompassing far more than a few scenes.</p> <p>Gabrielle stirred. She stared at Celine, then squirmed, trying to rise.</p><p>\u201cStop, Gabrielle,\u201d Marcus said. He frowned at Celine and jerked his head in a way that left no chance for her to misunderstand. An experienced sub, she knew better than to interrupt obvious aftercare.</p><p>Pouting, she rose and moved away.</p><p>Gabrielle had stilled, but her uncomfortable expression said the quiet moment had passed. And it was indeed time for him to return to check on the other trainees. He ignored his reluctance to let her go and set her on her feet. Her balance stayed good. Her eyes were clear and alert, although her tear-streaked mascara tugged at his heart.</p><p>But she was back to normal. He had no excuse to sit and hold her longer, no matter how much he\u2019d enjoyed it. How content he\u2019d been.</p><p>She started to adjust her skirt from where he\u2019d tucked it under the waistband.</p><p>\u201cLeave it as it is, Gabrielle. People should get a chance to admire my handiwork.\u201d When she glared, he smothered his laugh. Definitely back to normal. \u201cFollow one step behind me and speak only when addressed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>As Gabi followed Marcus around the room like a pet, she tried to summon up her bratty sub, but it felt as if he had an invisible leash hooked deep within her. And each time he gave her an order, instead of getting angry, she melted inside.</p><p>He wandered through the room, checking on his other trainees, stopping to chat with members in his quiet drawl. He liked people, she could see, and got along well with everyone. A charmer, always knowing the right words to use. Like her father.</p><p>\u201cStay here for a second, sugar,\u201d he said.</p><p>She scrubbed her hands over her face, trying to figure out where her spine had gone. In a puddle on the floor wasn\u2019t an answer she wanted to hear.</p><p>Marcus stepped away to speak to the blonde who\u2019d offered to get him a drink.</p><p>Obediently Gabi waited. Come. Stay. Nice dog. She amused herself with lifting her lip in a snarl and silently growling at the blonde who\u2019d moved close enough to rub her breasts over Marcus\u2019s arm.</p><p>When he returned, he touched Gabi\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you for your patience, sugar. Now I need to find Sally and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus.\u201d</p><p>The deep, rich voice made her spin. Master Z. Oh, hell. Heat rushed into her face as the owner\u2019s gaze ran over her. He didn\u2019t react to her skirt tucked in her waistband, baring her pussy. Why did her exposure feel more embarrassing with someone who knew who she really was?</p><p>Speaking of who she was, she needed to pull herself together. No matter how many warm fuzzies she got when Master Marcus complimented her, she mustn\u2019t follow his orders.</p><p>\u201cZ, how are you tonight, sir?\u201d Master Marcus said, his slow drawl making his voice even smoother than Master Z\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. How is your new submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a few bumps in the road, I believe she\u2019s learning.\u201d Master Marcus\u2019s tone chilled. \u201cI fear she has less experience than you implied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Master Z frowned. \u201cMay I speak with her?\u201d</p><p>Marcus hesitated and then nodded.</p><p>Master Z stepped closer, tipped her chin up, and studied her face. \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019re having a rough time, little one,\u201d he said for her ears only. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>His sympathy made her eyes burn, and she took a second to steady her voice. \u201cYes, Sir. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Involuntarily she glanced at Master Marcus and saw his brows had drawn together.</p><p>A short blonde standing slightly behind Master Z had the same displeased expression.</p><p>Jessica Randall stared at Z in shock. He acted so concerned and had touched that new sub so protectively. I\u2019ve never seen him do that before. Not like that. A knot in her chest hurt as if she\u2019d swallowed something\u2014like jealousy\u2014that kept growing.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Z said to the redhead. He squeezed her shoulder and stepped back.</p><p>The arm he put around Jessica didn\u2019t warm her as it usually did. \u201cJessica, this is Gabrielle, our new trainee.\u201d</p><p>A trainee? Not a new sub of Marcus\u2019s? Surprised, Jessica turned to Marcus and hesitated a second. She didn\u2019t really know him that well. Nonetheless... \u201cYou brought in a new trainee? She\u2019s not even a member.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Z is doing someone a favor,\u201d Marcus said, his drawl more clipped than usual.</p><p>Jessica pulled away from Z and scowled at him. \u201cBut Rainie is at the top of the list. She\u2019s supposed to get the next trainee position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your concern, Jessica,\u201d Z said, his voice dangerously low.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair.\u201d Jessica set her hands on her hips. Rainie had whooped and screamed in delight over the chance to be a trainee. \u201cWhy is Rainie getting passed over for someone who never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d The snap in his voice not only shut Jessica up but everyone else in the immediate area.</p><p>She took a step back, knowing she\u2019d gone too far. And with Z that was never a good thing.</p><p>He pulled a leather gag from his pocket. \u201cYou\u2019ve exceeded my patience, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>A gag? She glared at him and shook her head. He\u2019d had it in his pocket\u2014like he\u2019d planned to gag her all along.</p><p>His eyes turned from gray to almost black, and her resolve crumbled into mush. When he crooked his finger\u2014come\u2014she obeyed.</p><p>After work on Monday, Jessica drove down the tiny country road toward the Shadowlands. The spatters of rain against the windshield matched her mood perfectly\u2014the mood she\u2019d suffered since Saturday night. How dare he have gagged her? He knew how much she hated that, dammit. She moved her jaw side to side, feeling as if the stupid thing still filled her mouth. She should have punched him.</p><p>Instead she\u2019d melted. Like always. The touch of his sure hands firmly tying the gag, the overpowering way he looked at her, the unyielding grip on her shoulder as he kept her right beside him\u2014she\u2019d probably never get enough of that, even if they lived to a hundred.</p><p>If we\u2019re still together. The disheartening thought pulled her down like quicksand. Sinking. Inescapable.</p><p>After slowing her car, she drove through the iron gates and up the palm-lined driveway. Under the rain, the flowers turned their bright blooms toward the ground, muting the landscape.</p><p>Z rarely gagged her, so why had he last Saturday? Because of that woman, Gabrielle? Her eyes narrowed. A new trainee brought in without any warning seemed strange. He and the trainers\u2014first Cullen and now Marcus\u2014usually discussed potential trainees to the point of nausea, wanting just the right person. Aside from Andrea, they\u2019d always chosen them from longtime members. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why the change? The unease inside her grew. The way Z had looked at Gabrielle had been...different. Of course, he always acted as if all the subs in the club were his responsibility to protect. Jessica loved that...mostly. She did hate the way submissives came on to him, even though he made it clear Jessica was his sub. She couldn\u2019t blame the other subs\u2014who wouldn\u2019t want Z?\u2014but so many were drop-dead gorgeous. She couldn\u2019t help wondering when he\u2019d find one he liked better than her.</p><p>But this new trainee wasn\u2019t beautiful. She wasn\u2019t as overly round as Jessica, but still a little on the heavier side. Friendly-looking, with a wide smile and big eyes. And yet, Z had squeezed her shoulder and smiled at her as if she was more than a new trainee. Like they had a secret or something.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he said anything about doing a favor for someone?</p><p>Then again, all this week, Z had acted reticent. She\u2019d even asked if something at work had bothered him. His patients were all children, and sometimes their problems, their pasts, ripped him up inside, but he\u2019d said no.</p> <p>And then she\u2019d wondered if he was unhappy that her doctor had taken her off the pill last month, forcing them to return to condoms. But he hadn\u2019t seemed upset at the time. She pulled the car into the side parking lot and turned off the engine. The gusting wind rocked the car as she watched clouds blacken the sky.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d blown everything out of proportion. She had to admit she felt insecure right now...with good reason. Z\u2019s sons had arrived yesterday to spend a few days with him before they returned to the University of Florida, and Z wanted her to meet them. Avoiding his children for\u2014oh, a lifetime\u2014seemed a much better plan, but he\u2019d refused to listen to her protests.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve stalled long enough, pet,\u201d he\u2019d said yesterday morning as she prepared to leave, and she\u2019d seen the amusement in his dark gray eyes. \u201cYou might as well get it over with.\u201d</p><p>He could be such a jerk sometimes.</p><p>Okay. Here goes nothing. She slid out of the car and went through the side gate to the back, hoping to find them on the covered veranda where she could easily escape. No such luck. Great. Her hands grew clammy as she climbed to the third floor. The sprinkling rain and the wind turned her hair into a tangled mass. She sighed. So much for the time she\u2019d spent making herself pretty. Could life get any better?</p> <p>She reached the third floor and knocked.</p><p>Z opened the door a minute later, dressed in his usual black slacks and black shirt. \u201cDid you lose your key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. No. But I didn\u2019t want to...\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and put his hand on her lower back to direct her into the house. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want my sons to discover their father has a life beyond being a parent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Z turned her to face him, setting his hands on her shoulders. \u201cKitten, my boys know who you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d What had he told them? Why hadn\u2019t she asked more questions yesterday like, What exactly do the boys know about us?</p><p>He led her into the living room, where the two young men sat in the dark leather chairs. Z stopped beside the couch and said, \u201cJessica, this is Eric. He\u2019s a senior this year\u201d\u2014he pointed to a tall, lanky blond\u2014\u201cand Richard, a junior.\u201d Richard had black hair and brown eyes. Muscular. Both wore jeans. Richard\u2019s T-shirt displayed a country-western band; Eric\u2019s a metal chick band.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both,\u201d she said, taking a seat on the couch. She leaned against the end, idly tracing a dent in the leather left from Sunday morning when Z had bent her over the arm, then... She jerked her hand away and straightened, feeling herself turn red.</p><p>Z chuckled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you a drink, Jessica.\u201d The way his eyes danced with laughter, he knew exactly what she\u2019d remembered. The jerk.</p><p>As he left the room with his silent gait, she turned her attention to the two young men. They were studying her closely.</p><p>Although Eric frowned at her, Richard grinned in obvious approval. \u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing Dad for a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit more.\u201d And nothing had changed in that year.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you meet?\u201d Eric asked. His cold gaze assessed her, and his mouth twisted as if he thought her a whore who\u2019d wandered off her street corner. She tried not to take it personally. He probably acted that way toward any of his father\u2019s women.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a dark and stormy night,\u201d she started, winning a snort of laughter from Richard. \u201cAn armadillo lay in the center of the road, and when I braked, I skidded right into a ditch filled with water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the armadillo?\u201d Richard\u2019s brown eyes held concern.</p><p>He sounded as protective as his father. She gave him a warm smile. \u201cI did. Then I walked here to see if I could call a tow truck.\u201d</p><p>Z handed her a drink. He joined her on the couch and rested his arm across the back. \u201cShe bore a distinct resemblance to a drowned cat.\u201d</p><p>The two boys laughed.</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d Jessica frowned at Z, but when her eyes met his, she remembered the rest of that night. How he\u2019d taken charge, forcing her to take a shower, drying her off himself...everywhere...despite her protestations. He\u2019d overwhelmed her\u2014he still did, dammit.</p><p>The laugh lines beside his eyes crinkled as if he remembered as well.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Mom says hi,\u201d Eric said, drawing their attention back to him. \u201cShe\u2019s getting a divorce from that loser. Finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Richard echoed. \u201cShe\u2019s sure got screwed-up taste in men...aside from you, of course.\u201d</p><p>Z inclined his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed with divorced people that after the first marriage, the next choice is always crappy,\u201d Eric said, aiming the cut right at her.</p><p>She tried not to wince, but even knowing how a son might resent his father seeing anyone new, the insult still hurt. She knew she hadn\u2019t concealed her reaction well when Z squeezed her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEric.\u201d Z\u2019s firm voice had the same effect on the young man as on the subs in the club.</p><p>Eric flushed. \u201cSorry.\u201d He shoved to his feet and crossed the room, not quite stomping. \u201cIt\u2019s just... Fuck, Dad, look at her. She\u2019s our age. She could be your daughter, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Z sighed. \u201cOnly if I\u2019d started making babies at eleven.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known meeting his children would turn into a disaster. Jessica forced a smile. \u201cI appreciate the compliment, Eric. Especially since turning thirty this year really sucked.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like he believed either of them.</p><p>Richard grinned at his brother. \u201cPut your foot into it, dumb-ass.\u201d</p><p>Eric scowled at him, then her. \u201cYeah, well. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>No, you aren\u2019t. She looked down at her hands as her stomach twisted around the lump that had formed. Maybe he had a point.</p><p>Hopefully the personnel office wouldn\u2019t waste their time trying to hire her, Gabi thought as she walked out of the Tampa department store. The muggy air filmed her skin with damp until her inexpensive tan slacks and button-down shirt felt pasted on. With a disgusted sigh, she pulled the newspaper from her bag and checked the next stop on her job-hunting excursion. Oh joy\u2014an auto repair shop needed a receptionist.</p><p>The job-hunting directive had come from the two agents leading the investigation. Kouros and his partner wanted her to appear unemployed so the kidnapper'd think no one would notice if she disappeared. But, please, she hadn\u2019t liked looking for work even when she\u2019d really needed a job.</p><p>She\u2019d have to play this game for three more weeks. Unless the perp tried for her. The thought sent a shiver through her. Sure she had backup, but she knew too well arrests often went bad. She could get kidnapped like Kim.</p><p>I could die. Her life could end. Just...stop. She looked around. To never walk on sun-scorched sidewalks again, never see a limitless, blue sky, or hear a little girl giggle over an ice cream cone. She worked with the survivors of aggression every day, knew the devastation that accompanied senseless death.</p><p>Now she\u2019d purposely put herself squarely in the path, like lying down in front of a train. She swallowed. At least this time, the violence would only be directed at her. If everything fell apart, no one she cared about would get hurt.</p><p>Because people did get hurt when bad things happened. Despite the heat of the afternoon, her skin chilled as she heard again the sharp blast of a pistol in a small room, heard Danny\u2019s low grunt and the gut-twisting sound of a bullet punching through cloth and flesh. Red splattering out across everything. The way he\u2019d hit the floor, limbs flopping\u2014her scream wiping out the thud. The shock on his face made it all so much more horrifying. He hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d die that day.</p><p>As her chest tightened and sickness welled inside her, she shook her head. Stop, just stop. She forced a long inhalation. Another. Rubbing her hand against the brick wall behind her, she let the abrasive pain anchor her in the present. In the here and now, where cars flowed down the street. Most were white. Then a yellow sports car. A red pickup. A horn beeped, and brakes squealed. Two teenagers, hair in dreadlocks, argued as they sauntered past. Then one threw back his head and laughed. Life goes on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaking inside, she watched the noisy, energetic world around her. She\u2019d gone a year without any flashbacks and had hoped they\u2019d left completely. After all, Danny and Rock had died ten years ago. That day had been one of those life-defining moments, the day she\u2019d discovered that horrible things really can happen and people you love can die. Suddenly. Violently.</p><p>After scrubbing her face with her hands, she strode down the sidewalk as if to outrun her memories. Not possible, but sometimes she could fast-forward to the end. How she\u2019d cowered in a corner, unable to run, blood pouring down her cheek, more between her legs. A man had entered the tiny apartment. Silver-haired, deep lines beside his mouth, his face open and honest. His long-sleeved shirt clean and white, with no terrifying red splotches.</p><p>She\u2019d whimpered like a hurt animal, unable to stop the pitiful sounds. When he had come closer, she pushed back against the wall, making herself smaller, tugging at her torn clothing as if it could shield her. He\u2019d snapped something, and someone handed him a blanket. He\u2019d stepped forward. She shook her head, no no no, but he had simply opened the blanket and dropped it onto her lap. And then he\u2019d backed up and knelt a few feet away. Far enough that she had managed to breathe again. Could look at him. \u201cMy name is Abe, and I\u2019m with the FBI, sweetie.\u201d He\u2019d waited a moment for her to understand, then said, \u201cI\u2019m here just for you. To help you. Let me take you someplace safe.\u201d</p><p>There is good in this world to balance the bad.</p> <p>She\u2019d been given a gift\u2014a person who understood, who listened, who helped put her life back together. And using him as a model, she\u2019d become an FBI victim specialist\u2014someone who could reach past the terror. Could listen. Could help.</p><p>Speaking of which...</p><p>A bench at a bus stop provided a seat, and a tall maple lent some shade against the burning sun. With the ugly disposable cell phone Agent Kouros had provided\u2014did she look like a person who\u2019d carry a gray phone?\u2014she checked the status of a victim\u2019s compensation process and called her temporary replacement, Zella, to remind her of Josh\u2019s court date and that the teen would need hand-holding.</p><p>As Gabi answered Zella's questions on the other cases, guilt stabbed deep inside her. People depended on her, and she\u2019d run off to Tampa to serve as a decoy. When they\u2019d finished reviewing, Zella said, \u201cThe boss says you\u2019re off on medical leave.\u201d A pause. \u201cI heard a rumor from the Tampa office you\u2019re there doing something exciting.\u201d</p><p>Gabi\u2019s mouth dropped open. Then anger bit. Someone should muffle that gossipy secretary. She watched the traffic\u2014black car, taxi, white car\u2014and said truthfully, \u201cI\u2019m seeing no excitement here. I\u2019ll be back and raring to go within three weeks or so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood to hear. I\u2019ve heard a lot of whining about your absence, especially from the kids.\u201d</p><p>The warmth that spread through her outfaced the sun. It\u2019s nice to be missed. \u201cThanks. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>After disconnecting, Gabi dialed Rhodes. He didn\u2019t answer. Of course. Dickhead wouldn\u2019t take calls if he wasn\u2019t on duty. Yet someone needed to deal with this quickly. Scowling, she dialed the backup number.</p><p>\u201cGalen Kouros.\u201d She\u2019d have known him from the New England accent.</p><p>\u201cThis is Gabrielle Renard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle. What can I help you with?\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip. Ratting on someone. Maybe she should have\u2014</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hear there\u2019re rumors I might not be on medical leave, that I\u2019m doing something exciting in Tampa. Perhaps it\u2019s not that bad, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you hear this?\u201d His voice took on a grim tone.</p><p>Oh hell, she wasn\u2019t supposed to contact her office. \u201cAh. I called to check that my replacement is doing all right and answer questions about my caseload.\u201d</p><p>Silence and a sigh. \u201cVictim specialists. I suppose I should have expected that. Bighearted social workers.\u201d He made the term sound more like an insult than a compliment. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with the leak and speak with your replacement. You concentrate on your current job.\u201d</p><p>Considering the way he made Gabi feel like an idiot, the poor secretary was in for a rough time. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Z by the way; you did a fine job at the club last weekend. Your prior experience is making a difference\u2014the other three decoys aren\u2019t doing nearly as well.\u201d</p> <p>After he\u2019d clicked off, she stared at the phone for a moment. A compliment? Well. How nice after hearing all of Rhodes\u2019s complaints.</p><p>And enduring Marcus\u2019s disapproval. Her throat tightened at the memory. How could the disappointed look in the dom\u2019s eyes be more difficult to bear than a physical punishment?</p><p>Not relevant, Gabi. Get back to work. She scowled as she uncrumpled the page of ads. On to the next token job application. Only a block away. She slung her purse over her shoulders and headed down the sidewalk. She felt sorry for the poor agent trailing her, waiting in the hot street while she filled out fake applications in air-conditioned offices.</p><p>But he\u2019d get the weekend off, while she\u2019d have to continue her act at the Shadowlands.</p><p>And she\u2019d see Master Marcus again. Her heart gave an extra beat. What was it about that man\u2014that dom? How could she want another perfect suit-person like her last boyfriend? The last few dates with Andrew, he\u2019d never stopped criticizing her: her attire, her manners, her attitude, even the way she made love. When she\u2019d realized he sounded like her parents and that she\u2019d permitted him to make her feel inadequate, she\u2019d called it quits.</p><p>Mr. Perfect Marcus was just one more like Andrew\u2014even a lawyer, for God\u2019s sake. Do not get attracted to another conservative prig, Gabi.</p><p>At the intersection, the light changed, and she followed the cluster of pedestrians across the street. Two men beside her razzed each other about a failed weekend date. Having fun.</p><p>Unlike her reserved father, Marcus did seem to have fun. He had a big, open laugh, and he joked with his friends. She sighed. And when he wasn\u2019t unhappy with her, he\u2019d been so warm she\u2019d wanted to curl up at his feet.</p><p>Even after she\u2019d taunted him, he hadn\u2019t lost his temper. Instead he\u2019d tried to figure out what would reach her. As a social worker, she recognized how he searched for a susceptible place where he could push her in the direction he wanted her to go. He might well find it. She had vulnerabilities, everyone did, and maybe she had a few more than some.</p><p>He\u2019s gotten to me, hasn\u2019t he? She already wanted to please him and felt bad when she sassed him...and she really wanted to see him again.</p><p>The realization worried her. How could she possibly look forward to being under his control? God, that spanking had hurt. She hadn\u2019t cried like that in years. But afterward he\u2019d held her, pressing her head against his strong shoulder, murmuring comfort in that rich drawl. Had anyone ever cared for her so sweetly?</p><p>Or aroused her so thoroughly? She\u2019d sure never come so hard. Ever. The memories had given her lushly erotic dreams every single damned night, and she\u2019d wake up hurting from needing to come.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t gotten herself off. Gold star for me. He\u2019d told her not to come without permission, and she wanted to please him, even though her entire purpose in the Shadowlands was to defy him. Yes, the sneaky, perfect dom had snuck under her defenses. She set her jaw. Too bad for her...and him.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she walked a little faster. Next Friday and Saturday, Master Marcus could deal with her defiance, and she could deal with his response...somehow. That\u2019s just the way it had to be.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Carrying a tray full of drinks, Gabi paused as the members watching a noisy m\u00e9nage session blocked her path. She shook her head. The whole place was filled. How wonderful. More people to laugh at her getting in trouble.</p><p>She had a feeling tonight wouldn\u2019t be nearly as pleasant as last night.</p><p>On Friday, she\u2019d pushed herself to extreme brattiness, but aside from one swarthy dom and the bartender, who\u2019d both punished her, no one seemed to care. Marcus had arrived late, then done a scene with that blonde, so he hadn\u2019t had a chance to give her hell.</p><p>Marcus is here tonight. The knowledge sent excitement skittering along her nerves.</p><p>When the submissive in the m\u00e9nage scene groaned, one of her doms laughed. Curious, Gabi edged her way forward. Unfortunately she got too close to the dom in black leathers who\u2019d called her insolent, the one named Master Dan.</p><p>He frowned at her and jerked his head, a silent get back to work. He sure wasn\u2019t very nice. Why did some of the doms act like they owned her and others didn\u2019t?</p><p>When he turned his back, she stuck out her tongue and crossed her eyes. Laughter rippled around her, and the pregnant sub tucked under his arm giggled. Grinning, Gabi returned to the bar. That had felt good.</p><p>As she walked out of the crowd, she glanced over her shoulder and noticed the golden armband circling Master Dan\u2019s bicep. Interesting. Sam and Cullen both wore those gold bands. So did Master Marcus. Once safely out of Dan\u2019s sight, she stopped to scan the room. Apparently only a few doms wore armbands: the swarthy, muscular dom she\u2019d met\u2014to her misfortune\u2014a domme with a male sub, another domme with a female sub. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the brunette trainee walked past, Gabi stopped her. \u201cI know dungeon monitors wear gold-trimmed vests, but what\u2019s with the armbands?\u201d She nodded at the two dommes. \u201cDo those gold bands mean anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, girlfriend, did we forget to warn you about them?\u201d Sally rolled her eyes and grinned. \u201cThose identify the Shadowlands Masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s different from a dom how?\u201d</p><p>Sally rested her tray on her hip and thought for a second. \u201cOkay, you know how some doms are just a little dominating like maybe a one-scoop ice cream, and others have a lot more\u2014maybe two scoops of domination?\u201d</p> <p>Gabi nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, with the Masters, think supersized hot fudge sundae.\u201d Sally giggled. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only the domination part. Add in beaucoup experience and control and all that. They\u2019re voted Master status by the members, and it\u2019s sure not a popularity contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasters are the best to play with, but...\u201d Sally wrinkled her nose. \u201cAlthough the regular doms can boss us a little, they have to ask Marcus for permission to do anything else. But the Masters are supposed to help with the trainees, so they can pull you into a scene or use you for a demonstration. And if you\u2019re bratty and Marcus isn\u2019t around, they\u2019ll punish you themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you tell me.\u201d Gabi scowled. \u201cThat Hispanic one with all the muscles? Last night, he came down on me like a load of bricks\u2014put me in the stocks and allowed anybody who thought I\u2019d insulted them to whack me with a paddle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOuch. I wondered how you ended up there. Master Raoul\u2019s usually more forgiving than Marcus. You must have been even naughtier than me.\u201d Laughing, Sally tsk-tsked at Gabi before responding to a dom\u2019s wave for service.</p><p>Gabi slowly headed for the bar. So that\u2019s why the regular doms hadn\u2019t done anything about her behavior. Looks like she\u2019d need to concentrate on upsetting the Masters. Oh doesn\u2019t that just sound like fun?</p><p>As she neared the bar, she spotted Master Marcus. God, he was gorgeous...and dangerous. Despite his deceptively lazy stance, power seemed to radiate from him, and when his sharp blue gaze landed on Gabi, electricity sizzled like a cut power cord, throwing sparks everywhere.</p><p>Next to Marcus stood a rough-looking man in a black, sleeveless T-shirt and a gold band on his arm. Scars on the man\u2019s face and hands created white lines over his dark red-brown skin. As his unwavering, black eyes watched her approach, Gabi seriously considered detouring around both him and Marcus. But as she hesitated, she spotted Agent Rhodes at the end of the bar, reminding her of the stakes involved.</p><p>Okay, Kim\u2014this is for you, honey. Jaw tensed, she headed straight for Marcus and the other guy. She forced a cocky grin and greeted Marcus. \u201cHey, hot stuff.\u201d</p><p>His smile died. \u201cGabrielle, you don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring the way his voice made her insides tap-dance, she turned to his tough friend. \u201cHey, buddy, how\u2019s it hanging?\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s lips pressed into a straight line.</p><p>A flash of amusement flickered in his friend\u2019s eyes before disappearing into darkness. \u201cYour new trainee, Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Gabrielle, this is Master Nolan.\u201d Marcus tilted his head at her quizzically. \u201cHow long did it take before you could sit comfortably after last Saturday?\u201d</p><p>Two whole days. She took an involuntary step back, then made herself walk around them to set her tray down. Leaning an elbow on the bar top, she said breezily, \u201cOh, not that long.\u201d</p><p>Master Marcus\u2019s intent gaze moved over her face, her body, lingering on her hands.</p><p>She felt her hand rubbing the scar on her cheek. Oops. After tucking her hair behind an ear, she plastered on a nonchalant grin.</p><p>Marcus saw his puzzlement duplicated in Nolan\u2019s eyes. Gabrielle wasn\u2019t as confident as she tried to sound. His mention of spanking had tensed every muscle in that pretty little body and paled her face. Now her fingers traced the long scar on her cheek, which he\u2019d learned meant she\u2019d jumped past anxiety into fear.</p> <p>Why did she keep pushing to get punished?</p><p>Some submissives craved pain, but she wasn\u2019t one of them. Some wanted attention, and he still wasn\u2019t convinced she didn\u2019t...but she seemed genuinely mortified by spectators. Some subs\" only method of relating to people was to behave like brats, but Gabrielle was a naturally friendly person. She had an infectious laugh, chatted easily, and charmed everyone. In fact, almost every single dom in the place had requested to do a scene with her.</p><p>He found most of her sassy behavior downright cute. Except for the times like now when she deliberately antagonized a dom.</p><p>As Marcus studied her, she swallowed and shifted her weight, her eyes darting away. Definitely scared.</p><p>Dammit. Spanking her hadn\u2019t worked, and he doubted he could stomach hitting her harder. But his responsibility as a trainer demanded he teach her the consequences of insolence.</p><p>\u201cHot stuff,\u201d she\u2019d called him? \u201cMaster Nolan, could I request that you please keep her here for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Nolan curled his hand around her upper arm, not even appearing to notice her instinctive attempt to retreat.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d She slapped at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not my boss.\u201d</p><p>Her loud protests continued as Marcus retrieved his toy bag from behind the bar, and amusement mingled with his concern. He\u2019d spent a lot of time thinking about her, wondering what to do with her...and trying to remember he was her trainer and nothing more. Damned if he wanted to be attracted to the little nuisance.</p><p>After planning out some possible scenes for her, he\u2019d added a few extras to the bag. Odd how apropos one happened to be.</p><p>When he returned, she was still struggling and cursing Nolan. \u201cYou dumb-ass ape, get your hand off me. What\u2014are you the first in your family to be born without a tail?\u201d</p><p>The dom stared at her as if he couldn\u2019t believe the show, and Marcus almost grinned. When he\u2019d discussed Gabrielle in the Master\u2019s meeting before the club opened, Nolan hadn\u2019t believed she could prove much trouble. Well, now he knew.</p><p>After setting his toy bag on the bar, Marcus gripped her hair. \u201cBe silent.\u201d</p><p>For about thirty seconds, her natural submissiveness shut her up as if he\u2019d corked her mouth. Then she started again. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t like manhandling, and this\u2014\u201d</p><p>Marcus took her wrists, pulled them behind her back, and clipped the cuffs together. When she opened her mouth for another yell, he shoved a leather gag between her teeth. He tied it firmly, smiling at the muffled shriek.</p><p>Then her inability to talk or move registered. Her body stiffened, and her eyes dilated with fear.</p><p>Before she panicked, he put his hand under her chin to force her to meet his gaze. \u201cGabrielle.\u201d He held a pink squeaky toy and shook it so the bells inside rattled. A squeeze made it squeak. \u201cAnytime I gag you, you will hold this. The toy is the substitute for your safe word, sugar. If you drop it or make it squeak, everything stops.\u201d</p><p>Her brown eyes were huge, and she trembled like a terrified mouse. Why did she do this to herself? He slid his hand up to cup her face, and the unconscious way she rubbed her cheek on his palm told him she trusted him\u2014would willingly submit. Only she didn\u2019t.</p><p>With a sigh, he stayed on the path he\u2019d set out. He put the toy in her hand. \u201cDo you understand, sugar? Use it if something is too much for you. Make it squeak now so I know you can.\u201d</p><p>As she made the toy sound several times, her breathing slowed.</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d He stripped off her stretchy, bright yellow hot pants with regret\u2014she\u2019d looked damn fine in them\u2014lingering for a second over the soft, bare skin of her ass. Seductive, mouthy little sub. Then he gripped her waist and laid her, stomach down, on the bar, with her legs dangling off the edge.</p><p>Her teeth clamped on the gag, and she pulled uselessly at her cuffs, then tried to squirm off the bar. Seductive, mouthy, stubborn little sub. Marcus glanced at Nolan. \u201cIf you would please?\u201d</p><p>Nolan nodded and leaned on her legs, pinning her against the bar and preventing her from kicking in the process. After gripping her cuffs, the dom had her well immobilized, although she continued to struggle like a fish tossed on dry land.</p><p>Marcus glanced at Cullen, who drew a beer as he observed the show. \u201cLoan me a knife, please.\u201d Before Gabrielle could react with more than widened eyes, he patted her bottom. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut on you, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a second, then gave up and lay limp under Nolan\u2019s grip. Apparently the mention of a knife had scared the sass right out of her.</p><p>Cullen set the drink on the bar and tossed a knife at Marcus.</p><p>Marcus caught it out of the air. He took a piece of knobby, palm-sized ginger from his toy bag and cut off one of the fingerlike parts. \u201cThis is ginger, Gabrielle, like what is used in Asian cooking.\u201d He shaved off the brown coating and carved the long piece into the shape of an anal plug with a thick thumb-sized part, a narrower section, and a wide end to keep the plug in place.</p><p>When he held it up, Gabrielle inhaled sharply, obviously recognizing the shape.</p><p>Marcus smiled into her eyes. \u201cThe fun we\u2019ll have tonight is called figging.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Nolan chuckled, she stiffened as if she\u2019d forgotten his presence.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t use regular lubricant or it\u2019ll block the effect. Can you lube her with her own juices?\u201d Marcus asked, glancing at his hands. \u201cIf I get the oils near her pussy, she\u2019s going to screech like a steam engine.\u201d</p><p>Nolan snorted. \u201cNo shit. Guess I can help out this once, hot stuff.\u201d The dom pushed her legs apart and slid his fingers over her pussy. He chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s nicely wet, Marcus.\u201d Ignoring her muffled yells, Nolan lubed up her asshole.</p><p>Cheeks pink with outrage, Gabrielle glared as Marcus picked up the ginger. He nodded at Nolan. \u201cBest you try to relax yourself, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>As Nolan held her buttocks apart, Marcus slowly pushed the knob into her ass. Her tight ring of muscle fought against the intrusion\u2014just as it would offer up a token protest against a cock before closing like a vise around the base. He hardened at the thought.</p><p>The ginger slipped into place, and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, sugar. Now you\u2019ll learn what hot stuff really means. I do want you to know ginger doesn\u2019t cause any harm at all...no matter what it feels like.\u201d</p><p>Leaning an arm on the bar, he kissed Gabrielle\u2019s cheek and her forehead. \u201cSuch a pretty face to glare so much. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be polite and not have to be unhappy all the time?\u201d</p><p>His blue gaze was soft, his resonant voice almost a croon, and Gabi had to close her eyes to keep him from seeing just how devastating his question was. I would. I hate when you\u2019re mad at me.</p><p>\u201cAh, Darlin\u2019,\u201d he said gently, \u201cwe\u2019ll get there. It\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>She kept her eyes closed until she heard him move away. He\u2019d gone behind the bar to wash his hands, leaving the heartless dom still leaning against her legs. She could hear the laughter and conversations about her, and her cheeks flushed. She\u2019d done well in attracting attention, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>When Marcus came back, Nolan stepped away and asked in his gravelly voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t need any more help, I\u2019m going to round up my sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your assistance,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Nolan gave Gabi\u2019s bottom a light, stinging slap, and she gritted her teeth on the gag to keep from yelping. \u201cWould you like her caned tonight? I\u2019m getting out of practice.\u201d</p><p>Gabi tensed. Say no, say no.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Marcus grazed his fingers over the stinging area. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t learn some manners soon, I believe she might benefit from your expertise.\u201d</p><p>As Nolan headed away, Marcus gripped Gabi around the waist. With an easy swing, he set her on her feet. As the thing in her butt shifted, she shivered and wiggled, trying to get more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d leave her up there,\u201d the bartender said, leaning on one hefty arm and looking at her appreciatively. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a pretty bar ornament in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d Marcus ran his warm hands up and down her arms. His eyes held laughter as he smiled at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to be holding still without some help.\u201d</p><p>Cullen frowned. \u201cWhat did you want the knife for anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGinger root. She called me \u201ehot stuff.\"\u201d</p><p>The giant dom stared at Marcus for a second, then roared with laughter.</p><p>What\u2019s so funny?</p> <p>Marcus removed her cuffs and her yellow vinyl top, and finally her gag.</p><p>Thank you, God. She rubbed her cheeks and swallowed, trying to eradicate the taste of the gag. A gag, anal plug, bar top. Oh man. She\u2019d expected a spanking, maybe even a whipping. Not this kind of thing. As Marcus put the restraints into his bag, she realized everyone still watched her, probably hoping for another show. Damn them anyway.</p><p>She scowled at Marcus and Cullen. It didn\u2019t take any effort to want to annoy them. A bar ornament, my ass. \u201cSo am I supposed to wait tables with this thing up my butt?\u201d</p><p>Elbow on the bar, Cullen propped his chin in his hand and watched her as if she were an amusing bug.</p><p>\u201cNo, Gabrielle,\u201d Marcus said in a level voice. \u201cYou are going to sit with me and practice self-control. Don\u2019t make me regret removing your gag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, hot stuff.\u201d She pursed her lips in a kiss, hearing the people around the bar laugh.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change. As he studied her with those blue, blue eyes, she felt herself flush and something quiver inside her, a mingling of shame and desire. Unable to meet his eyes anymore, she dropped her gaze.</p><p>\u201cC'mere, sugar,\u201d he said softly. He sat down, back to the bar, and lifted her onto his lap.</p><p>When her weight landed on the thing in her butt, she winced, and her temper shifted as well\u2014with good reason. After all, some asshole had shoved something in her asshole.</p><p>His calloused fingers curled around hers, and he positioned her hands palm down on her bare thighs. \u201cI want your hands to stay just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered, then growled as he forced her knees apart and draped her legs on the outside of his, spreading her open. No. I am not going to sit here with my pussy wide open for everyone walking past to stare at. This is too much. Without saying a word, she tried to slide off his lap.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He cupped one hand over her left breast, and his other over her mound, holding her in place.</p><p>She stilled, her heart rate increasing at the thrill of his strong hands on her most vulnerable areas. His palm, hard and calloused, pressed against her bare labia. She quivered in his grasp as he fondled her breasts, rolling her nipples until need clawed through her.</p><p>\u201cNicely quiet. I like that, Gabrielle,\u201d he murmured into her ear, his breath warm against her cheek. \u201cSay, \u201eThank you, Sir, for providing me with a seat.\"\u201d</p><p>Her hesitation earned her a quick pinch on her nipple, and the tiny pain streamed like a lightning bolt to her pussy. How could she possibly find this exciting? But his fingers rested on each side of her clit, and if he started touching her there, she\u2019d have a climax on a damned bar stool. She breathed through her nose until the heat passed. \u201cThank you, Sir, for providing me with a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d Despite the fact he\u2019d forced her to comply, his voice was warm with approval, the approval that she\u2019d discovered she really, really wanted.</p><p>She tried to think of something atrocious to do next, and suddenly the hand between her legs started to move. He touched her wet, wet labia, making another approving sound. \u201cDo you realize how your body betrays you, Gabrielle?\u201d he said in her ear as his finger circled her entrance. \u201cYou make all these defiant noises, but your body says, \u201eTake me. Please.\"\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her clit, and then moved his legs farther apart, spreading her even more. \u201cI do like having you open so I can play with you as I please,\u201d he murmured, his sexy drawl thicker than normal.</p><p>Over by a sitting area, two trainees frowned at her. In the locker room, they\u2019d complained about how much time Marcus had to spend with her because of her behavior.</p><p>Other members wandered past, staring and laughing at the naked sub getting tormented on her dom\u2019s lap, and she flushed. Don\u2019t pay attention to what Marcus is doing. Watch for the kidnapper.</p><p>But he kept teasing her with erratic touches, and her focus started to erode. He knew just how to touch her, dammit. Arousal and embarrassment coursed through her, and her fingernails dug into her thighs as she tried to stay still. As her clit swelled, she became aware of the thing in her butt. It had...warmed. That didn\u2019t make sense. She\u2019d seen him cut it up; it didn\u2019t have any batteries or wires; it was just a root of ginger. Sure ginger was a spice, but a fairly mild one. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>It heated more, and she squirmed, realizing he\u2019d placed her so her buttocks rested solidly on his lap with no way to get the thing out. Her anus started to burn\u2014like the plug was flaming inside her. It needed to come out. Now. She struggled to get off his lap.</p><p>He tightened his grip on her breast, his palm flattened on her pussy, holding her in place. \u201cStay put, Gabrielle. You do not have permission to move,\u201d he said, but the ice in his voice was no match for the fire in her bottom.</p><p>\u201cIt burns.\u201d She pushed at his arms, but he had a hell of a grip for a lawyer. She didn\u2019t care if she got in trouble. It felt as if someone had stuck a burning stick up her bottom. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong. That thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel like hot stuff?\u201d From the amusement in his voice, he\u2019d known exactly what would happen. Her gasp of outrage made him laugh, and she wanted to scream at him. It was burning her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, take it out.\u201d Her body broke out in a sweat as the fire increased.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ignoring her struggles, he played with her, rolling her left nipple, then the right between his calloused fingers, slowly, each time increasing the pressure to the edge of pain. Her breasts felt full. Heavy. Her nipples throbbed. And then he moved the hand over her pussy, sliding a lean finger into her wetness and up and around her clit. In and around. Her clit swelled as if imitating her breasts, each tortuous circle waking her to a frightening need.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t want this.\u201d She grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hand away from her pussy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut your hand back on your thigh, Gabrielle.\u201d The steel in his voice cut through her resistance. A tremor shook her deep inside as she obeyed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou will stay in place whatever I do, whatever I take from you.\u201d</p><p>Her spine seemed to melt into his chest as if his removal of her choices had taken her with it.</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty little sub,\u201d he whispered. He kissed her hot cheek. \u201cJust stay quiet as I play.\u201d</p> <p>She somehow held still as he teased her clit, ever so slowly, arousing her pussy to a different fire, one that vied with the burning pain in her bottom. When he pinched her nipples, pain and pleasure seemed to zing like electricity between her bottom and her pussy and her breasts, drawing her closer and closer to coming. She moaned, drowning in sensation.</p><p>He ruthlessly brought her right to the brink, until she couldn\u2019t remain quiet, until she squirmed uncontrollably against his hold, needing to come so badly that she whimpered. She burned...everywhere. Each merciless stroke shoved her closer until the world receded to only the feeling of his hands and the fire of the ginger.</p><p>Every time she got close to the edge, he lightened his touch, keeping her on a throbbing, burning precipice.</p><p>Marcus nuzzled the cheek of the little sub squirming in his lap. She hovered right at the peak of both pain and pleasure, and one firm touch would send her screaming over the edge. Her breathy whimpers were a joy to listen to, as was her inability to put two words together into one of her insults. Master Z walked by, studied her for a second, and nodded at Marcus.</p><p>That had been a very unreadable expression from the club owner, Marcus thought. Almost concerned...pitying. Putting the thought aside, he returned his attention to his sub. Her responses delighted him. He might have to force her to let down her defenses, but once gone, she openly gave him everything. He nibbled on the lovely curve between her neck and shoulder to add to her sensations, and another low groan broke from her.</p> <p>\u201cBeg me, Gabrielle,\u201d he said, making it an order. \u201cBeg me to let you come.\u201d</p><p>Ah now, he\u2019d obviously pushed too far, for she tried to growl her defiance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give it all, sugar,\u201d he whispered and slid his finger up her engorged clit, too lightly to get her off but hard enough to increase the quivering of her thighs. The scent of her arousal blended with the light fragrance of her skin and hair. \u201cBeg me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened, and he laughed. Stubborn little sub. So honest in her defiance. How long since he\u2019d had such a challenge? He set his hands on the outside of her bottom and pushed her ass cheeks together. Pressure on the ginger root would increase the burn.</p><p>She stiffened and gave a husky moan. \u201cPlease. Oh, God, please, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>Almost. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir. Pleeeease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You were polite, Gabrielle, so I will reward you,\u201d he murmured. He swirled a finger in her juices, then started high over her clit, up past the hood, and worked his way down in tiny slick rubs. Her entire body stiffened as he came closer to the goal. Finally he reached the sweet, swollen nub and slid over it once.</p><p>Her back arched; her head thumped into his shoulder as she screamed, a satisfying, high sound that made him even harder than before. He gritted his teeth. If he had her soft, little ass squirming on top of his cock much longer, he\u2019d bend her over the bar stool and take her.</p><p>He tightened the arm he\u2019d put around her waist to keep her in place and circled her clit a few more times to draw out the afterwaves. A few seconds of that and she sagged against him like a balloon that had lost its air. Little shivers shook her body at intervals.</p><p>To please himself, he moved his hand up to cup a soft, swollen breast. He kissed her moist cheek. \u201cSay thank you, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were half-lidded. Her lips curved slightly. Absolutely beautiful. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He turned her and took her mouth. She yielded completely, wonderfully.</p><p>Eventually he drew back, despite his roaring need to take more. Her wet lips were swollen and red from his kiss. She\u2019d closed her eyes, and her thick red-gold lashes clashed endearingly with her pink cheeks.</p> <p>Lesson. This is a lesson, Atherton. Recalling his mind to the task, he brushed his cheek over hers. \u201cI do enjoy giving pleasure to polite submissives, sugar.\u201d He left the second part unstated\u2014that rudeness would receive pain.</p><p>Her eyes lifted and met his. The vulnerable look pulled at his heart. Then he watched as, like a prison guard, she locked her emotions away.</p><p>The bitch was running late. Cesar Maganti glanced at his watch: 1:30 a.m. In the shadows beside his target\u2019s apartment building, he leaned against the wall. Sweat trickled slowly down his back. His overalls, showing him as an appliance company employee, felt like an overcoat in the humid night.</p><p>Not long ago, Jang had reported that Candi\u2019d left the downtown BDSM club, so she should arrive any time now. With luck, he\u2019d have her boxed, called in, and ready for pickup the minute the docks opened in the morning. She\u2019d be the second woman of the four ordered.</p><p>He watched as a car entered the parking lot. A red Jeep\u2014nope. A drunken couple got out and staggered into a ground-floor apartment. He doubted they\u2019d seen anything but each other. Weekend nights were definitely the safest time to snatch someone. Two years ago, when the Overseer had e-mailed him a how-to-kidnap guide, he\u2019d laughed his ass off. But the bastard's suggestions had been dead-on.</p><p>The Overseer. Fancy name for a fucking pimp. But the patronizing asshole paid good money for each batch of girls. Last time the profit on the order had kept his PI agency afloat. This year it\u2019d pay off his gambling debts and keep him from ending up in the Gulf as an example.</p><p>This girlie and then two more and home free.</p><p>And there she was. C\u2019mere, chickie. She parked and locked her battered, white compact sedan, then walked toward the stairs on the end of the building. Healthy women\u2014the types he kidnapped\u2014rarely used the elevators. He checked the area. A car headed out on the far side of the lot, its lights dancing over the shrubbery. All clear.</p><p>Maganti smiled as the brunette approached. Nice rack. When she reached the stairs, he stepped out of the shadows. \u201cHey, Candi,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d used her name deliberately. Instead of screaming and running, she hesitated. With an alcohol-sogged brain, she took a moment to realize she didn\u2019t know him. Her eyes widened and\u2014</p><p>He nailed her with the Taser.</p><p>She dropped in a nice heap. After yanking the prongs from her stomach, he gave her a tranq injection to keep her out for a couple of hours at least. Long enough to get to the docks, pass her off to the guys doing the pickup, and get his money.</p><p>Maganti fetched the heavy washing machine box from behind the building, hefted her in, and sealed the top. Using a hand trolley, he rolled the box to his cargo van and up the ramp. After closing the door, he dumped her out and cuffed her wrists and ankles. No point in growing careless. As he drove out of the parking lot, he knew what anyone watching would see\u2014an appliance truck leaving after making a delivery. Another idea off the Overseer's list. No one questioned repair guys. Had an emergency call, ma\u2019am. The machine flooded the laundry room.</p><p>Once out on the road, he tossed his clear-lensed glasses onto the passenger seat and removed the baseball cap.</p><p>Two little birdies left to go. Whistling a tune, he thought about the woman cuffed in the back of the van. Long hair. Nice ass. Big tits. He hardened. If he hurried, he and Jang could have some fun with her before the boat arrived.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Later that evening, Marcus wandered through the club, checking on his trainees. Two of the newer doms had requested Sally. Marcus had hoped two doms might intimidate her a tad, but she was topping from the bottom as always, telling them what to do, what they messed up. Damn.</p><p>A young dom-sub couple had Tanner for a flogging scene, and the young man not only looked fit to burst but grinned between each stroke. Having already done scenes, Dara, Austin, and Uzuri now served drinks. Dara's session had lasted awhile, and Marcus smiled at the pink stripes running up the back of her thighs.</p><p>He headed toward the stocks to check on Gabrielle. Marcus had wanted to see how she handled a new dom and mild erotic pain, so he\u2019d agreed to let Holt, a dom in his late twenties, switch her.</p><p>After that, he might nab one of the free subs for a playtime of his own. The battle with Gabrielle earlier and her climax under his hands had left him hard as a rock\u2014but fucking her during this constant defiance stage of hers wouldn\u2019t be wise.</p><p>At the stocks, the blond dom wore a black jacket and leather pants. After her introduction to Holt, Gabrielle had eyed his biker jacket, which apparently matched her conception of a dom\u2019s proper attire, and smirked at Marcus. Marcus chuckled. She might drive him crazy, but the little redhead certainly didn\u2019t bore him.</p><p>He chose a seat at an angle to the play area. Holt had secured her well, with her head and hands restrained in the wooden bar and her yellow hot pants pulled down to bare her ass.</p><p>The little sub was quite a colorful sight. Pale, pale skin. A yellow top that barely contained her pretty breasts. The three yellow earrings in her right ear matched her clothing, two blue ones in the left to match her dyed locks, and a curling vine tattoo on her arm duplicated the colors. In the brighter light of the scene area, her hair glinted in a myriad of reds and golds\u2014and blue. Odd how he\u2019d only thought her pretty at first, but she truly was a lovely sub. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Holt walked in a slow circle around her, Gabrielle\u2019s face flushed, her hands clenching. Her weight shifted from leg to leg as if she realized how vulnerable her ass was in that position. Nervous. Excited. Very nice.</p><p>Taking his time, Holt played with her pussy and breasts to increase her arousal. Marcus had watched the dom work before. He did a fine job, although Marcus wanted to be the one with his hands running over her soft ass and teasing her pale pink nipples to stand erect.</p><p>Holt started to switch her lightly, watching her reactions.</p><p>After a few gentle swats, Gabrielle fisted her hands, and her mouth tightened\u2014not in pain, but as if she struggled with herself. Here we go, Marcus thought, not sure whether to laugh or curse.</p> <p>\u201cIs this all you got?\u201d she asked loudly. \u201cHey, even that stuffy trainer hits harder.\u201d</p><p>Stuffy trainer. Well, damn.</p><p>In a tuneful voice, she sang, \u201cAnything you can do, he can do better...\u201d</p><p>Marcus smothered a smile.</p><p>Holt tapped the switch on his palm, then tossed it aside, obviously deciding to see why she deliberately provoked him. He sauntered around the stocks and fisted his hand in her hair. The music from the dance floor drowned out whatever he said to her. Then he walked back and picked up the switch. Marcus assessed him\u2014still in control. No anger. Good enough.</p> <p>Turning his attention to Gabrielle, Marcus stiffened. Her face had turned dead white and expressionless, her eyes blank. What the hell had Holt said to her? Even as Marcus rose, Holt swung, caught her abnormally still body language, and pulled the blow. He tossed the switch aside again and reached her head just as Marcus got to the ropes.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, help me get her loose. She\u2019s frozen up.\u201d With one hand, Holt rubbed Gabrielle\u2019s back; with the other, he unlatched the bar. He crooned, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart. You\u2019re safe.\u201d He flipped back the upper bar that trapped her neck and wrists. \u201cGabrielle. Look at me, Gabrielle.\u201d He shook his head at Marcus. \u201cShe\u2019s out of it, dammit.\u201d</p><p>But her legs hadn\u2019t buckled, Marcus realized as he pulled her shorts up and helped move her out of the stocks. His gut tightened. This wasn\u2019t a normal reaction at all. Holt wrapped an arm around her, holding her up, still in charge of the scene. When her legs buckled, Marcus forced himself not to reach for her, but God, he wanted to\u2014to snatch her away, to hold her, to see what was wrong.</p><p>Holt looked up. \u201cI\u2019m still a stranger to her, and I\u2019m not going to play pissing games with a terrified sub. Take her.\u201d</p><p>Marcus gave him a grateful nod and swung her into his arms. \u201cSugar, you\u2019re safe. Relax now. You\u2019re safe.\u201d He stepped out of the roped-off area.</p><p>Olivia in a dungeon monitor vest waited nearby to see if they needed help.</p> <p>\u201cWe got it,\u201d he murmured to her and settled onto a couch, Holt dropping down beside them. With an arm behind her back, Marcus leaned Gabrielle against his chest, then cupped her cheek. \u201cGabrielle, I need for you to look at me now,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Her eyes were wide, unfocused, much like a sub in endorphin overload, but her stiff body, pale face, and clammy skin indicated something else. Worry deepened and sharpened his voice. \u201cGabrielle. Look. At. Me.\u201d</p><p>She jerked as if he\u2019d slapped her. Some of the blankness receded from her gaze. She blinked and stared at him, then around, obviously not remembering how she\u2019d ended up on his lap. When she shivered, he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>Holt fetched a fluffy subbie blanket and tucked it over the girl.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered and frowned at the young dom. \u201cI was with you, wasn\u2019t I? The stocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were, Gabrielle.\u201d Holt took her hand and watched her reaction carefully. She didn\u2019t jerk away. \u201cCan you tell me what happened? What scared you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her brows together.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her smile wavered a little. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d Her muscles tightened.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sugar,\u201d Marcus murmured.</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cMarcus?\u201d Her body relaxed, melting into him.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. She trusted him, and the knowledge warmed him. Relieved him. To see the feisty little sub reduced to frozen fear had worried the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cYou smarted off to Holt,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, glanced under her lashes at the dom. \u201cUm. Yeah. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to get a rise out of me,\u201d Holt said. \u201cDid you really want me to switch you harder?\u201d</p><p>Tensing again, she shook her head. \u201cUh-uh.\u201d</p><p>Marcus frowned. One more time where her insolent behavior didn\u2019t make sense. She didn\u2019t like pain. Sometimes a sub wanted a dom\u2019s attention, but Gabrielle already had that.</p><p>He shook his head. Analyze later, Atherton. Right now, he needed to know what had caused her response, and since she didn\u2019t remember, they\u2019d go through it step-by-step. \u201cHolt grabbed your hair,\u201d Marcus said. Moving slowly, he curled his fingers into her hair and pulled.</p><p>If anything, she softened against him.</p><p>Holt grinned. \u201cWell, that certainly wasn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Holt said something to you. Do you remember what, Darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d She bit her lip and frowned at the younger dom. \u201cYou grabbed my hair, and you bent over and\u2014\u201d Her muscles started to tense.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle,\u201d Marcus snapped.</p><p>She jerked and looked up.</p><p>\u201cThere we go. Stay with me, Darlin\u2019.\u201d He stroked her shaggy hair, and she eased back with a tired sigh. \u201cHolt, can you give it to her piece by piece?\u201d</p><p>Holt\u2019s mouth flattened, and he squeezed Gabrielle\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you again, sweetheart, but we need to find out what did this. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but her body stilled. She might not consciously remember the cause, but something inside her did.</p><p>\u201cYou little brat,\u201d Holt said.</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s exhalation was almost a laugh.</p><p>Smiling, Marcus rubbed his chin across her head. Nothing kept this spitfire down long, did it? The knot in his stomach loosened.</p><p>\u201cGuess it wasn\u2019t that.\u201d Holt smiled and fed her the next part: \u201cYou obviously want to be beaten hard...\u201d</p><p>A tiny flinch from her, but no fear.</p><p>Holt nodded. \u201c...or maybe you\u2019re a dirty slut who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s body turned rigid. Her eyes went blank.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Marcus lifted her chin again. \u201cGabrielle, look at me. Now!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>The bond he\u2019d established with her reached deep, and she shuddered. Her eyes focused on his.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good girl. Stay with me, Darlin\u2019.\u201d Because you\u2019re scaring the hell out of me when you don\u2019t.</p><p>She sighed and leaned into him again.</p><p>Marcus glanced at Holt. The dom\u2019s face tightened with unhappiness and guilt. \u201cI wanted to find out if she liked being called names.\u201d</p><p>Quite a few subs got off on a dom calling them slut or whore or dirty. \u201cYou weren\u2019t out of line, Holt. I\u2019ve never seen such an extreme reaction to verbal humiliation. This is something from the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d The dom ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYou going to work on this with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d His expression turned harsh. \u201cIf you discover who taught her that kind of fear...I\u2019d enjoy giving him a lesson in manners.\u201d</p><p>Marcus nodded. So would I. As the other dom walked away, Marcus stroked Gabrielle\u2019s pale cheek and studied on the matter.</p><p>\u201cDirty slut.\u201d Some women might be disgusted, some affronted, some turned on. But Gabrielle\u2019s reaction seemed closer to a catatonic flashback. What could have happened in her past to set such a trigger? The most likely cause would be...</p><p>His arms felt so good, and he shed heat like the sun on a summer day. Gabi pressed her cheek against the smooth shirt covering his muscular chest. She should get back to playing decoy, but her body didn\u2019t want to move. She stared at the stocks. They\u2019d released her, carried her here, and she didn\u2019t remember. How could she have blanked out? As fear spiraled up her spine, she took a death grip on Marcus\u2019s suit. Don\u2019t let go.</p><p>At her movement, he ran his knuckles over her cheek and used his thumb under her chin to turn her face up. His intense scrutiny felt as if he could see through her clothing, even her body, all the way into her inner self. She couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cYou ever played out a rape scenario, sugar?\u201d he asked in a rough voice, as if the ugly word had abraded away the smoothness.</p><p>As her skin turned cold, nausea wrung her stomach like a dirty washcloth. She dug her fingers into his forearm and encountered only rocklike muscles. \u201cNo.\u201d No no no. \u201cNo, please, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He released her face and curled his strong fingers around hers, anchoring her in the present. \u201cWhen were you raped?\u201d</p><p>Her air disappeared as if he\u2019d hit her in the solar plexus, and her next inhalation struggled against the constriction in her chest. \u201cHow...how did you know?\u201d</p><p>His eyes stayed steady on hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t, Darlin\u2019. But now I do. When?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed. \u201cTen years ago. I got caught in a gang war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d The unemotional acknowledgement somehow let her breathe. She looked down, watching how his thumb traced small circles on the back of her hand. Slowly her muscles unknotted.</p><p>\u201cDoes a man taking control bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It all happened in the past, and I deal with it okay. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t put anything down on the questionnaire as a problem.\u201d</p><p>He made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Darlin\u2019. Look at me now.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to flinch from the intensity of his blue gaze. I don\u2019t want to talk about this; I just want you to hold me.</p><p>\u201cWhen does being dominated cause problems?\u201d And as if she couldn\u2019t understand the question, he nodded toward the stocks.</p><p>Okay, so maybe sometimes she didn\u2019t do so well. \u201cI never thought about it.\u201d And I never want to.</p><p>Even as he kept her gaze trapped, he stroked her cheek gently, and as always when he mixed all that power with gentleness, everything in her melted. His eyes softened, and he murmured, \u201cLittle sub.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cThink about what you felt in the stocks...and tell me about the last time you froze.\u201d</p><p>She said lightly, \u201cWell, seems like once\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be acting up, Gabrielle.\u201d His fingers took her chin in an all-too-effective control. \u201cI want to hear about the last time something made you sick and scared.\u201d</p><p>No sidestepping would evade his insistence on answers. \u201cI dated a guy for a while. He\u2019d pull my hair and fuck rough, and I liked it. A lot. But he called me names once...\u201d Her hands turned clammy, and she tried to look away.</p><p>His hand tightened on her face. \u201cStay with me here, Gabrielle.\u201d His sharp eyes cut through her fear like a knife. \u201cTell me the words he used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlut.\u201d The word reverberated in her skull, and her pulse filled her ears like breaking waves in a storm. She swallowed, forcing nausea back. \u201cWhore. Cunt. Stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there we go. It\u2019s all tied to the words.\u201d He was silent a minute, thinking, then frowned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re still shaking, Darlin\u2019. We\u2019re going to sit a piece while you take a bit of rest.\u201d His hand slid to her nape and pressed her head against his shoulder. As the noise in her brain diminished, she could hear the slow beat of his heart, and each thud somehow settled her world.</p><p>She heard him speaking off and on... Coaxing the rough-voiced dom to give a construction job to a teen with a bad rep. Someone with a light Hispanic accent talked him into joining a poker night the following week. The techno music changed to classical\u2014Rachmaninoff.</p><p>He held her firmly, his arms never loosening. Sometimes he\u2019d drop a kiss on top of her head as if to let her know he hadn\u2019t forgotten her. And she felt more content right there, right then, than in just about forever.</p><p>Eventually he sat her up, laughter in his voice. \u201cYou falling asleep there, sugar?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and remembered to answer. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d A second\u2019s pause and she risked looking up. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, but we\u2019re not quite finished, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>\u201cFirst, and I mean for you to remember this: verbal humiliation is a hard limit for you. You tell any dom that before you start a scene. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>A hard limit meant a definitely won\u2019t do that. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood enough. Now I want to use a few of those words and see how you react.\u201d As he waited for her nod, he took her hand.</p><p>To brace herself, she gripped his wrist. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlut,\u201d he said softly, his eyes watching her closely.</p><p>She winced, then took a breath.</p><p>\u201cDirty slut.\u201d</p><p>Same reaction.</p><p>\u201cCunt. Fuckhole.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard them before, could hear the nasty voice as\u2014she pushed the memory aside. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brave, Darlin\u2019, not fine. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cSo rough sex or force doesn\u2019t bother you\u2014only the words?\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t make sense, did it? Staring at the scars on his knuckles, she tried to think. \u201cI... When...it...happened, other stuff had happened first\u201d\u2014Danny and Rock dying. The slicing pain down her face, blood everywhere, and\u2014\u201cand I was numb, I guess. Not feeling anything at all, but...I couldn\u2019t shut out the voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices.\u201d He rasped the word, emphasizing the s that made it plural. Under her fingers, his wrist muscles flexed to iron.</p><p>If he had directed that icy fury toward her, her heart would have stopped\u2014instead his anger made her feel as if she wasn\u2019t alone in an unpredictably violent world. She stroked her hand over his forearm, ruffling the golden hair.</p><p>After a few seconds, he took a long, slow breath and kissed the top of her head. \u201cAll right. Just the words. I do like knowing you wouldn\u2019t freeze if someone attacked you\u201d\u2014he smiled slightly\u2014\u201cso long as they didn\u2019t call you names.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh sounded like a hiccup, but better than nothing. \u201cI can guarantee that.\u201d A guy had jumped her three years ago, and she hadn\u2019t frozen at all. Apparently a man\u2019s knees only bent one way.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d His brows drew together. \u201cI do not like that a few words can paralyze you so badly. You didn\u2019t even think about a safe word. What if you weren\u2019t here but playing somewhere in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She\u2019d known from her date\u2019s reaction that she\u2019d scared him. The thought of blanking out like this terrified her. And all because of a few nasty words. \u201cI didn\u2019t lose it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle trainee, if you didn\u2019t trust me with your body and with your emotions to some degree, you wouldn\u2019t have returned after the first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d have tried to return for Kim\u2019s sake but might have failed if he\u2019d truly scared her. Even now her body seemed to sing, safe, safe, safe. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your reaction to Holt, having someone else say the words is too risky.\u201d He lifted her hand and kissed her fingers absentmindedly. \u201cBut you don\u2019t react enough if it\u2019s me. Of course, you knew I\u2019d say them. Maybe I should surprise you.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think the other doms would like you ruining their scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we might could find a different method.\u201d He frowned. \u201cStill, you should get some professional help, Gabrielle. Talking through this with someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have counseling afterward,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cThis didn\u2019t come to light then.\u201d Or during job evals. Of course, I didn\u2019t want to believe I had a problem. \u201cBut now... Well, if I can\u2019t fix it myself, I\u2019ll get help, but there\u2019s no way I can do that at this time.\u201d Sorry, Agent Rhodes, but I need to visit a psychologist. I\u2019ll go back to playing decoy later. Tempting. Nonetheless, she\u2019d stay. For Kim.</p><p>But God, what if someone\u2014a killer\u2014called her names? Her skin chilled. She needed to get over this now. \u201cYou said \u201ea different method.\" What do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThis might be too realistic, might raise more demons than we want to deal with right now.\u201d</p><p>His use of we wiped away the chill. She wouldn\u2019t have to face her fear alone. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Shadowlands has a yard for people who want to play outside. Sometimes Master Z closes it down and sets up\u201d\u2014she saw him reject the r word and choose another\u2014\u201ccapture games. Submissives are given a head start and then chased by their doms. They might get punished for their escape or fucked or both.\u201d</p><p>Marcus grabbing her. Pushing her to the ground. Holding her hair and... Heat slid through her, hot enough to liquefy her lower half. Until she imagined a man\u2014any man\u2014forcing her, and she chilled.</p><p>\u201cI will be damned,\u201d Marcus said slowly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought the idea would excite you, but it did. For a moment. Tell me what turned you off after that.\u201d</p><p>The sharing came easier this time, maybe because he listened so carefully. \u201cA stranger grabbing me and holding me down.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cWhat excited you?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, a flush of embarrassment heating her face. Yeah, tell the nice dom that he turns you on.</p><p>His warm hand cupping her cheek, he forced her to look at him. \u201cTalk to me, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou grabbing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He stroked the underside of her jaw with his thumb. \u201cMost women want to choose the man who stars in their fantasy, Darlin\u2019. Especially ones with a history like yours. But acting out a capture fantasy wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA game of hide-and-seek. And when I catch you, I\u2019ll call you nasty names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. The gardens feel dangerous, especially with others acting out their chase games. If you are sufficiently nervous...I think it might work. For tonight, all I want is for you to say a safe word rather than freeze. That will, at least, make you safer if you\u2019re in a BDSM scene.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not a rape fantasy, just a children\u2019s game. Her mouth still felt too dry, her heart too fast. \u201cBut only you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes held complete understanding. \u201cMe. I am the only one who will chase you. No one else.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling like a bobblehead doll she\u2019d won at a carnival years before. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Marcus tucked Gabrielle behind the bar where Cullen could keep an eye on her and went to change out of his suit.</p><p>When he returned, he stood off to one side for few minutes, amusement trickling through him. Apparently she\u2019d recovered enough to sass Cullen; he\u2019d gagged her with a ball gag, which not only silenced her but added the humiliation of making her drool around the rubber ball.</p><p>Cullen occasionally stopped mixing drinks to wipe her chin and\u2014from the way her color came and went\u2014give her hell. New submissives often misread the sociable bartender, figuring him easygoing. They rarely made the mistake twice.</p><p>Marcus strolled over, pausing to exchange greetings with the various members around the bar.</p><p>Cullen glanced at Marcus\u2019s black jeans and sleeveless T-shirt. \u201cNice to see you in real clothes for a change. By the way, I found your trainee too mouthy to tolerate.\u201d</p><p>Marcus looked at Gabrielle.</p><p>She stared at his clothing as if she\u2019d never seen a dom in jeans.</p><p>Suppressing his amusement, he waited until her gaze rose to meet his, then looked at the gag in her mouth and let his disappointment in her behavior show.</p><p>To his surprise, her eyes reddened with tears before she turned her head away.</p><p>Something twisted inside him. The bond between them continued to develop. She not only trusted him, but she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to please him. So there was hope for her after all. But the connection went two ways, being balanced by his need to protect and nurture. And possess. He found he didn\u2019t like seeing her under someone else\u2019s restraints. \u201cRelease her, please, sir,\u201d he said to Cullen.</p><p>Cullen unsnapped her arms and handed her a cloth before undoing the ball gag. She wiped her face, scrubbed the spit away, and glared at Cullen.</p><p>When the bartender looked at her in disbelief, Marcus clenched his jaw to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cHere I thought Andrea was bad.\u201d Cullen grasped her hair in his big fist and growled at her, \u201cApologize, sub, and thank me for the lesson.\u201d The sheer power he put into the words had her stammering out an apology and thank-you before she could get her sassy attitude back.</p><p>The people seated at the bar laughed.</p><p>Marcus regarded her carefully. Although flushed, she displayed no pleasure at acquiring an audience with her behavior. Whatever reason she had to misbehave, it wasn\u2019t to attract attention the way his ex-wife had done. Thank God. \u201cCome, Gabrielle, before you get in more trouble than you can survive,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>When Cullen turned his back, she stuck out her tongue. As laughter rippled around the bar, she hurried to Marcus\u2019s side, her eyes dancing with mischief.</p><p>In the dim bar, her smooth, pale skin almost glowed. He ran his knuckles over the sweet curve of her cheek and tucked a silky curl behind her ear. \u201cLittle brat,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She grinned at him.</p><p>Unable to resist, he bent to take her soft lips, pinning her between him and the bar so her body plastered against his. High breasts, lush ass. And when her arms circled his neck, he simply let everything go and savored kissing a yielding sub. This sub\u2014Gabrielle\u2014who made every other submissive seem bland. He nipped her bottom lip to tease her mouth open, then swept inside her mouth. She kissed him back with a hungry urgency. His arms tightened as he lost himself, plunging deeply and taking everything she offered so generously. When he hardened, she moaned and rubbed against him.</p> <p>He stepped back reluctantly, pleased at the pink flush in her cheeks, the heat in her eyes. Slowly he ran a finger over her damp lips, wishing he could justify taking her upstairs to one of the private rooms.</p><p>But no. You\u2019re her trainer, Atherton. She needs help, not a good fucking, although she might enjoy... No. He stepped back.</p><p>Cullen shook his head. \u201cAnother one bites the dust. You want your toy bag, Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d He set a hand in the hollow of her back, guiding her across the room to the side door and into the prep area for the Capture Gardens.</p><p>The potential participants stood in a line for Z\u2019s mandatory check. A psychologist, the Shadowlands owner spoke with any couple or group wanting to play the games, and occasionally denied admittance for reasons no one else could see. The other Masters insisted Z read minds. Delusional idiots.</p><p>Gabrielle had turned quiet when they entered, her muscles tightening. He pulled her closer, wanting to reassure her it would be all right. But she needed to be nervous to make this work. And it might not be all right. Her nestling against his side gave him perhaps as much comfort as it did her.</p><p>When they reached the head of the line, Master Z touched Gabrielle\u2019s cheek with his fingertips, and his dark brows drew together. \u201cAre you certain you want to participate, little one?\u201d he asked, sounding more like an overprotective father than a dom.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He stepped aside to let her pass, then frowned at Marcus. \u201cYou realize she\u2019s as scared as she is excited? There\u2019s something in\u2014\u201d He paused and smiled slightly. \u201cIndeed, you\u2019re on top of it. Have a nice game, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d After Marcus moved past, he glanced back over his shoulder. That was...odd.</p><p>The hum of excited conversation echoed off the dark-paneled walls. Heart pounding, Gabi scraped her toes on the cool roughness of the stone floor and watched the club members waiting to enter the garden. To play scary games.</p><p>She\u2019d almost backed out when Master Z had questioned her. No I\u2019m not certain. Still...she couldn\u2019t leave herself with such an idiotic vulnerability. And how would she ever find someone she\u2019d trust as she did Master Marcus? But she was scared. Oh yeah.</p><p>The line filed forward, with submissives going out to the gardens while their doms gathered on one side of the room. Eventually she and Marcus stood a few feet from the outside door. Beside a table piled with unlit glow sticks, Master Sam wished the preceding couple a good time, then turned to Master Marcus.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, I didn\u2019t know you planned to play tonight.\u201d The silver-haired dom smiled. His pale blue eyes examined Gabi. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty yellow outfit. Might as well match it.\u201d He picked up three yellow plastic sticks and flexed them until they glowed. \u201cGive me your arm, girl.\u201d</p><p>She held her hand out. He fastened one around her wrist, one on her ankle, and the last on Marcus\u2019s wrist. \u201cThe colors are a safeguard so the dungeon monitors can check that a dom grabs the right sub. In other words, only Master Marcus may claim you, Gabrielle. Clear so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Only Marcus. I can do this.</p><p>Marcus put his arm around her. \u201cRemember the club safe word is red, sugar. Dungeon monitors will be in the gardens to make sure people follow the rules.\u201d</p><p>She answered the concern in his eyes with a firm nod and smiled at Master Sam. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her and turned to the next group, three men\u2014two subs, one dom. Did the poor dom have to chase them both down?</p><p>Marcus guided her to where a Hispanic Master stood beside the door. Gabi winced. He\u2019d been the dom who\u2019d had her paddled for mouthing off.</p><p>He grinned at Marcus. \u201cDo you want her prepared?\u201d</p><p>Marcus regarded her. \u201cNo, I believe this is enough excitement for one little subbie. Thank you, Raoul.\u201d</p><p>Whatever prepared meant, Gabi thought she was glad to have avoided it.</p><p>\u201cHowever, Gabrielle, I do want you in a slave dress,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d She followed his gaze to a bunch of faded, raggedy dresses hanging on hooks.</p><p>\u201cHang your clothing up and put on one of those, please.\u201d</p><p>His polite words didn\u2019t cover up the steely tone. She automatically took a step and then heard a man laughing behind her. People. Audience. How could she have forgotten her task here? Guilt washed through her as well as a chill at thinking the perp might be in the room. She couldn\u2019t relax, mustn\u2019t relax, must do her job. \u201cI\u2019d rather wear my own clothing, thank you very much,\u201d she said insolently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting this again?\u201d Marcus asked gently. \u201cNow?\u201d He contemplated her as if she posed a perplexing chess puzzle.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not much to ask.\u201d She set her hands on her hips. \u201cThose rags are ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are indeed, but I thought you\u2019d prefer them to the alternative.\u201d He glanced at the other man. \u201cMaster Raoul, a full prep please. I would ask that you be verbally polite.\u201d</p><p>Master Raoul looked as affronted as if Marcus had hit him. \u201cHave I ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, my friend. I said that poorly,\u201d Marcus apologized in his rich southern drawl. He caressed Gabi\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe recently found that verbal abuse brings back a traumatic experience, so I\u2019m making that a hard limit for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Dark brown eyes studied her for a minute. Then Master Raoul smiled slightly. \u201cWell as long as I can abuse her physically, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along fine. Gabrielle, strip completely, including your cuffs, hang your clothing on a hook, and return to me here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d What the hell was a full prep?</p><p>\u201cDo you need help, chiquita?\u201d the dom asked softly.</p><p>The leather vest he wore didn\u2019t come close to hiding his muscular build, and his forearms were the size of her calves. Power lifter, she\u2019d bet. He could probably rip her clothes off without bothering to undo them first. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Although Master Marcus had pressed his lips together, the corners of his mouth turned up. The bastard.</p> <p>She stalked over to where two other subs were changing into slave rags. Gabi pulled off her clothing and hung it up. She tried to pretend she remained fully clothed, but the air brushing against her bare skin and the amusement of the doms waiting to one side destroyed the illusion. She unbuckled her cuffs and hesitated. Was she supposed to hang them up too?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them, Gabrielle.\u201d Master Raoul took the cuffs out of her hands.</p><p>Startled at his sudden appearance, she flushed and started to cover herself.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou have a modest sub, Marcus?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head in disapproval, Marcus joined them. With a firm grip, he moved her arms to bare her body. \u201cAfter your first night, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019d need reminding, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped back, and his gaze ran over her slowly, lingering on her breasts, her pussy. The air itself seemed to heat. \u201cYou have a lovely body, sugar, and I do like seeing you without clothing.\u201d</p><p>His open enjoyment warmed her almost as much as the heat in his eyes, and she stared up at him, feeling the earth slide sideways.</p><p>After a moment or an hour, he ran a finger down her cheek, and the simple touch made her shake inside. \u201cGo with Master Raoul to get prepared for the gardens.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the muscular dom grasped her upper arm and guided her to the door.</p><p>Feet dragging, she looked over her shoulder, hoping for a reprieve. Marcus jerked his head in an unmistakable go on now.</p><p>Fine. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she muttered and rolled her eyes.</p> <p>Unfortunately that meant she saw Master Raoul\u2019s expression, like one more peep would get her butt blistered. Dropping her gaze, she kept her mouth shut as he escorted her across the soft grass next to the building.</p><p>A lanky man in leathers waited with what appeared to be a pressure sprayer. \u201cI always get this job,\u201d he complained. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Heather would chop your hands off at the wrists.\u201d Raoul turned to Gabi. \u201cHold your hair up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Master Raoul shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t keep pushing, little sub. Jake, toss me the switch.\u201d</p><p>A long, thin stick flew through the air. Raoul caught it and slapped it on his leather pants.</p><p>She took a hasty step back, trying not to cringe. I\u2019m really getting to hate pain, and I don\u2019t much like you either.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to repeat myself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d She gathered her hair off her shoulders and held it up with one hand.</p><p>\u201cGood enough. Now hold still.\u201d He nodded to Jake.</p><p>The brown-haired dom pumped the sprayer and turned the nozzle toward her. Warm liquid, lightly scented with lemon, sprayed across her front and, as he walked around her, her back and legs. \u201cDone,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gabi let out a sigh. Well, that wasn\u2019t too bad. She\u2019d expected worse. As she slid a finger down her stomach, she realized the liquid was oil and giggled. They\u2019d oiled her like she\u2019d star in a greased-pig contest.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s grin flashed white in his tanned face, and even in the dim light she saw how his dark eyes softened. He looked entirely different. Like a nice person. \u201cYou have a pretty laugh, Gabrielle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can let go of your hair now.\u201d</p><p>After sliding the switch under his belt, he held his palms out to Jake and received a squirt of oil. With blunt-fingered, calloused hands, he oiled her unsprayed arm.</p><p>Just about the time she started to relax, he moved to her shoulders, the other arm, her back, rubbing the oil into her skin. She stiffened. Hadn\u2019t Marcus said it would be only him? But she\u2019d screwed that up, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>He was unhappy with her. Again.</p><p>Seemed as if she always did something wrong. Either she wasn\u2019t loud and rebellious and nasty enough for Agent Rhodes\u2019s idea of a brat, or her behavior disappointed Master Marcus. And disappointing him...hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making you so sad, chiquita?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and focused on Master Raoul. He\u2019d stopped to study her face, his expression so kind she wanted to spill everything out. She shook her head instead. \u201cNothing you can help me with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Master Marcus? Could he help?\u201d Raoul asked softly.</p><p>The burning in her eyes was unexpected and totally unwelcome. What was this place doing to her? \u201cNo.\u201d She gave him a crooked smile. \u201cIt\u2019s my problem.\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze didn\u2019t leave hers for a long moment. \u201cI think you\u2019d find he would listen, querida.\u201d He squeezed her shoulder, then knelt to rub the oil into her legs, up her calves, her thighs. It felt good, strange, even a little exciting until he neared her pussy. Her muscles tightened. To her relief, he rose to his feet.</p><p>She relaxed...and then he put his big hands on her breasts. She squeaked, stepped back, and bumped into Jake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not done yet, subbie,\u201d the younger dom said. He held her upper arms firmly despite her struggles as Raoul massaged in the oil. When he stopped, her breasts felt achingly swollen.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done. She stared over his shoulder, and yet she could feel his keen gaze on her face, as he teased and pinched her nipples, wakening them with slow circles, gentle friction, and little jolts of pain until they stood in rigid peaks. To her horror, she felt herself dampening.</p><p>As if he could tell, his eyes crinkled with his smile. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready for Master Marcus now.\u201d He brushed a kiss over her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet little sub, for all your mouthiness.\u201d</p><p>Jake released her arms, saying, \u201cHave a great run, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Raoul walked her back to the door, but rather than going inside, he pointed to the huge yard and a wide grassy path between tall bushes. \u201cRun that way, Gabrielle, and then wherever you want. Give Master Marcus a good hunt.\u201d</p><p>Staring around her, she walked in the direction he\u2019d pointed.</p><p>With a loud sigh, he pulled the switch from his belt and gave her a stinging swat right across her bottom. As she yelped in shock, he growled, \u201cI said run, sub. Run!\u201d</p><p>She sprang away, hearing the swish of the switch. Her bottom stung like hell\u2014he\u2019d got her good. Bastard dom, acting all sweet and then nailing her like that.</p><p>Her breasts bounced painfully as she ran, and she slowed quickly. As the plush golf-course-length grass tickled her feet, a sultry night breeze wafted against her bare skin. It felt strange\u2014wrong\u2014to walk around outside with no clothes on.</p><p>Rubbing her arms, she continued on. Hedges loomed on each side, opening into secluded areas with menacing shadows. \u201cGive Master Marcus a good hunt,\u201d Master Raoul had said, so she turned down a smaller path, working her way deeper in. Other glow lights twinkled here and there, reminding her she wasn\u2019t the only submissive in the game.</p><p>What a beautiful place though. The moonlight paled the curving flower gardens. Fountains splashed and gurgled everywhere, and lights under the water glowed. White fog drifted through the humid air and swirled around her ankles. Fog? She glanced up at the cloudless night sky and frowned, then realized the fog came from the fountains, spilling like thick mist over the sides.</p><p>They created fake fog, just for fun? She shook her head, trying to be amused, except the stuff made the place really eerie.</p><p>A man\u2019s voice broke the quiet. \u201cLords and ladies, the hunt is on. Find your slaves and do what you will.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Multicolored glow sticks danced like fireflies through the darkness. People ran here and there. Some of them. Other lights moved slower, more deliberately. The doms. Stalking their slaves.</p><p>And the sounds... A scream from the right. The slap of flesh on flesh and whimpering\u2014someone getting spanked. Gabi turned her head and heard wet sounds and simultaneous grunts from the left\u2014someone getting taken. Hard.</p><p>She had a quick image of Marcus grabbing her, forcing her to her knees, and driving into her. She sucked in a breath. He wouldn\u2019t. That wasn\u2019t what she wanted. Yet her nipples peaked, and her body dampened again.</p><p>He\u2019d be out there somewhere, searching for her yellow glow stick. Hunting her. The air seemed to heat, wafting over her skin like a hot breath.</p><p>She walked, taking one path after another, veering around the tiny nooks, averting her gaze from the people in them: a black woman chained to a tree trunk getting flogged. A skinny, naked man kneeling, his dom\u2019s cock in his mouth. A hefty domme in a shiny latex corset riding a man on all fours, steering him toward a secluded area. She\u2019d bridled the guy, Gabi realized. Yeehaw.</p><p>Still looking over her shoulder at the couple, she ran into a solid body and squeaked.</p><p>The man grasped her arms in a firm grip. \u201cEasy, subbie.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. Pale eyes and silvery gray hair glinted in the moonlight. \u201cMaster Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of the dungeon monitors this evening. Remember the safe word, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d They stood on a bigger path where others could see them...maybe the perp even, so Gabi added, \u201cOh lord and master. High muckety-muck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His thin lips curved into a pleased smile, and his hands tightened.</p><p>Uh-oh. She tried to retreat.</p><p>Despite her struggles, he turned her easily and then swatted her bottom really, really hard, right on top of where the switch had hit.</p><p>The burning pain swamped the stinging left from the switch. \u201cDamn you, that hurt!\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her back against his chest to murmur in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m a sadist, girl, and I enjoy the sound of pain. If you don\u2019t want to scream, watch carefully how you behave around me.\u201d</p><p>A tremor of true fear ran up her spine before he chuckled and let her go. This time she ran like hell.</p><p>A few minutes later, she slowed and bent over to brace her hands on her knees to catch her breath. Note to self\u2014must exercise more. When she straightened, she saw a solid wood fence blocked her way. She\u2019d reached the far end of the gardens. How many acres was this place? She turned to head back, choosing a path that led past a pure white flower garden glowing in the moonlight.</p><p>A dark shape stepped out of the nearby bushes. \u201cCome here, dirty slut.\u201d</p><p>She froze, her breath gone, unable to move as the man stalked closer.</p> <p>\u201cGabrielle.\u201d He grasped her shoulders and shook her gently. \u201cGabrielle. Look. At. Me. Use the safe word. Say it.\u201d</p><p>Marcus. It\u2019s Marcus. She stared up at his strong face. His masculine scent blended with that of the tropical flowers, and she could breathe again. \u201cRed,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled and pulled her into his arms for a hug. \u201cVery, very good, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>When he started to release her, she clung, and without objecting, he held her as her pounding heart rate slowed, as her muscles unknotted. Eventually he pulled back. \u201cReady for more?\u201d</p><p>No. But she firmed her lips. Turn into a brainless vegetable because of some words? Nothing Marcus might do to her could be scarier than that. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore it is. I\u2019m proud of you, sugar.\u201d He leaned down to kiss her, lightly nibbling at first, then taking her mouth with such a fierce, possessive hunger that her world filled with his touch and taste.</p> <p>God, the man could kiss.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cStay brave, little sub.\u201d He took two panther-quiet steps. Then the shadows swallowed him.</p><p>She frowned at how well he\u2019d disappeared and realized she saw no yellow light. He\u2019d taken off his glow stick, probably hidden it in his jeans pocket. Sneaky bastard.</p><p>After a few steps, she broke into a run. Let him try to keep up\u2014why should he have this too easy? After rounding a corner, she turned. No sight of him.</p><p>Calloused hands grabbed her and jerked her back against a hard body. \u201cFilthy fuckhole.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cSafe word. Say it, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d</p> <p>Four more times, he sent her into the darkness and found her again. At the last interception, reeling with exhaustion, she spat the word at him without even a pause. \u201cRed, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and then his hand fisted in her hair as he held her and took possession of her mouth. He kissed her as she\u2019d always dreamed of being kissed, hard and deep.</p><p>When he pulled back, he had to drag her arms from where she\u2019d wrapped them around his neck. \u201cLet\u2019s head back, sugar,\u201d he said in a slightly hoarse voice.</p><p>She gave a small sigh. His kiss had energized her, and right now she wished he\u2019d chase her for...fun...instead of to spout dumb words at her. \u201cI s\u2019pose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suppose?\u201d Instead of moving away, he stepped closer. His hard hand cupped her breast. Held it. Weighed it in his palm.</p><p>She gasped at the sudden streak of fire through her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem all that tired, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said with the slow drawl thick in his voice, the one he got when he was angry or considering doing something interesting, like really playing the game.</p><p>Her mouth went dry as her skin seemed to tighten. If he chased her for real, would she get scared? She saw the same question in his eyes. She considered and decided within a bare second. Maybe he\u2019d frighten her, but the idea of having him catch her...take her...sent heat rolling low in her pelvis. A tremor shook her as she threw caution away. \u201cI\u2019m not tired at all, Sir. In fact, I might run back to the house and get a less ...wimpy...partner.\u201d</p><p>He gave a deep laugh. \u201cMight you indeed.\u201d He pulled his glow stick out of his pocket and fastened it on his wrist, then tilted her chin up. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll make it there before I catch you?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught, and it sure wasn\u2019t from fear. She snorted derisively. \u201cPiece of cake.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cI\u2019ll count to one hundred.\u201d</p><p>Counting in her head, she poured on the speed for seventy-five seconds, veering right and left, then left again, picking directions that led away from the house. Yeah, he\u2019d never find her. Of course, he always did. Trying to catch her breath silently, she walked, keeping her wrist in front of her. As she peered through the darkness and white seething fog, she realized few of the glow sticks moved quickly anymore. Most were in groups of three, showing the dom had caught his sub. A few matched colors hovered low to the ground, and she giggled, knowing exactly what that meant.</p><p>She reached the back fence again, and no Marcus. Turning, she took a path leading toward the house, a little disappointed. The idea that Marcus would want\u2014really want\u2014to make love to her had set her blood on fire.</p><p>The other subs always sighed when they talked about him.</p><p>She grimaced. Most of the trainees\u2014except for Sally\u2014didn\u2019t like her because of her bratty behavior. Her steps slowed as the excitement trickled out of her. Aside from her parents, people liked her; here almost no one did. Her shoulders sagged.</p><p>A couple of trainees said she took up too much of Master Marcus\u2019s time. She sighed. He probably felt the same way. She sure wouldn\u2019t be a very satisfactory trainee. He never acted disgusted\u2014she\u2019d had a lifetime of handling that, after all\u2014but she hated disappointing him over and over. She massaged the aching place under her ribs. \u201cI am so looking forward to when this is over,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Somewhere near the middle of the gardens, a woman screamed out her climax, and Gabi stopped at the jolt of envy.</p><p>Yet the game had lost its appeal. I\u2019m not here to play. When this ended, she\u2019d never see any of these people again. Even if she could, no one would welcome her, not after the way she\u2019d acted. She swallowed against the lump in her throat, and her eyes blurred.</p><p>Speaking of games, she needed to get back and resume her act. Returning without Marcus would be a good defiant action. Lifting her head, she searched for a path to take. Her gaze snagged on a bright yellow glow a few feet away. Not moving.</p><p>\u201cI do believe you\u2019re the only sub I\u2019ve seen reduced to tears before her dom caught her,\u201d Marcus\u2019s soft drawl came from the shadows. He\u2019d been standing there, watching her wallow in unhappiness.</p><p>She gulped, wanting to bury her face against his chest and cry. Not going to happen, wussy girl. She straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin, realizing she stood in the open, illumined by the moonlight. \u201cI felt sorry for myself since my wimpy dom can\u2019t catch a snail crossing the sidewalk.\u201d</p><p>A snort of laughter. \u201cI do enjoy your way with words, trainee.\u201d A pause and his voice lowered, the threat as obvious as a cat\u2019s unsheathed claws. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Fear ripped across her nerves, and she bolted toward the thicker bushes. If she got around those\u2014and she did\u2014he\u2019d have a more difficult time spotting her bracelet. But she lost track of him.</p><p>Panting, she stopped and spun in a circle\u2014and spotted a yellow glow stick. A few feet away. Perfectly still.</p><p>\u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hammered even before she sprinted across the path. He\u2014What was he going to do when he caught her? He really was a cat, toying with his prey. She veered around a hedge and ran straight into him, a solid wall of muscle. \u201cOooph!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and set her on her feet. \u201cThe next time, sugar, I\u2019m taking you down.\u201d He stepped back a pace. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The low-voiced threat sent excitement churning through her, making her aware of the cool fog against her ankles, the way bushes scraped on her naked body when she got too close, the way her breasts jostled as she ran. A corner. Another. She popped into a secluded spot to catch her breath, and back out and\u2014</p><p>He grabbed her from behind.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Instinctive terror blasted her. She twisted and shoved at him frantically.</p><p>Marcus... It was Marcus, not a stranger. Okay. Okay. Using her head now, she pulled and sidestepped, and his hands slipped off her oily body.</p><p>\u201cLi\u2019ll brat.\u201d He made another grab for her.</p><p>I\u2019m a greased pig, all right. Giggling, she dashed for the far side of the clearing, gaining only a few yards before his hand closed on her arm\u2014and she yanked out off his grasp. No hitting or scratching, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cYou are a slippery little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said, his southern accent markedly increased. The bastard grabbed her hair.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d She turned to hit him\u2014rules be damned\u2014and he moved faster than she\u2019d thought possible. Setting an arm behind her shoulders, the other up between her legs, he yanked her hips forward, tipping her backward, then dropped down on his knees with her in his arms. Before she got her balance, he rolled her onto her stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No way. She got her feet under her and lunged forward.</p><p>With a low laugh, he caught her ankle and yanked her back, then set a knee on her butt. His weight pinned her, making her feel...odd. Excited.</p><p>Yet the second his powerful hands closed on her shoulders, terror engulfed her in a cold, mindless fog. She froze.</p><p>He stilled. Waited. She caught a whiff of his musky amber scent, and warmth dissipated her fear. It was Marcus touching her. Knowing his knee rested on her bare bottom, his weight trapped her, made all the difference. She wiggled and couldn\u2019t resist taunting him. \u201cYou rat-bastard dipwad, let me go.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he tightened his grip. \u201cMouthy little sub.\u201d The wrist cuffs snicked off his belt. \u201cI am going to enjoy what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Under the growing tension, unable to help herself, she squirmed, and he simply put more weight on her. Controlling her.</p><p>Despite her thrashing, he firmly buckled one wrist cuff on and the other, then clipped them together behind her back. When he removed his weight, she thought he\u2019d pull her to her feet. Instead his knee pushed between her thighs, keeping her legs apart.</p><p>His jeans scraped against the sensitive skin of her inner thighs. For a minute, he didn\u2019t move. And then he stroked her legs, traced the crack between her butt checks, squeezed her waist. He ruthlessly touched her how and where he pleased, and her skin burned under his calloused hands until it seemed she might set the grass beneath her on fire.</p><p>He set his palm between her legs to cup her heat and gave a satisfied, \u201cMmmmh. You\u2019re nice and wet, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>His touch roused her, yet...she felt too naked, too restrained, too vulnerable. Needing to escape, she wiggled. Helplessly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Gabrielle.\u201d His voice deepened, a smooth threat as his hand pressed on her ass cheeks, holding her in place. \u201cStay put, sugar. I want to examine my prize.\u201d</p><p>The commanding voice, the knowledge he wouldn\u2019t let her move, melted her inside. This was what she wanted, needed. Someone to take the control from her. She turned her head and rested her cheek. The cool grass scraped and tantalized her bunching nipples, an erotic contrast to his warm hand on her bottom.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d His unyielding hand held her down as with his other, he touched her intimately, caressing her folds and sending heat lancing up her center. When he slowly pressed a finger through her puffy tissues and up inside her, pleasure boiled up so violently that her eyes almost crossed.</p><p>His finger slid out, then pushed in deeper. He made another pleased sound. \u201cYes, Li\u2019ll Sassy, I\u2019m going to tie you down, spread you open, and see how much of me you can take.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, yes. Her pussy clenched around him.</p><p>With a low laugh, he rose and lifted her easily to her feet. Holding her wrist cuffs, he reached around her and teased her breasts, pulling on her nipples, until her breasts burned with the same need as her pussy. As he pushed her toward the darkest section of the tiny area, he said in a low voice, \u201cI intend to take my time later, but right now, little escaped slave girl, I\u2019m going to fuck you hard.\u201d The rude word in Marcus\u2019s smooth voice was jarring. And so hot her knees wobbled.</p><p>Something glinted in the pale moonlight, and she saw that a heavy chain ran down from a thick tree branch and intersected four chains that opened to hold up...a tire swing. Rather than a standing-up position, the tractor-sized tire lay horizontally. \u201cA swing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know why in a minute.\u201d Marcus unclipped her wrists, grabbing her quickly before she could escape, and tossed her onto her back between the two sets of chains. The tire had canvas attached over the hole, providing support in the center. Her neck rested on the tire rim. I don\u2019t want to make love on a damned swing. She sat up.</p><p>Marcus laughed and shoved her down, then clipped her wrist cuffs to the chains beside her shoulders. The tire rocked wildly as she struggled, yet her excitement increased with each unsuccessful yank against the chains. When he walked to the bottom of the swing, she kicked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have sex here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what you wanted.\u201d He caught one leg in his merciless grip, and now she\u2019d seen him without the suit, she knew just how muscular he was. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to enjoy tying you up, sugar.\u201d He tried to bend her leg up, but she kept it straight\u2014that was the whole point of the game, right?</p><p>She almost giggled. So maybe not all her insolent behavior was playacting. And every time he made her obey, it seemed to fan the flames in her roaring furnace.</p><p>With an amused sound, he held her leg in one hand and poked her in the ribs with a knuckle. She squeaked, and suddenly he had her leg bent and had her ankle in a strap hanging from the chain. He did the same on the other side, and there she was, naked and outside in a garden, faceup on a tire swing, wrists hooked to the chains, straps holding her legs up and apart.</p><p>God, this was so wrong. Kinky. Insane.</p> <p>Yet heat seared her skin as he ran his hands over the backs of her thighs, leaving tingles in their wake. \u201cI want that little pussy all the way down here where I can get to everything,\u201d he said and pulled her hips until her bottom hung out over the end of the tire and her legs angled toward her shoulders. He secured a strap up and over her pelvis to keep her hips from moving. At all.</p><p>Her pussy was open and exposed, and the slight movement of the swing wafted air over her wet folds. He studied her for a minute and smiled. \u201cThere you go, all ready for anything I want to do to you. You look beautiful, Gabrielle,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take it anymore, not from him. \u201cGabi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d His fingers slid between her folds, circling her clit.</p><p>Her breathing increased as her clit seemed to engorge. \u201cMy friends call me Gabi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I do believe we might be considered friends,\u201d he said, amusement obvious, as he teased her, rubbing one side of her clit, circling her entrance, repeating it again. He was too damned good at using his fingers, dammit. Her need grew, her pussy craving to be filled almost as much as her aching nub of nerves needed more of his touch. She squirmed, trying to get more.</p><p>\u201cStay still, sugar.\u201d He slapped her bottom, and the sting burned right into her clit.</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>His fingers paused. \u201cI asked Holt to see if you enjoyed a little pain. Looks like you do.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot open. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t like pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d He slid a finger into her, so fast and deep she choked. A burn ignited from the inside out. Her words tangled on her tongue as pleasure rocketed through her.</p><p>He slapped her bottom harder.</p><p>Aaaah! The pain set her pussy on fire, and she almost came right then.</p><p>He laughed, low and deep, running his hand over the stinging area. \u201cI\u2019ll be adding a tad more variety to your trainee scenes so we can explore this side of your nature.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue felt thick, and all she could think about was the way his fingers moved slowly in and out of her, occasionally moving out to slide over her clit until her whole pussy seemed to swell. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, you like a little pain with your sex.\u201d He illustrated by swatting her butt forcefully enough to make her cry out, then pumping his fingers in and out of her vagina. Another swat. Thrusting. The burning on her bottom merged with the sizzling heat surrounding his fingers, and everything in her tightened, waiting... She gripped the chains as her hips tried to lift.</p><p>When he withdrew, she whimpered.</p><p>At the sound of a condom wrapper being ripped open, her eyes widened. Her pussy pulsed, so swollen and wet, and the thought of him\u2014of Marcus\u2014actually inside her made it all worse. She wanted this, needed him to take her, possess her all the way.</p><p>At the silence, she looked up and saw him studying her. A corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for me, little slave girl,\u201d he said softly. She felt him swirling the head of his cock in her wetness and shuddered in anticipation. He brushed it over her clit and sent a tremor up her spine. She was so close.</p><p>A second later, his thick shaft slid into her, and she groaned at the astounding feeling. Then firmly, inexorably, he pressed deeper, filling her, stretching her. Too much.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, stop.\u201d She pulled on the chains and tried to slide up and away.</p><p>His hands tightened on her hips. \u201cYou can take it, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She gasped for air, and her legs rattled the chains uncontrollably. As she strained helplessly against the hip strap and his powerful hands, the knowledge he could do anything he wanted shot through her until she almost came right then.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot and wet, Li\u2019ll Gabi,\u201d he said slowly, as if he savored each word, as if he knew the way his dark, sexy voice melted her insides. His hands slid under her bottom and squeezed. \u201cAnd I intend to hammer into you until you scream for me.\u201d But he still moved slowly, his size almost painful, until he had sheathed himself completely inside her and his balls brushed against her buttocks. He pulled back, then eased in.</p><p>Within a few strokes, her body adjusted and the movement of his cock turned into a slick slide of thrilling, wonderful friction.</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cThere we go.\u201d Without warning, he slammed into her. The starburst of sensation blazed upward, arching her back. He plunged deeper\u2014the hammering he\u2019d promised\u2014and her need grew. God, she wanted even more. Her hips tried to move again, jerking uselessly. She groaned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me show you why swings are fun, Li\u2019ll sub,\u201d Marcus said softly. His cock slid out as he pushed on the chains, and then he yanked the tire back, slamming her pussy back onto him like a pile driver. Smiling, he played the swing, back and forth, turning it slightly so his shaft pressed against one side of her vagina and the other.</p><p>So much, too much, and yet she couldn\u2019t make it over the top. Everything coiled so tightly inside her that each exquisitely wonderful movement almost hurt.</p><p>Lovely, Marcus thought, rocking the swing enough to keep her right on top of the pinnacle. Every muscle in her body was tight, her hands clamped around the chains. And her little moans had turned to a continuous soft song of need.</p><p>He knew the feeling. His balls felt as if they were being squeezed by some ball-crushing domme as he forced his climax back. He slowed the rocking and changed his grip to the strap over her hips so one hand could keep the swing going. So should he play with her clit to send her over?</p> <p>No, he wanted to take her hard, have her come hard, shock her a little. Since he\u2019d started with erotic pain, it would be fitting to finish with it. He got a good grip on the strap crossing her hips and let the tire rock away. As his cock slid partway out of her pussy, he slapped her ass, then yanked the swing back to impale her. To engulf his rigid shaft in her hot, wet silk. Again and again. The way she clenched with each slap almost destroyed his own control.</p><p>Faster. More. A handful of strong swats and her voice rose. Her stomach muscles under his knuckles turned to rock. Another swat and yank and she broke into a violent climax. Her shrieks corresponded to the forceful clenches of her vagina around his cock like a giant sucking device. Hearing her come, feeling her pussy try to milk him, he couldn\u2019t fight it any longer. He released his control and gave the tire a series of short, hard yanks. His climax roared through him, ripping from his balls into his cock and out in hot blasts of pure sensation.</p><p>With a groan, he rocked the swing gently, giving her a last few spasms\u2014and when the hot walls of her vagina rippled around him, he wanted to take her all over again.</p><p>He ran his hands over her body, pleased at the soft, moist curves. The fragrance of her light feminine sweat mingled with the heavier scent of sex. He leaned forward, letting his weight down on her. Her soft breasts flattened against his chest, and he could feel her heart hammering. She blinked up at him, looking dazed, and he took her mouth. Even dazed, she kissed with the same wholehearted focus and response that she brought to having sex. That she used when talking to someone, he realized.</p><p>He could have happily stayed there all night with the swing rocking slightly and his little sub under him. Gabi, not Gabrielle. Fitting. She was as sweet and spicy as he\u2019d thought...and worried she\u2019d be.</p> <p>She\u2019s not yours, Atherton. Regretfully he kissed her one last time. He pulled out slowly and walked over to dispose of the condom.</p><p>When he undid the straps, she lay limp, eyes closed, still not recovered. Not surprising\u2014she\u2019d had a rough night, emotionally and physically, then come like a dream. He lifted her from the swing and settled onto the ground, leaning on a tree and nestling her against him. Amazing how nicely she fit into his arms. He rested his chin on the top of her head, enjoying the scent of her fresh, spicy shampoo and the lemon fragrance from the oil. Her flushed cheek lay against his shoulder, and her breath, still fast, puffed warmly against his neck.</p><p>He\u2019d actually planned to take her slower, drive her a little mad first, but her spirited fight had left him with a primitive urge to conquer and mark her in the most basic of ways. As a lawyer, he liked to believe in civilization; as a dom, he\u2019d learned how easily the animal instincts could surface.</p><p>He nuzzled the tiny damp curls at her hairline\u2014sometimes those animal instincts were purely fun.</p><p>He\u2019d barely gotten settled when three chimes broke through the night, stilling everyone to silence except a woman who climaxed in high yips. Laughter spilled through the gardens, and then the sounds of movement. \u201cWake up, sugar. We have to head in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmh.\u201d She rubbed her cheek on his chest and went still again.</p> <p>He frowned. The energetic little sub wasn\u2019t rebounding in her usual speedy fashion. Then again, how many times tonight had he terrified her, making her blank out? Although the desensitization was for her good, it would have an impact. He\u2019d topped the night off with a chase, rough sex, bondage, and pain. No matter how much she\u2019d enjoyed the capture game, it had undoubtedly shaken up her emotional equilibrium. No, even if she bounced back now, he wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014let her go home alone to experience whatever aftermath or nightmares might come at this point. \u201cGabi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be spending the night with me tonight, Gabrielle. You have the choice of where. My place, your place, or one of the upstairs private rooms.\u201d</p><p>She stirred in his arms. \u201cBut\u2014I need... I mustn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He saw the effort she made to think. \u201cDo you trust me, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>Her head dropped back onto his chest, her breathing slowing again. \u201cMmmhmm.\u201d</p><p>Good enough.</p><p>At the front St. Andrew\u2019s cross, Z held his cell phone to his ear and listened to the FBI agent rant about Gabrielle\u2019s irresponsibility. With a huff of disgust, he snapped the phone shut and shoved it in his pocket. Idiot agent.</p> <p>Turning, he took a moment to study Jessica. He\u2019d restrained her on the cross only a few minutes before. Color good, breathing easily, her gaze on him. Very nice. It wouldn\u2019t hurt her to wait on his pleasure. Especially since she knew she\u2019d incurred his wrath for trying to interfere between a dom and sub...again. Little Miss Protect the Other Subs.</p><p>He turned to watch Marcus half carry Gabrielle out of the Shadowlands. Whatever had happened in the gardens had sent the brave little decoy into a place where she wasn\u2019t safe to drive, and Marcus was taking her home with him.</p><p>Guilt weighed heavy on Zachary\u2019s shoulders. He\u2019d wanted to tell Marcus the truth for Gabrielle\u2019s sake, but he\u2019d given his word, and so Marcus had pushed her\u2014as a dom should. He was undoubtedly picking up on the discrepancies in her behavior. He wouldn\u2019t go easy on her, not once he realized she\u2019d kept secrets from him.</p><p>Z frowned, wishing he knew the dom better. Friendly but reserved, Marcus was taking his time in becoming friends with the other Masters. Nonetheless, he was a fine dom with a profound sense of honor and protectiveness.</p><p>Yes, little Gabrielle would be safe with him.</p><p>However, he\u2019d better give Galen and Vance a heads-up. Unlike the idiotic Rhodes, the two FBI agents in charge of the investigation were experienced and careful doms, and they\u2019d understand what had happened to the trainee.</p><p>Zachary massaged his neck as he looked around the club. Less than half the members remained this late at night. Although he\u2019d changed the music to Enigma\u2019s quieter chants, his head still throbbed like an overstretched balloon. He\u2019d spent the evening talking with the members, leaving himself open to every emotional nuance, trying to find a hint of a predator in his club. Now his brain felt as if it might explode. At this point, he couldn\u2019t read anyone, no matter how close he got.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even tell what Jessica was thinking\u2014but from her body language, she\u2019d take a cane to him if he let her loose at this point. He\u2019d gagged her again before strapping her to the cross. He shook his head at the fury in her eyes. Normally he found her impertinent attitude delightful; he had never wanted a meek submissive.</p><p>But with a kidnapper targeting rebellious subs, every time she smarted off, his anxiety rose another notch. The thought of someone hurting Jessica... His jaw tightened. The man would die. Painfully.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to talk her into taking a vacation right now, without him, and she\u2019d laughed at him.</p><p>But Jessica wasn\u2019t the only sub in the club in danger. He could damn well at least remove one target.</p><p>He spotted Sally a minute later and motioned her over, then checked Jessica again. Arms and legs in an X position, nicely open and exposed, her lush breasts begging for use. She caught his eye, and despite the gag, her growl came through clearly. He snorted a laugh and stepped out of the scene area as Sally trotted up.</p><p>The vivacious trainee grinned at him. \u201cMaster Z, can I do something?\u201d</p><p>Keeping an eye on Jessica, Zachary studied Sally. As mischievous as a basketful of kittens, the trainee was as sassy as she was sweet. She topped from the bottom whenever given a chance, which happened all too often. Although the Masters could control her and did scenes with her occasionally, she had both more experience and more intelligence than far too many of the other doms. Too clever and too stubborn for her own good. He\u2019d begun to wonder if she\u2019d ever meet the right dom. \u201cI have a favor to ask of you, Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What can I do?\u201d She\u2019d gone for her favorite schoolgirl costume in a tied-up white shirt and short plaid skirt. Her braids swung, and she bounced on her toes as if he\u2019d offered her a candy instead of wanting her help.</p><p>\u201cI want you out of Tampa for a couple of weeks.\u201d Zachary held up his hand to keep her from speaking. \u201cI can\u2019t explain except to say you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Not in the least. I\u2019m dealing with an internal club matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll leave the trainees short.\u201d</p><p>Typical of her to worry about the others. \u201cI\u2019ll work it out with Marcus.\u201d He smiled, knowing the perfect bribe. \u201cThere\u2019s an airline ticket for Des Moines waiting for you at the United counter. Eleven tomorrow morning. Go visit your family before school starts. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cReally? Hell, yes.\u201d She caught his frown and swallowed. \u201cI mean, thank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d He tugged on a braid, then hesitated. She lived alone. \u201cOne more thing, pet. Please call here when you get to Des Moines. Just leave a message on the machine that you arrived safely. And if you\u2019re worried about...anything...let me know.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a suspicious look. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The sociable imp always knew all the gossip. He lifted her chin. \u201cYou will not discuss this, or that I asked you to take time off. Nothing. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>From the way she shrank, he\u2019d scared her. Excellent.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. Get ticket, leave Tampa, check in, and don\u2019t talk about it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Off you go now.\u201d He returned to the club\u2019s other contender for brattiest sub. Jessica. Earlier he\u2019d felt her emotions, a hodgepodge quite unlike his straightforward sub. Sadness definitely, uncertainty also. Her behavior had been worse than normal, especially in the Shadowlands, and damned if he knew why. Perhaps something to do with his boys\" visit. He studied her for a minute.</p> <p>Damn, he loved her\u2014loved her more every day they remained together. She returned it, but could he keep her happy? He was older, as his sons had so tactlessly pointed out, and love didn\u2019t overcome everything. Over the last year, he\u2019d carefully avoided any commitment so that she could back out of their relationship if she wanted.</p><p>Did she want to? Was her behavior a prelude to calling it quits? Or a reflection of his own moods?</p><p>They needed to have a long, long talk, but not now, not when he couldn\u2019t share the information about the kidnappings and investigation. Damn the FBI bastards for insisting on secrecy.</p><p>Rubbing his neck, he strolled back to his feisty kitten. Her green eyes shot sparks at him as he took advantage of her helpless condition to enjoy her breasts, using his mouth and fingers until her nipples stood out in hard, dark red peaks. He moved down to her soft thighs, spread so invitingly open\u2014her pussy, already wet and slick. He teased her, waiting for when her growling turned to panting and her face flushed with arousal.</p><p>And then he removed her gag and took her mouth, stroking his tongue against hers, working his fingers over her clit. No matter what might happen, for the moment, she was his. As her clit engorged under his touch, she whimpered and squirmed.</p><p>When he stepped back, her body strained toward him, needing more. As she remembered where she was, she turned adorably red. \u201cYou manipulative jerk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I now?\u201d</p><p>His cold tone snapped her attention to his face, and she winced. He held her gaze and unzipped his slacks. Being taken in public embarrassed her, but it also excited her. He smiled slowly. How many climaxes would it take before she\u2019d lose her voice? Until exhaustion overwhelmed any urge for disobedience?</p><p>\u201cZ. Master. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will not.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d certainly been wrong about the redheaded sub. The spotter leaned back against the bar, smiling. A few minutes ago, Marcus had dragged the submissive from the Shadowlands. Not a peep out of her.</p><p>Looking broken\u2014but that\u2019s what he\u2019d thought before. Apparently a dom could subdue her for a time, as with the spanking last week, but she came right back, snapping and biting. He\u2019d laughed when she\u2019d noisily objected to the slave clothing.</p><p>And because of her spirit, the figging scene had been most entertaining. Yes, he\u2019d definitely include her in his report this week. Delightful.</p><p>A shame Marcus hadn\u2019t paddled her when she had the ginger up her ass. A submissive anticipating the next blow would clench her buttocks, but the increased pressure heightened the burn from the fig, so she\u2019d relax only to receive a hard swat on the ass.</p> <p>Well, when they harvested her, he\u2019d suggest it. Perhaps as part of the auction to keep the buyers amused. He might even volunteer to wield the paddle.</p><p>Grinning, he nodded at Cullen, then glanced over to the submissive area. Still an adequate variety and he had a craving for a soft one. He considered. There was a younger woman, and he did enjoy youth, but no. He\u2019d utilize the plump, older sub. Tears came too easily on a young one. Older ones resisted better, giving more satisfaction when they screamed and begged.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>This is totally insane. Stupid. Gabi scowled as she let Marcus help her out of his sedan. \u201cI feel fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, Darlin\u2019.\u201d He put his arm around her as if he thought she\u2019d fall down without his help. \u201cYou can act as ornery as you want, but you\u2019re not going to stay alone tonight.\u201d He nuzzled the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cOh honestly.\u201d She might have had a chance to protest at the club...if she could have managed, but for some bizarre reason, her synapses hadn\u2019t all been firing. After talking with Z, he\u2019d had Sally fetch her purse and clothes and stuffed Gabi in his car before she could pull it together.</p><p>On the ride to his house, she\u2019d thought about Agent Rhodes and had almost panicked until she remembered that Master Z had hugged her and murmured he\u2019d notify her friend. Dickhead would have a fit, and wasn\u2019t she a bad person to enjoy that he\u2019d yell at Master Z rather than her?</p><p>But in all reality, Marcus was right. She shouldn\u2019t drive right now, no matter how much her conscience objected.</p><p>That settled, she felt her excitement rise. Master Marcus had brought her to his home. She\u2019d stay with him...all night. And she wanted to. To sleep in his arms, maybe have sex again. Find out more about him and... Damn, don\u2019t be stupid. This is a temporary assignment, Gabi, not a date.</p><p>Motion detector-regulated lights came on as they walked up to the front and through a black iron gate into a tiny entranceway filled with sweetly fragrant gardenias. Inside, Marcus let go of her to turn and punch numbers into a security pad. After the humidity of the night, the dry, cool air made Gabi shiver. She wore her yellow top and hot pants Marcus had helped her put on. Hell, he\u2019d practically dressed her. Now, standing here in fetish wear in this nice house, she felt like a slut.</p><p>She took a step back, reaching for the handle of the door.</p><p>Turning from the keypad, Marcus frowned and stepped closer. His warm hand cupped her cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d He wanted honesty, and her brain was still moving too slow to come up with some excuse. She gestured to her clothes. \u201cI feel sleazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take it off.\u201d The corners of his eyes crinkled as he smiled. \u201cOn the rare occasions I bring a submissive home, I generally make her spend the weekend naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d When she gave him an appalled stare, his laugh filled the room, sending quivers through her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYes, I really do.\u201d His thumb traced her lips as he studied her. \u201cI\u2019m not a twenty-four-hour dom, but I consider nights and weekends to be open season on little subs in my house.\u201d</p><p>All weekend? \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve had enough tonight, lucky little sub, so don\u2019t get flustered on me.\u201d</p><p>When she sighed in relief, he laughed again. \u201cLet me show you around.\u201d He walked ahead of her to turn on lights, and she couldn\u2019t help but notice how his jeans and T-shirt clung to his hard body.</p><p>The entry opened into a great room where one side held an intimate seating area, the other side a man\u2019s favorite toy\u2014a giant HDTV. She grinned. The decor appeared very Marcus. Creamy white walls, light marble tile floors, rich brown leather chairs and couches. Everything balanced, the colors clean but warm, although the lack of brightness struck her as sad.</p><p>A decorative glass-fronted black iron woodstove separated the living area from the dining area. How fun. Tampa did\u2014occasionally\u2014get chilly enough to warrant a fire. Did he sometimes throw a blanket on the floor and make love to a woman in front of it? The stab of longing to be that woman struck her without warning. \u201cYou have a lovely home,\u201d she said, turning away from the room and the emotion.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now come along, Darlin\u2019.\u201d He cuffed his fingers around her wrist, making her stomach quake, and led her down the hallway to the master bedroom. Beige carpet, creamy white drapes, a massive bed covered with a dark blue satin quilt. The carved wood dresser and bedside stands matched the dark wood of the four posters. Curiously she ran her fingers over a scratched section of one of the spindles. Everything else seemed in perfect condition.</p><p>Even though she hadn\u2019t spoken, his dazzling smile appeared. \u201cFrom restraints.\u201d</p><p>Oh. She stepped away quickly, abruptly aware of her isolation with a man, someone she\u2019d only known two weeks. A dominant.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Then he pulled her into his arms. \u201cGabi, no matter where we are or what we do, your safe word still works. And as it happens, I\u2019m not fixin\" to throw you on the bed and tie you up. You\u2019re done for tonight.\u201d His hand moved down her back in a slow stroke of comfort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why did she feel so safe whenever he held her? She pressed her forehead against his chest. I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This just feels so strange. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t gone home with a man before\u2014Well, maybe not for bondage, but\u2014You know.\u201d For sex.</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cI doubt you were perfectly sober those times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She blinked and scowled. That sounded a little...bad. \u201cI guess.\u201d No wonder this felt different. Not only home with a dom, but without any nice inhibition relievers.</p><p>\u201cWe can fix that, at least. You go take yourself a shower while I open some wine.\u201d</p> <p>Covered in oil, sweat from running, dirt on her hands and knees. Major sticky ew. \u201cI\u2019d love a shower.\u201d</p><p>He reached into the closet and pulled out a long, dark blue silk robe, then showed her the bathroom. \u201cUse anything you like. There\u2019re spare toothbrushes and combs in the bottom drawer.\u201d</p><p>Well. She shook her head. The man obviously enjoyed...entertaining. Then again\u2014well-off, charming, gorgeous? Women probably had hairpulling wars over him.</p><p>In the huge walk-in shower, she let the hot water beat some sense into her brain. He\u2019s not for you. Remember that, Gabi. After scrubbing her body and wincing at the various bruises, she ran her fingers through her hair. Twigs. Leaves. Ew.</p><p>The built-in shelf held shampoo that smelled like Marcus, as well as a handful of hotel samples undoubtedly provided for his guests. Sheesh, her love life should be so lively. She tried to ignore the unhappy twinge. I\u2019m just one of many. Actually, her status was even lower. She was merely a trainee he\u2019d rescued because she\u2019d wussed out on him and couldn\u2019t get herself home. Remember that, Gabi. You\u2019re not here as his date.</p> <p>She picked a shampoo that smelled like citrus and spice, washed her hair, then stepped out into the steamy room. The fogged-up mirror gave a blurry image of a woman with wet hair, no makeup. Good thing Master Marcus had big balls, or he\u2019d scream and run out of the house at the sight of her. She grinned. Poor man. After she\u2019d cried all over him last week, he\u2019d had to look at her raccoonlike, streaky makeup all night. Domination\u2014not for the faint of heart.</p><p>After pulling on the borrowed robe, she walked into the living room. Empty. The lilting, soft voice of Sarah McLachlan came from the speakers. Glass clinked in the kitchen. A few seconds later, Marcus appeared, handed her a glass of wine, and brushed a kiss over her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou look better.\u201d He glanced down at himself and smiled ruefully. \u201cI need a shower too. You led me on quite the chase, subbie.\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>He laughed and tugged a lock of her hair. \u201cSo pleased with yourself.\u201d He nodded toward the living room. \u201cMake yourself at home, and I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>The tile floor felt smooth and cold under her feet, and the robe slid silkily against her bare skin as she walked across the room. She took a sip of her red wine. A lovely pinot noir. Just what the doctor ordered.</p> <p>She wandered over to one wall to check out the pictures. Family shots with a sweet-faced woman, and a gray-haired man who had Marcus\u2019s chin and eyes. One with a myriad of relatives. Many photos of teenagers of all ethnicities on basketball courts, in karate tournaments, building a house. A picture with Marcus at the center of a bunch of teens. She smiled at the way they\u2019d crowded around him, obviously trying to get closer. Marcus with his arm across the shoulders of a teen wearing gang tattoos. The boy grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>She studied the karate photos for a moment, realizing that like the teens, Marcus wore a white gi, only his belt color was... Oh wow. Don\u2019t start a fight with the nice black belt, Gabi.</p><p>The bookcase contained a variety of subjects: law, ethics, best sellers, horror with Stephen King predominating. Huh. Hers held social services books, psych books, sociology, Shakespeare, romances, and fantasy. They probably wouldn\u2019t get along at all in real life. Then again\u2014she studied the pictures of him with the boys\u2014he might have a few more facets than she\u2019d thought. God knew her father wouldn\u2019t be caught dead on a basketball court, let alone one in the slums.</p><p>At the sound of footsteps, she turned.</p><p>Marcus walked into the room, pulling on a silky robe like hers, and as he tied it shut, she saw how the hard, contoured muscles of his chest tapered down to a taut, flat abdomen. She\u2019d never seen him without a shirt, and her fingers tingled with the need to touch. The alcohol had definitely given her a buzz, dammit. She rubbed her hands on the robe\u2014bad Gabi\u2014and smiled at him. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>He motioned toward the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s sit, and I\u2019ll grill you about your life.\u201d</p><p>Her feet froze to the floor. Questions? She couldn\u2019t answer questions about her life. \u201cUm. I\u2019m a little tired. Maybe I could bed down somewhere out of the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be fibbing to me, Darlin\u2019. You were tired before. Not now.\u201d He regarded her with eyes sharp enough to cut. \u201cI take it there are parts of your life you\u2019d find uncomfortable discussing?\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes it was majorly disconcerting how he went from down-home Southern to lawyer-speak. \u201cI really do need to get home. Would you mind letting me have enough money for a taxi. I\u2019ll pay you back on Friday. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Very interesting, Marcus thought. He sipped his wine and studied her, watching her fidget at his silence. The little sub had plummeted from relaxed and laughing to stiff and uncomfortable.</p><p>On the drive here, after she\u2019d roused up, she\u2019d chatted about politics, society, a big cat rescue place that his nana also loved, and then argued with him about crime in the cities and how to address it. He\u2019d enjoyed every minute of the ride. The woman was cheerful and compassionate and very, very smart. Hell, she not only debated as well as he did, but derailed him with off-the-wall comments about the scenery, then jumped back on the train without a problem\u2014leaving him in the dust.</p><p>But apparently the thought of talking about herself made her want to flee. When he met her eyes, she dropped her gaze with the instinctive submission she\u2019d shown a few times before. For whatever reason, she\u2019d left her bratty sub shield behind at the club. I like the woman she is without it. Warm, energetic, bright. Dammit, she fit in his home. No, more than that\u2014she enhanced it.</p><p>When he walked around her slowly, she shivered. No makeup, pink from the shower, hair shaggy as a drowned poodle\u2019s, the robe swathing her in fabric\u2014and she tugged at his heart like a magnet. He wanted to cuddle her against him...then drag her under him and take her again. Affection and protectiveness and lust: he might find himself in serious trouble here.</p><p>He stopped in front of her, deliberately invading her space. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not running away home, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Her chocolate brown eyes held wariness. What made her so skittish?</p><p>\u201cWe are going to sit down and enjoy our drinks and some conversation. If I ask you a question you don\u2019t care to answer, tell me so. I do ask that you not lie to me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d managed to keep her gaze level on his, but the tiny muscles around her eyes tensed. Apparently she\u2019d already lied to him about something.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d deal with that another time. For now, they\u2019d discuss her experiences at the club and where to go from here. He took a step back, releasing her from his control. \u201cHolt looked like he enjoyed having you as a submissive.\u201d</p><p>Her sigh of relief made him smile.</p><p>When Master Marcus pushed her toward the couch, Gabi gave up the fight and complied. She sat down at one end, hoping he\u2019d choose a chair or at least\u2014</p><p>He took a seat in the middle, then put both their drinks on the coffee table. After lifting her legs onto his lap, he kept pulling, forcing her to slide down until her back rested against the arm of the couch. To her dismay, the tie of her damn silky robe loosened, letting the front gape open and exposing her breasts.</p><p>When she started to fix it, he gave her a stern look. \u201cLeave it open. I enjoy looking at you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers went limp. Thank God they\u2019d left the club, since she wasn\u2019t sure she could defy him. Somehow the time in the Capture Gardens had wiped away her resistance, and here in his house, his commands and the implacable look in his eyes sent quivers all the way to her bones.</p><p>His chin tilted up slightly. \u201cYour answer is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She picked up her drink, needing to have something to hold.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, sugar.\u201d He grasped her left foot and firmly massaged the aching muscles. God, that felt good. When his thumbs pressed deep into the sole, her eyes almost rolled up in her head.</p><p>He smiled slightly, selected another spot, and did it again. Seduced into talking by a foot rub. Sneaky dom. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how you happened to get in a gang war, Gabi. Will it bother you to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d When she tried to pull her foot back, he didn\u2019t let her. Just waited. She recognized his technique, had used it herself, yet even knowing that, the silence pressured her with the need to fill it. But this... Her chest tightened. I don\u2019t want to. Yet he\u2019d tried to help her this evening. Maybe he needed to know what kind of a wreck she was.</p><p>He waited, his hands even warmer against her skin\u2014or maybe the room had grown colder. She\u2019d grown colder. She took a fortifying sip of her drink. \u201cOkay, if you really want to know... I\u2019d run away from home and was living on the streets in Miami with a couple of men. I was pretty naive. They taught me a lot.\u201d Amusement tickled her throat as she realized how his stuffy lawyer soul would react. \u201cAlthough I never mastered hot-wiring cars, I got good at picking pockets.\u201d And pleasing Danny and Rock in bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like she\u2019d figured, his facial muscles tightened until his cheekbones stood out. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be horse whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. They\u2019re dead.\u201d Amusement died as sorrow swept through her, a cold wind that left an ache deep inside her chest.</p> <p>\u201cTell me, sugar.\u201d He released her gaze and massaged her other foot. The strength of his hands felt like stability in a wavering world.</p><p>\u201cI lived there around a year or so. The streets got rougher. Money got harder to find, so Rock started dealing even though two gangs were fighting for the territory already. One gang showed up at the apartment. They killed Rock and Danny and...\u201d She shrugged, trying to act nonchalant, despite the way her stomach had turned over. Everything in her curled up into a tiny ball of pain. She swallowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t die\u2014just got cut up a little.\u201d And raped.</p><p>His gaze traced the scar down her face. \u201cSo you were there when they killed your friends?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Finish the story; get it over with. She jerked her head in a nod and stared at the red wine in her glass. \u201cDanny opened the door, and they shot him.\u201d The pistol blasted, the sound shocking, terrible, filling the room, drowning out the shouts, her screams. Danny seemed to fly back. He hit the floor, his eyes wide, mouth open, blood everywhere. She hadn\u2019t even managed to stand up. He\u2019d made love to her early that morning, told her she was his special girl. \u201cRock had a gun on the kitchen table. He shot once and... They had a machine pistol.\u201d Bullets splintering the wood, ringing against metal...against flesh. His body jerked like he was having a seizure, and everything turned red as he hit the wall.</p><p>Marcus pulled her onto his lap and wrapped his arms around her. He did that a lot, didn\u2019t he?</p> <p>\u201cYou know, he\u2019d buy me romance novels. We were broke, but somehow he\u2019d still find me books,\u201d she whispered, heart aching.</p><p>His gaze didn\u2019t leave her face, a lifeline to keep her from drowning in the past. \u201cGo on. Tell me the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grabbed a knife and tried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou attacked them with a knife?\u201d Marcus interrupted in a strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cThey shot my Danny and Rock. I was so mad, and I wanted to hurt them. I got the one with the gun, actually.\u201d Her hand closed in a fist as if the wooden handle fit there. She felt the nauseating horror when the blade had slid in to the bone. His scream still brought her out of sleep sometimes.</p><p>Marcus uncurled her fingers and clasped her hand instead.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said, unsure even now whether she was relieved or disappointed.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you might have found that hard to live with...and they\u2019d have killed you in turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. They cut me instead.\u201d Their cursing, the knife flashing, the odd splitting down her cheek. Warm liquid on her face and neck, turning the white flowers on the couch a garish red. The pain\u2014God, the pain. Their laughter changing. Calling her horrible names. Hands pushing her down, holding her, tearing her... She heard herself whimper.</p><p>\u201cShhh, Darlin\u2019, shhh. It\u2019s over.\u201d Marcus\u2019s voice. His wonderful, masculine scent.</p><p>She found a bit of air, used it, and found a bit more. Her fingernails had dug trenches into his palm. She forced her hand open and tried to laugh. It sounded ghastly. \u201cWhen the cops busted in, I was... Well, at least they didn\u2019t shoot me. And then one man\u201d\u2014Thank you, God, for giving me Abe\u2014\u201cone man talked me out of the corner I was hiding in.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened as if he could protect her. Far too late for that. Yet when he sighed and rested his cheek on top of her head, his concern washed her fear away like waves rolling over a sandy beach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabi,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFor you and for your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were only in their early twenties. Younger than I am now.\u201d Too young to have everything stop. The bitter sorrow never quite left her. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the story.\u201d</p><p>He stayed silent for a minute, and she didn\u2019t mind at all. He could hold her all night if he wanted.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously been with other men since then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Her cheek against his chest, she could feel the springy hair beneath his silky robe. \u201cI had trouble the first couple of times.\u201d Kim had encouraged her, held her when she had nightmares afterward. She\u2019d been the one to drag Gabi to a BDSM club the next year. Nothing scared Kim; no conventions slowed her down. Gabi buried her face against Marcus and pulled in a slow breath. We\u2019ll save you, Kim. Hang on.</p><p>\u201cBut you got to the point you could go home with a man...with a little liquid incentive?\u201d Marcus said lightly, helping her return to stable ground. His hand massaged the tensed muscles in her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first night, we talked briefly about more than one man. And when you watched a m\u00e9nage, it excited you.\u201d He paused. \u201cGabi, is a threesome something you really want or will it give you nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d She blew out a breath, torn between the push and pull. \u201cI think I might like to try it. Having sex actually quieted some of my fears.\u201d She swallowed and added, \u201cSometimes, even with one man, I feel too many hands, and it scares me. Maybe I could get past that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He rubbed his chin over her head. \u201cI\u2019ll mull over how to set it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I think.</p><p>\u201cDid you go home eventually?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Not that she\u2019d wanted to. Her parents\u2019 disapproval had hung like a miasma in the air: You brought it all on yourself. \u201cI went back to school and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d \u201cI do ask that you not lie to me.\u201d She realized she\u2019d hesitated too long, way too long for an experienced dom.</p><p>\u201cI take it this is one of the things you prefer not to discuss?\u201d he said, his voice as gentle as the hand rubbing her arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, please, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shifted her to lean more comfortably in his arms\u2014and to where he could watch her face, she realized. \u201cThen let\u2019s talk about why you\u2019re so defiant a submissive. Why you\u2019re insolent even when you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. Tell the truth...without getting into the real truth. \u201cUh. I\u2019m just like that. Even as a kid. My parents are...rather rigid, and I\u2019ve never been much for following rules.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle rumbled inside his chest. \u201cI can believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I never got out of the habit.\u201d</p><p>His perceptive gaze pinned her. \u201cYou were a rebellious child, and you have a sassy nature, but sometimes there\u2019s more, Darlin\u2019. I think something drives you to cause a fuss. Any idea why?\u201d</p><p>She averted her eyes and shut her mouth.</p><p>Silence. He cupped her cheek, turning her face back. \u201cI want to help you, but I need to know what\u2019s causing all this. Don\u2019t you trust me enough to share it with me?\u201d</p><p>Guilt sent dark streaks through her, but she couldn\u2019t. Her throat clogged. She managed to shake her head. No.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He let her bury her face against him so she could force the tears back. Could pull herself together. When she finally pushed upright, he smiled at her and put her glass of wine into her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>He acted as if nothing had happened, as if she hadn\u2019t disappointed him. The relief was immense. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any chick flicks, and I doubt you\u2019d enjoy horror right now. But I keep some DVDs for my sister's children. How about Shrek or The Lion King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough choice.\u201d She often watched movies with her young clients. The Lion King was her favorite, but a guy would probably prefer: \u201cShrek.\u201d</p><p>She fell asleep listening to an ogre talking about the layers of an onion.</p><p>She awoke the next morning feeling wonderful. Well, aside from the various aches screaming at her when she moved. Scraped knees. And a tender butt. She grinned, remembering Master Raoul\u2019s switch.</p><p>During the night, she\u2019d woken from a horrible nightmare with Marcus\u2019s deep, slow voice pulling her to safety and comfort. Ignoring her apologies, he\u2019d turned her so her back rested against his chest. Since he\u2019d refused to let her wear anything to bed, his hot, hard erection had rubbed on her bare bottom. And then he\u2019d cupped her breast in one lean hand, kissed her shoulder, and told her to go back to sleep.</p><p>She\u2019d drifted off unsure if she regretted his control or not.</p><p>She slid out of bed. No sounds from the house. After brushing her teeth, she futilely wished for real clothes. After pulling on her robe, she stepped through the bedroom\u2019s sliding glass doors. He had a swimming pool big enough to swim laps. A giant inflated swan floated in the clear blue water.</p><p>Clad only in loose cotton pants, Marcus stood in the grassy backyard outside of the pool\u2019s screen cage. After a minute, she recognized the controlled movements of tai chi. One movement slid into another, infinitely slow and perfect. Panther graceful. She\u2019d taken self-defense in college and never looked like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he finished, he stood for a bit, then headed toward the pool. He spotted her and smiled...and her heart did a twitchy thing, as if it had wiggled in happiness.</p><p>\u201cI saw your pictures in the living room,\u201d she said, striving for casual. \u201cYou do a lot of this karate stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d He walked across the grass. \u201cI was a skinny hairless wimp at thirteen, and I wanted to impress a sweet young thing, so I signed up for karate. A month later, Marybeth abandoned me for a football player, but by then I was hooked on martial arts.\u201d</p><p>A wimp? His strong shoulders were twice the width of hers. Crisp golden hair covered the muscular planes of his chest. His biceps rippled under taut skin; tendons stood out on his forearms.</p> <p>She wanted to touch him so badly she shook inside.</p><p>After stepping into the caged pool area, Marcus stopped in front of her. \u201cYou look much better, Darlin\u2019. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She clasped her hands together. You\u2019re not a girlfriend, Gabi; you\u2019re just a messed-up trainee he took pity on. \u201cUh, I\u2019m ready to leave whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and gave her a quizzical look. In the morning light, his blue eyes appeared clearer than the cloudless sky above. \u201cAre you now?\u201d</p><p>When he ran his fingers down her jaw, her skin heated as if he were the sun. Unthinking, she rubbed her cheek against his palm and then flushed at acting like a starstruck teenager. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She took a step back. God, he was probably laughing at her.</p> <p>The corners of his eyes definitely crinkled, but his gaze held heat, not laughter. \u201cDoes a sub get to say \u201edon\u2019t\"?\u201d How could a quiet voice sound so threatening?</p><p>Her mouth turned dry, and her heart skipped a beat. \u201cNo. No, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought not,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHold your robe open for me, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>The muggy heat of a Florida morning hadn\u2019t changed, but with his command, the air itself thickened. Her fingers shook as she untied the belt and grasped the front, parting it. Exposing herself to his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful body, little sub.\u201d He cupped her breasts, weighing them in his palms, running his thumbs around tightening nipples.</p><p>She closed her eyes over the heady wash of sensation. His nearness, the warmth of his sure hands, the slight scrape of rougher skin over her nipples. Above all, more than anything, knowing it was his touch.</p> <p>When his fingers stilled, she opened her eyes and saw him watching her carefully. \u201cYou look a little flushed, sugar. Maybe we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>If he said he wanted to eat breakfast now, she\u2019d kill him. With a huff of exasperation, she abandoned the robe and grasped his hands, pressing them harder against her breasts. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>His eyes cooled, and he pulled his hands out from under hers.</p><p>Her heart shrank. Couldn\u2019t she do anything right? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d Lowering her arms, she bowed her head, wishing she could sink down into the concrete.</p><p>To her surprise, he chuckled and put his arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Darlin\u2019. I do sometimes forget you\u2019re still new to this. And we\u2019re new to each other.\u201d</p><p>The wave of relief shook her. After a second, she clasped her arms around his waist and burrowed a little closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to tell you I...I wasn\u2019t flushed because of the heat. I wanted to continue\u2014but not if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d she added hastily.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cAs it happens, I do know the difference between an overheated sub and an aroused one,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cAs for me wanting to...\u201d His hands curved under her bottom and slid her pussy up and down a very hard erection.</p><p>Oh. Well. She didn\u2019t get time to feel stupid. As his hands massaged her butt, he tilted her hips so her clit contacted the base of his cock. Her breasts flattened against his bare chest, and the heat inside her flared to life. \u201cUm.\u201d</p> <p>His laugh ruffled her hair. \u201cI think you\u2019re flushed again, Gabi. Go get in the pool.\u201d He pinched her bottom.</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief. \u201cYou want me to cool off?\u201d</p><p>His chin raised, and the stern look he gave her knocked all the air from her lungs. She flung her robe over a lounge chair and hurried to the shallow end.</p><p>She walked down the wide steps in the corner of the pool. The water was only slightly cool...until it reached her groin, and then it felt like ice water against her burning pussy. She squeaked and looked to see if he\u2019d noticed. Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>He\u2019d stripped his pants off. Long, powerful thighs, narrow hips, and tight buttocks. Oh my. As her insides melted, she checked the water around her to see if it had started to boil.</p><p>Near the deep end, he picked up a pole and herded the swan toward her. Gabi snickered. Who\u2019d have thought Mr. Stuffy would keep a blow-up swan in his pool, let alone one a good four feet or so across the back.</p><p>After setting the pole and something else on the edge of the pool, he came down the steps. Without speaking, he picked her up and laid her on the winged back.</p><p>Plastic warm from the sun scraped her breasts, teasing them to hard points. Giggling, Gabi tried to crawl up farther. She hadn\u2019t played on one of these for a\u2014</p><p>His hard hands yanked her back until her legs dangled into the water, forcing her to grab the wing on the opposite side. She glanced over her shoulder. His erection jutted upward out of the water, wonderfully thick and long. Veins bulged down the length. The head looked like velvet, and her mouth watered.</p><p>Holding her legs, he moved backward and up one corner step, raising his cock to the level of the swan.</p><p>\u201cMarcus, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying my little sub before breakfast.\u201d He spread her thighs open and slid his fingers in her wetness and over her clit. The rush of pleasure ignited a fire inside her, one he worked into a hard blaze as he mercilessly stroked her clit to hardness.</p><p>He released her for a moment, took a step toward the edge, and she heard a condom wrapper being torn open.</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself, sweetheart.\u201d Without further warning, he thrust inside her, burying himself to the hilt. Impossibly large, stretching her to the point of pain, yet the pleasure so intense her back arched. God. Her vagina strained to accommodate him, throbbing around the intrusion. His hands held her hips, keeping her immobile. His groin pushed against her pussy, and as the swan rocked under her, the crisp hairs teased her swollen, puffy labia. She moaned.</p><p>\u201cNow that there\u2019s a nice sound,\u201d he murmured. His fingers curled tighter around her hips, and he slid his cock out slowly. Too slowly. She wanted to push back, move him faster, but her legs dangled uselessly above the pool floor. He controlled the movements of the swan and of her body, and she could do nothing but hang on.</p><p>He took her hard. Mercilessly.</p><p>Right there in the pool, before breakfast, without asking first.</p><p>Took her so thoroughly that she came twice before he finished.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>After several more days of the bogus job hunting, Gabi wanted to scream. It wouldn\u2019t seem so bad if she needed a job, but she didn\u2019t. Her feet ached as if someone had pounded on them with a mallet. She swung her legs up to rest on the back of her couch.</p><p>Where\u2019s a nice foot-rubbing dom when you needed one?</p><p>She sighed, remembering last weekend and the careful power of Marcus\u2019s hands. On her feet. Her breasts. Her pussy. In the pool, he\u2019d slid those strong fingers under her and stroked just hard enough, pinched... She sighed, and her clit throbbed as if the memory had woken it up.</p><p>The memory of how he\u2019d tossed her on the swan and simply taken what he pleased still made her quiver inside. That morning, she\u2019d done anything he\u2019d wanted, as if their time in the Capture Gardens had set a pattern of her giving in. Submitting.</p><p>And I loved it. Loved seeing his smile of pleasure when she did as he commanded, loved basking in his approval instead of causing him disappointment. He hadn\u2019t played lord and commander all the time. After the pool\u2014and the shower\u2014they\u2019d cooked omelets and biscuits for breakfast, arguing about the ingredients, about who\u2019d wash up, about anything. If anyone had kept count\u2014and Mr. Lawyer had\u2014she\u2019d won more arguments than she lost. He hadn\u2019t acted like she was his slave. Well, not until they\u2019d put the dishes away, and she\u2019d said something about it being time to leave.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten that dominating look in his eyes, and his drawl had turned to rich velvet. \u201cNo, Darlin\u2019, you\u2019re not leavin' yet. You haven\u2019t gotten to...enjoy...my bed yet.\u201d</p><p>Oh Lord, she was getting all needy just thinking about it. Damn him.</p><p>She heard a thud. A thump. What sounded like a herd of horses stampeded through the room, and her two black cats tangled into a rolling ball under the tiny kitchen table. Gabi snorted a laugh. Whoever said cats were quiet pets needed his head examined. They might stalk silently, but the rest of the time...?</p><p>With a mutual hiss, the boys gave up the fight, and first Hamlet, then Horatio landed on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cOomph. Dammit, guys.\u201d Smiling, she stroked them. Horatio with long, fluffy fur, Hamlet with short, sleek fur, they\u2019d been a birthday present last year from her grandmother. Little fur babies to love from someone she loved. \u201cYou know, boys, your mama must have entertained the neighborhood, \"cause you sure don\u2019t look like brothers.\u201d She added wistfully, \u201cI wish I had a brother or sister.\u201d But her parents disliked how much a child interfered with their lives and had never considered having another after Gabi. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hamlet pushed against her hand, demanding a head scratching.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me, guys. A handicap to a career.\u201d She\u2019d tried to be the perfect daughter at first. When that didn\u2019t gain her any increased affection or attention, she\u2019d gone the other way. Perhaps not the best thought-out scheme, but at least when she\u2019d misbehaved, they noticed her.</p><p>As if to commiserate, Horatio rubbed his cheek against her chin.</p><p>She rubbed back. \u201cMaybe they\u2019d have done better with cats.\u201d Or not. At ten, she\u2019d begged for a pet and received a list of reasons for their refusal. Scratched furniture, pet dander, noisy... \u201cThey\u2019d only like you two if you were silent and hairless. Without claws.\u201d</p> <p>Hamlet stared at her with appalled green eyes; he\u2019d always been more conservative than Horatio.</p><p>After a glance at the clock, she groaned. \u201cGuys, I need to get moving. I\u2019m meeting our dear, sweet buddy, Dickhead\u2014and the other two agents\u2014at some Clearwater beach hotel.\u201d Rhodes would probably spend the entire time tearing her apart. Dammit.</p><p>She\u2019d asked Agent Galen to assign her a different agent, but Rhodes had specifically requested the Shadowlands. Of course, he\u2019d prefer the ritzy private club to the others. Because of his seniority in the Tampa office, they couldn\u2019t arbitrarily remove him.</p><p>Horatio flicked his ears forward as if to ask why she didn\u2019t just disembowel the obnoxious agent. What else were claws for?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d She swung her legs down and sat up. \u201cWhat bothers me about this assignment is Marcus. After all my years of smarting off to the parental units, who\u2019d imagine I\u2019d want to behave? Well...behave most of the time.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned, remembering how she\u2019d stepped out of the shower before Marcus, then reached back to push the lever to cold. The man had a remarkable command of the profaner elements of the King\u2019s English.</p><p>And a hard hand.</p><p>And amazing stamina.</p><p>She sighed. He\u2019d wasn\u2019t quite as conservative as she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Then again, his decor seemed pretty dull. And his clothing. And the way he talked sometimes\u2014Mr. Lawyer. She shook her head. No, they weren\u2019t really alike at all.</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t like brats, so she sure wasn\u2019t his type. He\u2019d only taken her home because she\u2019d been a mess, and the master of the trainees was a walking, talking example of overprotectiveness. Well, if she\u2019d been his pity fuck for the weekend, she\u2019d enjoyed it. Even if the thought did hurt.</p> <p>She picked up Hamlet, kissed the top of his furry head, and set him on the floor, then did the same with Horatio. Slinging her purse over her shoulder, she glanced around the apartment. Beige on bland on insipid. Very creative decorator.</p><p>Hamlet and Horatio sat side by side, disgust at her abandonment plain in their postures.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this, guys. Only two weeks and we go home.\u201d Back to her cozy, colorful apartment, back to their cat condos and window perches.</p><p>Back to a life without a stuffy, domineering lawyer who sometimes seemed like something more.</p><p>Once in the fancy Clearwater hotel, she checked to make sure no one had followed her. She grinned, remembering Dickhead\u2019s cursory lesson that she\u2019d titled \u201cHow to Be an Agent in Five Easy Steps.\u201d Nonetheless, she dutifully got off the elevator two floors early and climbed the stairs to the proper floor. How did they manage to do this covert stuff without feeling like idiots?</p><p>Winded, she stopped in front of the door to the hotel room and watched the elevator and stairway for a minute. Just in case. The silence in the hallway grew heavier as she stood there. Her amusement died as she remembered why she was here. Because someone wanted to sell her, to break her like an animal, to use her until she died. Oh, Kim. She pounded on the door.</p><p>It opened, and Agent Rhodes stepped back to let her in. \u201cAbout time you got here, Renard.\u201d</p><p>Her relief at being inside faded. She glanced at her watch. Two minutes late. She turned away to look around at the room decorated in warm colors of sand and brown, highlighted with tropical oranges and reds. Still a little winded, Gabi dropped onto the L-shaped, sectional sofa without waiting for an invitation. Next time, she\u2019d stop the elevator two flights above the hotel floor and walk down. And the minute she returned home to Miami, she\u2019d join a gym. She meant it this time. Really.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the meeting?\u201d she asked, glancing around the empty room.</p><p>\u201cA conference call in Buchanan\u2019s room. Kouros said they\u2019d return shortly.\u201d Rhodes took a seat at the other end of the sofa and smoothed down his black suit, adjusted the cuffs of his white shirt. He wore J. Edgar-approved conservative clothing, undoubtedly chosen to facilitate his way up the ladder.</p><p>He picked up the coffee cup on the table and took a sip. \u201cYou\u2019re not a trained agent, Renard, but the stunt you pulled last night jeopardized the investigation. I don\u2019t know why you have your head up your ass\u2014or maybe I do.\u201d His lip raised in a sneer. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how much you like your evenings.\u201d</p><p>Gabi set her hands on her thighs, keeping her fingers open, her palms down. A victim specialist had to keep her temper, to counsel, to talk through, to negotiate. He did have a point, she thought guiltily. She shouldn\u2019t have tried to work on her own personal problems at the Shadowlands. But she was glad she had. How could she allow herself to stay so vulnerable to a simple word or two?</p><p>But no need to worry about it now. \u201cRhodes,\u201d she said, giving him a level look. \u201cYour comment is inappropriate. Please confine yourself to a discussion about the investigation.\u201d</p><p>His face flushed. Had he forgotten how often she\u2019d called him on his behavior last year? Amusement tickled her throat. Maybe he thought that because she was a submissive in the club, her whole personality had changed. Not.</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cThen, sticking to the discussion, I want you to know if you pull another stupid trick like going off with one of your fuck buddies, I\u2019ll have you fired. You got that?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Narrow-minded asshole. \u201cBear in mind I don\u2019t work for you, Rhodes. I volunteered for this, and I can unvolunteer at any time and you can try to whistle up a new submissive to take my place.\u201d She smiled at him sweetly. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth and then closed it. Good choice. Considering her teenagelike bratty behavior in the Shadowlands, he\u2019d probably forgotten she wasn\u2019t someone he could push around. But as a child of an English professor and a corporate lawyer, she could not only out-pompous him, but could probably rip him to pieces verbally. And that wouldn\u2019t achieve anything except a moment of\u2014very nice\u2014satisfaction.</p><p>Unfortunately, complaining about him wouldn\u2019t get her far. Others had tried, but he had too many high-level buddies. And he\u2019d undoubtedly do his best to destroy her reputation in turn.</p><p>She sat back slowly as a nasty realization surfaced. If Rhodes put his twisted slant on what she had to do in the club, this job could well kill her career. Her chest tightened as she thought of everything she\u2019d worked for falling to pieces.</p><p>Before she could decide what to do, two men walked into the room. One was Galen Kouros, classically tall, dark, and handsome with a very unclassical limp. She hadn\u2019t seen him walk before, but from the way he leaned on a black cane, he no longer chased after criminals on foot. The lines in his face might come from pain, not a bad temper.</p><p>Despite the contemporary tan slacks and a white shirt, the other man looked like a medieval Scottish Highlander: a fair-skinned face with hard, flat planes; tied-back, light brown hair; tall and wide-shouldered. Both unshaven guys had the drawn appearance of people who hadn\u2019t seen a bed in recent history.</p><p>Interesting contrast though, a team of light and dark\u2014did the light one play the good guy during interrogations?</p><p>\u201cMs. Renard, it\u2019s nice to meet you in person. I\u2019m Vance Buchanan.\u201d The brown-haired warrior had an easy smile. He reached over the coffee table to shake. His hand was the size of a boxing glove. \u201cAnd I believe you\u2019ve met Galen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Kouros,\u201d she said politely to the other agent.</p><p>Buchanan snorted. \u201cYou can make it Galen and Vance. Would you care for a soda or coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. A soda would be great,\u201d she said.</p><p>As Galen took the chair opposite Dickhead, Vance got her a can from a small fridge, handed it over, then sat across from her. \u201cWe asked you to join us today for a couple of reasons, but mostly to bring you up-to-date.\u201d</p><p>The grimness of his expression made Gabi\u2019s insides tighten. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very perceptive.\u201d He rubbed his face and sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve determined who are the most notably rebellious submissives in the various Tampa clubs, and one of the women appears to have disappeared last Saturday. Another hasn\u2019t been seen since the week before. Just like in Atlanta, the subs belonged to different clubs. Our decoys haven\u2019t been touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Damn,\u201d Gabi whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe good news is this confirms the kidnapper is taking insolent submissives. The bad news is that both decoys in those two clubs did a fair job appearing rebellious. Maybe the kidnapped women seemed feistier or more appealing, or our agents are too new to BDSM or gave themselves away in some manner. And, much as I hate to add it, public sex might play a part. One decoy has sex at the club, but restricts it to another agent who\u2019s pretending to be her dom\u2014and happens to be her husband. The other decoy sticks strictly to nonsexual activities.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough,\u201d Galen broke in with a grunt of disgust.</p><p>\u201cStill no clues?\u201d Gabi asked.</p><p>They shook their heads. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t checked, these two subs might have gone missing for quite a while before anyone noticed,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThe kidnapper apparently chooses single women who don\u2019t speak with relatives or friends every day. And he covers his tracks. In Atlanta, he sent one victim\u2019s employer an e-mail saying she had a death in the family and needed time off.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes had leaned back in his chair, looking frustrated but lacking the sheer unhappiness the other two showed. He undoubtedly cared more about the success of the investigation than the victims.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving all the decoys in place in case the kidnapper strikes a club twice,\u201d Galen said. \u201cBut, Gabrielle, the chances are increasingly high he\u2019ll take someone from the Shadowlands.\u201d</p><p>The chill rattled her bones like an icy wind. What if something went wrong? I\u2019m not a brave person, dammit. When the can she held started to crumple, she gently set it on the coffee table and took a calming breath.</p><p>Galen set his cane against his leg and leaned back. With a look that seemed all too familiar, his keen gaze went from her hands to her face. Reading her. An experienced agent...or an experienced dom? She narrowed her eyes at him, and a hint of a crease appeared in his cheek.</p><p>She looked away. Honestly, Gabi, it\u2019s just your imagination. After so much time in the Shadowlands, of course she saw doms crawling out of the corners like cockroaches.</p><p>Vance said, \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the news of the missing women quiet for now in hopes of not alerting the unsub. Since we don\u2019t know where the delivery will take place, our only chance is to follow once a decoy is kidnapped. It\u2019s vital you do your utmost to attract his attention.\u201d</p> <p>With his words, the fear she\u2019d dammed broke over her like a tidal wave. She dropped her eyes, putting her hands between her knees to hide the trembling. A swallow cleared the tightness in her throat. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>The sympathy in Galen\u2019s eyes almost did her in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabrielle. It\u2019s not fair to you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean not fair?\u201d Rhodes said, his higher voice like a rasp against her nerves. \u201cWe\u2019re guarding her.\u201d He added under his breath, \u201cShe\u2019s not risking anything except a chill from lack of clothing.\u201d</p><p>Gabi saw the furious stare the big agent gave Rhodes.</p><p>Galen shook his head at his partner and responded to Dickhead in a soft voice almost as bladelike as Marcus\u2019s. \u201cYou show her the respect you would for any volunteer\u2014and you\u2019d better guard her very, very well, Rhodes. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>Rhodes\u2019s face turned pale.</p> <p>Yeah, you idiot, not easy being on the other side of pissed-off dom, is it? Gabi sighed. And that\u2019s where she\u2019d remain for the next two weekends. Even worse, after the night they had spent together, Marcus wouldn\u2019t understand. At all.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>On Saturday, Marcus halfheartedly watched Cullen lightly flog Andrea in the nearby scene area and tapped his fingers on the arm of the chair. After looking forward to seeing Gabi all week, her attitude on Friday night and this evening had come as an unwelcome surprise. Last Sunday at his house, she\u2019d been enthusiastic and loving, and he\u2019d found her sassiness as cute as it was fun. She\u2019d brought his home to life with her husky little giggle. He\u2019d wanted more.</p><p>And he\u2019d thought\u2014hell, he\u2019d known\u2014she\u2019d felt the same. But on Sunday, when he\u2019d returned her to the Shadowlands, she\u2019d jumped in her car and... Well, he\u2019d pretty much have to say it looked like an escape. Fleeing.</p><p>Marcus shook his head. Last night, she\u2019d treated him as if nothing had happened between them, and had returned to her bratty, inconsistent behavior with a vengeance. Why? She\u2019d loved surrendering to him at his house. He\u2019d been a dom long enough to know she hadn\u2019t faked her submission there and that much of the crap she pulled here was forced. But he sure hadn\u2019t figured out what to do about it.</p><p>A scream from the scene area drew his attention, and he smiled as Cullen tossed his flogger aside. The big bartender undid his leathers and first took Andrea\u2019s mouth, then her ass, employing a couple of interesting toys to ensure they both had a good time.</p><p>A very good time considering the pretty sub couldn\u2019t stand when Cullen unstrapped her from the sawhorse.</p><p>As Cullen cared for his sub and cleaned the equipment, Marcus did a mental check of his trainees. He\u2019d given permission for Dara to go upstairs with a newer dom who appeared mesmerized by her piercings.</p> <p>Austin had lusted after an older dom for months and finally got up enough nerve to flirt. Quite successfully. The dom had checked with Marcus, then dragged an enthusiastic Austin off to the dungeon. Marcus smiled. There might be a relationship starting.</p><p>Uzuri had left early, and since Tanner had already played with a couple who\u2019d wanted a third, he\u2019d finish the evening by serving drinks in the theme rooms. Apparently Sally had gone home to visit her family before school began. Surprising that the little minx hadn\u2019t mentioned her plan to leave; sassy as she was, Sally took her responsibilities seriously.</p><p>Gabi was serving drinks and causing trouble. After dumping a soda in a dom\u2019s lap, she\u2019d asked if he wanted ice with his drink. She\u2019d blown up a condom and popped it behind two doms having a discussion. And then she\u2019d told a dom who was buckling ankle cuffs on his sub that he looked good on his knees. Well. Marcus had barely gotten out of hearing before he\u2019d burst out laughing.</p><p>He sobered. The practical jokes could be tolerated, but she\u2019d also grown increasingly insolent, deliberately trying to incite a reaction.</p><p>He\u2019d made no progress at all. Dammit. His jaw tightening with frustration, he turned his gaze to watch Cullen finish stowing cleaning supplies.</p><p>The bartender scooped Andrea off the floor, where she\u2019d waited with a blanket around her. In the sitting area, he dropped into a leather chair hard enough to earn an oomph from the sub. She glared at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the way you haul me around like I\u2019m some doll.\u201d</p><p>Rumbling a laugh, Cullen slid a hand under her blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re my doll, love, and you\u2019re not going to forget it.\u201d</p><p>She melted at his touch and the tender look he gave her and snuggled closer.</p><p>Envy rolled through Marcus, and he set it aside. He knew full well the pain of loving the wrong woman was worse than the benefits. Before he and Patricia had divorced, she\u2019d either frozen him out, pretended to love him to get her own way, or had temper tantrums. He\u2019d actually preferred her rages\u2014at least when angry, she\u2019d shared her emotions honestly.</p><p>He thought of Gabi and the night she\u2019d spent with him. How she\u2019d snuggled closer to him in bed, how the rebellious spark in her eyes had changed to surrender, how she\u2019d touched him... Those emotions had been honest. Or had they? Could he have misread her completely?</p><p>\u201cYou okay there, Marcus?\u201d Cullen asked.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the time to indulge in unhappy woolgathering. He dredged up Gramps's favorite saying. \u201cFine as frog\u2019s hair, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your brat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brat seems to have a button she pushes at intervals to switch on a demon inside her.\u201d</p><p>Cullen barked a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, she\u2019s like a whipped dog, licking your hand one moment and attacking the next.\u201d Marcus frowned. \u201cI think she knows why, but she won\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>Marcus spotted the sub. In a neon blue halter top and vinyl skirt, Gabi had a dragon tattoo running up her shoulder, and earrings resembling golden claws decorating the curve of her ears. His little dragon sub was still sassing the members. \u201cYou ever met her, Andrea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to fill her drink orders at the bar.\u201d</p><p>Marcus studied her. Andrea was a sub, had been a trainee, and was a compassionate woman. \u201cMaybe she\u2019d be more forthcoming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroduce us,\u201d Andrea said after a second\u2019s thought. \u201cI won\u2019t break a confidence, but I\u2019ll talk to her if I can get her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d As Gabi neared the group, Marcus beckoned for her to join them.</p><p>Her eyes lit at the sight of him, but then her lips firmed. When she stiffened her shoulders and raised her chin, he knew she\u2019d decided to smart off. Yes, he could read her, even if he couldn\u2019t figure out her motivation.</p><p>She stood in front of him, setting her hands on her hips. \u201cYou guys are sure lazy bastards. Don\u2019t you have scenes to do, subs to beat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKneel. Now.\u201d Marcus pointed to his feet, putting enough snap into the command to get her to obey before her mind could react.</p><p>She dropped to her knees and, a second later, glared at him.</p><p>He smiled and pulled her between his legs, facing outward. Defiance or not, her sweet body felt just fine under his hands. He squeezed her shoulders, tracing the muscles beneath the soft feminine padding, enjoying the lovely curve of her neck. Wouldn\u2019t she look beautiful in a strapless gown\u2014perhaps a pretty blue to match the streak in her hair. \u201cGabi, you\u2019ve met Master Cullen. His sub is Andrea. She was a trainee back when he had charge of them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Interest brightened Gabi\u2019s face. \u201cNice to meet you, Andrea.\u201d</p><p>Andrea glanced at Cullen and got a headshake\u2014no talking\u2014that made her glower.</p><p>Marcus smothered a chuckle and informed Cullen, \u201cFrom the expression on your sub\u2019s face, she is still not adequately trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d Cullen\u2019s lips twitched before he frowned darkly at Andrea.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Se\u00f1or.\u201d She buried her head against him and added in a placating, sweet voice, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Cullen snorted. \u201cNice try, pet. I should still beat you.\u201d</p><p>Her whispered \u201cYou just did, cabr\u00f3n\u201d carried as clearly as Cullen\u2019s responding bark of laughter.</p><p>The wistful expression on Gabi\u2019s face squeezed Marcus\u2019s heart. She wanted what Andrea had with Cullen; he could see her longing. So why did she behave in a way so as to ensure she\u2019d never have such a relationship?</p><p>\u201cAlthough Andrea didn\u2019t live on the streets like you,\u201d Marcus told Gabi, \u201cshe grew up in the slums. And she caught grief from the other trainees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the trainees are nice...\u201d Gabi said, but he heard unhappiness in her voice. Were they giving her trouble?</p><p>After getting Cullen\u2019s permission to speak, Andrea said, \u201cOnly one sub was obnoxious, and she not only hated my background, but also that the most gorgeous man in the place was interested in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t that interested in you, Darlin\u2019,\u201d Marcus protested, earning a snicker from her before she clarified by patting Cullen\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cThis gorgeous man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich trainee?\u201d Gabi asked.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t here anymore.\u201d Andrea's mouth thinned. \u201cShe planted money in my locker so everyone thought I\u2019d stolen from her. Master Marcus and Dan grilled me like a criminal and threw me out of the club.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus winced. He still felt guilty over the way they\u2019d treated her.</p><p>Shocked, Gabi twisted to stare up at the trainer. \u201cYou were rude?\u201d She\u2019d thought Mr. Southern Lawyer always acted like a gentleman.</p><p>Andrea snorted. \u201cDan was rude; Master Marcus just backed him up. Of course after I got past wanting to kill them, I realized I did look guilty. And they were so furious thinking I\u2019d betrayed Cullen\u2019s trust, they weren\u2019t seeing clearly. They made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Snickering, Gabi widened her eyes at Marcus. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re not God? Nooo, say it isn\u2019t so!\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, cupped her breasts in his powerful hands, and whispered in a slow drawl, \u201cWhile you are here, Li\u2019ll sub, I am your god.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his deep voice, the feel of his palms as his thumbs grazed over her nipples, turned her insides liquid and melted her bones. Even a god couldn\u2019t turn her on as quickly. She closed her eyes for a second, just to savor being close to him, being touched, then sighed and let it go. Get back in the game, Gabi. \u201cDid the trainee get in trouble at least?\u201d</p><p>Andrea laughed. \u201cAfter the guys finished questioning Vanessa, they left her to Z. By the time he got through with her, she was crying so hard he had to call her a taxi. Then he got her banned from every club\u2014well, pretty much in Florida. I had no idea how well-known he is.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Master Z apologized to me here. Then Master Dan and Master Marcus apologized too, in front of everyone, even though they\u2019d already talked to me before, and I\u2019d forgiven them and everything.\u201d She frowned at Marcus. \u201cYou guys almost made me cry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurning into a regular watering can, aren\u2019t you, love?\u201d Cullen stroked her cheek gently with his huge hand.</p><p>\u201cYou wish,\u201d Andrea growled and nipped at his fingers. She wrinkled her nose at Marcus. \u201cIt was when you two gave me that humongous gift certificate to the best fetish-wear place in Tampa that I got teary-eyed.\u201d She said to Gabi, \u201cMy budget didn\u2019t go far, and I always looked like a poor relation in here, so I had a great time buying new clothes. I still haven\u2019t spent it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the benefits,\u201d Cullen rumbled, running his hand across the low bodice of Andrea\u2019s skintight vinyl dress. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you let me admire this new dress from the rear. I\u2019d enjoy a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Andrea slid off his lap.</p><p>Marcus squeezed Gabi\u2019s shoulder and murmured in her ear. \u201cGrey Goose, please.\u201d</p><p>As she shoved to her feet, the \u201cYes, Sir\u201d came out before she thought. Do better. She sucked in a breath, stuck her hand out, and shouted, \u201cHeil Hitler,\u201d then goose-stepped toward the bar. And tried really hard not to think about the disappointment that had darkened Marcus\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Dammit. I hate, hate, hate this.</p><p>Master Raoul had been talking to Andrea, but when Gabi reached the bar, he moved away.</p><p>Andrea grinned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re driving Master Marcus nuts, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d And making them both unhappy. The lump in her throat made it difficult to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou doing it on purpose?\u201d</p><p>The straightforward question coming from another sub left Gabi at a loss. The doms were the enemy, so to speak, but other submissives belonged on her team, and the habit of confiding in friends almost overcame her brains. \u201cIn a\u2014\u201d She shook her head, trying to get back on balance. \u201cMaybe. Kind of.\u201d</p><p>Andrea snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s an answer. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always seems like a good idea at the time.\u201d Gabi shifted uneasily. \u201cIs Master Raoul ignoring us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He just likes to talk to the newer doms and subs.\u201d Andrea drew her finger through a wet spot on the bar. \u201cSo what did you do on the streets?\u201d</p><p>Very blunt person, wasn\u2019t she? Gabi grinned, realizing she could like her a lot. \u201cI broke into houses, shoplifted, picked pockets.\u201d Andrea\u2019s dress had a pocket on one side. Leaning forward, Gabi reached for a stack of napkins farther down the bar, bumped into her...and lifted her car keys.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Andrea said, pushing the pile of napkins closer.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Gabi mimicked, setting Andrea\u2019s key chain on top of the napkins.</p><p>Andrea broke into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re good! My cousins tried to learn, but they\u2019re too ham-handed.\u201d She caught Gabi\u2019s frown and added, \u201cThey\u2019re all reformed and respectable now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. All our indiscretions happened in the past, but it was still awkward, since Cullen\u2019s a fire inspector and Dan\u2019s a cop.\u201d</p><p>Dan, the hard-faced one. \u201cHe\u2019s a cop? That figures.\u201d Gabi massaged her arm, remembering the way he\u2019d dragged her across the room to Marcus.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that grip. He\u2019s a cop to the bones. Kari\u2014the pregnant one\u2014is a schoolteacher, and everyone says Dan\u2019s mellowed a lot since meeting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, I can tell he\u2019s a real pushover now.\u201d Gabi leaned an elbow on the bar. Raoul hadn\u2019t budged, so she could indulge her curiosity about the other Masters. \u201cWho\u2019s the dark-haired Master, the one with black eyes who looks so mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Nolan. Building contractor. And his sub, Beth, owns a landscaping business\u2014she redesigned the gardens here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m glad Nolan and Dan are taken. Scary dudes. I wouldn\u2019t want to do a scene with one of them. Of course, when Marcus gets angry...\u201d That\u2019s even worse. Gabi mocked a shiver, ignoring the dull ache in her belly from making him unhappy again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared, and you still sass them?\u201d Andrea frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not very smart.\u201d</p><p>Gabi shrugged. \u201cMy father insists my shoe size is bigger than my IQ.\u201d</p><p>As Andrea sputtered with laughter, Master Raoul walked over to get their drink orders. Finally.</p><p>Late Saturday night, Jessica sat upstairs in Z\u2019s private third-story rooms and fumed. She hadn\u2019t gone to the Shadowlands yesterday because of a late client appointment\u2014estimated tax payments could screw up the best schedules\u2014and had looked forward to tonight. But Z had said he didn\u2019t want her in the club. And the jerk wouldn\u2019t tell her why, just claimed he had internal club problems.</p><p>Sure he did. She paced across the living room. Galahad watched, the end of his tail flicking as he contemplated chasing her feet. At least he wanted to chase her.</p><p>In the quiet room, she could hear the sounds of the Shadowlands, the low pulse of the music, mostly the bass. Occasionally a high cry. Very little, really. Z had said he\u2019d put in an excessive amount of soundproofing when he set up the club.</p><p>What would he do if she went down there? Jessica tried to rub the chill from her arms. He\u2019d left no room for misunderstanding. Stay out of the club tonight and next weekend too. He\u2019d smiled and said that was all he\u2019d ask, just tonight and next weekend.</p><p>Her mouth thinned. When she\u2019d worked on the Shadowlands accounts, she\u2019d noticed the new trainee\u2019s membership lasted only a month\u2014after next weekend, Gabrielle would be gone.</p><p>Well, maybe I\u2019ll be gone too.</p><p>The thought pierced her heart like a sharp blade. She shook her head. Z\u2019s withdrawal had something to do with that...that person. What if he wanted to play with her without Jessica around to get her feelings hurt? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at the wall. In the beginning, Z had let Cullen join a scene and touch Jessica. Did Z figure she should share him with others?</p><p>Anger sliced into her brain so sharply it took her breath away. I won\u2019t, damn him. Her hands fisted, and if he\u2019d been present, she\u2019d have hit him. Man, I need to get out of here before I make a scene like a child.</p><p>She trotted down the inside stairs and stopped in the ground-floor hallway. No car. Z'd picked her up, saying she could join the guys\" poker game after closing. She was stuck here until Z left the club. Dammit.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs in the empty hall, she paced up and down, and if she kicked the wall a few times, well, tough.</p> <p>An unknowable amount of time later, she heard the sound of a key, and Z stepped through from the club. God, he looked tired. Under the unforgiving hall light, harsh lines bracketed his mouth; another line carved between his eyebrows. How could he make her heart leap, make her worry about him, and make her hate him all at the same time?</p><p>He saw her and inclined his head. \u201cJessica. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. She stomped on the urge\u2014the need\u2014to hold him, to let him comfort her and to give him comfort in return. He looked like he badly needed a hug.</p><p>No. He could just take himself off and get soothed by someone else.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d gotten tired of having a short, fat sub. \u201cI need a ride back to my place. Can you ask one of the guys to give me a lift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHadn\u2019t we planned you would spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d She sounded like a kid having a temper tantrum and couldn\u2019t summon up the energy to care. He\u2019d left her alone all evening. He didn\u2019t want her there. His sons hated her and thought her too young for him\u2014and maybe she was. \u201cEither find someone to take me home or do it yourself.\u201d</p><p>He studied her face for a long moment and then sighed. \u201cAll right, kitten. Perhaps that would prove best for tonight.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take his hand. Everything inside her hurt. She\u2019d expected him to argue, to push her into talking about her fears, to...to show it mattered to him whether she stayed or left. \u201cThank you.\u201d She turned and headed toward the door to the garage. They\u2019d have a long, long, silent drive home.</p><p>Right now her only goal was to make it there without crying.</p><p>In the parking area near the Clearwater Downtown Docks, Cesar Maganti drank his coffee and watched the boat lights bob up and down in the darkness. The wharf never stayed totally quiet, even this late, but no one paid any attention to his big appliance truck.</p> <p>Muffled screams of pain came from the back of the truck as Jang toyed with the female they\u2019d taken earlier. She\u2019d barely awakened from the sedative before Jang had started. He was a brutal bastard but reliable, and discreet help was difficult to find. The Overseer didn\u2019t care if the girls were roughed up some as long as they\u2019d heal up in two to three weeks\" time. That left a lot of leeway for someone like Jang.</p><p>The girl started to cry, and Maganti heard the wet sounds of sex.</p><p>On the seat beside him, his phone vibrated. Maganti checked the number. The Overseer. \u201cYes?\u201d No identification, no trace. Both of them used disposable cell phones that would get tossed after the last pickup.</p><p>\u201cI received your message about a problem with the order.\u201d</p><p>Maganti sat up as anxiety burned off his relaxed mood. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lighter-colored piece is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d The Overseer's list included a sassy blonde and a brunette from the Shadowlands. Maganti was to take whoever proved safer.</p><p>But his investigation showed the blonde had a relationship with her dom and saw him during the week as well as on BDSM nights. Often a woman who only played at a club could disappear without making waves. Hell, half the time a dom wouldn\u2019t even know a sub\u2019s real name. But a husband or lover would search forever and create all sorts of stink.</p> <p>\u201cI see. And the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnavailable.\u201d The fucking brunette had disappeared into thin air.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disappointing. Let me check if I received an update.\u201d The clicking of a keyboard broke the silence on the phone. \u201cAh yes. There\u2019s a very fine piece that fits our specifications. I\u2019ll send you the new parts number.\u201d</p><p>Maganti grinned. Score! When the brunette cunt had disappeared last Sunday, he\u2019d worried he\u2019d lose a fucking quarter of his potential fee. \u201cGood enough. I\u2019ll watch for it.\u201d He didn\u2019t know where the dude got the names of the females; he didn\u2019t need or want to know.</p><p>\u201cAny trouble securing the rest of the order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m waiting for the pickup now, in fact.\u201d He\u2019d grabbed this bitch easily enough. Even better, the only people who might miss her were at her job. On Monday, he\u2019d send her boss an e-mail explaining she\u2019d had a death in the family.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Will the new part be ready before next Sunday? After that would be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the new piece checks out, I\u2019ll package the last order for shipping on Friday or Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Silence indicated the Overseer had hung up.</p><p>Maganti heard retching noises coming from the back and turned to yell at Jang, \u201cGet that fucking gag off before she chokes.\u201d He spotted a boat pulling up to the dock. \u201cHer ride\u2019s here. Let\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The Shadowlands had closed. Holding his little trainee\u2019s wrist, Marcus led her down the private hallway, then outside. After the dry air-conditioned atmosphere of the club, the sultry air wrapped around him like a sweaty fist.</p><p>Gabi stopped. Her eyes were big and frightened, making him want to pull her into a hug and reassure her. \u201cI need to go home now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou live alone and don\u2019t have a job at present. Is there a reason you can\u2019t stay a couple of hours longer?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, then closed. She\u2019d decided not to lie to him. This time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He took her around the corner to Z\u2019s private yard at the rear of the Shadowlands. The other three doms had already congregated on the veranda. Z wasn\u2019t in sight.</p><p>Gabi stopped again, obviously seeing everyone present was a Shadowlands Master. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKneel right here, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She did so silently, which told him how terrified she must be. She stared at the men.</p><p>Many doms, one sub. Of course she was worried. He caressed her cheek. \u201cGabrielle, I am planning to do a scene with you, but it will be only me and you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed.</p><p>Better. \u201cStay here for now, Darlin\u2019.\u201d He strolled over to the other Masters, who stood across the veranda by the small refrigerator.</p><p>\u201c\"Bout time you decided to join us for a poker night, buddy.\u201d Cullen grinned. \u201cCan I hope your reluctance means you don\u2019t know how to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoker? I thought Raoul said bridge.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Cullen handed him a beer.</p><p>Still in his black leathers and T-shirt, Nolan gestured toward Gabi with his drink. \u201cDid you bring her to play poker, or is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem.\u201d Marcus looked at him, then Cullen and Raoul. \u201cI\u2019m not getting what is going on in her head. She\u2019s submissive and at times beautifully so. And out of the blue, she\u2019ll turn defiant, even past the point of self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that.\u201d Cullen scratched his jaw. \u201cDamned if I\u2019ve figured out her motivation either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do, my friend?\u201d Raoul asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do a scene with her, get her into subspace, and find some answers. But I usually have an idea of where I\u2019m going. This time\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cullen nodded. \u201cYou want backup if needed, and other eyes in case we can spot a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I realize it will delay the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComes with the territory,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cBesides, Z called a bit ago. Said he had to take Jessica home and he\u2019d be late. You want to wait?\u201d</p><p>Marcus hesitated and then shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s deliberately keeping something back about her. I\u2019ll do this without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help setting up?\u201d Raoul asked.</p><p>\u201cNo setup. I\u2019ll use the posts out here.\u201d Marcus turned to check on Gabi. She knelt, watching him, her nervousness apparent in her wide brown eyes and clenched hands. So quiet. Why so submissive now? \u201cCome here, please.\u201d</p><p>She rose quite gracefully, he noticed. She\u2019d obviously practiced a bit.</p><p>Nolan grunted in approval, and Cullen murmured, \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty sub, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>When she stood in front of him, she asked, \u201cYes, Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful like this,\u201d he said, seeing the need to please shining in her eyes.</p><p>She flushed.</p><p>He tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to flog you, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Gabi inhaled sharply and took a step back. Was he insane? \u201cYou kept me here to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a sadist, Gabi, and we both know you enjoy a bit of pain. This is just a different type.\u201d Without giving her time to think it over, he guided her between two patio posts that had bolts embedded up high. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d the rough dom\u2014Nolan\u2014called and tossed Marcus two short chains.</p><p>Marcus used them to restrain her between the posts so that she faced the veranda with her arms lifted like in a victory cheer V.</p><p>Her breath caught as she pulled on the chains. Could she let him do this? \u201cI\u2014Why now? Not before in the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do better with less people around, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn, he\u2019d noticed. Even as she tried to figure out what to do, excitement speared through her, rapidly turning to heat when he removed her halter top with sure fingers. He unzipped her short vinyl skirt and pulled that off as well, leaving her naked.</p><p>Oh God. Her heart started to race, and she could feel her nipples peaking, her skin tingling with anticipation.</p><p>His gaze ran over her, face to hands to breasts, and he gave her a slow smile. \u201cAll excited before we even start.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, and her eyes strayed toward the other doms. What must they think? Why was she the only submissive here?</p><p>He noticed the direction of her gaze. \u201cSugar, I\u2019m going to blindfold you.\u201d</p><p>Be blind? Gabi shook her head, her fear rising like the mercury in a thermometer on a hot day. \u201cSir, no.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin, meeting her eyes with his steady ones. \u201cGabrielle, you\u2019ll concentrate better on the sensations and not on who\u2019s present. I will not do anything that you don\u2019t know about, and I will not leave you alone, not even for a second.\u201d</p><p>She saw the question in his face: Do you trust me? And she couldn\u2019t hold out. All evening she\u2019d hated how she had to keep disappointing him time after time. Master Nolan, Raoul, and Cullen had been members of the club for years; surely none of them were the kidnapper. With relief, she realized she didn\u2019t need to act like a brat. She could do what Marcus wanted this time.</p><p>Excitement started in the hollow of her back and tingled up her spine. Flogging. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he said, making her heart leap with longing. He tied the padded blindfold on snugly.</p><p>As the blackness enfolded her, she tensed, and yet her skin tingled as if someone was running a Fourth of July sparkler over it.</p><p>\u201cYou have a safe word to use if you need to.\u201d He didn\u2019t move but stayed close enough that the heat of his body warmed hers as he stroked her hair gently.</p><p>As her breathing eased, she heard the other men talking quietly. Cullen\u2019s louder laugh. The fragrance of the sea and tropical flowers and Marcus\u2019s own masculine scent. She raked her toes against the concrete to remind herself of where she was.</p><p>He abandoned her hair and ran his fingertips down her body. She jumped.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sugar.\u201d His hand grazed across her skin as he moved to stand behind her. He braced his chest against her back and curved his fingers lightly around her throat, the most subtle of reminders of how vulnerable she was. He murmured in her ear, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do wrong, because all the control belongs to me. You don\u2019t have any say in what happens.\u201d</p><p>The concrete seemed to soften under her feet.</p><p>His breath brushed her ear. \u201cYou can scream or sass or cry. It doesn\u2019t matter. I will still do what I want to do.\u201d He turned her head far enough to take her mouth, roughly, possessively, reinforcing that she could do nothing to stop him.</p><p>Even as she shifted her weight anxiously, heat pooled low in her belly. This was what she wanted...had always needed.</p><p>He ran his hard hands over her, his touch almost painful; then cuffs closed snugly around her ankles. Unbreakable. Chains clanked as he secured her legs widely apart.</p> <p>Air wafted over the bare, wet skin of her pussy and inner thighs, cool against the heat.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re open to me, and I will do whatever I want. All you can do is take it, Li\u2019ll subbie.\u201d</p><p>The words sounded like a threat, and yet given in his soft drawl, they made her shiver with anticipation. Touch me, please.</p><p>He must have knelt behind her, for his hands grazed up the backs of her thighs and moved between her legs. He stroked through her folds. She could feel she was awfully wet despite her fear\u2014or maybe because of it. Flogging. He would hit her\u2014</p><p>\u201cStay with me here, sugar,\u201d he murmured. His finger slid directly over the top of her rapidly hardening clit, and her mind went blank as the sensation sizzled across her nerves. She groaned and pushed her hips forward.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d His finger circled, melting her insides. Even as he played with her clit, he kissed the right cheek of her bottom and then bit the soft flesh hard enough to send a shock of pain up her spine and shoot her arousal higher.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt like this. He was playing with her as her cats toyed with their prey. Her hips squirmed; she couldn\u2019t tell how to move to increase his touch on her clit. As the chains clanked, she remembered the other doms and froze. A flush scalded her face.</p><p>Marcus laughed, low and deep. \u201cYes, they\u2019re watching, Gabi. They see how you\u2019ve surrendered to me, and how you\u2019re going to give me everything I ask tonight.\u201d The pleasure in his voice surged over her like an ocean wave.</p><p>Abandoning her throbbing pussy, he rose and set his solid chest against her back. When he cupped her breasts, heat moved through her, up and down, electricity lost in the maze of her body. He teased her nipples, rolling them gently between his fingers, increasing the pressure slowly into pain.</p><p>Caught in his trap, she\u2019d pull away from the hurt and then push forward, needing the pleasure. He sucked on her earlobe, his breath riffling her hair. Encircled by him, unable to escape, she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl,\u201d he murmured and stepped back.</p><p>A second later, velvety fingers ran up and down her back\u2014not his hands. A flogger, he was teasing her with a flogger.</p><p>He hit her lightly. And again. Soon the tiny, thuddy sensations went up her thighs, her butt, her back, the rhythm never faltering, the impact slowly increasing. Her bottom, her thighs began to sting, and gradually the blows hurt as a burning pain lingered behind each slapping blow.</p><p>Before it reached too much, Marcus slowed and eased off.</p><p>Realizing she was using the chains for support, feeling a little dizzy, she straightened, thinking he was done.</p><p>Instead she felt his breath on her mound.</p><p>She inhaled sharply as her pussy suddenly woke. When he slid his hands between her legs, her knees shook. His fingers curled upward over her lower buttocks, and his thumbs drew her labia slightly apart, completely exposing her clit.</p><p>She shuddered at the sensation of being touched as if he had the right.</p><p>He ruthlessly opened her farther. \u201cVery pretty, Darlin\u2019, all swollen and pink.\u201d His tongue, hot and wet, slid directly over it, and lightning ran straight up her spine with an almost audible hiss.</p><p>His merciless fingers held her still as he closed his lips around her clit. He ran his tongue over the swollen nub of nerves, rubbing one side, then the other, as his top lip pressed down on the hood.</p><p>Her body went stiff; her legs quivered. Unrelenting, he continued as her insides coiled, tightened, her breathing stopped. Hot stroke after hot stroke. The pressure grew until nothing could hold it back. Her body exploded, a tsunami of pleasure engulfing her. Her hips tried to buck against him, and he held her still, controlling her even through her orgasm.</p><p>Before she finished shuddering, he started flogging her again. Gentle caresses and tiny thumps from the multiple strands of the flogger. The rhythm never faltered as the strokes grew harder and harder, stinging against her skin, yet somehow the burn increased the throbbing between her legs.</p><p>The blows began to hurt.</p><p>He eased up, slowed, stopped. And then he knelt in front of her and ran his hands up her legs.</p><p>Again? Oh God.</p><p>She shook as he stroked her with hard hands, pulling her pussy against his mouth. He didn\u2019t tease her\u2014no, his lips demanded that she respond.</p><p>As his tongue slid over her, her clit hardened, swelled, and her insides coiled under his touch. She moaned, losing track of everything, as the stinging on her skin blended with the fire drawn in circles by his hot tongue. The pressure inside her tightened, and then he closed his lips around her and sucked, flickering his tongue over her clit at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOooh God.\u201d The wail escaped her as everything inside burst outward in waves of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLet it go.\u201d</p><p>He flogged her again, harder yet. And made her come again. The pain on her skin grew, yet so did the pleasure until each blow of the flogger excited her more and tightened her clit, until his breath on her mound pulled the stinging into her clit, transforming it into excitement. Until the pain itself squeezed through her as tightly as his lips around her.</p><p>When the blows started again, she couldn\u2019t tell. Somehow the ground had disappeared from under her feet. She couldn\u2019t hear the whip anymore, just the rush of her breath and thud of her heart. Her arms and legs were gone; nothing was there except the clouds around her. White puffs that billowed and bumped against her back in soft little jostlings.</p><p>\u201cGabi.\u201d So insistent a sound. \u201cGabi.\u201d The demanding, deep voice pulled at something inside her as if it could tug her heart out.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Her tongue didn\u2019t move right, and she tried again. The clouds around her lightened until the sky showed through them. So blue. Clear blue. Intense...eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019re so disobedient.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute to get through. Diso...what? Disobedient.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>Her lips felt numb. His eyes were so blue. \u201cI have to. Noisy sub. They said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSaid what, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet attention. Noticed.\u201d</p><p>Marcus frowned at his little sub. Eyes glazed, breathing slowly. The pain and pleasure had overwhelmed her until she rode a wave of endorphins and submission. She was deep into subspace, and the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And he\u2019d hit topspace, his senses overly acute, her every breath and movement pulling him further in, binding them into one. But \u201cthey said\u201d? Was she hearing voices? \u201cWho said, Gabi? Who told you to get noticed?\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together, and she blinked. \u201cKouros. Agent Kouros.\u201d</p> <p>What the hell? At his house, she\u2019d dodged his question about a job... \u201cWhere do you work, Gabi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI.\u201d</p><p>It took a second, and then the word hit him like a bullet in the chest and he grunted at the impact. Chairs creaked behind him as the other doms rose, probably as stunned as he was. She\u2019s been playing me? \u201cYou\u2019re an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together. \u201cYes. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re undercover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her head sagged.</p> <p>He needed to get her down. Glancing at the doms, he jerked his head for help. Raoul and Cullen unbuckled her wrists and Nolan her ankles. Marcus supported her weight and then scooped her into his arms. She\u2019d lied to him. But no matter what happened, a dom didn\u2019t abandon a sub after a scene.</p><p>He settled onto a wide porch swing with Gabi on his lap. When Nolan offered a sheet, he nodded. The evening felt too warm for blankets, but she\u2019d need the comfort of something over her nakedness. Nolan tucked it around her body, and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sugar,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cYou\u2019re just fine. I\u2019ve got you, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>As the endorphins wore off, her euphoria would disappear and the pain from the flogging would start to register. He hadn\u2019t flogged her hard, but she\u2019d taken a while to get deep enough into subspace.</p><p>She stirred again, probably feeling her skin stinging. Blinking up at him, she offered a lopsided smile. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Despite his anger, his heart tugged. She looked so sweet, nestled against him like a milk-fed puppy, her eyes open and honest.</p><p>No hidden reserve. He hadn\u2019t realized its existence until it had disappeared. Secrets. Dammit. He hauled in slow breath.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he answered gently. His anger and his need to demand explanations would have to wait until they returned to even footing. She was too vulnerable right now.</p> <p>\u201cRest, sugar. I have you,\u201d he repeated. Her unique scent of rose and sandalwood and feminine musk slid into him.</p><p>Her fingers stroked his chest lightly as she snuggled. Her trust sent fury surging through him, because he\u2019d trusted her in turn and she\u2019d lied. As he rocked, he considered how Z had insisted Marcus take on a trainee they hadn\u2019t discussed and insisted he keep her for a month. An unyielding fist squeezed his guts, and he lifted his head.</p><p>The others had pulled up chairs around him. Cullen, ever the bartender, handed Marcus an opened can of soda.</p><p>He took a long drink, but the cold bite of carbonation didn\u2019t remove the bitterness of betrayal. \u201cZ knew. That sorry bastard knew.\u201d</p><p>Nolan\u2019s black eyes studied the little sub as he drank his beer. \u201cSeems likely.\u201d Anger ran through the calm words.</p><p>At a sound from the house, Marcus glanced up at the third story. Z stepped out onto the landing and came down the steps to the veranda.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Z said as he neared the group. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be so late.\u201d As every Master on the patio turned their attention to him, Z took a step back, one hand massaging his forehead as if someone had punched him\u2014something Marcus really wanted to do. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered a few interesting facts about the new trainee,\u201d Cullen said in a level voice. He nodded toward Gabi.</p><p>Z\u2019s face went still. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. Just in subspace,\u201d Cullen said quickly.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Mouth thinned, Z asked Marcus, \u201cYou questioned her?\u201d</p><p>A twang of guilt hit, and Marcus pushed it aside, recalling the nights he\u2019d lain awake, trying to figure out the trainee Z had insisted he take. His voice came out hard. \u201cShe\u2019s not a disobedient submissive\u2014she\u2019s an FBI agent. What else have you lied about, Z?\u201d</p><p>Just then, Gabi squirmed on his lap. Using his arm as an aid, she pulled herself to a sitting position and rubbed her face. She smiled at Marcus. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d He tried but couldn\u2019t damp the anger soon enough.</p><p>Her smile wavered and died. She looked at the others. At Z. Back at Marcus. Her face paled to the color of Marcus\u2019s white shirt, and she wrung her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s all funny in my head, but I remember...I told\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cYou did.\u201d Fury at her deception made his words clipped. Cold.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cYou questioned me\u2014like a criminal. You wanted me to trust you just so you could do that to me.\u201d She shoved to her feet, staggering back on shaky legs.</p><p>Marcus rose hastily to put an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, you bastard.\u201d She shoved at his arm. \u201cGet away from me. I\u2019m out of here. Never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not driving in this condition, Gabrielle,\u201d Marcus said even as Z did. He glared at Z. \u201cStay out of this.\u201d</p><p>Without answering, Z moved closer to cup Gabi\u2019s cheek. \u201cAre you all right, little one?\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s anger flared higher as he fought the need to pull his sub out of Z\u2019s reach.</p><p>She made such an effort to smile at Z that Marcus\u2019s heart twisted. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>And they could both feel her tremble. Dammit, he needed to stay with her; she couldn\u2019t be left alone. He tightened his grip. \u201cI\u2019m taking her home, Z, and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gabi snapped and jerked away from him.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle,\u201d Marcus warned.</p><p>\u201cYou have no\u2014nothing to do with me.\u201d The look of betrayal on her face matched his own, and he felt as if he\u2019d kicked a defenseless child. \u201cI don\u2019t want you near me. You bastard.\u201d Her voice broke, and she turned away.</p><p>Marcus considered. He could overrule her and take her home, but his presence right now would be more damaging than someone else\u2019s. Especially since he still didn\u2019t understand what was going on. \u201cRaoul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Raoul said, understanding immediately. \u201cI\u2019ll drive her car\u2014and her\u2014to her place.\u201d He pulled Gabi into his arms, ignoring her protests. \u201cThis isn\u2019t up for discussion, chiquita. You don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>When she sagged, too tired to put up a fight, Raoul said, \u201cNolan, can you follow and bring me back after? It might take a while, since I want to make sure she doesn\u2019t drop. Further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan do. No problem.\u201d Nolan shot Z an icy stare. \u201cBut you and I will talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d As the two doms escorted Gabi through the side gate, Z pulled out his cell and told someone Gabi was being driven home. He shut the phone on the sound of a man cursing and kneaded his brow. \u201cWhat a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d Cullen handed Z a drink, getting a surprised look. \u201cYes, I\u2019m pissed off, but you rarely do anything without a reason, so I\u2019ll wait until I hear it.\u201d</p><p>Marcus wasn\u2019t feeling that charitable. Guilty as hell was his judgment.</p><p>Cullen took a chair, stretching his long legs out, deliberately lowering the sense of an impending fight. Z and Marcus remained standing.</p><p>Marcus braced his feet. The other Masters had known Z for years. Marcus hadn\u2019t, and the bastard had damned well destroyed any chance of that. Marcus planned to have his say, tear up his membership card, and never look back. Right now his only question was whether to use a fist to punctuate his statement.</p><p>Z\u2019s gaze met his. \u201cMarcus.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s talk. I have decisions to make, and since the secret is out, you all can help.\u201d The bastard pulled two chairs over and shoved one to Marcus before sitting across from him and Cullen. Deliberately taking the hot-seat position.</p><p>Despite his anger, Marcus had to admire the man\u2019s self-possession. Dropping into the chair, Marcus set his elbows on the arms. Waiting silently.</p><p>\u201cThe FBI came to me two weeks ago,\u201d Z started. \u201cThe previous month, a submissive had been kidnapped and then escaped. Before she died of a gunshot wound, she said someone was kidnapping rebellious subs for a slave auction\u2014for men who want the pleasure of breaking them. More slaves are scheduled to be taken from Tampa, and the final pickup of victims is next Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Cullen muttered.</p><p>\u201cThree subs from different BDSM clubs are missing in Atlanta. The FBI has no leads, so they placed decoy submissives in Tampa/St. Pete clubs. Gabrielle was assigned to the Shadowlands. I had to give my word not to tell anyone, even you, Marcus, although I did protest the secrecy. Both sides had valid arguments, and unfortunately the FBI is in control of the decision.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Z looked at Marcus, no expression on his face. \u201cI gave her to you because I could ask you to keep her when any other dom would have dumped her after the first night. Or abused her. I knew you wouldn\u2019t let your anger rule you.\u201d Z leaned back and took a drink of the beer Cullen had given him, obviously giving them time to absorb everything.</p><p>His word. Marcus scrubbed his face, feeling the rough stubble. An honest man didn\u2019t break his word.</p><p>Cullen snorted. \u201cDan would call this a clusterfuck.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stared out at the palm trees. The black shapes blotted out the stars. Cullen had it right; this was a clusterfuck with no path that didn\u2019t involve betrayal or damage. Knowing Z\u2019s protectiveness toward submissives, Marcus understood his need to help. With a sigh, Marcus gave up. \u201cIt must have got you all riled up to see her punished for doing her job.\u201d</p> <p>Z\u2019s shoulders sagged, the only sign he\u2019d worried over Marcus\u2019s opinion. \u201cNothing about this has been easy for anyone.\u201d His eyes met Marcus\u2019s. \u201cMarcus, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears to me you didn\u2019t have a choice. And Gabrielle knew what she was getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. Although I insisted she fill out the questionnaire honestly, I daresay she pushed her own comfort zone\u2014she didn\u2019t want to take a chance she\u2019d fail to attract attention. Unfortunately, I believe her experience was limited and lightweight and several years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Cullen\u2019s face turned to granite. \u201cI ball gagged her. How could I not have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Z nodded. \u201cAnd that reaction justifies the reasoning for secrecy. How can you punish misbehavior appropriately if you know the sub is acting? The two agents in charge of the investigation are both experienced doms; they knew how we\u2019d react.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrave little sub,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cI know FBI agents are tough cookies, but...\u201d</p><p>Z winced. \u201cNot to add to your guilt, Marcus, though I doubt it can exceed mine, but she\u2019s not an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Marcus said, keeping his voice as polite as he could manage.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find out until this week when her backup sniped about her lack of training.\u201d Z rubbed his forehead again. \u201cShe\u2019s a victim specialist\u2014a social worker who helps the victims of crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell is a social worker here?\u201d Marcus asked. His jaw felt so tight it might shatter.</p><p>\u201cOne of the women kidnapped in Atlanta is her friend. Gabrielle volunteered\u2014demanded\u2014to help. I daresay BDSM-experienced submissives are in short supply among FBI agents, so they took her up on it.\u201d Z shifted in his chair. \u201cMarcus, she\u2019s one of the bravest people I know. She is completely terrified and doing this anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Terrified. He\u2019d seen her fear. Every single night. He set his drink down carefully. He\u2019d made her fear worse. He\u2019d spanked her. Mercilessly. He\u2019d hurt an innocent, vulnerable woman and made her cry.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Gabi\u2019s brain slowly thawed from an icy ball into something functional. Her fingers clenched her crocheted throw to her breasts like a security blanket. Her eyes opened to focus on her bland apartment.</p><p>She tried to move. Failed. She frowned down at the thickly muscled arm around her waist, holding her against a hard chest. I don\u2019t know that arm. Marcus\u2019s arms were powerful but leaner. She looked up, past the corded neck, the strong jaw, and into chocolate brown eyes. Not blue. \u201cMaster Raoul.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cBack with me again? How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>What was he doing in her apartment? As her memories flooded in, her breath strangled in her throat. Flogging. Marcus. Questions. The other doms. Her jaw clenched. This dom had stood and watched while Marcus turned her into jelly and interrogated her.</p><p>She shoved his arm away and rose, ignoring the weakness in her legs. \u201cI want you to leave now.\u201d Pulling her blanket more tightly around her bare shoulders, she tried to conceal her shivering. Her apartment felt as if someone had set the air-conditioning to thirty degrees, and the chill had gone bone-deep. She might never be warm again.</p><p>\u201cChiquita...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo away.\u201d In her head, she could see her mother\u2019s disapproval at her rudeness. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still shaking, Gabrielle,\u201d he said.</p><p>Raoul had been kind to her. He\u2019d stayed silent on the drive home, not trying to make excuses for Marcus or blaming her for lying to them. Instead he\u2019d held her hand in his big warm one as if to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. He\u2019d escorted her to her apartment. Once inside, he\u2019d ignored her protests and held her as she had a meltdown.</p><p>But her shaking was his fault. Marcus\u2019s fault. The back of her thighs and her bottom stung as if she\u2019d acquired a horrible sunburn and made her even angrier. She lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You did your job, and I thank you.\u201d</p><p>But for what he\u2019d helped with, she might never forgive him.</p><p>As if he heard her thought, he winced. \u201cGabrielle, you realize Marcus only wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave right now, I\u2019m calling the cops.\u201d She managed to pick up the phone without dropping it.</p><p>He set a business card on an end table, smart enough not to hand it to her. \u201cGabrielle, if you need someone\u2014a friend\u2014please call me.\u201d His dark brown eyes held only concern when he added, \u201cJust to talk or for a shoulder to cry on. You don\u2019t have to be the strong one all the time.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, I do. \u201cThanks for the offer.\u201d She nodded toward the door.</p><p>He left quietly. She locked the door behind him and leaned against it.</p><p>What have I done? Brought back, escorted into the apartment, no chance for the kidnapper to get her. Oh, Kim, I\u2019m sorry...</p><p>She\u2019d blown her cover. Rhodes would never understand why she\u2019d blurted it all out.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand either.</p><p>But Marcus had known exactly what he was doing. He\u2019d deliberately worked her into such a wreck she couldn\u2019t control her thoughts, let alone her words. And questioned her. In front of others. His betrayal felt like a gash in her soul, spilling blood with every beat of her heart.</p><p>Her knees buckled, and she dropped down onto the thin carpet. Horatio and Hamlet crept out from behind the couch to rub against her legs. \u201cI trusted him,\u201d she told them. Horatio broke into a low purr and set a paw on Gabi\u2019s knee.</p><p>Her eyes prickled with tears. \u201cI did. I trusted him. God, I\u2019m stupid.\u201d Even though she\u2019d pretended not to care, inside she\u2019d been sliding deeper and deeper under his spell.</p><p>Well, the spell had broken. Wake up, Cinderella. Your glass slippers have shattered and cut your feet. She rose and staggered a few steps. How could a damn flogging turn her muscles into limp noodles? Her legs felt as if they belonged to someone else. Could she even stand up long enough to shower? But she had to. Had to wash away the sticky sweat and arousal, to eradicate his touch and scent.</p><p>But hot water and soaping after soaping couldn\u2019t remove her memories of his strong hands, the scrape of his shadowed jaw, his warm breath. As her back and butt and legs burned, she felt again the rhythm of the blows, the slow increase in pain...and need.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>After toweling dry, she wiped off a clear spot on the steamed-up mirror, then turned. Pink lines remained from the flogger. Light along her back, darker on her bottom and the backs of her thighs. Nothing was welted or raised. The redness would probably have disappeared by tomorrow.</p><p>Yet it seemed like Marcus had marked her...had somehow branded her as his own.</p><p>Anger sliced through her, the pain sharper than her stinging skin. Yet beneath it was a terrifying sense of satisfaction\u2014an internal voice that said yes to his marks of possession.</p><p>A clusterfuck. Marcus leaned back in his home office chair and stared at the white ceiling. Interesting term. What a shame he couldn\u2019t use it in court. The accused stole an M16 and then... Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it was a real clusterfuck.</p><p>The evening had definitely been a clusterfuck.</p><p>Before he and Cullen had left the Shadowlands, Z said he\u2019d explain to the Masters and ask them to keep the investigation secret. With a stab of pity, Marcus had agreed. Z had looked exhausted.</p><p>Apparently Marcus wasn\u2019t the only one feeling like he\u2019d kicked a helpless puppy.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s report hadn\u2019t helped. The little sub hadn\u2019t cried or fully recovered, but threatened to call the cops if Raoul didn\u2019t leave. Everything in Marcus wanted to go to her, to make sure she was all right. A dom didn\u2019t put a sub in that kind of shape and abandon her.</p><p>Guilt weighed like a heavy hand on his shoulders. Despite the fact that he\u2019d done his best with good intentions, he\u2019d screwed up, damaging where he\u2019d only wanted to help.</p><p>Damn Z anyway.</p><p>Marcus rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock. Four a.m. But he couldn\u2019t sleep. Instead he booted up his computer.</p><p>Realizing Gabi probably used a fake name, he\u2019d demanded her correct name from Z. Renard. He typed Gabrielle Renard into the search engine.</p><p>The results appeared on the screen. She worked in the FBI field office in Miami. A victim specialist. A social worker, just as Z had said.</p><p>After reading for a while, he leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. She helped the victims of violence and seemed to mostly work with children and teens. When she\u2019d talked about her murdered friends and her rape, she\u2019d mentioned a man who had\u2014how had she put it?\u2014talked her out of the corner she\u2019d hidden in. Had he been a victim specialist perchance, the one who started her on this path? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet a kindness, pass it on.\u201d That was his mother\u2019s motto. Apparently Gabi lived by it. Mama would like her.</p><p>After shutting the computer down, he poured himself a brandy. In his backyard, he took a chair and propped his feet up on another. Above the city lights, the stars shone brightly in the black sky, a comforting assurance that the universe continued on, despite the disasters on one tiny planet. As he watched, a meteor streaked across the sky and fell.</p><p>Well, he knew some of the little sub\u2019s past now, and from the articles, she exemplified both dedication and compassion. A softhearted woman. Guilt pressed on his chest. Good job there, Atherton. Jesus, could I have screwed up any more badly?</p><p>He watched another bright light fall to its doom on Earth. In the club, she acted like a brat for the killer. It explained her idiotic rebellions like the missing fact in a trial. All those times she\u2019d start to submit, then straighten her shoulders and spit out something outrageous\u2014all pretense. His chest tightened as he remembered how many times he\u2019d punished her. God, how could she ever forgive him?</p> <p>He\u2019d acted appropriately for what she\u2019d allowed him to know\u2014and realizing that didn\u2019t help at all. How the hell would he make this up to her? During his marriage, his wife had demanded presents, jewelry, flowers after a fight. He dry scrubbed his face, his stubble rasping over his palms. Jewelry wouldn\u2019t fix this. Nothing would.</p><p>In the distance, an emergency siren wailed. Marcus tipped his head back with a sigh. Hard world. He did his best to try to make it a better place. Now to discover he\u2019d hurt someone he\u2019d come to...come to what? Care for? Maybe.</p><p>Probably. She\u2019d appealed to him from the beginning, even with her outrageous behavior. Of course, not all that brattiness was acting. Marcus smiled and took a sip of brandy. No, she had a mouth on her.</p><p>She\u2019d hidden much of herself, but everything he did know attracted him. Her laughter. \u201cI felt sorry for myself since my wimpy dom can\u2019t catch a snail crossing the sidewalk.\u201d He wanted that laughter in his life.</p><p>\u201cThey shot my Danny and Rock. I was so mad, and I wanted to hurt them.\u201d So matter-of-fact when she\u2019d told him, as if her loyalty and courage weren\u2019t remarkable.</p> <p>He tilted his head back, remembering her wistful voice. \u201cYou know, he\u2019d buy me romance novels. We were broke, but somehow he\u2019d still find me books.\u201d Such a little thing to mean so much to her. He wanted to be the one to comfort her. To take care of her. He smiled. To buy her romance novels.</p><p>But she\u2019d undoubtedly run from him now. What if she didn\u2019t return to the Shadowlands? She might not want to give him a second chance. His mouth tightened, and determination settled inside him with a weight like gravity.</p><p>Such a shame that a sub doesn\u2019t always get what she wants.</p><p>On Monday, Gabi rode the elevator in the Clearwater hotel two flights past the FBI agents\u2019 floor, then took the stairs back down. Her dread of the coming interview increased with each step closer to the room.</p><p>She opened the stairwell door, stepped into the hallway, and trudged across the thick carpeting. She and sleep hadn\u2019t been on speaking terms, and her exhausted body felt as if it was wading through water.</p><p>At the door, she hesitated. What could she say? She still didn\u2019t understand what had happened to her last Saturday, so how could she explain it to the agents?</p> <p>Maybe Master Z had called? But all contact was supposed to go through Rhodes. And she already knew his reaction. Her mouth twisted. When she\u2019d finally reached him late Sunday, he\u2019d completely lost it. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? You\u2019re undercover\u2014un-der-co-ver\u2014or doesn\u2019t that mean anything to you? So he fucked you and you decided to spill everything. What is that\u2014pillow talk?\u201d He\u2019d finished his rant with what she\u2019d expected. \u201cI\u2019m going to have your ass for this.\u201d</p><p>Even before she\u2019d called him, she\u2019d known her career in the FBI was over. Finished. Termini. No one would understand. They\u2019d simply see she\u2019d exposed an ongoing investigation to a whole lot of people. Yeah, serving as a decoy wasn\u2019t her real job; yes, she\u2019d volunteered to do it; but after destroying a covert operation, it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>So. I might as well get this over with and then start seriously job hunting. She tugged her T-shirt down\u2014why dress up to get fired?\u2014straightened her shoulders, and knocked on the door.</p><p>The door opened, and the big agent, Vance Buchanan, let her in. He wore faded jeans, a blue T-shirt, and beard stubble. He looked her over slowly as if assessing her condition. \u201cBad week, eh, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>At the rough sympathy in his voice, tears burned her eyes. She turned her head away and sucked it up. \u201cI\u2019ve had better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. Z gave us a call yesterday.\u201d He pointed toward the L-shaped couch and chairs where Galen waited. \u201cGo sit.\u201d</p><p>As she took a chair across from Galen, Vance took a soda from the small refrigerator, opened it, and set the can on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Okay, confession time. Rhodes had already told them\u2014God, she just bet he\u2019d told them\u2014but she needed to also. \u201cSome of the Shadowlands Masters learned I\u2019m working undercover. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d She started to pick up her drink and realized she couldn\u2019t swallow past the lump in her throat. Instead she folded her hands in her lap and forced herself to meet Galen\u2019s eyes. \u201cI told them. By accident. But it\u2019s still my fault. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop,\u201d Galen said, holding up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand your logic. You have a dom, one experienced enough that Zachary Grayson trusts him with the Shadowlands trainees. He strings you up, drives you straight into subspace, and asks you questions. Why the hell do you think that\u2019s your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and drink your soda.\u201d Galen\u2019s baritone was actually kind.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t blame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve played a brat too long, Renard. What did I tell you to do?\u201d</p><p>Oh hell, that answered one question. The guy was definitely a dom. She picked up the can and took a tiny sip.</p><p>Standing behind the couch, Vance leaned his forearms on the back cushions. \u201cGabrielle, the sole reason we accepted you as a decoy is because you\u2019re submissive. You had no defenses against a determined master like Marcus Atherton.\u201d He fixed her with a level gaze. \u201cAm I clear? We don\u2019t blame you in the least.\u201d</p><p>She let out the breath that she\u2019d held since...oh, since the day Rhodes went ballistic.</p><p>Galen\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cYou figured we\u2019d fire you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed logical.\u201d</p><p>Vance\u2019s blue eyes turned hard. \u201cRhodes is an asshole. He had the contacts to get him assigned to this case and plays the game well enough we can\u2019t justify yanking him off, but do us the courtesy of not thinking we\u2019re complete idiots.\u201d</p><p>A gasp of laughter escaped her, and both men grinned.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Galen leaned forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask you here today to ream you out. Quite the opposite. Gabrielle, are you willing to return to the Shadowlands?\u201d</p><p>That was so far from what she\u2019d expected that her head spun. \u201cI will. You know I will, but Master Marcus\u2014he knows. He knows I\u2019ve lied to him and been faking it all.\u201d</p><p>Vance tilted his head. \u201cPersonally I\u2019d say you only fake about fifty percent. What do you think, Galen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think sixty-forty, with the weight on the sassy side.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open, and then she glared.</p><p>Vance chuckled. \u201cYou win. There\u2019s more brat there than fifty percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not funny. Did you hear what I said?\u201d Gabi crossed her arms over her chest, less to appear confident than to conceal her trembling hands. \u201cMarcus won\u2019t tolerate me coming back, and even if he did, I don\u2019t want to...to do anything with him. Ever.\u201d She\u2019d trusted him, and he\u2019d taken advantage of her. She shook her head and tried to keep her mind on the subject. \u201cBesides, the other Masters know also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Vance said. \u201cZ explained it all. The Masters aren\u2019t stupid, and they understand why we kept your identity secret. It won\u2019t be easy for them now. They\u2019ll have to fight back the need to protect you, not punish you.\u201d</p><p>Galen interjected, \u201cBut they swore to do their best.\u201d The corner of his mouth tipped up. \u201cNot the most reassuring thing in the world for you to hear, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Go back. Be terrified of a kidnapper. Be punished.</p><p>Be with Marcus. Her hands curled into tight balls of dissent. He\u2019d seen her at her most vulnerable and taken advantage of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to a different dom?\u201d Could she bear having someone else in charge of her? She bowed her head, watching her knuckles tighten. I don\u2019t have a choice. She\u2019d woken before dawn covered in sweat from another nightmare about Kim being whipped. Her screams had dug into Gabi\u2019s mind until she could hear them echoing off the walls of her apartment.</p><p>A tap sounded on the door, and she raised her head.</p><p>Galen glanced at his watch. \u201cDamn lawyers are way too punctual.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is your decision, Gabi,\u201d Vance said over his shoulder as he crossed the room. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let you two work out how you want to handle it.\u201d He opened the door.</p><p>Master Marcus stepped in. He glanced around. Then his gaze zeroed in on her like a targeting control in a video game.</p><p>Every blood cell in her body leaped in joy until she remembered what she\u2019d done. What he\u2019d done. The joy fractured and died, leaving her with the bitter taste of betrayal on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d Galen said, rising. He held his hand out. \u201cI\u2019m glad you could make it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGalen.\u201d With his silent grace, Marcus walked over to shake hands, then nodded at Vance before turning his gaze back on Gabi.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes. The lethal blue color hadn\u2019t changed from when it had filled her world like a desert sky. And his voice\u2014soft and deep, so different from the sound he\u2019d made when she\u2019d told him she was FBI. Like he\u2019d been stabbed. She concentrated on picking up her soda gracefully, although from the way her stomach churned, she sure didn\u2019t need a drink.</p><p>Vance huffed a laugh. \u201cTake her for a walk, Marcus, before she turns any greener.\u201d</p><p>Galen said, \u201cShe\u2019s willing to return\u2014got more guts than a lot of so-called agents\u2014so when you\u2019ve worked out how you\u2019ll handle this, come back here so we can finish planning.\u201d</p><p>Go with him? As she realized the agents had cast her to the sharks, she stiffened in disbelief.</p> <p>Marcus pinned her gaze. One shark. With piercing blue eyes. He held his hand out. \u201cCome, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t go anywhere with you.\u201d Back stiff, she rose, heading for the door. She gave the other two men a wounded look.</p><p>\u201cLittle spitfire.\u201d Vance caught her wrist and pulled her to a stop. His eyes were a darker blue than Marcus\u2019s but surprisingly kind. \u201cWe talked with Z, with the other Masters, and with Marcus. All anyone wants is to let you serve as a decoy in the safest, gentlest way we can arrange...and we all agree Marcus is the best choice. Talk to him, Gabi, and if you decide you can\u2019t work with him, we\u2019ll figure out something else.\u201d</p><p>Talk with Marcus. Could she stand it? Did she have a choice? Vance held her gaze until she nodded her surrender.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He set her wrist into Marcus\u2019s hand. Strong fingers closed, trapping her more completely than any restraint.</p><p>The agents had planned for Z to attend this meeting, but Marcus had played the guilt card on them. He might have employed a few courtroom techniques, but he\u2019d told the truth. Their secrecy bullshit had not only given him a rough few weeks, but also led to the fiasco last Saturday. They sure as hell owed him a chance to make it right with Gabrielle. They\u2019d reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that Gabi had the final choice.</p> <p>Marcus had pondered long and hard about today\u2014what to say and where to go so she\u2019d feel comfortable. Obviously nowhere alone with him. So now he guided her out of the lobby toward the beach. On the grounds around the hotel, the palm trees rustled and swayed in the stiffening breeze. Gulls cried as they rode the air currents, diving at the white-capped waves. People were scattered here and there, their towels, blankets, and umbrellas a bright splash of color against the white sand. A child with flaming red hair used a stick to write his name in the wet sand.</p><p>As Marcus guided Gabi onto the sidewalk paralleling the beach, his spirits rose. Damn, he liked seeing her, even if she was under duress. The sea wind ruffled her shaggy hair and brought him her sandalwood scent. With an effort, he put away the memory of how the fragrance deepened, darkened in the tender crease between her hip and thigh.</p><p>Instead he studied her. Shoulders still rigid, walk stiff, the small muscles around her eyes and mouth tense. \u201cGabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her brown eyes wary. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to what you have to say, but just so you know, I don\u2019t want to...to work...with you.\u201d Her mouth twisted bitterly at the word. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>The stab hurt. \u201cI understand.\u201d And she was perfectly justified for her feelings; however, if she stayed enmeshed in the past, she\u2019d not listen to him at all. How could he get her to relax? Got it. He stopped, right in the middle of the sidewalk. After removing his shoes, he stuffed his socks in the toes and rolled up his jeans.</p><p>She stared at him as if she\u2019d never seen bare legs before, and a spurt of humor broke through his guilt. Did she really see him as that stuck in the mud? He tied the laces together, slung his shoes over his shoulder, and nodded toward the wide expanse of beach. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>After eyeing him suspiciously, she said, \u201cFine,\u201d and followed suit, removing her shoes and socks. Although she\u2019d worn a black T-shirt and jeans, her sneakers were blue and her socks a flaming red that matched her toenails. Damn, she made him smile every time he saw her.</p><p>She walked beside him toward the water. The warm sand was deep and soft, the footing a little unsteady. He watched with satisfaction as she gave up hating him and concentrated on avoiding clusters of seaweed, broken shells, and enthusiastic dogs.</p> <p>When they reached the wet sand, flattened into firmness by the waves, he took her hand.</p><p>Startled, she frowned up at him, gave a token tug to see if he\u2019d cooperate, and then shrugged, obviously deciding not to fight about it. She turned her head, staring at the water. \u201cSo talk.\u201d</p><p>He snorted a laugh. \u201cTough little sub, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened, but she didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>He stopped, took her shoes, and dropped both pairs onto the sand. Cupping her cheek with one hand, he used his thumb to tilt her head up. Her stormy eyes met his. \u201cGabrielle, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said cynically. \u201cWhat are you sorry for, anyway? I\u2019m the one who lied.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to admit they had anything between them that he could have damaged. He couldn\u2019t quite read her; too many emotions warred across the face. Defensiveness. Hurt. Anger. Something else. \u201cZ lied too, Gabi. Did either of you have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like this matter at all, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Her brown eyes lightened slightly, and then a crease furrowed her brow. \u201cWhat are you apologizing for?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his other hand, holding her face between his palms. Her cheeks were soft and warm. The sunlight glinted off her long red-blonde eyelashes. \u201cI might not have known about the role you played, but still, the thought of how rough I was on you sits poorly with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The inadvertent slip warmed his heart. \u201cBut what I truly regret\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabi waited for him to gather his words, and actually felt a bit of amusement. Was the fancy lawyer at a loss for the right thing to say? Her humor faded quickly, for his firm hands kept her from retreating and assuming a more comfortable, distant manner. He\u2019d placed them face-to-face and shared his emotions as openly as he demanded the same from her.</p><p>His thumb rubbed over her chin. \u201cI regret the loss of your trust, Gabrielle. I deliberately kept you after closing on Saturday. I could tell you had a reason for all the defiance, and I wanted to discover what it was so we could deal with it.\u201d His lips twisted into a wry smile. \u201cQuestioning you when you couldn\u2019t think was to help, not undermine you. Instead it turned into a betrayal of your trust. I\u2019m sorry, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>He hurt too. The open pain in his eyes crumpled her hard-erected defenses as if she\u2019d constructed them of paper. Somehow he\u2019d gone straight to the heart of her anger. He\u2019d known that she did feel betrayed. Did feel as if he\u2019d taken advantage of her, and she wouldn\u2019t have if she hadn\u2019t trusted him so much. Her breath hitched, and her eyes flooded with tears. Oh hell. She tried to jerk away, choking out, \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, darlin\u2019, that I won\u2019t.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her against his solid chest. His hand pressed her head into the hollow of his shoulder and the comfort...the sheer wonder at being held finished her off. And she cried, sobbing out her pain, even her smoldering anger at the punishments she herself had forced him to mete out. He hurt me and hit me, and he means so much to me...</p><p>He enclosed her in his hard arms, rumbling unintelligible, comforting sounds, and rocked her slowly in his cradle of safety. As the storm of her emotions died down, she managed somehow to find a semblance of control and pull herself together.</p><p>His arms loosened, and he let her go...and she wanted to crawl back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cLittle sub,\u201d he murmured and used his thumbs to wipe the tears from her face.</p><p>\u201cI got your shirt wet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like himself, thick hair windblown, jeans, his cotton shirt rumpled and wet, but his blue eyes hadn\u2019t changed, and neither had the way he studied her. \u201cIt\u2019ll dry. Hopefully you feel better.\u201d</p><p>She felt...hollow, emptied of anger and pain. Her fear hadn\u2019t left, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He frowned, tilted her chin up. \u201cSomething is still wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you.\u201d She shrugged, trying to act nonchalant. \u201cI\u2019m just scared. Nothing new.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The word he said under his breath could never have come from Mr. Conservative, and she stared at him in shock.</p><p>He laughed, his deep, infectious laugh that was almost as startling as hearing him curse. He pulled her hand away from her scar and kissed her fingertips. After picking up the shoes, he put his arm over her shoulder and started walking again.</p><p>As the tide came in, the waves flowed farther up the sand, engulfing and tickling their feet in frothy white water. She smiled. Then the tightness returned to her chest. What would it be like to never be part of any of this again?</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder, breaking into her thoughts. \u201cDo you think less of yourself because you\u2019re afraid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little. Other people manage to do this kind of thing all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some hide in their houses scared to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou learned about violence at an early age and in a particularly ugly way, Gabrielle. But more than that...\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him, and his eyes met hers.</p><p>\u201cYou have a caring personality. You understand people and want to help. That\u2019s different from a soldier\u2019s mind-set. You\u2019re more vulnerable to the damage that evil can create.\u201d His brows drew together. \u201cYou must have studied this in college, and you had counseling. You should know this, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wry smile. \u201cI do. I did. But deliberately setting myself up for\u2014\u201d She halted. She hadn\u2019t planned to mention\u2014</p> <p>\u201cI heard you volunteered because of your friend.\u201d Despite the concerned expression on his face, his gaze held only warm approval. \u201cYou\u2019re a loyal friend, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh came easily, as if her tears had hollowed out room for happier emotions. \u201cNah, I just wanted an excuse to hang out in a BDSM club.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, then cursed as an incoming wave soaked the bottoms of his rolled-up jeans.</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>One second before the next wave hit, he swung her around to reverse their positions. She squeaked as cold water splashed up her calves, soaked the material over her thighs, and ran down her legs, turning her skin to goose bumps. \u201cYou...you scumbag dipwad.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDid you call your dom a name?\u201d</p> <p>She giggled, then protested, \u201cYou\u2019re not my dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I not?\u201d Deliberately, he tossed their shoes onto the dry sand and advanced on her.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d Hands up, she waded farther into the water until it hit her knees and each wave tested her balance.</p><p>He stopped, and his smile faded. \u201cSeriously, Gabi, do you want me to arrange a different dom for you?\u201d</p><p>The thought of losing him actually hurt, like a cruel blow somewhere deep inside. Obviously she\u2019d ventured farther with him than was safe. A wave surged into her, and she staggered on the shifting sand\u2014the footing was definitely unstable. She and Marcus had no solid foundation either, but...for right now, she\u2019d cherish the time with him. Hell, she could end up enslaved or dead before this week ended\u2014might as well take what she wanted from life. \u201cI want you,\u201d she said, then winced. \u201cUh. I still have to behave like a brat.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and heaved a mock sigh of complaint. \u201cYou planning to make this here weekend a nightmare for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d And what a relief he now realized it was an act\u2014well, some of it was an act.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m fixin\u2019 to feel badly every time I punish you.\u201d His face sobered. \u201cI truly will, Gabi. I understand why Galen and Vance demanded secrecy. I don\u2019t think I could have...\u201d He shook his head.</p> <p>He was the kind of dom who would hurt for doing what must be done. \u201cI know. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good then.\u201d He curved his hands around her waist in a hard grip. \u201cHowever, Li\u2019ll brat, I reckon I\u2019m not going to regret this at all.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. This?</p><p>He actually grinned. Then he lifted her and tossed her head over heels into the water.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>When Gabi walked into the Shadowlands that Friday, apprehension crept up her spine. How would the Masters treat her now?</p><p>She spotted Agent Rhodes sitting at the end of the bar and snickered at his glare. Had Vance or Galen taken him down a peg? Or maybe the fact that they hadn\u2019t reprimanded her torqued his jaw. She veered to avoid him and headed for the other end of the bar, where Master Raoul talked with the big bartender.</p><p>\u201cAh, if it isn\u2019t our wayward trainee.\u201d Raoul smiled at her, his dark eyes warm.</p><p>She flushed, remembering how he\u2019d held her...and how rudely she\u2019d behaved afterward. \u201cGood evening, Master Raoul...oh, Master of the Universe,\u201d she amended quickly. Damn these doms for making it so easy to forget her role.</p><p>\u201cMaster of the Universe? That doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\u201d Cullen leaned an arm on his bar and grinned. \u201cSo how do I get greeted, little sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d He was baiting her. Deliberately. She tried to forget that he\u2019d put a ball gag on her for being mouthy and raised her voice so the people seated around the bar could hear her. \u201cYou know how really big guys are always nicknamed Tiny?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for any response, afraid she\u2019d chicken out. \u201cGuess that would make you Master Munchkin, huh?\u201d</p><p>Raoul choked on his beer, sputtering so hard Gabi helpfully slapped him on the shoulders. Several times, although his back felt like a concrete wall.</p><p>Success\u2014now she had two doms glaring at her, and Andrea stood behind Cullen, hands over her mouth, trying to smother her laughter and failing miserably.</p><p>The other reactions around the bar varied. Some of the doms grinned. A few looked displeased, their expressions similar enough to her father\u2019s that she retreated a step as her backbone of oak turned to willow.</p><p>\u201cIs this trainee acting out again?\u201d At the sound of Marcus\u2019s soft drawl, excitement replaced her dread. She started to spin, only to have him yank her back against his body. His hard chest pressing against hers and his unbending strength somehow emptied her mind like someone had opened a drain.</p><p>\u201cImpertinent submissive,\u201d Raoul snapped, and his dark brown eyes turned mean. \u201cNothing new for this one. You\u2019re doing a lousy job of bringing her to heel, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me to heel? Like I\u2019m a dog?\u201d Without thinking, Gabi instinctively yanked away and snapped out, \u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she does need to be brought to heel.\u201d Marcus\u2019s blue eyes chilled. \u201cCullen, do you still have the toys Margery left?\u201d</p><p>Cullen laughed, loud and strong. Her stomach sank. Dammit, she\u2019d only arrived a few minutes ago. A little warm-up would have been nice.</p><p>He rummaged in the shelves under the bar, and she felt a glimmer of hope. Considering how much junk he had stored, maybe he wouldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d He shoved a brown paper sack across the bar to Marcus.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d Master Z strolled up to the bar.</p><p>Oh God, they\u2019re conglomerating. Nooo.</p><p>\u201cAfraid so, Z,\u201d Raoul said, pulling the sack closer. He smiled at her. \u201cLose the clothes, subbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019ve only had this on a half an hour,\u201d she protested without moving. \u201cI like this dress.\u201d</p><p>Marcus lifted her chin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been disrespectful to the doms and disobedient. Since a spanking didn\u2019t work, let\u2019s see if humiliation will incite you to more attractive behavior.\u201d</p><p>The relentless look in his eyes and the controlled power in his voice turned her body into a forge of heat, melting her bones. It took a minute for the meaning of his words to catch up. Wait, wait, wait. Humiliation?</p><p>He pulled her closer and unzipped her skintight, black latex dress. Her skin seemed to yearn toward him, and as if he knew, he slid his fingers under the material and fondled her breasts. He held her gaze as he touched her, rubbing his thumbs in circles over her nipples until the peaks bunched painfully and a tremor of need shook her body.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d he said. \u201cAll warmed up and ready for action.\u201d</p><p>What kind of action? The nipple clamps came to mind, and she tried to take a step back.</p><p>He pulled the dress over her head. \u201cI\u2019ve always preferred my subs naked anyway.\u201d</p><p>His strong hands held her waist firmly, warm against her skin, and she stared up, bathed in the clear blue of his eyes. Every time she looked at him, the world seemed to slip sideways.</p><p>Then she shook her head. Get over it. She saw Raoul pick up her dress and hand it to Cullen. Naked, dammit. Even worse, she had a hunch they\u2019d barely started.</p><p>Marcus took a dog collar off the bar and buckled it around her neck. The controlled heat in his eyes pinned her far more securely than any restraint. Something shook deep inside, like an earthquake so far below the surface that nothing moves above.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing you in a collar,\u201d he said softly. His fingers checked the fit, tracing along the edge of the leather. Arousal bloomed in her body as if he\u2019d touched her pussy instead, and he smiled into her eyes and ran his fingers the other direction.</p><p>He slid fur mittens over her hands, fastening small buckles, which would prevent her from removing them unless she used her teeth. Furry mittens. A collar. Her stomach tightened as she began to suspect what they planned. \u201cBite me.\u201d She\u2019d made a really poor choice of words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcus took a hair comb from the bag, displayed the brown, furry ovals hanging from each side, and slid it into her hair. He adjusted it so the furry...ears...dangled against her cheeks.</p><p>She stared at him in horror\u2014they actually planned to dress her up like a dog. A floppy-eared dog. Fury rolled through her. Spanking was one thing, this was... \u201cYou sorry-ass bastard, you are not going to do this!\u201d</p><p>She heard laughter around her. Then Master Marcus yanked her off her feet and flattened her on the bar. Her bare stomach lay on the cool, polished wood, and her legs dangled over the side. He leaned against the backs of her thighs, immovable and heavy, and patted her bottom. \u201cYou might could be less sassy, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Cullen tossed Marcus something, and she heard paper tear. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine size,\u201d Marcus said approvingly.</p> <p>Oh no. Oh God. The last time he\u2019d set her in this position\u2014</p><p>\u201cRaoul, if you would?\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Raoul\u2019s hard hands pulled the cheeks of her bottom apart. Cold liquid dripped into the crack.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t,\u201d she yelled, struggling to pull away.</p><p>The weight on her legs increased. Something touched her anus. Marcus made a little circle around the rim with the slick lube, and nerves jolted awake and fired straight to her pussy. \u201cEasy, sugar. Push back so it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bastard, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A slap across her bottom silenced her. \u201cI do believe you\u2019re trying my patience, sugar.\u201d Without mercy, Marcus slowly pushed the anal plug in. Bigger than before, burning as it stretched her, and she moaned and squirmed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t escape. And then, with the feel of Marcus\u2019s body pinning her to the bar, his fingers warm between her ass checks, and his determined invasion of even her most private place, she surrendered completely. It was as if his use of that area reinforced his rights over her as effectively as putting a collar on her. As her will to fight disappeared, she looked over her shoulder at him. He was watching her intently. When her yielding gaze met his, his eyes fired with possessiveness.</p><p>For long moments, he held her transfixed until he finally looked away, breaking the spell.</p><p>She hauled in a shuddering breath, recalled to her surroundings. She realized she was wet between her legs from more than the lubricant, and her body craved, screamed for him to touch her there. To take her. In front of everyone? Oh God, was she insane? I\u2019m on a bar. Exposed. How could this possibly turn her on? Unable to bear the humiliation, she started to struggle again.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s hands tightened.</p> <p>Then it was in; the pain stopped. She felt a slight tug at the plug that made her jerk. Looking over her shoulder, she saw Raoul holding a long fuzzy...tail.</p><p>The damn thing had a tail attached. I\u2019m going to kill them. Kill them all.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Master Z?\u201d Marcus asked politely, wiggling the plug, undoubtedly to watch her wiggle.</p><p>She did.</p><p>\u201cShe does make a pretty puppy, Master Marcus,\u201d Z said, amusement clear in his smooth, deep voice. Damn you, Z.</p><p>\u201cYes, she does.\u201d Marcus patted her bottom and ordered, \u201cOpen for me, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to, not here, but oh she wanted his hands on her. She spread her thighs and gasped as he set his hand against her pussy. \u201cA nice wet start,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s make this more fun for you.\u201d He slid his fingers between her folds and over her clit, deliberately arousing her until her sex ached with need, until her mind emptied of anything except his touch.</p><p>He patted her bottom. \u201cNow kneel for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the bar.\u201d He lifted and steadied her as she knelt on the polished wood. Her butt rested on her heels, and the plug shifted every time she did, keeping her nerves far too awake. Her pussy throbbed. As she stared at the grinning faces around the bar, the fake ears flapped against her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLie down, puppy.\u201d Marcus patted the wood.</p><p>She considered refusing, but God knew what he\u2019d come up with next. And she had done enough bucking orders for the moment. She bent over, resting her forearms in front of her knees. She stared down at the wood of the bar. Cullen liked to polish it, she remembered, seeing her reflection in the glossy finish. And now they\u2019d put her on top of it, naked. Humiliation seemed somehow worse than getting walloped. And it was lonely. Really lonely.</p><p>Marcus pulled her sideways to the edge of the bar until her shoulder rested against his. The warmth of his body hardly registered, dropping into the big well of unhappiness inside her. \u201cLook at me, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>With an exasperated sound, he turned toward her, setting his hands on each side of her face.</p><p>She looked up at his strong jaw, his unsmiling mouth, intent eyes.</p><p>\u201cLi\u2019ll sub.\u201d He stroked her hair, tugged on one floppy ear. His voice dropped low. \u201cSweetheart, Galen and Vance wanted at least one punishment tonight that involves the other doms and keeps you front and center. This is what I came up with. I\u2019d hoped a few insults from Raoul would get you riled up, but you only needed one.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d set it up? \u201cYou want to humiliate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI chose the scene for several reasons, Gabi. For one, you\u2019ll have the attention of pretty much the whole bar. For two...\u201d His lips tightened, and his eyes darkened as if clouds had covered a summer sky. \u201cNone of us can bear to beat on you, Darlin\u2019. Not hard enough to make it realistic.\u201d</p><p>The knot in her stomach loosened slightly. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe third reason...\u201d He ran his knuckles gently over her cheek, and she felt the scrape of his scars and calluses. \u201cYou wanted to find out if you could handle more than one man touching you. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d At his house. She had wondered what might trigger a flashback. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this way, I can watch and control what happens and also make it clear there\u2019s nothing going on between us.\u201d</p><p>Nothing between us. The words made her heart squeeze. She pushed the ragged sense of loss aside. Galen and Vance had said Marcus might have an occasional scene with her, but not every scene. He was just following orders. And trying to fullfill her wishes. \u201cI see. Okay.\u201d She hauled in a breath. \u201cI can handle the embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you can handle just about anything,\u201d he murmured, and the respect in his voice almost undid her right then and there. \u201cYour safe word is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can use yellow if you\u2019re getting a little overwhelmed and need a break but still want to continue.\u201d A muscle in his jaw flexed. \u201cYou will use your safe words, Gabrielle, if it gets to be too much. No heroics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d He cared. The warmth running through her wasn\u2019t arousal this time.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He brushed a kiss over her lips. \u201cKneel up.\u201d</p><p>She straightened back into a normal kneeling position. He gave her a nod and a loud order. \u201cPuppy. Stay.\u201d</p><p>He left her sitting on top of the bar, a floppy-eared dog, and heat rose in her face as she realized she\u2019d become the center of attention for the entire bar. But instead of derision, she heard approving murmurs, compliments on her breasts, her ass, how sexy she looked. Although the doms sounded amused, it was a friendly amusement, and the sting of humiliation disappeared.</p><p>As Marcus talked to Master Z, Master Cullen wandered closer, carrying the makings for a drink. The huge bartender set everything on the counter a few feet from her, gave her a wink, and started mixing the ingredients.</p><p>If she was a puppy, then he was a guard dog. Marcus left nothing to chance.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d Marcus raised his voice for the bar area, not loud enough to disturb the scenes around the perimeter of the room. \u201cThis Li\u2019ll Irish setter puppy is in obedience school. She can growl, whine, whimper, or yelp. Nothing else.\u201d His eyes met hers, checking that she understood.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Gabi or Puppy, nothing else. Anyone using derogatory language to my puppy will be escorted from the bar.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t taking any chances with them saying her trigger words. The fact that he\u2019d remembered, that he cared felt...good.</p><p>One of the doms close to her said sarcastically, \u201cAnd will the fancy suit do the escorting if they don\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><p>An older dom snorted. \u201cAtherton uses the word escort loosely. The last time someone messed with a trainee, he threw the guy across the bar. Strolled over, waited for the idiot to stand up, punched his lights out, and dragged him by his jacket collar out of the place. Escorted him, my ass. Didn\u2019t even wrinkle that fancy suit.\u201d He took a sip of his beer and added, \u201cAtherton is invariably polite, but nobody in their right mind fucks with his trainees.\u201d</p><p>Marcus waited until the noise diminished. \u201cShe\u2019s going to make a circle of the bar, showing off the commands she has learned. Since she\u2019s a little slow, her only commands are: come, sit, lie, stand, and stay. Please pet her if she\u2019s a good puppy; swat her hind end if she disobeys.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My God. Surely he meant for her to walk around the bar...not crawl on it. Didn\u2019t he? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled. \u201cI do mean to say that in this case, come means crawl over here, not have an orgasm for me.\u201d As laughter ran about the bar, he edged between two seated men, gave her a level look, and snapped his fingers. \u201cPuppy, come.\u201d</p><p>He meant for her to crawl. She stared at him and shook her head. No. Right this minute, her orders to act defiant merged completely with her inclination. No way. And since she sat on her bottom, no one would be...</p><p>Someone swatted her upper thigh hard enough to sting. \u201cOw!\u201d She jerked around.</p><p>Master Dan had pushed between a couple of the men. \u201cGrowl, whine, whimper, or yelp,\u201d he reminded her and slapped her thigh again, lighter this time.</p> <p>Goddammit. She lifted her upper lip and snarled at him. I hate you, and if you hit me one more time, I\u2019ll bite you.</p><p>Amusement lit in his brown eyes, and he grinned. She stared in shock. Stone Face was human?</p><p>\u201cGo, sweetie,\u201d he said softly and jerked his head.</p><p>Crawl. She gave a long, loud sigh and started down the bar. The anal plug sent little nerves pinging inside her, and the fluffy tail brushed against the back of her thighs with each movement.</p><p>Why did Master Z have such a big bar? Doms reached out and patted her butt. One raised his voice, a sound like a gravel truck on a bad day. \u201cPuppy, lie down.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced over. Master Nolan. She hesitated. Marcus had said come. Only he\u2019d disappeared. Her hesitation earned her a light swat on the rear and a firmer, \u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>She crouched, arms resting on the wood.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he said. He ran his hand down her bare back, her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree, gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>Other hands reached out, and she jerked as they touched her.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Gabi,\u201d his rough voice murmured, his hand wrapping around her arm, less to restrain her than to support her. Shaking inside, she stared at him, saw the way he studied her with dark, dark eyes, and she knew Marcus had explained the purpose for the puppy play. As a gray-haired dom patted her bottom and another stroked her ribs, she found her breathing had steadied. She wasn\u2019t alone here.</p><p>Nolan gave her an approving smile and stepped away.</p> <p>Down the bar, Master Raoul leaned forward. \u201cCome, Puppy.\u201d</p><p>She almost smiled. So Marcus had hedged his bet, planting the Masters both to help her and to demonstrate to the doms what he\u2019d allow. Her heart lightened, and despite the way the ears flopped against her face and the weird tail brushed her thighs, she did a bouncy crawl down the bar to Raoul.</p><p>His teeth flashed white in the dark skin. \u201cPretty puppy. Sit.\u201d</p><p>She planted her butt on her heels and jumped when it pushed the plug deeper. This was just too weird. Her heart still hammered from fear, her face burned from embarrassment, and yet she was wet between the legs. Aroused? God help me. She settled more carefully into position.</p><p>\u201cBueno,\u201d Raoul said and ran his hand down her arm, glancing at the men next to him. \u201cPet the puppy and show her she\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he said.</p><p>Hands seemed to come from everywhere, stroking her bottom, her thighs, her back.</p><p>Then Raoul, with a firm grip on her arm, cupped her breast.</p><p>She jerked and whined.</p> <p>\u201cShhh, Puppy,\u201d he said, and his eyes held the same watchful intelligence as Nolan\u2019s as he stroked her breasts, the calluses on his fingers scraping lightly over her nipples. The other men kept touching her. Too many hands.</p><p>She whimpered, her fingers clenching together, fear rising inside her like the tide.</p><p>\u201cGabi, look up,\u201d Raoul said in a low voice.</p><p>When she turned to him, he tilted his head to the right.</p><p>Several feet farther down, Master Marcus stood at the bar. His eyes held blue fire, his gaze almost palpable, silently reassuring her that nothing horrible would happen.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t left her. He\u2019d keep her safe. She relaxed.</p><p>He smiled, and then his gaze ran over her, lingering on her breasts, her slightly open thighs, before returning to her face. The heat in his eyes seared her.</p><p>God, she wanted him.</p><p>He glanced at Raoul and nodded. As Raoul started stroking her breasts again, Marcus watched, his attention increasing her awareness of how Raoul\u2019s broad fingers pinched her nipples, of someone tugging her tail, another massaging her bottom. Excitement rose inside her. Under his gaze, everything seemed to change as if each man\u2019s hands were his...as if it was him touching her.</p><p>Raoul chuckled, pulling her attention to him. \u201cThat\u2019s much better. Stand, Puppy.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts swung, swollen and heavy, as she took the crawl stance. At the far end of the bar, Master Sam snapped his fingers. \u201cCome here, Puppy.\u201d</p><p>She set off down the bar. Halfway there, she felt a hard pinch on her thigh and yelped in surprise and pain.</p><p>Rhodes grinned at her nastily\u2014and then Cullen grabbed the agent\u2019s hand and slammed it onto the bar. \u201cSince you can\u2019t follow instructions, I suggest you step away from the bar,\u201d Cullen growled. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes scrambled away so fast he tripped on the bar stool and almost fell.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Pup.\u201d Cullen leaned an arm on the bar and smiled at Gabi.</p><p>Giving him a grateful look, she licked his knuckles and wiggled her butt hard enough to make her tail swing.</p><p>His laughter should have shaken the bar. He pointed to the end of the bar. \u201cKeep going, Pup. You don\u2019t want to piss off Master Sam.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, she headed down the bar, actually enjoying the little pats from the various doms, the murmured, \u201cPretty puppy.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s adorable.\u201d \u201cIs Marcus letting her scene yet?\u201d</p><p>Maybe this punishment wasn\u2019t so bad after all.</p><p>When she reached Master Sam, he pointed to the bar. \u201cSit, Pup, and stay.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him and had a thought. She needed to act up again, but Marcus said the Masters felt bad about punishing her. Master Sam was a sadist, so he\u2019d do okay with it, right? Instead of sitting, she growled and bit his wrist. Very, very gently, but a definite bite. He gave a startled shout and yanked his hand away. \u201cYou little\u2014\u201d He caught himself and snapped, \u201cBad puppy.\u201d</p><p>One look at his menacing expression and she decided only a complete idiot would bite a sadist. She scrambled past him as fast as her hands and knees could manage.</p><p>He grabbed her ankle, pulling her mercilessly back down the bar. She whined.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again.\u201d His growl came out a lot lower than hers as he yanked her to the edge of the bar. He put his right arm under her pelvis, holding her butt up, and gripped her thigh. She had a second to realize how he\u2019d secured her, and then his hand hit her bottom. Hard.</p><p>She managed to change her scream into a yelp. Three brutal swats and her bottom burned with pain. One more and her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>He released her and snapped, \u201cNow sit, dammit.\u201d</p><p>She started to, until her tender ass cheeks touched her heels, and she almost didn\u2019t. Very carefully she lowered her butt. Hopefully the bad guy had seen her wonderful defiance and punishment so it wouldn\u2019t be wasted. That had really, really hurt.</p><p>He nodded, his eyes still icy. \u201cNo petting for you. You don\u2019t deserve any.\u201d</p><p>The doms around him made sounds of disappointment. Sam stared at her for a minute, then leaned forward and fisted her hair. She cringed when he bent forward, but he whispered in her ear, his voice a rasp, \u201cIt so happens that I only like hurting people who want the pain. I didn\u2019t enjoy that, girl.\u201d</p><p>When he let go, she saw the tense muscles in his cheeks. He\u2019d meant it. Oh hell. Guilt stabbed deep inside her. Weren\u2019t doms supposed to be tougher than this? She gave him an apologetic whine and pawed his hand with her furry mitten.</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up, and his eyes lightened a little. \u201cOff you go, pup, and behave.\u201d</p><p>Holt called her down the bar next, and he simply gave her a command and kept her long enough for everyone to pet her. Then she went to an older dom with gray peppering his hair. Between them, she watched for Marcus. He moved from place to place, staying in front of her, staying within sight. And his smoldering gaze transformed each dom\u2019s touch to something erotic. She grew increasingly wet. Aroused.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>As she neared the end and veered around some glasses, she heard: \u201cLi\u2019ll puppy.\u201d A baritone with a southern accent like warm sunshine. Marcus.</p><p>Standing at the end of the bar, he snapped his fingers. \u201cCome here, Puppy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Relief washed over her, followed by a wave of excitement. She crawled to him and whined, pawing at his arm with one mittened hand.</p><p>Cupping her face, he regarded her for a long moment. The pad of his thumb traced her lower lip. \u201cAlmost over, sugar,\u201d he murmured for her ears only, \u201cthen you\u2019ll get a break. Are you up to playing a brat in a threesome?\u201d</p><p>She cringed. Strangers taking her. Two strangers. Her heart sank.</p><p>He must have seen, for the sun lines beside his eyes deepened. \u201cWith me, darlin\u2019. And Raoul. You did request it.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. Marcus and Raoul? She inhaled sharply, need and uncertainly mingling inside her. Taking refuge in her act, she barked a couple of times. Then bit his hand.</p><p>His uncontrolled bellow of laughter sent chills all the way down her spine and had her lips curving up. Dammit. No smiling. I\u2019m a brat. When he reached for her, she grabbed the sleeve of his suit in her teeth and shook her head, growling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Planting her mittened hands, she tugged. Serve him right if she put holes in his suit.</p><p>\u201cBad puppy.\u201d He swatted her sore bottom, pulling his sleeve away when she yelped. Her butt started burning all over again. She growled at him.</p><p>He chuckled, picked her up, and slung her over his shoulder, knocking the air right out of her. He anchored her with one hand...and the other fondled her sore bottom.</p><p>When she whined, he laughed. \u201cI like seeing you all pink-assed, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He set her down on a long wooden coffee table beside his already open toy bag. \u201cStay, Puppy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, man. She gave him an uncertain look, then waited on hands and knees. Me. With two men. Her heart rate increased. When boots appeared in her line of vision, she lifted her head to see Raoul.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cAwfully sad-looking little puppy you have here, Marcus.\u201d A big hand stroked her hair. \u201cLooks pretty used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll look even worse in another minute,\u201d Marcus said, his voice louder than normal again. \u201cThe Li\u2019ll pup bit me.\u201d His own way of helping, she realized, making sure everyone knew she was being punished.</p><p>Raoul choked on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI believe puppies like to lick everything in sight,\u201d Marcus said, amusement clear in his voice. \u201cMaster Raoul, would you give her something to lick, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Raoul said.</p><p>Lick? Oh God. A little stunned, she watched him open his leathers. His cock was hard, long, the same darkness as his skin, with a mushroom tip tending toward purple and a slight bend to the left. He fisted it. When she stared at him, he grinned, his teeth white in the swarthy face. \u201cCome, Puppy, let\u2019s see if you\u2019re as good as I\u2019ve heard. No biting,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She tensed and prepared to obey. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth.</p><p>Nothing. She looked up. He waited with a patient expression. He wouldn\u2019t push her into something she wasn\u2019t ready for.</p><p>But Galen said the kidnapped women had participated in public sex. She needed to do this.</p><p>And...she\u2019d asked Marcus for it. Uncertain or not, excitement bubbled inside her. A threesome. God.</p><p>At least Marcus had given her someone she liked. She remembered how patient Raoul had been in her apartment, cuddling her until she\u2019d stopped shaking. Okay. Here goes nothing. She carefully licked up his cock, tonguing the fat veins.</p><p>\u201cVery good, querida,\u201d he said softly. He pulled a condom from his pocket and sheathed himself. \u201cMaster Sam mentioned you like orange.\u201d</p><p>She snorted a laugh as he put his cock between her lips and she tasted the citrus. These guys. He eased farther into her mouth. She started to rise up, wanting to use her hands, and heard from behind her, \u201cNice puppies don\u2019t jump on people. Stay on all fours, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. Raoul set a hand behind her head and started thrusting. \u201cTighten your lips, Gabrielle,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand use your tongue.\u201d</p><p>She did her best, trying not to get intimidated, but... What if he shoves it down my throat? Then she noticed he still had his hand around the base of his cock. It would keep him from pushing too far, she realized. Relief filled her. I can do this. Using her tongue and lips, she did her best to pay him back, even as excitement rose in her.</p> <p>And all the time she felt the heat of Marcus\u2019s gaze. His hands massaged her bottom, making her insides melt.</p><p>Raoul\u2019s hand fisted in her hair.</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s very nice, Puppy,\u201d he growled in a low voice.</p><p>After a bit, Marcus set something on her low back. She tried to turn, but Raoul\u2019s grip in her hair kept her in place. The rhythm of his cock thrusting\u2014the knowledge Marcus planned to take her from the rear\u2014started a burning low in her belly.</p><p>Marcus ran his fingers between her legs, sliding easily in her very wet folds, and he made a satisfied, \u201cMmmph.\u201d A condom wrapper rustled, then he ruthlessly separated her thighs, opening her.</p><p>She tensed and moaned around the cock in her mouth.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s cockhead bumped against her entrance, making her jolt. Her fingers curled inside the mittens. Please.</p><p>He steadily pushed inside her. Oh God. His thick shaft stretched her swollen tissues, glided past the anal plug, tugged at the folds around her engorged clit.</p><p>She\u2019d been so excited for so long... Her mouth full, her pussy full, held in place at each end, and it was too, too much. Everything inside her coiled tight, tighter, and then snapped in a wholly unexpected, long, rolling orgasm.</p><p>\u201cBueno,\u201d Raoul murmured.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good Li\u2019ll pup.\u201d Marcus pushed farther into her. As he tilted her ass higher in the air, she realized it let him go deeper. Too deep.</p><p>She whined, his size uncomfortable and so, so erotic.</p><p>\u201cYour puppy sounds a little upset,\u201d Raoul remarked. He caressed her hair and plunged in far enough to touch the back of her throat as if to remind her she had a cock at each end.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s set her to yipping instead,\u201d Marcus said. He felt huge inside her, filling her completely. And then he tugged on her tail, wiggling the anal plug and shocking awake the nerves in her backside. She couldn\u2019t keep from moaning.</p><p>Raoul laughed, thrusting rhythmically into her mouth, and she accepted helplessly, wanting Marcus to do the same. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear a yip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will.\u201d Marcus\u2019s hands closed on her hips in an unyielding grip. He withdrew slightly, then thrust into her again, steadily increasing his pace. It felt good\u2014so good to have him inside her.</p><p>She concentrated on Raoul for a bit, sucking and licking, tightening her lips around his cock. He murmured something in Spanish and increased his speed until he was pistoning into her mouth. With a low groan, he came, the jerks of his cock a kind of reward, his hand clenched in her hair somehow sexy as hell.</p><p>Marcus had given her, and he\u2019d taken her.</p><p>When Raoul stepped back, Marcus started to thrust hard and fast. She pushed back against him, keeping his rhythm, pleased that she\u2019d already come and could concentrate fully on him.</p><p>Marcus lifted the thing he\u2019d set on her back, and a second later, it buzzed. A vibrator. Oh man.</p><p>Rrr-rrr-rrrrrrr, rrr-rrr-rrrrrrr sounded in surges of steadily increasing vibrations. Marcus reached around her and set the vibrator against her clit.</p><p>\u201cAaah!\u201d Her yelp made him chuckle, the bastard.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a yip,\u201d he said to Raoul.</p><p>Gabi dropped her head as need started to burn inside her again. As her concentration fragmented, she realized it was another way Marcus took control from her. She couldn\u2019t think, could only move as he dictated, take what he gave her.</p><p>Between Marcus\u2019s cock and the anal plug, she felt too full. Too stretched. The vibe pulsed against her clit, and the increasing waves demanded a response. Her clit engorged, the skin tightening over the swelling tissues. Almost there...</p><p>But before her clit hardened enough to send her over, he moved the vibe, rocking it up to press on the hood of her clit, then rolling it to one side and the other. In between, he\u2019d hammer into her, his cock a tool he used to command her submission.</p><p>She wanted to curse him. Each time she neared the peak, he put the vibrator somewhere else. Sam wasn\u2019t the sadist, dammit; Marcus was. As he kept it up, her labia swelled, her flesh burned. Everything he did tensed her insides until she felt like an overstretched rubber band.</p><p>Each thrust buried him to the hilt, and the vibrator on her clit sent electricity shooting through her veins, sizzling and burning away every thought in her head except the way he felt inside her\u2014and the uncontrollable beginning of her climax. She moaned, her legs shaking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my puppy,\u201d he drawled. She felt the vibrator move...and come to rest directly on top of her swollen, sensitive clit. \u201cCome for me now, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooooh.\u201d The rubber band of her climax broke with a hard snap, and then she was coming, wave after wave of exquisitely brutal pleasure. Her spasming vagina rebounded around his cock, bounced off the anal plug, and sent her into more spasms until her whole body shook. Her arms collapsed, and her weight landed on her forearms.</p><p>The vibrator dropped to the table. Before she could slide completely down in a boneless heap, Marcus closed his hands on her hips, pulling her ass upward, yanking her back onto his cock. And then he pounded into her, short hard strokes, finishing with one so deep that she felt impaled. As his cock jerked with his climax against her cervix, her body spasmed again.</p><p>Marcus bowed his head, sucking in air, still buried inside her as the inner walls of her cunt rippled around his cock in the most intimate caress known to man. She came more beautifully and more wholeheartedly than any woman he\u2019d known. He\u2019d never felt like this before, as if when she took him inside her, she accepted all of who he was.</p><p>He\u2019d worried that she\u2019d never trust him again. Instead, as she fought her fears on the bar top, she\u2019d used him as her anchor, trusting him to keep her safe. The feeling she\u2019d roused in him with her faith in his protection had been better than any climax.</p><p>With a sigh of satisfaction, he bent to kiss up the delicate ridge of her spine, across her vulnerable nape, to the sweet curve of her shoulder. During the puppy play, knowing his presence turned her fear to excitement had left him harder than an iron bar. But watching other men touch her had created an undeniable need to take her, to mark her as his own. Territorial? Damn right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He still gripped her hips, soft hips with a beautifully rounded ass. It jiggled as she walked, enticing a man with the urge to grab and plunge balls-deep. He uncurled his fingers. She\u2019d have some bruises there on her fair skin, more marks to add to the pretty red handprints on her ass. He ran his hand over the redness, enjoyed the resulting wiggle and squeak...and the way her pussy clenched around him.</p><p>Unfortunately he couldn\u2019t stay here forever, tempting as it was. With a feeling of loss, he pulled out, removing the anal plug at the same time, smiling at the way her back arched in response to the sudden sensations. She started to slump, and he put an arm under her waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold her for you, my friend,\u201d Raoul said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d When Marcus stepped back, Raoul swung her up into his arms, waiting patiently.</p><p>Marcus disposed of the plug and condom and fastened his slacks, then grabbed a subbie blanket from the stack near the wall. After wrapping the blanket around her, he took her from Raoul.</p><p>Her mouth was swollen and pink, her eyes glazed. Droopy dog ears flopped on her flushed cheeks. \u201cYou are so cute,\u201d Marcus said under his breath.</p><p>Raoul grinned at him in agreement, slapped him on the shoulder, and left.</p><p>Marcus settled into a chair with the little sub against his chest. She glanced up, focused on his face for a second, then, obviously content, lay her head back down.</p><p>\u201cMaster Marcus.\u201d Andrea stood in front of him. \u201cCullen said your puppy needed water, and you might too after all your hard work.\u201d</p><p>Marcus lifted his eyebrows. \u201cWho said?\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cDios, you\u2019re fussy. Master Cullen said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Open the bottles for me, please, and set one on the coffee table.\u201d</p><p>She did and handed him the other bottle.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sugar, and please thank your dom for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d She grinned at him and walked quickly away before he could reprimand her again. He shook his head. Andrea was a beautiful woman, but he\u2019d never envied Cullen her sassy mouth. And now look what he had: a little sub who outdid Andrea in brattiness without even trying. He knew damn well Gabi didn\u2019t make up all the defiance\u2014a hell of a lot of it was just her nature.</p><p>He kissed the top of her nose and chuckled when she frowned up at him. \u201cMaking me crawl on the bar was a very mean punishment, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to smile but couldn\u2019t help it. She had the satiated look of a woman who has come and come hard, and she still found the energy to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cIt was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He nuzzled her cheek, enjoying the playful fragrances of rose and sandalwood mingling with the scent of her arousal. \u201cHow much did it bother you to have so many men touching you?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, stiffening slightly.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. Look at me, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>Big vulnerable brown eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt scared me at first, but you\u2014When you watched me, I felt safe. And I saw that you wanted me to enjoy it, and somehow then I did. Thank you.\u201d The gratitude and warmth in her gaze made him feel as if he\u2019d grown another foot in height.</p> <p>\u201cAnd with Raoul? Did you like the threesome?\u201d He kept his tone easy, knowing if she really wanted multiple men, he\u2019d try to manage it for her. Somehow. His jaw tightened. He\u2019d wanted to break Raoul\u2019s neck for touching her. My sub.</p><p>A line formed between her brows. \u201cI like Raoul and having you both excited me, but mostly because of you. Knowing you were watching, and when you took me, all I could think about was you inside me.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m glad I tried it, but I\u2019d just as soon not do it again.\u201d</p><p>Again. She had only one more day at the club. Did she even remember? He pushed the thought away. \u201cAnd playing puppy?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cI rather like biting and growling. Especially biting.\u201d</p><p>Brat. \u201cOnce you got started, you seemed to enjoy yourself. We did too, watching you heat up from being petted, seeing your breasts swing and your tail swish. I do believe the entire bar cheered when you screamed a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>Red rolled up into her already pink cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou come beautifully, sugar, and it\u2019s a pleasure to watch. I\u2019m sure the doms enjoyed knowing they helped you get there.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and obviously couldn\u2019t figure out what to say, settling for a \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can put your clothes back on. I\u2019m being generous, Darlin\u2019, so you\u2019d best thank me. I\u2019ll take myself a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He got his reward in a long, lingering kiss, one that made him remember how much fun simply kissing a woman could be. Especially this woman.</p><p>Most amusing. The spotter for the Harvest Association observed the ending of the puppy play and shook his head. The sub made an excellent dog. He diverted himself for a few minutes wondering how she\u2019d react to pony play. To wearing a bridle and harness and a long tail attached to an oversize anal plug that would make her scream as it went in.</p><p>Perhaps pulling a cart.</p><p>He did enjoy whipping ponies to a faster speed, watching how their muscles contracted with strain and sweat poured off their naked bodies.</p><p>Glancing over at Gabrielle, the newest addition to the Association list, he smiled.</p><p>A couple of hours later, Gabi admitted she was having fun. Every dom in the place treated her like their pet now. She received a lot of \u201chere, little puppy\u201d calls from the doms who wanted drinks. She sassed them mildly and saved her good insults for the Masters.</p><p>Her feet hurt though, almost worse than her bottom. The trainees were all working harder. Z said Sally had gone to visit her family. That had been a rather sudden vacation, Gabi thought, but it eased her mind. Sally fit the profile of the kidnapped victims perfectly.</p><p>A thought struck her, and her eyes narrowed. Had someone whose name started with Z made sure one potential target got out of range? Oh, he damn well had; she knew it. Grinning, Gabi picked up the tray of drinks from the bar.</p><p>As Gabi checked to see if anyone needed a drink, her heart missed a beat. Marcus stood by the St. Andrew\u2019s cross, talking to that blonde, the one who always came on to him. His girlfriend, Celine, Sally had said, although it seemed strange that Marcus would have a lover and still screw around with other women. Then again, Gabi didn\u2019t have much experience with people in the BDSM lifestyle. Maybe everything Marcus had done with her was just considered part of the master of the trainees job. Nothing special. Nothing to threaten a girlfriend.</p><p>The woman was beautiful, damn her, like a glowing version of Marcus, with golden blonde hair, light blue eyes, and a dark tan. Tall and slender. Jealousy seared Gabi\u2019s veins as if they flowed with acid instead of blood.</p><p>The woman knelt, as gracefully as a ballet dancer. Perfect manicure and pedicure, perfectly styled hair, perfect makeup. She wore what looked like a custom-fitted leather corset. So she was rich too. She and Marcus looked...right...together.</p><p>Marcus said something to the woman. She bowed her head and kissed his shoe, her golden hair spilling prettily over her back. The way she gazed at him in adoration made Gabi\u2019s teeth clench hard.</p><p>Leave him alone, you piece of perfect. He\u2019s mine. Gabi blinked and took a step away from the scene area. Then another.</p><p>He\u2019s not mine. What am I thinking? And yet...she\u2019d definitely headed herself right down that path. Not smart, Gabi. Nothing would last past this weekend. He\u2019d agreed to work with her as his trainee. Nothing more.</p><p>Gabi bit her lip. The pull toward him felt like a riptide, impossible to escape. I want more.</p><p>The blonde picked up a flogger from the floor and held it up to him, waggling her butt in invitation. Gabi couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. After last Saturday\u2014with Marcus\u2014she now knew exactly how intimate a flogging could be. I can\u2019t watch this.</p><p>Turning her back on them, she took her tray to the bar, depression settling around her shoulders like a black cloak.</p><p>And when Cullen spoke, she sassed him so bad he tossed her on the bar top and walloped her a few times with his bare hand.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make her feel better, but at least she wasn\u2019t watching something that made her chest hurt.</p><p>Exasperated, Marcus frowned at the woman kneeling at his feet. Even though he hadn\u2019t dated her in a couple of months, she still clung to him like kudzu. He\u2019d scened with her occasionally when she\u2019d begged\u2014mild flogging, no sex, no real emotion. Not that she complained. She actually preferred lightweight scenes, didn\u2019t like her boundaries pushed, didn\u2019t want a significant connection.</p><p>I do. Even before he\u2019d met Gabi, he\u2019d known he needed more. And now, having made love with her and connecting with her on so many levels, he\u2019d never settle for less.</p><p>He studied Celine for a second. She hadn\u2019t taken his hints. Then again, she wasn\u2019t a perceptive woman. When they\u2019d first met, she\u2019d delighted him with her apparent sweetness, her graceful submissiveness. Now her behavior felt cloying, for her submission was all on the surface, not soul-deep.</p><p>She wanted him to do a scene with her.</p><p>Marcus sighed. Galen and Vance had made it clear Gabi should appear uncommitted. She must play with various doms\u2014and they\u2019d encouraged him to do the same. Dammit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After setting up the puppy play punishment, he\u2019d steeled himself to watch her fuck another man\u2014or two men if she\u2019d wanted the threesome. But when she\u2019d almost panicked and never taken her eyes off him, he\u2019d known she wouldn\u2019t willingly have sex with someone else.</p><p>He felt the same. And yet he really should reinforce he wasn\u2019t involved with Gabi and wouldn\u2019t notice if she disappeared.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cPlease do a scene with me, Master,\u201d Celine repeated, making him grimace.</p> <p>She knew full well that calling him Master rather than Master Marcus implied that he owned her, and if she thought that was an enticement, she didn\u2019t understand him at all. Master meant commitment. To a submissive. To a woman. And love...love would be in there too. \u201cI\u2019m not your master. Use my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I give you pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt her by being blunt, but apparently he\u2019d made a mistake. \u201cCeline, you\u2019re a lovely woman, but I don\u2019t feel about you the way I should for a girlfriend or a submissive.\u201d</p><p>The muscles of her face tautened until her cheekbones turned white. \u201cI\u2019m perfect for you, Marcus. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t scene with you again.\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you like me to introduce you to some doms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d She stayed on her knees as if she expected him to change his mind. She was stubborn, he\u2019d give her that.</p><p>\u201cI hope you find a good master. Take care of yourself, sugar.\u201d He walked away before she could respond. After he did a quick check of his trainees, he\u2019d damn well get himself a drink.</p><p>Later this evening, he needed to get Gabi into a scene where she could display all her bratty talents. He chuckled...and his smile faded. He couldn\u2019t top her again; they\u2019d spent enough time together tonight.</p><p>As he pondered on the doms he\u2019d trust with her, his jaw tightened. He was an idiot, getting so territorial when they hadn\u2019t talked about being together after this weekend. Nonetheless, that\u2019s the way he felt.</p><p>But she did need to play with someone else tonight. Maybe a lightweight flogging with nothing erotic at all.</p><p>And for his own piece of mind, he\u2019d find her an ugly dom.</p> <p>Close to two in the morning, Maganti waited patiently for his last target to show up. Soon now, since Jang had called from the off-ramp to say she\u2019d driven past. With the Shadowlands so far into the country, Jang had to watch from a more public location.</p><p>Number four chickie. The last one. Pretty too. He smiled. Maybe he\u2019d delay calling for the boat so he and Jang could enjoy themselves longer.</p><p>With a sense of anticipation, he spotted her car pulling into the lot. Right on time.</p><p>Flashing lights appeared behind her, and Maganti's jaw dropped when a cop car turned in and headed straight for the apartment building where he stood. What the fuck?</p><p>Son of a fucking bitch, had he been made? Sweat trickled down his face as he ghosted back through the breezeway to the rear of the building, and from there watched two cops jump out of the patrol car and race up the stairs. They pounded on a door.</p><p>A man shouted, \u201cGo away.\u201d Through the breezeway, Maganti saw lights blink on in the other buildings. Doors opened. The asshole had woken up everybody in the entire fucking apartment complex.</p><p>Maganti watched, teeth grinding together, as his target walked into the breezeway and up the steps to her apartment.</p><p>Gabi\u2019d felt so jumpy on the drive back that she almost crashed when a cop car appeared behind her. It followed her into the parking lot, then raced past and over to her building.</p> <p>It\u2019s not here for me. Yet as she got out of the car, her skin prickled as if every little nerve ending sensed someone watching her. She knew Rhodes hung around somewhere, but somehow this felt more...ominous. Yet no one appeared. Maybe the weather'd made her jumpy. A storm system had moved in off the Gulf, and black clouds blotted out the stars. A blustery wind swayed the trees and tugged at her clothing.</p><p>She walked across the lot as the cops pounded on a door a ways down from her own apartment. Before she\u2019d reached the building, another police car pulled up, then an ambulance. Damn.</p><p>After climbing the steps to her floor, she spotted her neighbor peeking out and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The tiny white-haired woman lit up at the chance to share gossip. \u201cOooh, that man in 282 came home beastly drunk and beat up his girlfriend. We heard her screaming all the way down here. Clara from 280 called me, and I told her to call the police.\u201d</p><p>Nothing to do with me. The relief made her grin. \u201cPretty disgusting\u2014a man beating on a woman.\u201d The switch marks on her bottom burned.</p><p>\u201cI never liked the look of him anyway. I told Clara that he looked like a brute.\u201d Drawing her cotton robe closer against a spatter of raindrops, Mrs. Peters edged out onto the walkway to watch the brute get hauled away.</p><p>Gabi glanced over the railing. Drunk and belligerent. She hesitated, wondering if she should check on the girlfriend, then saw a policewoman enter the apartment. So she patted Mrs. Peters on the fragile shoulder. \u201cHave a nice rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, dear.\u201d</p><p>After a quick shower, Gabi sprawled on her bed, still too awake to call it a night. As rain hit the windows in waves, she snipped off the leg of a snagged pair of panty hose and rolled it into a mouselike cat toy. She left a realistic tail on the end and tossed it onto the carpet. Two furry bodies sprang in pursuit.</p><p>Horatio won. The brown ball in his mouth drooped in a convincingly mousy manner as he growled at Hamlet and lashed his tail.</p><p>Hamlet hesitated. He licked a rough patch of fur to show he didn\u2019t really want the mouse ball, then jumped on the bed to cozy up to Gabi.</p><p>Lying on her side, she rubbed her nose in his soft fur. When she\u2019d walked on the beach with Marcus, she\u2019d asked that he find good homes for her babies...if anything happened. His expression had been frightening, and then he\u2019d yanked her into his arms and held her. But he\u2019d promised.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe, my boys, no matter what,\u201d she murmured. \u201cJust one more night.\u201d</p><p>Then what?</p><p>She scritched Hamlet under the jaw, winning a purr. Then she\u2019d go home to Miami and forget all about the Shadowlands? Marcus?</p><p>Could she? Return home, yes. Forget? Probably not.</p><p>Until the Shadowlands and Marcus, she hadn\u2019t realized how deep her need went for more than\u2014what did Marcus call it?\u2014vanilla sex. After all, in the BDSM clubs in college, she\u2019d never really submitted.</p><p>But Marcus had shown her the fulfillment of handing over the reins and surrendering all of herself. She couldn\u2019t give that up now, even if she had to look for it with someone else. So she\u2019d continue to explore the scene, even when she left. Master Z could probably recommend a safe club.</p><p>Marcus wouldn\u2019t be her dom though. Needing something to fill the black emptiness inside, she pulled the cat on top of her stomach. He blinked at her and settled back down to snooze, ears cocked forward to listen.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Hamlet, I don\u2019t understand him.\u201d When Marcus had taken her home with him, she\u2019d had so much fun. Cooking, arguing, swimming. Just talking. The way he stepped in and out of dom mode had kept her half-aroused the entire time. On the beach, he\u2019d been so sweet and playful...and she\u2019d thought she meant something to him.</p><p>But she could tell from the way Celine acted that they had a relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a guy,\u201d she told Hamlet. \u201cSo tell me, how could he make love to me if he and Celine are an item?\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened a slit as if to remind her that men were bastards.</p><p>Last night Marcus had handed her over to another dom to scene with. Not the behavior of someone who gave a damn, right? And she\u2019d seen how well Celine suited him. So damned perfect. \u201cThey look good together, Hamlet.\u201d Gabi sighed. \u201cI guess I really don\u2019t know him all that well.\u201d</p><p>Only she did. With her disobedient, insolent behavior, she\u2019d made him furious, and he still controlled his temper. And me. The thoughtful, generous way he made love told her a lot. So did how he argued\u2014fairly, acknowledging when she brought up a good point\u2014and how he listened.</p><p>She gave him the same things back. And I make him laugh. Can oh-so-sweet Celine do that?</p><p>Dammit. Tomorrow would be her last night. She\u2019d watch, maybe ask him...somehow...if he thought...wanted... She groaned. Right. That\u2019ll go over well; ask him a question you can\u2019t even manage to articulate.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Sitting quietly\u2014and nakedly\u2014in a roped-off scene area, Gabi waited for Marcus to return. The plastic drape covering the waist-high bondage table crackled under her butt. Around her, the Shadowlands warbled and soared with its own unique music: the Goth music of Cruxshadows pounding, impact toys cracking on bare flesh, a caged submissive crying in a high voice, a sub in a flogging scene moaning.</p><p>The fragrance of leather mingled with sex and sweat and perfume. She held her arm to her face and inhaled the lingering scent from where Marcus had gripped her wrist.</p><p>This was her last night here, Gabi thought. It was almost over, and no one had made an effort to lure her out of the building. Would the perp try for her later, after she left? Or maybe he hadn\u2019t taken the bait. Had he targeted someone else? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if nothing happened now? She felt like dancing in relief...and crying. What about the women he\u2019d kidnapped? What about Kim? Her hands fisted; then she forced her fingers to open. You can only do what you can do.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d act like a brat; this was her part to do. And she\u2019d enjoy it as much as possible. Because, as Kim and the other women had found, sometimes things go bad. If the kidnapper did manage to get Gabi, at least she\u2019d have lived.</p><p>And loved? She shook her head. Live for today. Tomorrow can wait.</p><p>A scream of release turned her attention to the flogging scene where the submissive writhed against the St. Andrew\u2019s cross. The dom dropped his flogger and pumped his fingers into her pussy, and she shrieked higher, obviously coming again.</p> <p>At least someone was having a good night. I\u2019m not sure I am. While serving drinks, she\u2019d acted obnoxious enough to collect some nasty reprimands from the Masters. Now Marcus planned to play with her\u2014with hot wax.</p><p>And he calls it playing? Like, whatever happened to chess? Or cards? Or tag?</p><p>As he strode into the roped-off area, carrying a tray of ominous-looking things, excitement speared low in her belly, along with a hell of a lot of anxiety.</p><p>He set the tray on a table and moved it closer. \u201cThere we go. All ready.\u201d</p><p>Her hands turned clammy. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus smiled at her and pulled her legs open, securing her knees to the straps on each side of the hip-wide table. He kissed her lightly, then put his hand over her face and pushed her down, making her giggle, at least until he put a strap across her hips. Oh man.</p><p>\u201cDo you prefer your arms above your head or at your sides?\u201d he asked, ever so polite, the bastard, as if she didn\u2019t see the amusement in his eyes at her squirming.</p><p>She wiggled\u2014tried to, at least\u2014and the knowledge that she couldn\u2019t escape sent a wave of heat rolling over her even as her breathing increased and fear trickled into her belly. No, hot wax wasn\u2019t a good idea. \u201cI prefer not to do this. I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his jaw and looked at her quizzically. \u201cDid I ask your permission? No, I didn\u2019t. Little trainee\u201d\u2014he emphasized the word\u2014\u201cif you didn\u2019t mark something as a hard limit, then you get to try it.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned his weight on his forearm beside her head, his eyes intent on hers. \u201cIf after we\u2019ve started, you find this too much for you, for whatever reason, use your safe word. Do you trust me, Gabrielle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo damn much if you ask me,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cLook at the stuff you\u2019ve gotten me into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what you\u2019ve learned about yourself, sugar.\u201d He kissed her, taking charge of it and letting her feel that he had. By the time he lifted his head, desire bubbled in her veins and turned to a hot sizzle when his hand cupped her breast. How did he do this to her, take away all her willpower to fight?</p><p>How could he turn her on with one single smile?</p><p>Still leaning on his arm, he caressed her breasts. His licked finger stroked wetness in circles over the areola. As if he had nothing better to do, he studied how her nipples bunched into peaks. A mild pinch on each tip shot a roaring blast straight to her clit as if she had a freeway running from her breasts to her pussy.</p><p>His eyes stayed focused on her face as he slid his hand down to the junction between her legs. \u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t want to do this, you\u2019re a tad wet, sugar,\u201d he murmured. His fingers played in the betraying wetness, tugging at her folds, sliding over her clit, teasing her entrance.</p><p>Her clit tightened, and she actually felt blood swelling her labia until she throbbed. \u201cIt\u2019s not the wax; it\u2019s you.\u201d Her voice came out breathless.</p><p>His eyes crinkled. \u201cNow that is purely nice to hear, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and pulled a strap across the table, positioning it below her breasts to restrain her arms at her sides. Another strap went a few inches above her nipples, and the two squeezed her breasts between them, pulling the skin taut. \u201cVery pretty,\u201d he said and tugged the hard peaks lightly, showing her how sensitive they\u2019d become.</p> <p>She bit back a moan and tried to remember she needed to act disobedient. He made it so difficult. One stern look from him and she waved the white flag every time.</p><p>Or at least until she regained her wits.</p><p>After drizzling massage oil onto her stomach, he massaged it in, from above her breasts to her inner thighs. When he dripped more over her clit, the electrifying impact of the tiny drops made her shudder. Then she gulped. There? Why was he putting anything anywhere near her pussy? \u201cWhy oil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have beautifully delicate skin, Gabi,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThe oil keeps the wax from sticking as much. Maybe someday we\u2019ll try it without.\u201d</p><p>They had no someday. The thought sent a stab of regret through her. But what if there were? Would he want to see her after this?</p><p>He shoved the small table closer and lit a white candle. Her arms tried to lift against the restraints. Get it away. Oh God, he really planned to do this.</p><p>After rolling up the sleeves of his white tailored shirt, exposing those muscular forearms that really didn\u2019t belong on a lawyer, he picked up the candle. He dripped some wax on his inner elbow, grunted, and raised the candle higher. More wax splatted onto his arm. \u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take her eyes from the dancing flame. No, this was so wrong. Candles should be used for meditation...for romance. Or on a birthday cake at least.</p><p>So where was the cake? The present? The song?</p><p>As he stepped closer to her\u2014as the damned flame got way too close\u2014she started singing. \u201cHappy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me...\u201d</p><p>Marcus paused, looking at her in disbelief.</p><p>See. I knew he didn\u2019t have a sense of humor. \u201cHappy birthday, dear Gabi\u201d\u2014she lifted her head and blew out the candle\u2014\u201chappy birthday to me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, and she tensed, and then he burst out laughing, so loud and strong that she giggled. God, he was so incredibly sexy when he laughed.</p><p>The stony-faced Master Nolan walked into the roped-off area and stared at her with unforgiving, dark eyes. \u201cMarcus, you\u2019re a pitiful excuse for a dom, let alone a trainer,\u201d he said in his rough voice. And loudly too. \u201cBeat her. Don\u2019t laugh at her.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you here.\u201d</p><p>With a snort of disgust, Nolan held up a tiny, tiny flogger with a palm-sized handle and thin suede strips. \u201cZ got these today and sent one as a gift for your trainee.\u201d</p><p>It was totally cute. Marcus could lash her all day without doing any damage. She grinned. \u201cA widdle flogger. Oooo, I\u2019m scared now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe you\u2019re right. The trainee is getting ornery,\u201d Marcus said in his soft voice. He took the flogger and smiled at her. \u201cIt\u2019s little, sugar, because it\u2019s meant for little places.\u201d With a flick of his wrist, he brought the strands down right on her pussy.</p><p>\u201cAck!\u201d Her back arched as she fought the straps, tried to bring her legs together as he gave her two more whaps. \u201cJesus Christ! What are\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow and the flogger at the same time.</p><p>She shut right up. Her clit had been swollen from his fingers. Now it throbbed and burned. Wetness trickled through her folds, and she sucked in a breath. God, if he lashed her again, she might come.</p><p>Nolan glanced at her pussy and snorted a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good punishment for her, Marcus. She likes pussy whipping too much.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Marcus pressed his palm between her legs, his intent blue eyes on her face as his fingers slipped and slid in her folds. \u201cWell now, Darlin\u2019, we might could have some fun with this later tonight.\u201d</p><p>The threat\u2014promise\u2014made her pussy clench, and he laughed.</p><p>Nolan shook his head, slapped him on the shoulder, and returned to the redheaded sub waiting outside the roped-off area.</p><p>Marcus circled his fingers around her entrance, sliding so easily she knew her pussy must be drenched. \u201cI do think you need something in that Li\u2019ll cunt.\u201d He turned away from her, leaving her throbbing, and rummaged in his leather toy bag.</p><p>Her eyes widened when he held up the vibrator from the previous night. \u201cI forgot to tell you that this is yours now, sugar. Before you take it home, we might as well get one more use of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her in amusement. \u201cOf course I would. Haven\u2019t you learned anything yet?\u201d He pushed the nubby penis shape against her entrance, and despite how wet she was, she was also still swollen from yesterday. She groaned as sensitive tissues stretched. He seated it deep inside her, and her vagina pulsed around the intrusion with each beat of her heart.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t turned it on.</p><p>Marcus stepped closer to the tray, picked up the candle, and frowned at it. After a second\u2019s thought, he pulled a blindfold from his toy bag and firmly tied the soft silk over her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to gag you, sugar, but one blown-out candle is your limit. I figure if you can\u2019t see the flame, you can\u2019t huff and puff at it.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see anything...couldn\u2019t tell what he was doing. A tremor shook her.</p><p>\u201cYes, blindness makes everything more intense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ears straining, she caught the crack of a paddle. Not close. Moaning. A man somewhere on her right cried in gut-wrenching sobs. A woman gave hard-voiced orders. Cullen\u2019s hearty laugh.</p><p>The lighter clicked. Oh, God. She sniffed, trying to tell if he\u2019d moved the candle closer.</p><p>\u201cI use candles without fragrance, Gabi,\u201d he said and chuckled. \u201cFor safety. You won\u2019t smell anything approaching.\u201d</p><p>Something hit her stomach. She jerked at the momentary burn, then relaxed as it faded to warmth.</p><p>After a second, Marcus pried the wax from her skin and ran his finger over the spot. \u201cJust right,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Then she had no chance to process anything as hot drips of wax created a line across her stomach, slow drip after slow drip, each burning sensation blossoming over her nerves before fading. He drew one line down to her lower stomach and back up. Circled her belly button. The heat became more intense, then cooler. She couldn\u2019t predict where the next drop would start, and her skin grew more sensitive, waiting for the slight pain, then the warmth.</p><p>He covered her stomach, gradually moving upward to between her breasts. She held her breath as the splats of wax headed left, circling the curve of her breast, around and around, closer and closer to her nipple. Sometimes very hot, sometimes just warm, so she couldn\u2019t predict what any one would feel like, but she cringed, anticipating\u2014</p><p>A splat of wax hit right on the very peak. Her back arched uncontrollably. Hot, hot, it pulled like wet sucking lips around her nipple. As the sensation spread through her breast, she almost came right then.</p><p>She panted, aroused beyond bearing, and heard him murmur, \u201cYou\u2019re doin' fine, sugar. Just fine.\u201d He stroked her hair back from her face and kissed her forehead.</p><p>Wax dropped onto her stomach again, the heat soaking into her skin and heading in an unrelenting line straight upward to her right breast. By the time wax impacted her other nipple with the bite of pain, she seemed to be submerged in cotton balls, feeling nothing except the sensations crawling across her body and the sheer need coiling inside her.</p><p>She felt his hand between her legs, and the vibrator clicked on, clicked more times as he cycled through the choices to one where the intensity of the vibrations surged up and down like ocean waves. All the nerves inside her awoke as if she had a second clit deep in her vagina. Her hips tried to lift, held in place by the strap, and her pussy clenched over and over around the intrusion.</p><p>Suddenly more wax drizzled back and forth across her stomach, hotter this time, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. Lower, crisscrossing to her hips in measured splat after hot splat, venturing down her thighs and up. As the lines drifted farther toward the inside of her legs, she realized his goal and could only moan, unable to verbalize anything.</p><p>Her clit throbbed and swelled in anticipation. Ruthlessly he dripped the wax in an arc from her left inner thigh to high over her mound, down the right thigh, and back again, each set of hot drops closing drip by drip on her very center. As the vibrations inside her intensified, he changed direction. A drop of wax hit the top of her mound, a pause, another a little closer to her pussy, a pause, and another. Her lower half tightened more between each searingly hot impact.</p><p>Closer...and the wait for the next seemed eternal.</p><p>It hit\u2014oh God\u2014the hard, hot splat hit directly on her impossibly sensitive clit.</p><p>\u201cAaaaah!\u201d Everything inside her exploded outward in waves of excruciating pleasure, over and over. Every time they slowed, the vibrator inside her changed its rhythm and another inescapable climax shuddered through her. Her hips bucked against the immovable strap; her whole body tried to arch upward.</p><p>When everything finally stopped, she struggled for air. God, that had been\u2014</p><p>Liquid poured directly onto her pussy\u2014hot, hot, hot\u2014and she screamed as another orgasm hit, brutally hard, shaking her like a rag doll.</p><p>As the spasms faded, as the roaring in her ears receded, she realized the liquid hadn\u2019t been hot at all\u2014he\u2019d poured ice water onto her pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou...you sadist,\u201d she gasped. He gently removed the vibrator, and she shivered at the cold, lonely feeling of being lost inside the clouds.</p><p>His hands stroked soothingly over the tender area between her hips and thighs, his grip pulling her back to earth. \u201cEasy, sugar, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze, and everything inside her melted like the wax he\u2019d poured on her. I love you.</p><p>Despite the oil, removing the wax from Gabi\u2019s skin overloaded her senses and sent her back into subspace. Now buried in the blanket he\u2019d wrapped her in, she blinked at him, her smart little mouth silent, as he cleaned up. Once finished, he put her corset and skirt in her arms and picked her up.</p> <p>He nuzzled her temple and inhaled her fragrance. Adrenaline still sizzled through his veins, the high of topping a little spitfire, reading her responses and reacting in turn, and taking her to the ultimate of pleasure. Sometimes topping a sub reminded him of working a jury until they reacted as he wanted, glaring at the accused and sympathizing with the victims.</p><p>A good scene with a responsive sub was even better. And with Gabi? As his arms tightened around her, she sighed and rubbed her cheek against his chest. Had there ever been such a sweet, snuggly brat? His heart squeezed.</p><p>Before the night ended, they needed to have a long talk.</p><p>As he searched for a good place to relax, he spotted Dan and Kari, Cullen and Andrea across the almost empty room at the chain station, watching Nolan play with his sub. Hell, in the Master\u2019s meeting before opening, Nolan had mentioned that near the end of the night, he planned to nudge Beth forward and had invited the others to watch. Marcus had almost forgotten.</p><p>With Gabi still in his arms, he took a chair across from Dan.</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cHeard a lot of screaming from your direction.\u201d He frowned at Gabi and nodded at Marcus\u2019s feet.</p><p>It took Marcus a second before he realized she shouldn\u2019t sit in his lap. Cuddling didn\u2019t make for bratlike opportunities. With a silent sigh, he shook her, wanting to kiss her instead.</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d She blinked at him.</p><p>My puppy. He set her on her feet and nodded at the floor. \u201cDown where you belong, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She gave him such a meltingly sweet look, he almost pulled her back on his lap. Then she remembered her role. \u201cBelong? On the floor?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to his feet in answer.</p><p>\u201cRat bastard,\u201d she huffed. She knelt, and just when he thought she\u2019d lost her touch, she glanced up at him and said loudly, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of one hundred thousand sperm, you were the fastest.\u201d</p><p>Dan choked on his drink, and Cullen\u2019s loud laugh filled the air. Kari buried her head against Dan\u2019s chest, her shoulders shaking. Andrea was laughing like a loon.</p><p>Trying to seem angry, Marcus yanked her back so he could lean over and talk in her ear. Hopefully he\u2019d appear to be giving her hell. Instead he told her the truth. \u201cI\u2019m liable to split a gut if you keep acting up, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head, choking on giggles. Little brat was too cute for her own good, and where did she come up with those insults? \u201cHow do you feel? Are you able to kneel?\u201d He half hoped she\u2019d say she needed him to hold her.</p><p>She was of stronger stuff. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t sound convinced.</p><p>He straightened and said loudly, \u201cI\u2019d best keep you close so you don\u2019t rile me up anymore.\u201d After settling himself forward on the chair, he pulled her back until his legs enclosed her, and he gripped her nape in a mock hard grip. \u201cLet me know if you get uncomfortable, Darlin\u2019,\u201d he murmured for her ears only.</p><p>As she relaxed against him, he traced a finger over the black chain-link tattoo around her neck. She had matching ones on her ankles. One unpredictable, fascinating woman.</p><p>What did she plan to do after today? Would she return to Miami right away?</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t work. They needed time to explore what they had together. She was attracted to him. A little sub couldn\u2019t disguise that or her response to him in bed.</p><p>And now that he could distinguish what portion of her brattiness was acting versus pure ornery Gabi, he found her behavior more amusing than annoying. In the future\u2014if they had one\u2014when she sassed him, his taking her to task would reward them both. Funishment\u2014not truly discipline.</p><p>\u201cThis is your last night here,\u201d he said, testing to see if she\u2019d give a hint as to her plans.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound happy.</p><p>Leaning forward, he massaged her shoulders. Her tense little body should still be relaxed, considering how far she\u2019d gone under in the scene. He kissed the top of her head and said softly, \u201cSomething is bothering you.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her cheek against his with that unconscious affection he\u2019d grown to love. \u201cWhat if he isn\u2019t caught? What about my friend? The other women?\u201d</p><p>Her loyalty squeezed his heart, and he offered the only reassurance he could. \u201cOur...friends...won\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed slightly. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t.\u201d Her lips curved. \u201cThey\u2019re almost as stubborn as you are.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her earlobe in retaliation and smiled at her husky giggle. As she rested her cheek against his leg, he realized in surprise that he felt...content. Relaxed and happy in a way he hadn\u2019t for, perhaps, years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kneeling between Marcus\u2019s legs, Gabi felt enclosed in safety as he played with her hair and traced his fingers across the back of her neck.</p><p>The other two couples were watching the scene where the harsh dom, Master Nolan, caned... What had Andrea said his sub was named? Beth. Chains held the redheaded sub\u2019s arms over her head, and a spreader bar kept her legs wide apart as Master Nolan beat on her. A flogger lay discarded on the floor, and now he tossed away the cane and picked up a leather tawse. Beth had tears in her eyes, but her nipples had peaked hard and her face was flushed. She waggled her hips and arched into the blows with more excitement than pain.</p><p>Gabi shivered, remembering the flogging from Marcus, how the burning had somehow changed to pleasure until she couldn\u2019t tell the difference. The redhead\u2019s moans sure didn\u2019t sound unhappy. Her dom worked her higher and higher, then switched to the little pussy flogger Marcus had used. Had Z given them to all the Masters?</p><p>Nolan slapped the flogger across Beth\u2019s breasts, then landed one right between her legs. The sub\u2019s back arched as she screamed and shuddered in a long, awe-inspiring climax.</p> <p>Master Nolan\u2019s face changed entirely as he smiled, and Gabi saw why his sub found him appealing. The rumble of his voice reached the people watching as he fisted a hand in Beth\u2019s hair, leaning his body against hers. Her tremors eased. And then Nolan stepped back and swatted the flogger three more times right on her pussy, hard and fast. With an incredible look of shock, Beth climaxed again so violently that the chains rang.</p><p>The watching doms grinned, murmuring approval of his skill.</p><p>The rest of the Masters had arrived while Gabi had stared at the scene. Sam, a whip dangling from his belt, stood with arms folded across his chest. Mistress Anne sat in a leather chair, and a sub in a chain chest harness knelt at her feet. Raoul leaned against the back of the couch where Dan and Kari sat.</p><p>Dan pulled Kari onto his lap, freeing up more space. His big hand splayed over her pregnant stomach, and he smiled at her like a man who had all his dreams right there in his arms.</p><p>Gabi sighed. Would anyone ever look at her like that?</p> <p>Mistress Olivia sat down beside Dan and Kari.</p><p>Master Z had stood off to one side and now chose one of the two empty chairs. He had his short, curvy sub with him tonight, although Gabi didn\u2019t remember seeing her recently. Z pointed to the floor. Jessica sank to a kneeling position, her face expressionless.</p><p>As Nolan wrapped his arms around his restrained sub, Gabi glanced at Marcus and the other Masters. \u201cWhy\u2019s everyone so happy?\u201d she whispered to Marcus.</p><p>He leaned down, crossing his arms under her breasts, and murmured in her ear: \u201cBeth was married to a sadist who scarred her up simply to hear her scream. She ran away.\u201d</p><p>When Gabi squinted her eyes, she saw Beth\u2019s white scar lines and puckered circles, marks like she\u2019d seen on some of the victims she\u2019d worked with. \u201cThe bastard. I hope he\u2019s rotting behind bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderground actually, I believe. At any rate, when Beth came to the Shadowlands, she was too terrified to give up control. Z made her take Nolan as her dom.\u201d</p> <p>Gabi suppressed a laugh. The meanest-looking dom in the place? If she\u2019d been Beth, she\u2019d have run like hell.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worked with her for months to get her over her fear of restraints. She trusts him now. Totally. So much that when he brings out floggers and canes, she doesn\u2019t have a panic attack. He considers tonight her graduation in a way, and he wanted to show her that she could do it all.\u201d</p><p>Gabi watched as Nolan released his sub from the restraints, one big arm around her to hold her up. Beth\u2019s eyes were fixed on the dom as if he held the sum total of her world. \u201cI think she passed the test.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Jessica sighed as Nolan swept Beth up, carrying her over to join the group.</p><p>Z turned, motioned for one of the trainees, and nodded to the scene area. The members knew to wipe up after playing, but sometimes a sub needed the attention more, so Z kept a cleaning person available. The trainee nodded and trotted off.</p><p>Although a bit glassy-eyed, Beth appeared incredibly happy, snuggled into Nolan\u2019s lap with her head against his shoulder. He murmured to her, his face as gentle as Jessica had ever seen. God, they looked good together, and she felt pleased for them...if a little envious.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s voice lifted slightly. \u201cBeth, do you love me?\u201d</p> <p>She tilted her head back to smile up at him. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like living with me?\u201d He framed her face, his hands almost as scarred as his sub\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith everything in me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAm I your dom, little rabbit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her red-brown brows drew together. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing.\u201d He gave her a faint smile, and his gravelly voice deepened. \u201cI thought I\u2019d tell you we\u2019re getting married next month. We need to get a plane ticket for your mama.\u201d</p><p>Jessica could almost see Beth\u2019s mind try to process Nolan\u2019s declaration. The redhead sat straight up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s not any kind of a proposal. You can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Nolan\u2019s mouth tightened, and he gave her a look any sub in the world would recognize, the one that said someone was getting far too close to pissing off a nasty dom.</p><p>Beth stopped. She frowned at her hands.</p><p>\u201cBeth, do you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped, lifting her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you like living with me?\u201d</p><p>Beth gave an exasperated snort. \u201cOkay, you jerk. You don\u2019t need to go through it all again, although you really should have finished with a \u2018will you marry me\u2019 question.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take the chance you\u2019d say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dom,\u201d she grumbled and then gave him a breathtaking smile. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>As everyone broke into applause, Cullen handed Nolan a ring, and he slid it onto Beth\u2019s finger. She let out a squeak of delight, her eyes wide. Hands bracketing her dom\u2019s face, she gave him a very long, very sweet kiss.</p><p>And then she shoved herself off his lap to hurry to Kari and show her ring off.</p><p>Jessica grinned as Nolan winced and adjusted a conspicuous erection.</p><p>Dan snorted and told Nolan in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019d better take her home soon before you damage something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell with that. We\u2019re heading upstairs the minute she stops showing off her ring.\u201d Nolan grinned as Beth trotted from Kari to Andrea. \u201cThen again, if she takes much longer, I may just bend her over this chair.\u201d</p><p>As the men laughed, Beth dropped down beside Jessica. \u201cLook, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>Jessica smiled at her instead, seeing the glow in her eyes, the utter happiness with no reservations whatsoever. \u201cI\u2019m so glad for you.\u201d</p><p>Beth hugged her. \u201cWithout you holding my hand and encouraging me, I might have run. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Blinking away tears, Jessica hugged her back. \u201cOkay, show me.\u201d</p><p>The ring was lovely, a diamond in the center of smaller multicolored gems, giving the impression of a flower in bloom, perfect for the landscape designer. \u201cI\u2019m envious,\u201d Jessica said, trying to make her words light even though she meant them with all her heart. \u201cAnd I know you two will be wonderfully happy together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Beth kissed her cheek before grinning at Z. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Z stroked her hair. \u201cBe happy, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>Feeling a little excluded and a lot envious, Gabi watched Beth return to Nolan.</p><p>His black gaze had never left his submissive for more than a few seconds.</p><p>Beth flapped her subbie blanket at him. \u201cWant to go upstairs, my lord and master...or just bend me over the arm of your chair?\u201d</p><p>Everyone burst out laughing.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s face darkened, and he rose.</p><p>Beth warily took a step back.</p><p>Gabi giggled when Nolan stripped the blanket from Beth and tossed her over his shoulder. He slapped her butt, glanced around at everyone, and grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re going upstairs for a bit, Z,\u201d he said.</p><p>Master Z inclined his head. \u201cFeel free to spend the night, Nolan. Use as many rooms as you deem necessary to get her properly engaged.\u201d</p><p>Nolan chuckled, caressing Beth\u2019s slim thigh. \u201cGood suggestion, Z. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a handful of rooms to obtain a quiet little fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>A muffled \u201cWhat!\u201d came from the redhead, even as the rest of the doms grinned.</p><p>Cullen had picked up the various toys in the scene area. Now he hung the leather bag over Nolan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll need this, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Gabi shook her head, a bit appalled. Each of the private rooms on the second floor had a different piece of equipment\u2014from spanking benches to St. Andrew\u2019s crosses to bondage tables. By morning, poor Beth probably wouldn\u2019t be able to walk.</p><p>\u201cWell, that exhausted me.\u201d Dan nuzzled his pregnant sub. \u201cBrought back all sorts of horrible memories of getting engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it did not,\u201d she said. Gabi gasped as the round little sub poked her hard-faced dom in the ribs. Was she insane? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you get the impression we have an overabundance of smart-ass subs?\u201d Master Dan growled to Cullen. He grabbed Kari\u2019s wrists and hooked her cuffs together over her protruding belly.</p><p>Cullen\u2019s sub, Andrea, grinned. \u201cNot me. As a past trainee, I\u2019m the very epitome of a submissive, an example to the other subs in my attire and demeanor and obedience.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a quote, but if that had been in the trainee instructions, Gabi had sure missed it.</p><p>Cullen stared at his sub in disbelief. \u201cFor that absolute whopper of a lie, you may fetch me a beer\u2014and just water for you.\u201d</p> <p>When she scowled at him, he yanked her dress over her head, leaving her in only a thong. His fingers curled under the thin band on one hip. \u201cLook at me in that tone of voice again, and you\u2019ll lose this too, love.\u201d</p><p>As she flounced away, Cullen grinned. \u201cYou know, I never get tired of watching that ass, especially when she\u2019s stomping.\u201d</p><p>Marcus laughed. He rubbed his cheek against Gabi\u2019s, his beard shadow tantalizingly abrasive, and murmured, \u201cGet dressed, sugar; then fetch us both a drink. Since you\u2019ve been a good girl\u2014for oh, at least the last five minutes...you may have whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>God, she could listen to his voice forever. She turned her face up and whispered, \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a kiss as slow and sweet as his Southern drawl.</p> <p>After squirming into her vinyl skirt and hooking up her corset, Gabi waited at the bar to give her order. An older couple had taken over the closest scene area. In a pink bustier and matching collar, the woman was carefully helped onto a spanking sawhorse by her white-haired dom. They must be around seventy and looked so sweet together. Imagine living with\u2014and loving\u2014someone for half a century.</p><p>With fingers knotted by arthritis, the dom stroked his sub\u2019s cheek, and they exchanged a kiss and laughter.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s heart squeezed. I want that. I want Marcus to be my dom. My man.</p><p>She ordered Marcus\u2019s vodka and a soda for herself from the dom serving as bartender, then made circles in a streak of spilled beer. Marcus acted affectionate. But did he treat all his trainees like her? Wouldn\u2019t he have said something if he figured on seeing her after tonight?</p><p>Her insides fluttered as if she\u2019d eaten an anxiety sandwich for lunch rather than tuna. Maybe he thought she wasn\u2019t interested, that she planned to go home and never think of him again. He\u2019s a dom, Gabi; he\u2019d know, one part of her said. The other more optimistic side insisted she should make an effort before giving up.</p><p>\u201cHi there.\u201d</p> <p>Gabi glanced over and saw the blonde submissive who adored Marcus. Miss Golden and Perfect. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Marcus said you\u2019re one of his new trainees.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was soft and sugar-sweet. \u201cMy name is Celine.\u201d</p><p>My Marcus. The pain of her claim slid into Gabi\u2019s heart so quickly she had no defense against it. She inhaled carefully and attempted a return smile. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d And that is so not true. I could have happily lived my whole life without meeting you. \u201cI\u2019m Gabrielle. How long have you two been together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince spring. He\u2019s everything I ever wanted.\u201d Celine smiled and patted Gabi\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve watched you, bless your heart. Don\u2019t you realize the doms don\u2019t like bratty submissives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d Some village somewhere is missing an idiot. \u201cWhy, I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>Celine pursed her lips into a moue of disapproval. \u201cThat\u2019s why that trainee Sally still hasn\u2019t found a dom who can stand her. I\u2019m surprised Marcus puts up with her. He hates disrespectful behavior.\u201d</p><p>Gabi managed not to wince and kept her voice level. \u201cWell, damn. Who knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t be hurt,\u201d Celine said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help.\u201d</p> <p>On the other side of Celine, Master Dan\u2019s pregnant submissive frowned; maybe she didn\u2019t approve of sarcastic subs either.</p><p>\u201cYou see, that\u2019s why Marcus loves me so much,\u201d Celine said. \u201cI never give him any trouble or back talk. Whatever he wants is what I want.\u201d</p><p>I should punch her. Tear some of her perfect hair out. No submissive in the place would blame me.</p><p>The bartender showed up\u2014finally\u2014and set Gabi\u2019s order down. \u201cOne Grey Goose, one Coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gabi said.</p><p>\u201cOh, is that for my master?\u201d Celine picked up Marcus\u2019s drink. \u201cI\u2019ll save you the trip, and you can get back to waiting on people.\u201d She moved away, gracefully and amazingly fast. Gabi would have had to chase after her like a hound on the hunt.</p><p>Gabi watched as Celine, the perfect submissive, handed Marcus his drink and knelt at his feet.</p><p>That\u2019s my place.</p><p>Marcus said something, and Celine laid her face against his knee.</p><p>When Gabi let out the breath she\u2019d held, it felt as if her ribs had collapsed into jagged bones. That completely answered any questions she\u2019d had about...anything. He had someone already, and even if he didn\u2019t, Gabi sure wasn\u2019t the type of sub or woman he wanted. He\u2019d made it clear right from the beginning he wouldn\u2019t tolerate brats. Why had she thought he\u2019d changed his mind?</p><p>She glanced at her drink. Bubbles rose in the dark liquid to burst and disappear. Time is up, Cinderella sub. The fairy tale had ended, and she needed to go home. What a shame she\u2019d screwed up the story and her future held no Prince Charming. Heart aching, she headed for the exit.</p><p>Before she reached the door, she heard, \u201cGabrielle.\u201d Not Marcus, with the extra lilt he gave to the end of her name, but Z\u2019s deep voice. She turned.</p><p>His brows pulled together. \u201cWere you leaving without saying good-bye?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed past the lump in her throat. \u201cIt seemed easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier isn\u2019t always best,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo. But it is this time.\u201d Her gaze slid back to Marcus. His blonde submissive had wrapped her arms around his legs. One clinging vine, made-to-order. \u201cPlease tell everyone I appreciated their help.\u201d</p><p>And saying that reminded her of what was really important. Why was she giving in to these stupid, petty emotions when Kim might be fighting for her life? \u201cI wish we\u2019d caught the guy.\u201d</p><p>His gray eyes turned the color of gunmetal. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop trying to find them, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She managed a half smile. \u201cWell. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He silently opened his arms.</p><p>She went into his embrace without a second thought, and he held her firmly as she fought tears. Once she had herself under control, she pulled back, and he let her go. Lifting her chin with a finger, he stroked away a tear. \u201cBe safe, little one.\u201d</p><p>She fled.</p><p>Well, that answered that, Jessica thought, as Z strode across the room after the damn trainee.</p><p>And then Gabrielle walked into his arms like...like she\u2019d already spent a lot of time there. Every hope inside Jessica shriveled up and died. Only Jessica hugged him like that.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted me here tonight. She might not be a psychologist and mind reader, but she could tell when he was displeased. Z had let her come only because of Nolan\u2019s plans, but she sure as hell didn\u2019t feel wanted.</p><p>Now she knew why\u2014she\u2019d been replaced. The certainty slid into her so insidiously she didn\u2019t notice until pain swamped her senses. Until she couldn\u2019t breathe. Around her the Masters talked, comparing notes on their most disastrous scenes. No one paid attention when she slid back and rose. She needed to get out of here before Z returned\u2014if he did.</p><p>Jessica detoured to one side of the room and headed for the exit.</p><p>Near the front, she glanced around. Z was on the other side of the bar, his back to her. Even though nothing ever erased his military-straight posture, she saw weariness in his stride. She hesitated. Could she be wrong?</p><p>Doubtful.</p><p>As she passed the office door, she slowed. Z stored the membership records on the computer, and since she did the accounting, she could pull up any information she wanted. Like a trainee\u2019s address.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d go and chat awhile with the sub. Z might not be willing to talk, but she\u2019d bet Gabrielle would have no such compunctions. Jessica\u2019s fingers were numb as she punched in the code and entered the office. She\u2019d find out how long Z had been seeing her, and maybe then she\u2019d know what to do.</p><p>In her apartment parking lot, Gabi slid out of her car, inhaling the clean, crisp air. The storm had passed, and now palm fronds and debris skittered across the concrete in the light breeze. She shivered as the cool air hit her bare shoulders and legs. Not exactly dressed for the weather, was she? She gave a bitter laugh.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t stopped to change or even put on her shoes, just emptied everything from her locker and left. Lingering meant Marcus might notice her absence. Then again, he\u2019d seemed pretty occupied when his real sub had brought his drink. She gave a cynical laugh; he probably wouldn\u2019t think of her until closing time.</p><p>She stopped and closed her eyes. No, that wasn\u2019t fair. She\u2019d known few men as responsible as Marcus. He\u2019d eventually have searched for her...and then rounded up a kindly dom for her to play with like he had last night. So she\u2019d saved him all sorts of work by leaving early. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she bent over to reach for her purse and clothing on the passenger seat, she heard, \u201cNice ass.\u201d</p><p>Dickhead. Could the evening get any better? She turned, trapped between the open car door and his body, regretting her lack of clothing. Clenching her hand around her car keys, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re blowing your cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCase is over. Thompson caught the kidnapper.\u201d</p><p>Hope spiraled up inside Gabi, wiping out every other emotion. Kim. They can save Kim. \u201cWhere? When? Did he go after one of the decoys? How did you find out?\u201d Why didn\u2019t someone call me?</p> <p>Rhodes\u2019s expression turned sour. \u201cThompson made the bust at the St. Pete club. He was waiting outside for the decoy and heard noises from the alley and went to check it out. The unsub had attacked a woman who\u2019d come out the back door.\u201d Rhodes shook his head. \u201cWhy she was stupid enough to leave the club through the alley...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s caught? Did anyone get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman got knocked out when Thompson charged into them, but the paramedics are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I guess my part is over then.\u201d She felt off-balance, as if she was still running even after the race ended.</p><p>\u201cDammit. I wanted the collar.\u201d His gaze turned to her. \u201cYou should have tried harder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did my best.\u201d Gabi sighed, understanding his sour grapes. After all the work, that was it. Time to go back and try to pick up her life again. A sadder life now she\u2019d seen its emptiness. No deep laughter, no hot sex, no warm snuggles. She rubbed her arms as if that would stave off the cold.</p><p>The movement drew Rhodes\u2019s attention to her lack of clothing, her bare shoulders and legs, the cleavage made by the corset. His expression changed. \u201cYou might have done better if you hadn\u2019t gotten such a kick out of everything.\u201d His gaze slid over her body like a spray of filth. \u201cBut since we\u2019re both here together, why don\u2019t we keep enjoying ourselves.\u201d He jerked his chin toward her apartment. \u201cI can show you as good a time as that asshole trainer did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d Substitute him for Marcus? Oh God, I want my Marcus. Her throat tightened until she was afraid she\u2019d burst into tears, so she snapped at him instead. \u201cYou are such a sleazeball, Rhodes\u2014walking, talking proof of why siblings shouldn\u2019t marry.\u201d</p><p>It took him a second, and then anger distorted his face into something ugly.</p><p>That was stupid, Gabi. Exhausted, she leaned against the car. Just leave, dammit. \u201cGo home, Rhodes. I don\u2019t want to have to report you.\u201d She fully planned to note his behavior in her account anyway, although it probably wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p><p>His color darkened. \u201cYou report away. You know, Renard, if I document how much you enjoyed your assignment, you won\u2019t have a job to go back to.\u201d</p> <p>Sickness spread through her; she\u2019d known this might happen. But to have her entire life and hopes destroyed in one evening... \u201cYou\u2019re a real bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure we can work something out.\u201d Leaning on the side of the car, he put his hand on her. On her breast. Squeezing.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d With a growl she couldn\u2019t control, she slapped his hand away and slugged him square in the nose. The crunch of shattering cartilage made her stomach clench, and his high-pitched yell reverberated back from her nightmares.</p><p>He grabbed his face, and blood gushed through his fingers.</p><p>She raised her fists, despite the bile burning her throat. \u201cGo, Rhodes. Leave now.\u201d</p><p>Eyes crazy, he backed away. Before he\u2019d gone ten feet, she slammed the car door and fled across the parking lot, easing up only when an engine revved.</p><p>Car tires screeched on the pavement as he drove out of the lot.</p><p>As her heart hammered in her chest with lingering adrenaline, she tried to laugh. He\u2019d left.</p> <p>I broke his nose.</p><p>Trying not to remember the ghastly noise it had made, she snorted. Dickhead shouldn\u2019t have provoked a woman with a broken heart.</p><p>Her mood flattened into dismal again.</p><p>As she walked to her building, a small car pulled up at the fire lane, blocking her path. The car shut off, and a short blonde jumped out.</p><p>Z\u2019s sub, Jessica. The blonde\u2019s face was drawn, her hands clenched as she glared at Gabi.</p><p>Jesus, what is this? Pick on Gabi night?</p><p>Maganti shook his head. Jesus, what is this? Screw up Cesar\u2019s night?</p><p>What was it going to take to grab this cunt? Last night, fucking cops all over the place; now, some chick wanting to do a smackdown.</p><p>He needed to get this bitch tonight. Now. Get lost, blondie, so I can do my job.</p><p>As he watched from the shadows, the little blonde said in a hard voice to his target, \u201cI want to talk with you. How long has he been seeing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ.\u201d</p><p>The redhead rolled her eyes. \u201cIf you and Z are having problems, it has nothing to do with me. Go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Wait, wait, wait. Maganti stiffened, losing track of the conversation. The curvy blonde had been on his list. He\u2019d done a background check and crossed her off because she had a lover. But if she\u2019d fought with her fuck buddy, she could go right back on the menu. If a chick\u2019s dude screwed around on her, no one wondered why she up and disappeared.</p><p>He looked at her and saw dollar signs.</p><p>His target scowled and started to walk away, but the bulldog blonde grabbed her arm. \u201cI need answers. Please.\u201d</p><p>The redhead gave a long-suffering sigh. \u201cGod, you\u2019re stubborn. Fine. Let\u2019s go upstairs and talk. It\u2019s really not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>The redhead leaned forward and whispered something in the blonde\u2019s ear, making her jerk back and stare. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay. We\u2019ll discuss it in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>An okay night changed into a fucking great night when they both headed toward the stairs at the center of the building.</p><p>As they entered the thruway, Maganti pulled his backup Taser and waited until they\u2019d turned to climb the steps. He moved out far enough to get a clear line of fire and shot one and the other. Pow, pow. It only took a minute to pull the prongs out of their bodies and heave the women into the box\u2014a little tangled, but what the hell\u2014and secure the box to the handcart. He backed his van up, pushed the handcart up the ramp, and was on his way.</p><p>Now this was a fucking fine haul.</p><p>Gabi woke, head pounding, stomach wrenching with nausea. Her mouth felt as if she\u2019d licked up beach sand, and her foggy brain seemed to think she\u2019d spent the night drinking. Only...she hadn\u2019t, right?</p><p>She tried to sit up, realized she lay on a metal floor\u2014not her bed. Something rattled when she moved her arms. Restrained? Was she still at the club? She raised her head carefully so it wouldn\u2019t fall off. She wore handcuffs. A two-feet chain strung through the cuffs was padlocked to a bolt in the gray metal wall.</p><p>The world spun dizzily as she wiggled to a sitting position. She swallowed hard. Am I at the Shadowlands? No sounds. Not Marcus\u2019s place. She\u2019d left him at the club. So why the bondage?</p><p>She\u2019d driven back to her apartment. Right. And she\u2019d punched Dickhead? She flexed her fingers, gritting her teeth at the soreness in her right knuckles. That part wasn\u2019t a dream. Then...Jessica'd arrived, and they\u2019d started to climb the steps. A man in the shadows. Pain. Gabi tensed, remembering the horrible pain, how every muscle had shrieked in agony. Then...</p><p>Here. She turned her head. Jessica lay beside her. Unconscious. Handcuffed.</p><p>They weren\u2019t at the club. Not playing, not a scene. No no no. A scream tried to escape, couldn\u2019t get past the constriction in her throat. The nausea, the headache, the grogginess...drugged.</p><p>The horrible realization came from deep inside and slammed into her brain. Kidnapped. Thompson hadn\u2019t caught the perp.</p><p>I\u2019ve been kidnapped. With Jessica. Terror rose in her, as inescapable as waves breaking on the rocks, swamping her thoughts until the room itself turned red. Cold.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to get out of here. She jerked on the bolt, and it held her implacably. No. Oh God, please. She rattled and yanked the chain. Let go, dammit, let go! Pulled over and over, until the metal handcuffs ripped her skin.</p><p>Pain. The increasing pain pushed her beyond her panic. Panting, she slumped against the cold wall. What was she doing?</p><p>I panicked. She shook her head, forced her breathing to slow. Don\u2019t do that again, Gabi. As she stared at the blood trickling down her wrists, terror waited on the edges of her mind, pushing against her control.</p><p>Using all her willpower, she turned her attention away from the restraints.</p><p>Where are we? Gray walls, gray floor. Metal. Not a room. A cargo van. It stank of sweat and fear and sickness. And sex. She pushed farther back against the wall, pulling her legs in, curling into a ball.</p><p>The only light came from a small mesh window in a door between the cargo part and the cab section. The cargo area held a cooler, a porta-potty, and a big corrugated box for a washing machine with a handcart leaning on it. Nothing within reach.</p><p>Her chest started to tighten, but Jessica groaned.</p><p>A minute later, the blonde raised her head, squinting against the light. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Do better, Gabi. \u201cSorry.

How long before anyone called Gabi? Oh dear God. Fear spiraled outward. No rescue. No hope.

I can\u2019t lose it. \u201cSorry,\u201d Gabi whispered. Heart hammering, she mentally edged back from the chasm. After a second, she turned and leaned against the wall of the van, facing the other woman. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Hands clenched into fists, the blonde stared around the van, her face white. Then her chin lifted. \u201cI reserve the right to yell about you and Z later. For now, tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Despite the ice creeping up her spine, Gabi almost managed a smile. Trust Z not to have a wimpy girlfriend. \u201cIt\u2019s like this...\u201d</p><p>As Gabrielle talked, Jessica tried various ways to get out of the handcuffs. No deal. By the time Gabrielle finished the story, Jessica wanted to kill Z, dead as a doornail. That\u2019s why he\u2019d come down on her so hard for her brattiness. Why he\u2019d kept gagging her. And why... \u201cHe tried to keep me out of the club completely,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d Gabrielle shook her head. \u201cAnyway, the only thing he feels for me is sympathy. I\u2019m sorry that he couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cMarcus was furious when he found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re with the FBI and a decoy, then someone will rescue us.\u201d Hope bubbled up. She could almost hear the good guys sneaking up on the van right now.</p> <p>\u201cNo. God, this is so screwed up. My backup, Dickhead, treated me like a slut and kept getting nastier. Last night, someone told him they\u2019d caught the kidnapper, so he figured the assignment was over and came on to me.\u201d Gabrielle shuddered.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Name-calling was done. Groping happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I broke his nose. He left.\u201d</p><p>Outrage burned through Jessica. \u201cYour protector abandoned you?\u201d</p> <p>Gabrielle shrugged. \u201cWell, supposedly they\u2019d caught the bad guy. Not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one knows we\u2019ve even been kidnapped.\u201d Oh God. Jessica\u2019s fingernails dug holes in her palms. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any wonderful FBI skills?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle gave a bitter laugh. \u201cI\u2019m a social worker, not an agent. I volunteered because I\u2019d played in BDSM clubs\u2014years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t believe he got you too,\u201d Gabrielle whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll s-sell us.\u201d Her face was white enough to match her scar, shivers shook her constantly, and she looked right on the edge.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had so many nightmares of this. And now it has happened.\u201d Gabrielle stared at her hands, breathing way too fast.</p><p>Jessica remembered how a few members had laughed at the bratty trainee\u2019s punishments. Except she wasn\u2019t a brat at all. For a month, this poor woman had played decoy, hoping to be kidnapped. Jessica shook her head, sympathy overwhelming her fear. Time for me to shoulder a little of the burden.</p> <p>She considered options, then slid as far as the chain would let her. She bumped her arm companionably against the woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, if two brats can\u2019t figure out how to get out of this, who can?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle stiffened and stared at her in disbelief.</p><p>Jessica gave her a level look and tilted her head in the way Z did when he challenged her to try something new.</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Her eyes cleared. \u201cGet out of here? Sure. We\u2019ll just do that little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Jessica waited a beat. \u201cGuess I won\u2019t get to knock you on your ass when this is over, huh?\u201d</p><p>This time Gabrielle actually chuckled. \u201cNo wonder Z adores you.\u201d</p><p>Jessica stared.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I\u2019m not blind. I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you, how he treats you.\u201d Gabrielle gave her a derisive sniff. \u201cPersonally I thought you were a real bitch, but if you believed I\u2019d poached on your man\u2014and that he\u2019d actually look twice at me\u2014I might have come across all pissy too. But get over it. The man loves you.\u201d</p><p>A knot in the pit of Jessica\u2019s stomach disappeared, and her eyes pooled. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I feel better. I\u2019m still terrified, but...better. I\u2019m so happy I could even...scream.\u201d She waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>Jessica let out an earsplitting scream, and Gabrielle followed suit.</p><p>As the back door of the van rolled up, Jessica\u2019s eyes watered at the sudden blast of daylight.</p><p>\u201cThe bitches are awake, Cesar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Another man\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time to leave.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Unable to sleep, Marcus had risen at dawn and tried to prepare questions for a witness in his next court case. Useless. He couldn\u2019t concentrate. He picked up the phone in his home office and punched in Gabi\u2019s number. Still no answer.</p><p>Damn the little sub, walking out of the club without even a good-bye or have a nice life or anything. Damn Celine too. After handing him his drink and saying Gabi was using the restroom, she\u2019d started in with her \u201cyou\u2019re my master\u201d bullshit. She probably wouldn\u2019t pull that again, since he\u2019d called over some doms and told them she was looking for a master.</p><p>Finally freed up, he\u2019d gone to find his missing sub, only to discover she\u2019d left.</p><p>He rubbed his face wearily. He\u2019d almost called Z to demand Gabi\u2019s address, but showing up at her home might screw up the FBI investigation. She\u2019d best get her pretty ass out of bed and answer her phone.</p><p>Why had she left like that?</p><p>Maybe, with her assignment concluded, she figured they were done with each other. She\u2019d be wrong.</p><p>Hands laced behind his head, he leaned back in his office chair. Smiling, he remembered how she\u2019d blown out the candle for wax play. Little brat. He needed to convince her to remain another week\u2014and stay here with him. If he could win a jury over, you\u2019d think he could argue a case for himself. Or he might could wrangle some vacation time from the DA and visit Miami.</p><p>No, sugar, we\u2019re not done.</p><p>When his phone rang, he picked it up, anticipation rising. No one would call him this early, except maybe a repentant trainee. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus, is Gabrielle with you?\u201d Z\u2019s voice.</p><p>Disappointment gave way to concern. \u201cNo, she isn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not answering her phone, neither is her backup from last night. The agent coming on duty says she\u2019s not in her apartment, but her car\u2019s in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>Marcus was on his feet with no memory of standing. He forced a breath. Get the facts, Atherton, before going off half-cocked. \u201cMaybe she and the agent went for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently the next man would get notified of their location.\u201d</p><p>A cold hand squeezed Marcus\u2019s spine at the implication. \u201cAre you at her place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way. Galen and Vance are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the address.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Marcus pulled in to the parking lot of Gabi\u2019s apartment complex. Three-story building, dull brown, no landscaping. It hurt him to think of her living here. He squinted at the numbers on the doors and spotted hers.</p><p>A light rain spattered against him as he ran across the lot. He veered around a small Taurus parked in the fire lane and took the steps two at a time.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s apartment stood open, a man in a dark suit blocking the door. \u201cLet him in,\u201d Z called from inside.</p><p>Marcus pushed past the man.</p><p>Vance and another man were in the living space. Z stood in the tiny kitchen area, his face drawn with exhaustion. \u201cMarcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews?\u201d Marcus asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing good.\u201d Z kneaded his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s Jessica\u2019s car in front. Unlocked. Her purse is in it. Her phone too. She\u2019s not answering at home.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stared at him. \u201cBoth of them are missing?\u201d</p><p>Galen stepped out of the bedroom. He carefully used his foot to push a cat back and closed the door behind him. He nodded to Marcus and spoke to everyone. \u201cI called in. The tracking devices are operating, but they\u2019re worthless. Both Gabrielle\u2019s shoes and purse are still in her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance you\u2019ve made a mistake?\u201d Marcus asked.</p><p>Galen gave a bitter glance at a set of keys on the kitchen table. \u201cVance found Gabi\u2019s apartment keys on the sidewalk by the steps.\u201d</p><p>The fury rising in Marcus\u2019s veins was matched by sheer fear. Where are you, Gabi?</p><p>\u201cYou gonna scream again, bitch? We\u2019re in the middle of a swamp\u2014won\u2019t do you much good.\u201d In a tank top and jeans, a repulsive man with pitted skin and stringy black hair stepped up into the van, rocking it with his weight. Gabi saw the gang tattoos covering his arms and almost panicked again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth twisted in an ugly grin as he stared at Gabi, his gaze lingering on her breasts. \u201cCesar knows I like it when bitches scream.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hammering, Gabi stared past him and out the van door. Oaks with hanging moss, thick underbrush, a dirt road. Silent except for the dripping of water from the trees and a few bird calls. She glanced at Jessica and saw her unhappy comprehension. No one would come to investigate their screams.</p><p>The man called Cesar stepped into the van and pulled the door down behind him. Dyed blonde hair, mud brown eyes, just under six feet, and thickly muscled.</p><p>He wore overalls with an appliance store brand. \u201cI don\u2019t like cleaning up my van when you chickies piss in your clothes, so use the porta-potty now. You won\u2019t get another chance till you\u2019re on the boat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where are we?\u201d Jessica asked, her voice shaking slightly.</p><p>Cesar snorted. \u201cAlways the same questions. You\u2019re getting sold to buyers who will appreciate your special...qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Fear combined with the nausea from the drugs, and Gabi\u2019s stomach roiled. How much time do we have?</p><p>\u201cSoon enough. A boat\u2019ll pick you up in downtown Clearwater in a couple of hours. We\u2019ll be on our way in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Don\u2019t care.\u201d He glanced at the other man. \u201cJang, one at a time. I\u2019ll cover.\u201d He patted the Taser holstered on his belt.</p><p>When Jang pulled a key from his jeans pocket, Gabi saw the outline of a cell phone. Her nostrils flared as if she could scent hope. A phone.</p><p>\u201cYou first, bitch.\u201d When his eyes raked over her, Gabi\u2019s skin crawled. \u201cWe gonna have us some fun on the drive. I am, at least. You\u2019re gonna scream.\u201d He grabbed her wrists and shoved his other hand in her corset.</p><p>Without thinking, she kicked him in the balls as hard as she could.</p><p>He made a horrible high-pitched sound as he staggered sideways. His legs gave out, dropping him to his knees as he clutched his groin, gagging and sucking air.</p><p>Gabi pulled her legs back, the momentary sense of victory eclipsed by fear. Then she raised her chin. She\u2019d pay for kicking him...but it had been worth it.</p> <p>When Jang moaned, the other guy gave a nasty laugh. \u201cYou forget we divided the cuffs so each bitch got one set? Legs are free, you fucking idiot. Now move it.\u201d</p><p>Jang pushed to his feet, his gait unsteady, his face pale. He detoured around her legs. Before she could move, he grabbed her hair and slammed her head against the side of the van.</p><p>Pain ripped through her head in a searing explosion. Her stomach turned over, and she gagged.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Jang released her and stepped away hastily.</p><p>\u201cFuckhead.\u201d Cesar made a sound of disgust. \u201cIt still stinks from the last one puking her guts out. Just let her piss and lock her back up.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Jang unlocked one cuff, yanked the chain free, and hefted her to her feet. He shoved her toward the portable toilet.</p><p>She let herself stagger, which wasn\u2019t hard considering she felt dizzier than hell. Turning to sit on the commode, she deliberately fell forward, knocking into him. As he staggered back, he grabbed her upper arms. With Jang's body blocking the other man\u2019s view, Gabi thumped her head on his chest to divert his attention, and slid her hand into his pocket.</p><p>Her fingers closed around the phone.</p> <p>She dropped onto the toilet, hiding the phone in her hand and hunching over her stomach as if she needed to throw up. And if her head got any worse, she might. After a quick breath, she lifted her head and glared at Jessica. \u201cWhat are you staring at, you loser? This is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>Both men turned to look at Jessica.</p><p>The blonde\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>Hell. Catching Jessica\u2019s gaze, Gabi mouthed, Yell.</p><p>Jessica blinked. But she caught on fast. \u201cMy fault? You\u2019re the skanky bitch who tried to steal my man.\u201d She yanked at her restraints.</p><p>While the men\u2019s attention was on Jessica, Gabi shoved the phone into her corset, hiding it between her breasts. Then, taking her time, trying to get her stomach to settle, she did her business, humiliated at the sound.</p><p>Still walking bowlegged, Jang hauled Gabi off the toilet, locked her back up, and gave Jessica a turn.</p><p>Leaning back, Gabi watched under her lashes, praying no one called Jang\u2019s phone. She figured, no matter how dumb he was, he might notice if ringing noises came from her breasts. To her relief, they simply chained Jessica up, walked to the front, and shut the door to the cab section behind them.</p><p>The engine started with a rumble, and the van pulled out.</p><p>Gabi frowned. The door between the cargo section and the cab held a tiny window. They could see into the back, but probably not easily since the only light came from that window. Why have a door at all?</p><p>Her stomach twisted. Probably so no one on the street could look through the windshield and see the handcuffed women. Her breath hitched. No. Can\u2019t panic now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the acting?\u201d Jessica whispered. She must not have seen Gabi pick his pocket.</p><p>If you\u2019re watching from the other side, Danny\u2014thank you for the lessons.</p><p>\u201cI got his cell.\u201d Head splitting with pain, Gabi fumbled around the restrictions of the short length of chain and handcuffs, finally managing to fish the phone out of her corset. She punched in 911. Busy.</p><p>Tried again. Busy.</p><p>Dammit all. She put in Rhodes\u2019s number. No answer. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Galen\u2019s number. Give me Z\u2019s number.\u201d</p><p>Jessica reeled off a number. No one answered, and Gabi used voice mail, trying to be clear. Kidnapped. Clearwater. Docks. Cargo van.</p><p>\u201cDescribe the guys\u2014tell them about the tattoos,\u201d Jessica whispered. Gabi did and finished, telling him not to call the cell\u2019s number. She put it on silent too...just in case.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d Jessica gave Gabi the number to his office.</p><p>Another voice mail, dammit. Gabi left the same message, then deleted the phone log. \u201cLet me try 911 again.\u201d She punched in 9, then 1\u2014</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find my fucking phone!\u201d Jang yelled in the cab.</p><p>Gabi felt the blood drain from her face. Oh God.</p><p>The van pulled over and stopped. Heart pounding, Gabi unsilenced the cell and slid it across the floor. It stopped beside the porta-potty. She slumped, trying to control her breathing.</p><p>The door to the cab burst open and hit the wall with a crack that made her insides cringe. Light from the windshield highlighted Jang\u2019s body as he stepped into the back. \u201cWhere is it, you fucking bitches?\u201d</p><p>Gabi mirrored Jessica\u2019s baffled expression.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll find it myself.\u201d He still walked as if his balls hurt. Avoiding her feet, he yanked Gabi sideways until the restraints pulled her arms straight. The handcuffs dug into her raw wrists. He tugged at her corset unsuccessfully, cursed, and started to unhook it.</p><p>Gabi struggled futilely, sick with revulsion. With fear. When her corset opened halfway, Jang grabbed her breast.</p><p>When he touched her, her thoughts fragmented with terror. She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d Cesar stepped into the back and glared at Jang. \u201cYou asshole, I don\u2019t have time for this crap.\u201d Pulling out his own cell, he punched in a number...and the phone by the commode buzzed softly. \u201cYou clumsy fuck, it\u2019s over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Jang squeezed Gabi\u2019s breast viciously. \u201cConsider this a sample for later,\u201d he whispered and shoved her against the metal wall.</p><p>She grunted as she hit, and tears filled her eyes. Please, someone, get us out of this.</p><p>After retrieving his phone, Jang hit a few buttons, obviously checking the outgoing calls.</p><p>Not moving, Gabi watched, thanking God she\u2019d erased the numbers she\u2019d dialed. Her head pounded; her shoulder and wrists and breast throbbed with pain. If he came back for her, she might cry. Her jaw clenched. No. No, she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>With a shrug, he told Cesar, \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good thing for you, fuckup.\u201d Cesar motioned him into the cab and followed.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jessica whispered.</p><p>Gabi nodded, grateful she wasn\u2019t totally alone. Not that it would matter.</p><p>Leaning her head on the wall, she stared at her wrists, at the mangled flesh and purpling bruising under the metal handcuffs. Blood smeared the metal floor.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why Marcus only used leather cuffs. She remembered how he\u2019d stand close enough that her every breath brought her his masculine scent, how he\u2019d hold her arm with a firm, warm grip while he ran a finger under the cuff to make sure it wasn\u2019t too tight. She\u2019d look up to see him watching her intently. His lips would curve\u2014just barely those first few days, then more. The last two nights, he\u2019d had a different smile: one that said he knew her, all of her\u2014the possessive smile of a man who\u2019d had a woman and intended to have her again.</p><p>Each time, even though she wouldn\u2019t move at all, she\u2019d yearn toward him. Toward his possession. No longer make me, Sir, but take me, Sir.</p><p>And now she\u2019d never see him again.</p><p>A slave. Would they break her? Maybe? Or maybe she\u2019d die first, her body as mangled as her wrists, her voice gone from screaming. A shudder seized her. She wasn\u2019t especially afraid to die. Everybody did, sooner or later. But the thought of what came before death, that someone would deliberately inflict horrible, crushing pain on her... As her hands trembled, the blood oozing from her wrists splattered on the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, I\u2019m terrified. They could so easily turn her into a panicking, mindless animal. I don\u2019t want that again. So she\u2019d damn well do absolutely everything she could to escape, no matter how small the chance. No point in waiting and hoping for something better to come.</p><p>And if she managed to attract attention, then maybe\u2014even if she died\u2014maybe Kim or Jessica might get rescued.</p><p>Her spine straightened. Pretty weak plan, but it helped take her another step away from losing control. I\u2019m more than an animal.</p><p>As the truck rumbled down the road, she mentally pulled up her big-girl panties\u2014and she really, really wished she\u2019d worn panties rather than a thong\u2014and turned to Jessica. \u201cYou know, I had all these great insults to use at the Shadowlands, but I forgot to yell them at Jang. Wanna hear them?\u201d</p> <p>Jessica stared at her, then sucked in a shaky breath and grinned. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll trade you some of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. My favorite is: Your birth certificate is an apology from the condom factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Jang\u2019s too stupid to get the meaning.\u201d Jessica thought. \u201cHow about: Why don\u2019t you check eBay and see if they have a life for sale?\u201d</p><p>Gabi grinned. \u201cNot bad. Hmm\u2014oh, I know... Is that your face or did your neck just throw up.\u201d</p><p>The sputter of laughter Jessica gave made Gabi\u2019s heart lighten. It was good not to be alone.</p> <p>In increasing frustration, Zachary watched as the FBI agents tried to find something, anything to point them in the right direction. Dammit, where would the pickup happen? His fear for Jessica knotted his guts until he stood and paced the kitchen. Again.</p><p>From the bedroom came the sound of plaintive meows. He\u2019d been in there earlier, holding and petting the two felines while Vance searched the apartment. The cats wanted Gabrielle. Maybe as much as he wanted Jessica. He ran his hand through his hair, craving her so badly his arms ached. Needing to shake her silly for scaring him, to hold her and let her know what she meant to him. All he could think about was how unhappy she\u2019d been last night. Because of him.</p><p>He stared at his hands, useless with no target in sight. This not knowing...not being able to act...</p><p>On the decrepit sofa, Galen had his bad leg extended. As he talked on his cell phone, his face slowly reddened with anger, and his low voice sharpened to such a cutting edge that the other person probably had blood pooling at his feet. With a low curse, the agent snapped the phone closed and called over one of the local agents. \u201cCampbell, meet Rhodes at your office. Grill him for anything he saw last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Campbell asked. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he here? Is he okay? Where\u2019s Ms. Renard?\u201d</p><p>Galen\u2019s eyes had darkened to total black. \u201cThe fucking asshole says Gabrielle lost her temper and punched him. Broke his nose. He spent the night in an ER, waiting to get it set.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell stared. \u201cHe left her and didn\u2019t call in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of training do your agents have?\u201d Marcus snapped.</p><p>Galen took the verbal hit without wincing. \u201cHe thought the investigation was over. Last night an agent assigned to another decoy caught a man attacking a woman behind the St. Pete club. The woman was knocked unconscious during the fight, and Thompson believed he\u2019d got the unsub. He called Rhodes to gloat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the kidnapper?\u201d Zachary asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple from the club wanting to play out a rape scenario. Once the woman woke up and explained, we released the man. But Thompson didn\u2019t bother to call Rhodes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Rhodes is free and clear?\u201d Marcus\u2019s hands had fisted. Zachary gave him a warning look.</p><p>\u201cNo, Marcus,\u201d Vance said. \u201cNo matter what, he should have arranged coverage for her. We\u2019ll deal with him later.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stilled and visibly forced himself to relax. \u201cI overreacted, gentlemen. Please forgive me.\u201d</p> <p>Galen gave him a thin smile. \u201cConsider him dead meat, Marcus. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Zachary turned and paced back across the room, his need to do something ratcheting up another notch. Do anything\u2014take the car and yell their names at every corner. Dammit, Jessica.</p><p>With the noise of the various conversations, Zachary at first didn\u2019t hear the music coming from the bedroom. Mangione\u2019s \u201cFeels So Good.\u201d His cell\u2019s ringtone. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He tore across the apartment, shoved the door open, tripping over the cats and somehow managing to kick the door shut behind him before they escaped. He grabbed his jacket from the bed and yanked the cell out of the pocket.</p><p>The ringing stopped. No, dammit.</p><p>He flipped the phone open. One message. He almost listened, then forced himself to return to the others before punching Play.</p><p>\u201cZ.\u201d Gabrielle\u2019s voice. Hoarse. Strained.</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d he snapped at the others. He set it on speaker and turned the volume up.</p><p>\u201cHe got us\u2014me and Jessica. Taser and drugs. We\u2019re in a big van\u2014cargo-sized. A boat is picking us up at the Clearwater Docks, downtown, in about two hours.\u201d Zachary heard a whisper. Jessica\u2019s voice saying something about tattoos. His heart thumped hard enough to hurt. She was alive.</p><p>Gabi\u2019s message continued, \u201cTwo men. They call each other Cesar and Jang. Jang has gang tattoos covering his arms. Don\u2019t call this number back. It\u2019s their phone.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Galen was already on the phone, barking orders. Vance had his cell out but paused to look at Marcus and Z. \u201cMost women would be in hysterics. Those two are keeping it together. Thinking. Give me a brat any day.\u201d He handed Zachary a slip of paper with a number scrawled on it. \u201cForward the message to this number for a sound analysis. I doubt we\u2019ll get anything useful, but we\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Zachary nodded.</p><p>Marcus tapped his fingers on the table for a second. Then he glanced at Zachary and lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for them to say I can\u2019t help. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>Zachary checked the agents, occupied with their planning. \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Chuffing mufflers, whining motors, the screech of brakes. A car horn. Gabi knew they\u2019d reached the city. The van slowed, sped up, slowed, jarring the cuffs on her wrists, making them burn. More blood trickled down her arm.</p><p>Jang stepped into the cargo section, leaving the door open. Holding a rag and a roll of duct tape, he walked over to her.</p><p>Her heart hammered against her ribs. They were in the city, people around. Probably going too fast for anyone to hear them. Still... Don\u2019t miss a chance. We\u2019ll die anyway. She screamed as loud as she could, and Jessica joined her a second later.</p><p>He backhanded Gabi. Her head snapped back, her cheek flaring with pain.</p><p>Then he kicked Jessica in the stomach. Her groan made him laugh before he turned back to Gabi.</p><p>\u201cWatch the merchandise, asshole,\u201d Cesar yelled.</p><p>Her face on fire with pain, Gabi struggled, jamming her shoulder against him, trying to knock him away. Jang seized her jaw and forced her mouth open. He stuffed a filthy rag in. Despite her attempts to head butt him, he got several strips of duct tape across her face, muffling her completely. When he stood up, she managed to twist far and fast enough to kick his knee. He shouted and staggered back.</p><p>With a filthy curse, he evaded her feet and slapped her hard to the floor. Her head struck, a hammer blow reverberating in her brain.</p><p>His boot caught her in the ribs. A firebomb of pain burst through her. She retched and choked, unable to inhale.</p><p>\u201cIf you puke with a gag on, you\u2019ll die, bitch.\u201d He watched for a second, grinning, then cuffed her hands behind her back.</p><p>Too dizzy to sit up, Gabi lay on her side, lungs heaving for air. Don\u2019t throw up. She could only breathe though her nose. I\u2019m suffocating... Stars filled her vision. Slow breath. Slow breath. More stars wheeled in the black sky. Helpless.</p><p>Jang had moved to Jessica, but Gabi couldn\u2019t help. She heard a thud and a high cry of pain, then footsteps. Gabi lay still, heart rate easing as she drew air in. Carefully. Don\u2019t panic.</p><p>A few minutes later, the van pulled to a halt, and the engine stopped.</p><p>\u201cThe boat here?\u201d Jang asked.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t called yet. The storm probably slowed them down. At least the rain will cut down the number of people on the docks.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re at the docks. Once on a boat, there\u2019d be no escape. God. Gabi\u2019s fear rose until she strangled with it, but she pushed it away. If she panicked, she\u2019d die. Think, stupid. Could she get to her feet?</p><p>\u201cBox the redhead first,\u201d Cesar said.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking ankle cuffs, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Cesar narrowed his eyes and stared a second. \u201cUse duct tape and the chain. Hogtie them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Jang turned to Gabi. Too nauseated to fight back, she lay still as he did a couple of turns of duct tape around her ankles. He used the chain to secure her feet close to the handcuffs. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>She tried to wiggle, tried to move, and had to force panic down again. Jessica met her gaze, and she gave Gabi a sharp nod. Not giving up yet. Neither would Gabi.</p><p>\u201cOne little trip left, chickies, and then you can scream yourselves blue,\u201d Cesar said from the driver\u2019s seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You bastard.</p><p>\u201cWe gonna have some time before the boat shows?\u201d Jang asked.</p><p>\u201cYou think your dick's going to work by then?\u201d Cesar gave a nasty laugh.</p><p>Jang touched his crotch gingerly and growled something foul.</p> <p>Please let his cock stay limp. She stared at his crotch. As long as she was wishing, let it rot and fall off too. Please.</p><p>Cesar stepped into the cargo area, sliding a pistol into one overall pocket. He pulled the washing machine labels off the sides of the box, leaving only THIS SIDE UP markings. \u201cLet\u2019s get her loaded.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Gabi under the shoulders, Jang grabbed under her thighs, and they hefted her up. They lowered her most of the way into the box, then dropped her the last couple of feet, knocking the air out of her. Lights danced in her vision until she managed a breath.</p><p>\u201cTape it shut?\u201d Jang asked, leering down at her, lips pulled back to show yellowing teeth.</p><p>I\u2019m so glad I kicked your balls into your throat.</p> <p>\u201cSlap on a couple of strips to keep the top closed. I don\u2019t want to fuck around with peeling tape off between loads.\u201d</p><p>The flaps shut, leaving her in darkness. Her heart hammered, and blood pounded in her veins so loudly she barely heard Jang apply the tape to the top.</p><p>\u201cFucking shitheads, if they got delayed, they should have called.\u201d Cesar\u2019s voice came faintly through the box.</p><p>Take your time, boat. Gabi arched backward until her spine felt as if it would snap, and managed to touch the duct tape wrapped around her ankles. She inched a finger along the tape, swearing silently. The chain holding her wrists to her ankles had rolled much of the tape over, rendering it untearable. Dammit. I only need an inch or two\u2014and a little time.</p><p>A cell phone rang. \u201cYeah.\u201d Cesar\u2019s voice. \u201cGot it. Be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTying up now,\u201d Cesar said, satisfaction thick in his voice.</p><p>Boots thumped into the cargo area, and Gabi heard the rattle as the back of the van slid up.</p><p>\u201cGet the ramp. I\u2019ll take her and tell them I got an extra,\u201d Cesar said. \u201cHave Blondie ready to go for when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Gabi wanted to groan\u2014she\u2019d just found an uncurled area of the duct tape. She ripped at it.</p><p>The box tilted, dislodging her grip. They\u2019d put it onto the hand trolley, Gabi realized. She frantically tried again as things scraped on the box\u2014straps securing it. The floor of the box came up, sliding her sideways, as the trolley thumped down the ramp. She heard a metallic rattle as someone pulled the van door down.</p><p>Soft tapping noises confused her. Rain? She twisted to reach the tape again. The cart rolled erratically, ruining her grip.</p><p>Eventually the grating of wheels on the street changed, and she heard the lapping of water. They\u2019d reached the dock.</p><p>God, she was out of time. The cart bumped over something, tilting slightly, and she blinked. Maybe...</p> <p>Motion stopped. Low voices.</p><p>Gabi squirmed until her feet faced forward, then rolled over her cuffed hands to hit the side of the box with her knees and head. The cart rocked slightly. She rolled back to thump harder into the other side.</p><p>The box dented. Cesar cursed.</p><p>The Clearwater Downtown Docks were way too big. Cursing under his breath, Marcus wiped rain out of his eyes. Thunder rumbled, drowning out the hum of traffic on the Memorial Causeway Bridge that loomed high over the waterside. He could feel time disappearing, and his gut knotted more with each unrecoverable minute.</p><p>How the hell was he supposed to differentiate a boat doing the pickup from an innocent one? Despite the weather, the place was busy\u2014mostly Sunday sailors and those that knew a good rainstorm helped fishing.</p><p>A yacht chugged away in a billow of blue-gray smoke. He stiffened. What if Gabi was on board? If they were too late?</p><p>He saw Vance and other agents on the adjacent docks. He and Z had already been prowling the wharf when the FBI had arrived. Accepting the inevitable, Vance had given them assignments. Z to the south parking lot, another agent to the north to search for the cargo van among the daunting number of vehicles. After seeing the size of the waterfront, Galen had gotten back in his car to call in the Clearwater police.</p><p>Glancing at craft after craft, Marcus kept walking. At the end slip, two men in dark green slickers and jeans finished tying up their fishing boat. One stepped onto the dock and leaned against a concrete post, arms folded.</p><p>Marcus studied the vessel for a minute. Lower hatch open. Nothing showed inside. No noises. And he knew anything and anyone might be stashed in there. With a growing sense of despair, he headed back.</p><p>A man in overalls, pushing a box on a hand trolley, veered around him.</p><p>Marcus nodded to him and stopped after a few steps. That\u2019s a very big box. He turned.</p><p>The man from the fishing boat stepped forward to greet the delivery man. As they shook hands, the box on the trolley rocked slightly, and one side dented outward.</p><p>The man cursed and slapped his hand on the box.</p><p>Fury raged through Marcus, searing the blood in his veins. He hesitated\u2014if he yelled, the boat would get away. But he couldn\u2019t risk them loading whoever was in the box...</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d he roared, the sound echoing across the water. \u201cVance, here!\u201d</p><p>As the men turned, he slammed into both, knocking them away from the box. They staggered back. The hand trolley tipped over, landing right on the edge of the dock. A cart wheel caught, hung for a second, and the weight of the box dragged it toward the water below.</p><p>God. Marcus made a frantic grab for the wheel, seized it, and yanked the trolley and the strapped-on box back. The cart clanged onto the concrete dock. From the corner of his eyes, he saw a pipe swinging straight for his head. He jerked back. The metal grazed his skull. Pain exploded in his head, and his vision sheeted to red. He lurched sideways.</p><p>From instinct alone, he managed to block the next blow, spotted another incoming, and kicked the man in overalls to his knees.</p><p>\u201cHere! Vance here!\u201d Zachary spun toward Marcus\u2019s shouts. Hope outraced the rush of adrenaline.</p><p>A man near the end of the parking lot stepped out of a van to stare at the docks. Tank top\u2014tattooed arms. Zachary broke into a run.</p><p>The man spotted him. He swung back into the cab and slammed the door shut.</p><p>Zachary tore across the lot. \u201cGalen! Over here!\u201d Too far, dammit, too far. The van started with a roar and backed out of the parking space. Tires squealed as the truck accelerated toward the exit lane at the end.</p><p>Zachary cursed. He\u2019d never catch it. Sirens wailed in the distance\u2014too far away.</p><p>Nearing the end, the van swerved sharply, skidded, and rammed into a parked car. And stalled.</p><p>What the hell? Zachary raced toward the van. He heard the rrrr of an attempt to start the engine. Through the side window, he saw the driver. Blood trickled from his nose.</p><p>A foot materialized out of nowhere and booted the man in the face. Two people. One in the passenger seat.</p><p>Zachary slid into the side of the van with a hard thud. He pulled open the driver\u2019s door.</p><p>The driver struck at him backhanded.</p><p>Grabbing the arm, Zachary yanked him out onto the pavement. The man staggered, caught himself. Spinning around, he punched.</p><p>Zachary blocked the incompetent blow, seized his arm, twisted up and back. A crunch of bone and gristle\u2014dislocated.</p><p>Screaming in pain, the guy swung blindly. Taking a quick side step, Zachary buried his fist in a soft belly. With an explosive grunt, the driver folded in half. Zachary rammed his knee into the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>Another crunch. Another scream. And not nearly enough.</p><p>His knee had straightened the bastard up sufficiently for another punch. Zachary was happy to oblige. He channeled his rage in a fist to the ribs. The satisfying crackle of bones breaking, caving in\u2014and the way the man\u2019s eyes rolled back in his head\u2014dissipated Zachary\u2019s fury.</p><p>The bastard fell. Out cold.</p><p>The harsh snapping of gunfire coming from the docks tightened his gut. Marcus hadn\u2019t been armed. But Zachary\u2019s job was here.</p><p>He stepped toward the driver\u2019s side. Cautiously. He\u2019d recognized those feet, and his kitten would be pretty upset.</p><p>Blonde hair in a tangle, Jessica lay half-sprawled across the passenger seat. Hands behind her back. Duct tape over her mouth. Green eyes blazing. Legs up, ready to kick a man into hell and beyond.</p><p>Damn, he loved her.</p><p>She saw him, and her eyes widened. The look she gave him\u2014fury and relief and love...oh yes, there was love there\u2014made his world right again.</p><p>He inclined his head and smiled. \u201cRough day, huh?\u201d</p><p>She choked on a hysterical-sounding laugh, obviously recognizing the question from the night they\u2019d first met.</p><p>Swinging into the cab, he helped her sit up. His fury ignited again at the bruises on her cheek, the ripped skin on her wrists. But she was alive. Safe. He buried his face in her hair for a self-indulgent moment.</p><p>Gabi\u2019d heard Marcus shouting before her box had gone crazy, toppling and spinning and swinging. Her head still whirled. Her shoulder sockets felt wrenched from landing on her cuffed hands. The box lay on its side, and cracks of light showed through the torn flaps.</p><p>Was Marcus really here?</p><p>Must get out. She inched her fingers down the duct tape again. There, an intact edge. Fighting the handcuffs, she managed to get the tape between her fingertips and ripped. It tore\u2014oh God, yes! The chain, looped around the cuffs and tape, came loose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frantic with the need to get free, she scissored her legs to peel the rest of the torn tape from her ankles. Her wrists were still cuffed behind her, but move, move, move. She squirmed to the end of the box and kicked the flaps. The top burst open, and Gabi rolled out.</p><p>Too much light. Her skull blared with pain. Rain splattered against her. On the wharf, men were yelling and running toward the docks. She turned her head. Cesar sprawled on the dock near her. Farther away, men fighting. Grunts and curses. The figures blurred, cleared.</p><p>Marcus. A man in a slicker swung a thick metal pipe at him, and Gabi screamed behind the gag.</p><p>No, please, no. She struggled to rise. The blow missed Marcus somehow, and he hit the man, knocking him back.</p> <p>In front of Gabi, Cesar pushed to his feet and drew the pistol from his overalls.</p><p>No! Gabi pulled her legs under her and dove at Cesar. Her shoulder slammed into the back of his knees. His legs buckled, and he yelled as he toppled backward.</p><p>A ton of weight landed on her back, almost yanking her arms from the sockets. Her knees scraped the concrete. Mouth still taped, she struggled for air.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d Cesar rolled off, lunged for the pistol just out of his reach. Sucking in air, she twisted and kicked his leg, sending him to his knees. A moment of satisfaction.</p><p>Face contorted with rage, he lurched toward her. Oh God. She rolled frantically away, over her bound arms.</p> <p>\u201cGabi!\u201d Marcus yanked her to her feet and whirled her aside. A pipe flew past her head. A man turned and ran toward a boat slowly pulling out of the slip.</p><p>Dizzy, Gabi staggered sideways. She caught her balance and turned back toward the men. Her breath stopped as Cesar pointed the pistol directly at her. \u201cYou fucking cunt.\u201d</p><p>?Fucking cunt.? Hands tearing her clothing, yelling horrible names... Gabi\u2019s body froze as her brain went blank. Marcus\u2019s yell, \u201cGabi, down!\u201d hit the surface of her mind and bounced away.</p><p>A brutal shove knocked her to one side. She hit the ground hard, breaking the paralysis. Marcus blocked her view of Cesar.</p><p>The sharp crack of a pistol shattered the air. Marcus made a low, horrible sound and jolted back, turning slightly. Blood, terrifyingly red, stained his light shirt. Growing bigger.</p><p>Nooo.</p> <p>Snapping sounds like a multitude of fireworks deafened her, and Cesar screamed. He fell.</p><p>Cursing and yelling. Men\u2014many men\u2014thudded down the dock.</p><p>Marcus. She tried to sit up, failed, tried again. Oh please.</p><p>Cesar lay, eyes open. A uniformed cop stopped beside him, then kicked the pistol farther away. Another man yelled for an ambulance.</p><p>Still standing, Marcus had his hand pressed to his shoulder, and blood in a nightmarish flood flowed between his fingers. He\u2019s hurt. God no. Gabi choked, rolled onto her knees, trying frantically to stand with legs that had no strength.</p><p>Someone grabbed her shoulders, holding her. Hands touching her. No no no. A tidal wave of terror took her, and she fought blindly, yanking her wrists, unable to scream.</p><p>The hands released her. She was free...and Marcus was there, his face filling her vision. She blinked. Not dreaming. Rain ran down her cheeks like tears as his warm fingers curled around her bare shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sugar. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re safe, sweetheart.\u201d His voice, like no one else\u2019s, convinced her.</p> <p>Her heart still raced, but she could only stare at him. He\u2019s alive. She tried to talk and choked on the gag.</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d he said under his breath, as he peeled the duct tape off her lips ever so slowly.</p><p>\u201cSir, you\u2019re hurt.\u201d A man bobbed at his elbow.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d Marcus pulled the rag out of her mouth. When she sucked in air, his eyes crinkled at the edges. \u201cThere, now you can sass all you want.\u201d</p><p>As he touched her face with gentle fingers, someone knelt behind her and gripped her arms. She jerked, trying to escape, but Marcus held her shoulders, murmuring, \u201cEasy, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>Handcuffs. The man was unlocking her handcuffs. She held still, barely breathing, ignoring the pain as he pulled away the metal that had dug into her flesh. \u201cThere you go, sweetie.\u201d She knew that voice.</p><p>As she brought her arms forward, the wrench of agony in her shoulders mattered not at all. Free.</p><p>Vance stepped out from behind her. \u201cI want a blanket for this woman, and get this man to the hospital,\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou asshole,\u201d he said to Marcus. \u201cSit down before you fall down.\u201d</p><p>He looked so white.</p><p>Gabi sat next to Marcus\u2019s bed with her arm pushed through the side rails so she could hold his hand. He had intravenous lines in his arm, and wires ran to a monitor showing his heart rate. She tried not to stare at the display, terrified the lines would suddenly go straight like they did in the movies.</p><p>But he\u2019d made it through surgery, right? If he was in danger, the doctor'd have sent him to the ICU, not a surgical unit. Right?</p><p>\u201cGod, I hate hospitals,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cWake up, dammit. They said you woke up in recovery. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long, long day. When Marcus had been wheeled out of the emergency room, she\u2019d pulled out her IV and followed. Sitting in the surgery waiting room, she\u2019d stared at the television set and had seen horror instead. The gun. \u201cGabi, down!\u201d Marcus stepping in front of her. Staggering back. The blood.</p><p>My fault.</p><p>When his grandparents had arrived, the nurses had freely offered up information about the progress of the surgery, so Gabi had moved closer to eavesdrop. She\u2019d regretted it when the older couple started discussing the girlfriend they\u2019d met in June, Celine, and arguing whether to call her. Thank God, the grandfather had said no.</p><p>The waiting had been interminable. Unable to sit still, she\u2019d cuddled a teenage girl whose mother was in surgery after a car accident, then comforted an old woman whose husband wasn\u2019t likely to survive.</p><p>After Marcus left the recovery room, his grandparents had sat with him for a while, then gone to make calls and get something to eat...and Gabi had slipped in.</p><p>Would he ever wake up?</p><p>Voices in the hallway caught her attention. Galen\u2019s clipped New England accent and Vance\u2019s rumbling baritone. Damn them. They were undoubtedly looking for her and would drag her back to the emergency room to finish getting treated. But she couldn\u2019t leave Marcus. Not yet. Not until she saw him awake.</p><p>So maybe she wasn\u2019t firing on all cylinders right now, but she didn\u2019t care. He had to wake up. She had to say she was sorry.</p><p>She limped into the tiny bathroom to hide. Too dizzy to stand long, she sat on the toilet and waited.</p><p>Once they left, she resumed her vigil. She stayed upright, afraid of falling asleep. Her head felt like someone was pounding on it with a mallet. Her jaw didn\u2019t want to open. She fingered it and winced. With every movement, her shoulders screamed as if they were hinges that had rusted shut after a decade in the rain. And her ribs... Well, although the X-rays said cracked, not broken, she sure couldn\u2019t tell the difference. Damn Jang anyway.</p><p>None of her injuries compared to a bullet in the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marcus. So, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t frozen, if she\u2019d jumped away, he wouldn\u2019t have stepped in front of her and gotten shot. She put her head into her hands and moaned. Be all right, please. Just be all right. Once she saw him awake, she\u2019d leave and do whatever Galen and Vance needed. She wouldn\u2019t stay\u2014he wouldn\u2019t want to see her.</p><p>She was just another trainee. One he\u2019d felt he had to protect. He could have died.</p><p>More minutes ticked by.</p><p>Marcus groaned.</p><p>Gabi jerked upright and moaned as pain battered her nerves. She leaned forward, her hand clamping around his.</p><p>His eyelids fluttered. He looked at her, his gaze unfocused. But awake. Alive.</p><p>Thank you, God. Oh thank you.</p><p>She managed to stand. Bracing herself on the side rail, she touched his face. Warm. She ran her finger over the scratchy beard stubble, slightly darker than his hair, and traced a darkening bruise on his forehead. Beat-up...but alive.</p><p>His eyes cleared, and he frowned at the room, the IV stand, and the monitors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital,\u201d she told him, her guilt so heavy she had trouble speaking. \u201cYou got shot\u2014because of me. But you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>When she released his fingers, his hand turned over to capture hers. He tried to speak, then cleared his throat. His voice rasped, the smoothness gone. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She choked. \u201cOh yeah. You\u2019re the one who got shot.\u201d Her throat constricted until her voice sounded as rough as his. \u201cIt should have been me. I\u2019m sorry, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He tried to say something, but she couldn\u2019t take more. She brushed a kiss to his cheek. \u201cGood-bye, Marcus,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She limped out of the room as fast as she could. With relief, she spotted his grandparents coming down the hall. He wouldn\u2019t be alone. Averting her gaze, she made for the elevators. A wave of dizziness crashed over her, and blackness edged the corners of her vision. No. Passing out not allowed, Gabi.</p><p>Everything was finished now. The case. Her stay in Tampa. Her time with Marcus.</p><p>She wanted to go home.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>The sound of songbirds in the garden drifted in through the open window of Zachary\u2019s bedroom, and he smiled at the peaceful melodies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Snuggled in the bedding, Jessica breathed slowly, still deep in sleep. One half-curled hand nestled under a round cheek. Her long golden hair spilled over the pillow, the light strands glowing against the dark fabric.</p><p>Just as she glowed like a beacon in his dark life. He pulled his chair closer and wrapped his hand around her delicate fingers. Did she have any clue how much she meant to him? He worked with children, sad, broken, abused children who\u2019d seen more horror in their short lives than most adults. Sometimes to heal, they needed to know someone\u2014anyone\u2014understood their sorrow and rage and confusion. He\u2019d listen. He\u2019d take in their pain and release them of some of the burden.</p><p>But pain accumulated, and even the love of friends and family hadn\u2019t been able to lift his increasing sadness. Then Jessica erupted like a small hurricane into his life. Her keen intelligence and logical mind was balanced by her spirit, her courage\u2014and her love. She reminded him that the world held as much good as it did evil.</p><p>God, he\u2019d almost lost her today. His shoulders tightened. Leaning forward, he pushed her hair away from her face. Silky hair\u2014soft, soft cheek.</p> <p>When she blinked, he cursed himself for his lack of discipline. She needed the sleep.</p><p>Her hands fisted, and she stiffened. He felt her fear, saw it overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cJessica,\u201d he said in a level, clear voice.</p><p>Her eyes focused on his face, and he saw\u2014felt\u2014relief flood through her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, kitten,\u201d he said, affirming it verbally.</p><p>She pulled in a breath, looked at the room, the bed, the window. When her eyes met his again, her smile blossomed. \u201cYou saved me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you might have managed to save yourself.\u201d</p><p>She considered it, his logical sub, and shook her head. \u201cNo. If you hadn\u2019t come, he\u2019d have won eventually. I was cuffed. Even if I\u2019d gotten out of the van, I couldn\u2019t run. Not after hurting my ankle.\u201d She pouted. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I sprained it when I kicked his face, but I think the steering wheel did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodthirsty little sub,\u201d Zachary murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh sure. I saw Jang after you got through. I didn\u2019t do nearly as much damage.\u201d</p><p>Zachary\u2019s hands closed as if he had the man\u2019s neck in his grasp. He should have bloodied him a little more.</p><p>She smiled at him, her green eyes glinting with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to be a hero. Saving the subs like a proper dom.\u201d</p> <p>Saving. He frowned. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have needed saving or been anywhere near those men. Jessica, why did you leave last night without speaking to me?\u201d</p><p>He caught a flash of oh shit before she stalled. \u201cWell.\u201d Obviously needing to be on a more equal level, she pushed up in the bed and winced.</p><p>Dammit. He couldn\u2019t stand seeing her in pain. Grasping her under the arms, he gently pulled her up in the bed and tucked pillows behind her back. Her face had paled. Nonetheless, he couldn\u2019t put off this talk any longer. They\u2019d had enough silence between them. His jaw clenched. If she wanted to leave, he needed to know. \u201cNow tell me. Why?\u201d</p><p>She looked down and fingered the abrasions from the damned metal handcuffs the kidnapper had used. \u201cThings had... You haven\u2019t been the same. For a while. You\u2019ve acted so...distant. And mad at me. Every time I sassed you or anyone at the club, you\u2019d gag me as if you didn\u2019t want to hear me. I knew you were unhappy. I thought it was because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zachary, let me finish.\u201d</p><p>Zachary. He rarely heard her use his real name. Usually only in bed or when she was moved, as if it had special meaning to her. He took her hand. Everything in him wanted to object that she\u2019d not understood, to coax her to let him fix it and make it right, to help her understand their relationship wasn\u2019t broken completely. Instead he tilted his head and kept silent.</p><p>\u201cI saw you with Gabi. I could tell you had a secret, the two of you. And you treated her...differently...than the other subs. Almost like you treat me.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amount of caring you show me...her...is exponentially higher,\u201d said his little mathematician. \u201cMore protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stared at her hands again. \u201cAnd then I met your sons.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cEric doesn\u2019t approve of me. He obviously thinks you should find someone more\u2014more like you. I\u2019m just an accountant, from a middle-class family. I\u2019m not rich or sophisticated or beautiful, and I\u2019ve seen pictures of your ex. She is. If Eric can\u2019t get you back with his mother, he wants you to have someone classier...and older.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Eric saw first with his eyes, not his heart.</p><p>\u201cSo. I felt like you\u2019d pulled away, not wanting me around\u2014you even told me not to come to the club\u2014and I was jealous. And insecure. I thought maybe you had second thoughts about being with me.\u201d</p><p>Past tense. She\u2019d used the past tense. \u201cYou know differently now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. I understand about Gabi being a decoy, and you wanted to keep me from getting targeted. But that still doesn\u2019t... Nolan and Beth are engaged. Dan and Kari are married and having a baby. And they all met after we did.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face. The best-meant ideas didn\u2019t always work out in the way a person expected. \u201cJessica, as my boy so kindly pointed out, I\u2019m older than you are. I have grown children. You\u2019re just starting your life, kitten, and I don\u2019t want to push you into something you might regret. Especially since a person first entering the lifestyle can confuse the desire to be dominated with desire for the dom.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, and then her eyes narrowed. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a relationship because you think I\u2019m too young? God, Z, I\u2019m thirty. How old do I have to be to know my own mind?\u201d</p><p>The sparks lighting her eyes delighted him\u2014she was rapidly returning to normal\u2014but he had enough experience with women to realize that if he smiled, she\u2019d throw something at him. \u201cI might have been overly cautious,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so. I\u2019m still here, aren\u2019t I? I know where the door is, and I know how to say \u201eno thanks.\" You\u2019re being stupid. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his chair, a bit stunned. Her cheeks had flushed with\u2014ah, that was definitely anger. And there wasn\u2019t a single doubt in her mind. Well, then.</p><p>Uh, oh. He\u2019d gotten a look on his face that boded no good for her, yet everything in her rejoiced because the expression wasn\u2019t that of a man who was bored with his girlfriend, but the possessive look of a dom.</p><p>She winced. Had she really called him stupid?</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I have this straight,\u201d he said in a chillingly smooth voice. \u201cYou want a commitment. And do you want children to go with that?\u201d</p><p>She sputtered. \u201cYou make it sound like, \u2018Here\u2019s your order. Do you want fries with that?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes, I want fries\u2014I mean children. With you.\u201d Telling him about her hopes made her feel as if she stood naked on a cliff in a cold wind. Why could they discuss everything else, but this...this seemed harder? \u201cI want at least one baby, maybe two. And considering how rude one of your kids is, I\u2019ll probably do a better job of motherhood than your ex.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched as if he\u2019d started to smile. But this baring the soul was too one-sided, and she faltered. \u201cW-would you want more children?\u201d</p><p>He steepled his fingers and gave her a level look over the top. \u201cJessica, I work with children. I like children. And I\u2019d enjoy actually being present this time. I\u2019ve always regretted being out of the country so much when Eric and Richard were growing up.\u201d</p><p>Oh. She breathed out as her ballooning anxiety started to deflate. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. And maybe I should add that Eric asked me to convey his apologies for his rudeness.\u201d Z smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll come around, kitten. Now go on, give me the rest.\u201d</p><p>The rest. She mustered her thoughts, lined up his objections. Her wants had been tabulated; she needed to sum it all up. Like their ages. The idiot.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re older. Not much, really. And considering you love staying in shape and I refuse to run, we\u2019ll probably get all old and crippled at the same time. If not, then I\u2019ll learn to use a cane, and I\u2019ll get to beat on your ass for a change.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, actually laughed, and she grinned. Maybe her hopes wouldn\u2019t materialize, but she felt the healing between them, the sense of rightness return.</p><p>\u201cYou are an awful submissive,\u201d he said softly. \u201cQuite the brat. Are you going to also address that small problem of yours now?\u201d</p><p>She hunched her shoulders. He was tired of her mouthiness, wasn\u2019t he? Her hopes shriveled. Then she remembered what Gabi had said: \u201cNo wonder Z adores you.\u201d The jerk was playing his psychology tricks on her. She pushed her hair back over her shoulder and wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cNope. You like me as I am.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, smiling faintly. \u201cNo, Jessica\u2014I love you as you are.\u201d He rose and stripped the covers right off her, and she realized he\u2019d removed her clothes when he\u2019d helped her to bed. She squeaked and instinctively grabbed for the sheet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grasping her forearms, avoiding the sore spots from the cuffs, he looked into her eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t restrain you...today...since you\u2019ve had enough of that. Instead, you will turn over and kneel. Hold on to the head of the bed. Open your legs to me. For every time you move from that position, I\u2019ll add another swat from Mistress Anne\u2019s favorite paddle.\u201d</p><p>She winced. The domme had a paddle with MINE carved out, so a smack not only pinkened a butt cheek but left raised white areas spelling out the word. He watched, his jaw stern, as she rolled over onto her knees and grabbed the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWider, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. But she felt moisture gather between her legs and how her heart rate hammered. She looked over her shoulder and saw his gray eyes darken with pleasure as he looked at her. Her excitement skyrocketed. His ruthless hands opened her even more widely, and then he touched her, running his fingers through her folds, teasing her clit until she squirmed. Dammit, a year ago he\u2019d scared her with how well he could play her body. Now he was terrifying.</p> <p>She heard him unbuckle his belt and open his slacks. He came up behind her, his knees between hers. The coarse hair on his thighs teased her buttocks. Oh God, she needed him so badly, she whimpered.</p><p>He pulled her back against his chest, turning her slightly. Threading his fingers in her hair, he tethered her as he took her mouth, his lips firm, his kiss blatantly hard and possessive until she felt as if she was drowning in sensation. Held by his fist in her hair, his mouth, she couldn\u2019t move as his free hand played with her breasts. He teased her until they swelled, and each pinch of her nipples sent a sizzling current of electricity to her pussy.</p><p>Until her need stretched out past endurance. She burned. When her bottom pushed back against his thick erection, he freed her lips long enough to let her whine. \u201cPleeease.\u201d</p><p>His almost painful grip on her hair kept her head tilted up and back as he studied her for a long moment. Her sex throbbed in time with her pulse; her urgency grew. Then he rubbed his cheek against hers. \u201cI believe I\u2019d like to hear more begging first.\u201d And he released her hair, sliding his hand to her pussy instead. He caged her there, one hand rolling her nipples as his other traced figure eights around her clit and entrance. Too light, dammit.</p><p>He changed to firm, slow strokes. Too slow, dammit. Sadistically, he drove her upward at a snail\u2019s pace until she reached the edge, her legs trembling, her head back against his shoulder, her hands white-knuckled from trying not to shift position.</p> <p>\u201cGod, please.\u201d</p><p>His finger paused and then resumed circling her clit. She pushed her hips forward. If he\u2019d just go over the top of it...</p><p>He released her breast and set his hard arm across her pelvis, pinning her tightly against him, permitting her bottom no movement at all. His finger circled again.</p><p>Her whole body shook. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. Please.\u201d She used her ultimate weapon. \u201cMaster, please, I love you...\u201d</p><p>His low, satisfied laugh almost sent her over. \u201cClever little sub,\u201d he murmured in her ear and nipped her earlobe. When he took his hand from her pussy, she groaned in frustration.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He swirled his cock in her wetness and brushed the velvety head against her clit.</p> <p>Oh yes. She held her breath. Please please please.</p><p>And then he drove into her with a long, heavy thrust, filling her to the point of pain.</p><p>\u201cAaaah.\u201d So thick and hard and... She strangled on the next cry, panting at the incredible feeling of him, at the way her body melted under his firm hands.</p><p>Merciless thrusts bent her forward. Only her grip on the headboard and his iron-hard arm across her pelvis kept her upright. He pushed her knees farther apart and set a finger on either side of her clit so each powerful thrust tightened the skin over it and sent forks of desperate pleasure careening through her body. Her toes curled, and her fingernails squeezed the headboard, the need to come building higher.</p><p>Something was different, but she couldn\u2019t think, her attention narrowed until she felt only his fingers stroking over her clit and the thick, hot slide of his cock. He held her right at the edge as she shook uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cTradition says a man should be on his knees when he proposes,\u201d he murmured in her ear and pushed farther inside her until she moaned.</p><p>Wait. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a traditional man, after all.\u201d He kissed the little spot right under her ear, sending goose bumps over her skin. \u201cI love you, kitten. Will you marry me?\u201d</p> <p>He drove into her harder, until she felt the jolt of each thrust deep in her belly. And then he slowed, leaving her teetering on the precipice of an orgasm. \u201cAnswer me now, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>Her vision blurred as she only clung to this world by her fingertips. Oh God. \u201cYes. Yes, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d His rhythm changed. His thick cock stretched her with each deep plunge, and as he withdrew, his finger would slide up and over her clit. Her engorged nub tightened more and more, and her pussy clenched around him. Her orgasm rolled toward her as inevitable as the turning of the tide.</p><p>She poised on the crest for one agonizing second, and then her insides exploded into pleasure so intense the room blurred and only his hard hands seemed to hold her in this universe. She convulsed around him, wave after wave consuming her until even her fingers tingled with the sensations.</p><p>As she gasped for air, he murmured into her ear, \u201cHowever, when we\u2019re old, I will still keep the cane.\u201d</p><p>Her choked laugh turned to a yelp when he pinched her clit...and she came again.</p><p>A second later, he drove into her far enough to bump against her womb. His hands tightened on her hips. As he pulsed inside her and his heat filled her, she realized what had changed.</p><p>She\u2019d heard no crinkling sound of a condom wrapper. His cock felt different\u2014velvety and hot and real.</p><p>His big hand splayed over her abdomen, and in a dangerously low voice, he murmured, \u201cWe\u2019ll get started on those children right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Atherton.\u201d</p><p>Marcus forced his eyes open. A figure blurred, then came into focus. A gray-haired nurse, wearing green scrubs with pink dancing bears. She pulled his covers down to his waist. White gauze dressings covered his shoulder, and it hurt.</p><p>Some of the fog cleared from his brain. He\u2019d been shot. Had surgery. His mouth felt like it had the day after he\u2019d discovered tequila. \u201cUh.\u201d He swallowed and tried again. \u201cGood morning. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded at a clock on the wall. \u201cStill early. My name is Mary, and I\u2019m your nurse today. Your doctor should be in soon to do the first dressing change. Can you give me a number for how much pain you\u2019re in\u2014on a scale of one to ten, where one is almost nothing?\u201d</p><p>His shoulder hurt like hell. \u201cAbout a three.\u201d</p><p>She gave a gravelly laugh. \u201cYou men. Try again and be honest this time.\u201d</p><p>With a wry smile, he admitted, \u201cSeven.\u201d She\u2019d make a good domme.</p><p>\u201c\"Bout what I figured.\u201d She held up a little device attached to the IV. \u201cI showed you this yesterday, but I doubt if you remember.\u201d She pushed the button. \u201cI just gave you a dose, and you should feel better in a minute or two. Next time, when your pain hits around four or so, push the button. It won\u2019t let you punch it too many times, so you can\u2019t overdose. Got it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and realized his head hurt too. Damn pipe-wielding bastard.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast will arrive shortly. And your grandparents said they\u2019d visit this morning, if you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Had Gabi been with him? \u201cWas anyone else here yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cA very beat-up and exhausted young woman kept you company from the minute your grandparents left the room until they returned.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure that she\u2019d cared enough to watch over him was swamped by his concern. \u201cShe should have been in a hospital bed herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t about to budge. She even dodged the Feds looking for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn little brat,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The nurse smiled and turned her attention to getting his temperature and checking his lungs. By the time she left, the pain medication had kicked in, and he sighed in relief. Nasty things, bullets. They\u2019d been lucky though; he and Gabi could easily have died. Instead she was battered but alive. And this hole in his shoulder would heal up fast enough.</p><p>For a few minutes, he worked on separating his anesthetic-induced dreams from reality. Too much of yesterday seemed like a nightmare\u2014his fear that they\u2019d arrive too late, that Gabi\u2019d be hurt. The box sliding off the dock. Hell, it had all been too close. Another couple of minutes and the boat would have left with her on it. The thought darkened the room for a moment.</p><p>He touched the side of his head, fingering the tender lump. He owed his little trainee his life. Instead of giving up, she\u2019d not only gotten free but flung herself to his rescue. He chuckled, remembering how the bastard had toppled when she tackled him. So brave. No cringing on the ground for his spitfire.</p><p>Or going into hysterics afterward. He still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d snuck in here to check on him. She had incredible loyalty and courage\u2014qualities he\u2019d not considered essential in a lover\u2014but perhaps his vision had been narrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced at the door. Dammit, he wanted to see for himself she was all right.</p><p>He frowned at the memory of her in his room. Blood on a swollen lip, her cheek scraped and raw. Whispering to him, asking him to wake up. \u201cSorry...\u201d Had she said she was sorry? For what?</p><p>\u201cIt should have been me.\u201d His mouth tightened as her low husky voice sang through his memories. What the hell did that mean? His eyes narrowed. She\u2019d kissed him...and said good-bye. Not See you later. Not I\u2019ll visit tomorrow. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>An ominous feeling took up residence in his gut. Spotting a phone, he reached over, stifled a groan when he jarred his shoulder, then dialed. Her number rang and rang before a recording stated it was no longer in service.</p> <p>He scowled, trying to think despite the fogginess from the pain meds. Her phone... Ah, she\u2019d probably received it for the decoy job. He stiffened. What about her apartment? Was she even in Tampa?</p><p>\u201cHey there, boy.\u201d His grandfather stepped into the room and stopped for a thorough scrutiny. A smile creased his leathery face. \u201cYou look better today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Marcus smiled and held his hand out to shake.</p><p>His grandmother followed, bending to give him a gentle hug and kiss. Her eyes teared up. \u201cWe were so worried,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cYour mama called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you told them not to come. Marissa needs them more.\u201d On complete bed rest in the last month of her pregnancy and with two children under five, his sister needed all the help she could get.</p> <p>\u201cThey agreed only if we both call them daily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do attorneys involve themselves in shoot-outs, boy?\u201d Ex-Judge Atherton pulled up a chair, obviously preparing to show he hadn\u2019t lost a jot of his cross-examination skills since retirement.</p><p>\u201cComplicated story.\u201d How to explain his relationship with Gabrielle? \u201cA woman I...know...was kidnapped, and a friend and I assisted in locating her.\u201d Not a bad summary, he decided, then screwed it up by adding, \u201cA bullet is a small price to pay to get her back.\u201d</p><p>His grandmother\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally? Is she the woman we met last June? Celine?\u201d</p><p>Marcus smothered a smile. When Celine had joined them for dinner one evening, his grandparents had been...polite. Their reaction to her had added weight to his decision to step back. He didn\u2019t want a surface-sweet, manipulative woman; he wanted one who\u2019d yell at him to his face, one who could keep him as fascinated as Gramps was with Nana.</p> <p>In the lifestyle, his grandmother would be known as a brat. \u201cNo, Nana, you haven\u2019t met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we likely to?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>He smiled at the thought of a meeting. Gabi had an effect on others like the spring sun on flowers, and it wasn\u2019t because she was a pushover, but because she liked people. Despite her sassy mouth, she cared, and they could feel that. The little brat would probably give his domineering grandfather a rough time, and Gramps would love it. \u201cI very much hope so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she the woman in here yesterday?\u201d Nana asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one was in here with him,\u201d Gramps said.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we returned from the cafeteria? A young lady came out of Marcus\u2019s room.\u201d She paused. \u201cThe same one who sat in the waiting room the entire time we were there.\u201d</p><p>His grandfather frowned, his bushy brows forming one line as he thought. \u201cThe one who kept the little teen from having hysterics?\u201d</p><p>Nana nodded.</p> <p>\u201cCurvy. Fair with light red hair.\u201d He snorted. \u201cAnd a blue streak in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d Marcus said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe looked like somebody beat the hell out of her.\u201d His grandfather\u2019s face hardened. \u201cDid you get the bast\u2014bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d Blue eyes the same color as Marcus\u2019s zeroed in. \u201cYou going to get the girl too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>In her car, Gabi sat in the parking lot of the FBI Tampa field office. This emotional stuff was going to have to end real soon, dammit. She studied her hands. Nice and steady. Her face in the mirror looked calm, despite the yellowing bruises on her cheek and jaw.</p><p>Her insides felt like a pile of scooped-up Jell-O. If Dickhead had told stories about her, well...she\u2019d just have to deal with it. At least she didn\u2019t work in Tampa.</p><p>To her surprise, no one gave her any trouble. On the contrary, the ones who recognized her thanked her and promised they weren\u2019t giving up. No sidelong looks at all.</p><p>\u201cMs. Renard.\u201d</p><p>Gabi stopped in the hallway and turned to see four women in business attire. The one in the lead grinned and held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Marjorie\u2014one of the other decoys. I wanted to congratulate you on the job you did. Agent Kouros kept holding you up as a shining example of getting into the role, and you aren\u2019t even an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t give up,\u201d another younger woman said. \u201cEven when your backup abandoned you.\u201d</p><p>Gabi couldn\u2019t help asking. \u201cI never did hear what happened to Agent Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie snorted. \u201cAgent no longer. Something else we have to thank you for.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cHe said you\u2019d come on to him, blahda-blahda-blah. But, although he managed to side-step written complaints, everyone here knows what kind of an asshole he is. When he tried to lay the blame on you, every woman in the office lined up to set the facts straight. Between the complaints about him, the fact you had to defend yourself, and him leaving you without orders or calling in? He\u2019s history.\u201d</p><p>A tall brunette swept a courtly bow. \u201cAnd the females in this division thank you.\u201d</p><p>Well, there is a God. Gabi grinned. \u201cSounds like I owe you thanks, and you certainly brightened my day.\u201d</p><p>As the women continued down the hall, Gabi opened the door to the office Galen had commandeered. Same dingy decor. He sat at the small table again, talking with Jessica.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d Jessica limped across the room to hug Gabi. \u201cI wanted to visit you in the hospital, but Z wouldn\u2019t let me leave the first day, and these guys\u201d\u2014she wrinkled her nose at Galen\u2014\u201cmonopolized the next morning, and then you disappeared. Where\u2019d you go? Mr. Never-Talk Galen won\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been staying with my parents in Orlando.\u201d Only one more day there and then home for good.</p><p>\u201cAre they vacationing in Disney World?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they live there. My father is a lawyer for Thompson and Dunn International.\u201d An important, dignified job. No scandals allowed. When Galen had called them from her hospital room, she\u2019d heard their revulsion that she was involved in something sordid. It might wipe off on them, right? But Galen had pushed, and her parents had agreed to let her stay in their house.</p><p>She pressed her hand over the cold lump in her stomach. The visit had been...difficult. Somehow, maybe from having almost died, she\u2019d realized down to the bone that they\u2019d never love her. And the only way to obtain their respect would be to turn herself into a pale reflection of them.</p><p>I like myself. Surely if she said it often enough, the pain would diminish. And hey, she had friends who liked her, a grandmother who loved her, clients who needed her. A person could survive without her parents\u2019 love. So get over it already.</p><p>When Gabi smiled, the worried expression on Jessica\u2019s face eased.</p><p>\u201cPlease join us,\u201d Galen said, patting a chair on his right.</p><p>Gabi settled herself in the chair. Carefully. Even several days after the kidnapping, her head still hurt, her body hurt.</p><p>\u201cOne last debriefing with both of you,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me any tidbit, interrupt each other, add in what else you might have heard.\u201d</p><p>By the time they finished, Gabi felt depleted and the aching in her owies had increased an order of magnitude. Then again, she shouldn\u2019t complain. She could be screaming under a whip. Raped. Have someone like Jang...</p><p>Her stomach twisted, and she started to spiral into a panic attack. Breathe. She closed her eyes, trying to get control. Think of something else. Marcus\u2019s voice saying, \u201cEasy, sugar. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re safe, sweetheart.\u201d The way his gaze could take her elsewhere. Breathe.</p><p>Her chest loosened, and she opened her eyes.</p><p>Jessica had taken her hand.</p><p>Galen was frowning. \u201cLet me get you some water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d The panic attacks and emotional crap would improve, she knew. Been there, done that.</p><p>After she\u2019d passed out in the elevator by Marcus\u2019s room, they\u2019d admitted her to the hospital\u2014just like ten years ago. Same old merry-go-round. Hospital stay, interviews by cops and FBI, dumped on her parents to finish recovering. Panic attacks. Eventually a return to normality.</p><p>As Galen handed her the water, Vance walked in. \u201cHey, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Vance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle.\u201d The big agent grinned and came over to gently shake her hand. \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>Gabi snorted, feeling better. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d She took a sip of water, pleased when it went down without difficulty.</p><p>\u201cYou seeing Marcus today?\u201d Vance asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just like that, the water stuck in her throat. She choked and coughed and tried not to whimper at the stabbing pains in her ribs. She said hoarsely, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Vance frowned. \u201cDoes he...?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cFirst things first. Galen, boot up your computer. I have a couple of problems that came up.\u201d</p><p>Galen picked up his cane. \u201cExcuse us, ladies.\u201d</p><p>As the two men moved away, Gabi turned to Jessica. \u201cDid you and Z... Um.\u201d</p> <p>The blonde laughed. \u201cWe definitely ummed. And Gabi? What you said helped\u2014not only the explanation of the kidnapping stuff, but how Z feels about me. We\u2019re getting married. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d Gabi hugged her, ignoring the complaints from her ribs. \u201cThat is the best news I\u2019ve had all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d Jessica bounced in her chair. Then her brows drew together. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s still pretty steamed I left the club that night without him. He said something about putting me in leg shackles.\u201d</p><p>Gabi snickered. \u201cYou poor baby.\u201d After waiting for her voice to steady, she asked, \u201cSo how is Marcus? Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve visited him almost every day\u2014got him groceries and stuff. He seemed a little shocked at first about everybody showing up to help out, but he\u2019s mellowed a lot. Anyway, he\u2019s doing all right, but he\u2019s not supposed to use his arm much. The doctor gave him a sling.\u201d</p> <p>Relief felt like a cool breath of air. \u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well.\u201d Jessica raised her eyebrows. \u201cDid you get hooked on him like all the trainees do?\u201d</p><p>Just another one of the trainees, huh? Gabi assumed a rueful smile. \u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met his girlfriend yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. The lovely Celine made a point of introducing herself.\u201d He deserves so much better.</p><p>\u201cShe would. She goes out of her way to make it clear he belongs to her.\u201d Jessica shrugged. \u201cDamned if I know how she caught him\u2014I still don\u2019t know him that well\u2014but men are really stupid sometimes. Still, she\u2019s the kind of oh-so-sweet sub he likes. Everybody knows he doesn\u2019t like bratty subs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSally mentioned that.\u201d And he told me himself.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot like Sally, you know. I bet if the agents had asked you to be a sweet, passive submissive, you\u2019d have had a lot more trouble playing the part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thanks,\u201d Gabi snapped, then tried to imagine herself being all sweetness and light. Ugh. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You bitch.\u201d</p><p>Jessica giggled. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you ask Marcus to introduce you to a dom who likes brats?\u201d</p><p>Oh sure, and how pitiful would that be? Please, Marcus, if you won\u2019t have me, do you know someone who would? \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m going back to Miami on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to work. I really do. Sitting around is...\u201d Too filled with memories and wishes and disappointments. Between her parents\u2019 disapproval and loving a man who didn\u2019t like her personality, she not only needed a distraction but to surround herself with her friends too\u2014before I throw a pity party to end all parties.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Jessica smiled. \u201cI wanted to go back yesterday, but Z told me I had to wait until Monday. For someone who said he only dominates in the bedroom, he sure gets bossy sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Still, it\u2019s probably better that he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Gabi raised her eyebrows. \u201cIf you think he can\u2019t tell, you are so delusional.\u201d</p><p>Jessica snickered. \u201cPoint to you.\u201d She glanced at her watch and grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d Her hand curled around Gabi\u2019s. \u201cI wish you could stay. When you come back to visit your folks, why don\u2019t you call, and we\u2019ll get together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t visit my parents. I\u2019m only there because Galen wanted me close to Tampa and I was too dizzy to stay alone.\u201d Gabi managed a smile. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty conservative, and...they don\u2019t approve of me. At all.\u201d God, Gabi. Pathetic much?</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jessica frowned. \u201cWell, maybe come back to the Shadowlands for a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica, I don\u2019t think that would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>The blonde\u2019s eyes turned unhappy. \u201cYou really did fall for Marcus, didn\u2019t you? Oh, Gabrielle...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Wouldn\u2019t work...and I agree.\u201d Gabi made a shooing gesture. \u201cGo. Don\u2019t draw this out or we\u2019ll both end up bawling. Galen would be horrified.\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded, gave a quick hug, and hurried out of the room.</p><p>Gabi moved her chair to face the windows and pretended to watch the thunderclouds building up on the horizon. When she had her emotions under control, she turned back around and saw Vance leaning on the desk watching her. Galen had resumed his seat at the table and had the same assessing expression.</p><p>\u201cAre you two through with me?\u201d she asked coolly.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few things left,\u201d Galen said. \u201cYour friend, Kimberly. I\u2019m sorry, Gabrielle. It\u2019s not good. If we can take this organization down, we might be able to trace her. But our best bet\u2014finding them before the auction\u2014didn\u2019t happen.\u201d He looked so unhappy she wanted to pat his hand.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d When she finally accepted the facts\u2014that there was nothing anyone could do\u2014she\u2019d spent a day crying. Grieving. \u201cPlease...just please don\u2019t stop looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we won\u2019t,\u201d Vance said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked away for a second. \u201cSo what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ and the other Masters have all called, wanting to make sure you\u2019re all right. We\u2019ve reassured them that you are.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that the doms had worried warmed her. \u201cThank you. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus has called every day wanting to know how you are and where you are. Wanting your number.\u201d Vance grinned. \u201cHe got pretty damned annoyed when I didn\u2019t hand it over. But regulations say I need your permission. I assume you\u2019re okay with it?\u201d</p><p>She so didn\u2019t want to see him. She\u2019d said good-bye. If she\u2019d had any lingering hopes, Jessica had crumbled them like dead leaves on a vine. She pushed her emotions into a box and shut the lid. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Vance\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job is finished. I\u2019m going to put this behind me, and I\u2019d rather not have any reminders. Please don\u2019t give him\u2014or anyone\u2014my information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcus didn\u2019t sound as if he thought everything was finished,\u201d Vance said slowly.</p><p>Her eyes prickled with unshed tears. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice man. I\u2019m sure if you tell him I\u2019m fine, that\u2019s all he needs.\u201d</p><p>Galen leaned back in his chair, his gaze intent. \u201cI got the impression he cared more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very protective of his trainees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.\u201d Vance sighed. \u201cWell, Gabrielle, the protective bastard isn\u2019t going to believe us that you refused, and he\u2019ll hound us. Would you mind calling him and explaining?\u201d</p><p>The wish to hear Marcus\u2019s voice again dissolved in the knowledge of what it would do to her. No more crying. \u201cSorry, you\u2019ll just have to cope.\u201d She pushed her chair back, needing to be gone.</p><p>Galen\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cHe deserves more than being blown off, Gabrielle. The man risked his life for you.\u201d</p><p>Guilt stabbed worse than the pain in her ribs. But Marcus didn\u2019t really want her; they just didn\u2019t understand. She said in an even voice, \u201cI know he did, and I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGratitude, hell.\u201d Galen tossed a piece of paper and a pen across the table. \u201cYou write him a note explaining, or I\u2019ll give him every number we have on file for you.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, feeling as if he\u2019d slapped her.</p><p>His black eyes were cold. Implacable. \u201cDo it now.\u201d</p><p>You bastard. She shoved her tears down. \u201cYou know, any resemblance between you and a human being is purely coincidental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that.\u201d He rapped the table with his knuckles and pushed to his feet. \u201cLeave it here and I\u2019ll see that he gets it.\u201d He turned to Vance. \u201cWe\u2019re due in Benton\u2019s office now.\u201d</p><p>Vance nodded.</p><p>Galen limped to the door, glanced back once. \u201cBe well, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She looked away.</p><p>Vance hugged her. \u201cWe enjoyed working with you, Gabrielle. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d As he walked toward the door, she cleared her throat. \u201cHe was only kidding about writing a note, right?\u201d</p><p>Vance gave her a level look. \u201cGalen never bluffs.\u201d</p><p>On Saturday, Marcus stalked into the Shadowlands. A sub said hi, met his eyes, and backed away. He tried to be amused and failed. Thank Christ Z had assigned the trainees to Mistress Olivia for the rest of September, or he\u2019d probably terrify them too.</p><p>The music from the dance floor reverberated through the room, the bass hitting his bones in repetitious blows. He nodded curtly as people greeted him, grateful the doctor had let him abandon the sling and he didn\u2019t have to explain to every nosey parker how he\u2019d been hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced around. Z said the FBI agents planned to drop by tonight to give the Masters an update and their thanks. Marcus intended to ask for an update also. The bastards had refused to tell him Gabi\u2019s location; perhaps they\u2019d be more cooperative in person.</p><p>\u201cHey, Marcus.\u201d Behind the bar, Cullen waggled a bottle of beer.</p><p>Marcus hesitated, then walked over and took the drink. He\u2019d stopped his pain meds yesterday, and his shoulder throbbed like a sadistic dentist had drilled holes in it. \u201cThank you, Cullen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look a bit pissed off. Anything I can do?\u201d</p> <p>Marcus\u2019s mood lightened slightly. To his surprise, all the Masters had visited him in the hospital. Once he\u2019d gone home, their care continued. Z and Jessica had brought groceries and books on Monday, followed by Dan and Kari, who\u2019d cooked and frozen meals for him to microwave. On Tuesday, Nolan and Beth had stopped by to run errands and had found Sensei and a batch of his teenagers there. Beth had commandeered the boys to do his yard work. Impressed by their enthusiasm, she\u2019d hired two for her gardening service.</p><p>Wednesday, Anne, Olivia, and Sam had visited in the morning. Then Andrea had cleaned his house\u2014over his objections\u2014while Cullen had put together a meal. Z and Jessica on Thursday\u2014as well as some associates from the DA's office. On Friday, Raoul had barbecued steaks he\u2019d brought, and the rest had arrived to hold an informal engagement celebration for Z and Jessica, and Nolan and Beth. He\u2019d lived in Tampa only a year, but he\u2019d made some good friends without realizing it.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t allowed him to get lonely, but despite their company, he\u2019d missed Gabi as if he\u2019d misplaced a body part. His heart, maybe.</p><p>Marcus took a sip of beer and looked at Cullen. \u201cNothing you can do, thank you, unless you enjoy pounding on FBI agents.\u201d</p><p>Cullen grinned. \u201cTempting... Got a reason or are you just bored?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabrielle isn\u2019t in town.\u201d Every day that had gone by, he\u2019d expected to hear from her. But she hadn\u2019t called. Hadn\u2019t left a message. The memory of her eyes when she\u2019d said, \u201cGood-bye, Marcus,\u201d haunted him. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t returned to her job, and I can\u2019t find her. Her phone and address are buried well, and neither her Miami office nor Vance will give me her phone number or even relay a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see how that would burn your ass.\u201d Cullen frowned. \u201cThe agents got here a few minutes ago. They stopped by the bar to say thanks.\u201d Cullen glanced at his sub. \u201cSweetheart, did you see where Z and the others went?\u201d</p><p>Andrea finished drawing a beer and frowned at Marcus. \u201cYou look terrible. You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrelevant,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Z?\u201d</p><p>Andrea set the drink in front of Olivia and muttered, \u201cMen are such idiots,\u201d winning a snort of laughter from the domme.</p><p>\u201cPet,\u201d Cullen warned.</p> <p>She sniffed and set her hands on her hips. Her attitude resembled Gabi\u2019s so much that grief slid like a knife between his ribs. \u201cFine, just die and see if I care. They\u2019re way at the back, close to the cages, behind the giant fern planter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Andrea,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cCullen, please swat her ass for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my pleasure to do that little thing, buddy.\u201d</p><p>As Marcus walked away, he heard a squeak and a thud as a mouthy sub got tossed onto the bar, and then the slap of a hand on bare flesh.</p><p>Andrea\u2019s voice rose. \u201cCh\u00edngate, cabr\u00f3n.\u201d</p><p>Marcus shook his head, smiling. That insult would probably get her gagged.</p><p>The secluded sitting area held the FBI agents and some of the Shadowlands Masters. In the chorus of greetings, Raoul patted an empty chair. \u201cWe waited for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Marcus acknowledged.</p> <p>The only sub present, Jessica, was curled up in Z\u2019s lap, looking much like the kitten he called her, and Marcus smiled at her. The misery of not having Gabi in his arms hurt worse than the hole in his shoulder.</p><p>Z nodded at the agents, an unspoken gesture that they had the floor.</p><p>Vance leaned forward. \u201cFirst, this information is privileged and not to be shared with anyone, even your subs.\u201d He glanced at Jessica. \u201cAnyone, pet.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou know Jessica and Gabi\u2019s kidnapping followed three others in Tampa.\u201d Vance scowled. \u201cThe man killed on the dock, Maganti, was a private investigator here in Tampa. He received a list of women, investigated them, and chose four who could easily disappear. He did the same thing about two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years apart?\u201d Nolan straightened. \u201cThat\u2019s a fucking long setup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d Vance rubbed his neck. \u201cWe didn\u2019t gain enough information, dammit. The boat escaped clean. Maganti died. The hireling knows very little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they involved in the Atlanta kidnappings?\u201d Marcus asked.</p><p>Vance shook his head. \u201cOnly here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago. More than one city. You\u2019re dealing with a human trafficking organization,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>\u201cAnd one that\u2019s very well concealed,\u201d Galen agreed. \u201cWe\u2019d still be in the dark if that Atlanta victim hadn\u2019t escaped. We\u2019ve already found two other cities with this pattern of disappearances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Dan muttered. The cop shot a frown at Z. \u201cDid any Shadowlands submissives disappear two years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked.\u201d Z\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cA young woman\u2014college student. Not a feisty one. A redhead.\u201d As if to reassure himself of her safety, he pulled Jessica closer, and she turned her head into his shoulder.</p><p>Marcus breathed out slowly. He needed to know for himself Gabrielle was safe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cIf the student wasn\u2019t a brat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vance said, \u201cWe examined other Tampa club records. As far as we can tell, four redheaded subs disappeared two years ago.\u201d</p><p>Nolan grunted. \u201cSpecialty items for auction or maybe for filling custom orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Maganti or Jang belong to any BDSM clubs?\u201d Marcus asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Galen said. \u201cSomeone else made up the list of potential victims, and gentlemen, you should assume the spotter is still in place. We will, of course, do our best to root him out, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll watch,\u201d Dan said. The other Masters nodded.</p><p>Nolan cracked his knuckles. \u201cBe more rewarding if we find him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear that,\u201d Vance said in a stern voice, obviously trying to suppress a smile. \u201cOn a happier note, the agent who\u2019d abandoned Gabi\u2014she did break his nose, by the way\u2014no longer works for the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Low murmurs around the group, consisting mostly of the designation of \u201casshole\u201d and \u201cbastard,\u201d aside from Nolan, who simply growled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Vance got to his feet, Galen struggled to his, and they shook hands with everyone. Marcus waited patiently.</p><p>As Vance talked with Dan, Galen bent down to Jessica. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got caught up in this, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault\u2014I was already on the list.\u201d Her smile turned to a grin. \u201cBesides, I got to see Master Z kick major ass.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her hair, grinned at Z. \u201cI like your brat.\u201d</p><p>Z merely smiled. \u201cAs do I. I fear you and Vance will need to find your own.\u201d</p><p>Galen finally walked over to Marcus. \u201cThank you for the help. I regret we weren\u2019t quick enough to keep you from getting shot.\u201d He pulled an envelope from his suit pocket. \u201cGabrielle wrote this for you.\u201d</p><p>His hopes rose, then dropped. A letter meant she didn\u2019t want to speak to him. Dammit. \u201cI\u2019d like her phone number.\u201d</p><p>Galen\u2019s eyes held sympathy. \u201cI can\u2019t, Marcus. It\u2019s not only against the rules, but she requested we not give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Marcus stepped back, winded as if he\u2019d caught a roundhouse kick to his gut. She didn\u2019t want to see him. Not caring how rude it might be, he ripped open the letter and read the few sentences.</p><p>Marcus,</p><p>Thank you for your care while I was in the Shadowlands. Thank you for saving my life. I\u2019m so very sorry I caused you to get shot.</p><p>Galen says you want my number, but I just want to move on and not remember this last month.</p><p>His guts felt battered. The last month was one of the finest in his life, and she wanted to forget it?</p><p>I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it a relief to not have a brat in your trainees.</p><p>Thank you for everything,</p><p>Gabrielle.</p><p>Gabrielle, not Gabi. Does that mean we\u2019re not even friends either? He saw Galen hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cShe\u2019s sure I\u2019ll find it a relief not to have a brat in my trainees. She wants to forget everything\u2014and not speak to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, as a law enforcement officer, I recommend you honor the lady\u2019s wishes. As a dom...\u201d A corner of Galen\u2019s mouth turned up. \u201cMarcus, she was hurting when she wrote the letter, just as much as you are now. I think she\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Vance had joined them, and he nodded agreement and shook Marcus\u2019s hand. \u201cGood luck. You\u2019ll need it\u2014but she\u2019s worth it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two FBI agents walked away, stopping for a minute to observe Sally instruct a dom on the proper way to use a switch.</p><p>Marcus sank down into his chair, reading her words again. When he looked up, the others had resumed their seats. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense. How can she write everything off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari did mention... Ah, she\u2019s seen you with Gabrielle, and thought you two... Anyway, she asked me... Hell.\u201d Dan ran his hands through his hair and scowled. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s like this: last Saturday Kari overheard that sub you date\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCeline?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. Celine told Gabi that doms don\u2019t like bratty subs, and she was surprised you didn\u2019t throw her out of the trainees.\u201d</p><p>Marcus closed his eyes. \u201cOh wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets better. Celine apparently said you\u2019re her master, and you love her because she never gives you any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d Anger flared through him so fast and hot it was a wonder the letter didn\u2019t burn. Did Gabi actually believe Celine\u2019s bullcrap? That he\u2019d make love with her if he was involved with someone else? \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. I\u2019ve never been her master, never come close to being in love with her. I told her that.\u201d</p><p>Jessica cleared her throat. \u201cAll the subs believe... Um, Celine told everyone you\u2019re together.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus sighed. \u201cWell, that explains part of the problem.\u201d He noticed Jessica wringing her hands and cleared his throat. \u201cBest you tell me what else I\u2019m missing, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a second. \u201cDid she lie about you hating disobedient subs too? Even though your ex-wife...\u201d She flushed, and her jaw firmed. \u201cEverybody knows you hate brats, Master Marcus. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He might have gotten riled, except the little blonde had tears in her eyes. Why? \u201cNo, darlin\u2019. Not anymore.\u201d He smiled slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I liked sassy behavior until I met Gabi. But I like the challenge. And I like her honesty. When she does submit, it\u2019s...\u201d The sweetest thing in the world. \u201cI was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>Marcus sighed. \u201cYes, Jessica, I do. I intend to do my best to convince her of that.\u201d He had enough contacts in law enforcement that he\u2019d locate her eventually.</p><p>Jessica studied him, then turned to Z.</p> <p>\u201cTruth,\u201d Z said softly.</p><p>Taking a stand in front of Marcus, she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIf you break her heart, I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Marcus glanced at Z.</p><p>Z gave him a faint smile. \u201cPlease recall why the kidnappers targeted our two submissives.\u201d</p><p>Marcus closed his eyes and shook his head before looking at the diminutive blonde. \u201cI will do my best not to hurt her, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jessica smiled. \u201cI\u2019d love to see her face when you show up.\u201d When her eyes lit with mischief, Marcus saw how she\u2019d captured Z. \u201cGabrielle is staying with her parents in Orlando until Monday. Her father is a lawyer at Thompson and Dunn International.\u201d She frowned again. \u201cI guess they\u2019re really conservative and don\u2019t approve of her. When she mentioned them, she sounded...unhappy. Like when she talked about you.\u201d</p><p>A well-placed stab, especially since she was being honest. But he remembered Gabi had told him much the same thing about her parents. And she\u2019d run away from them as a teenager. \u201cLittle Miss Sassy, did your parents have a problem with your behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. They always wanted me to stand on my own feet.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI spent a fair amount in time-out as a kid, but\u201d\u2014her smile faded\u2014\u201cbut my family likes who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus nodded. Gabi thought Marcus didn\u2019t approve of her. That he was conservative. Stuffy. He remembered her surprise at seeing him in jeans. When he\u2019d thrown her into the ocean. To top it off, he was a lawyer like her father. Well, he had his work cut out for him, didn\u2019t he? \u201cI think I get the picture, Jessica. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He could easily track down her father\u2019s address, and now he had an idea of what he was up against: Celine\u2019s lies. Thinking he hated brats. Being too much like her parents. She had a lot to learn. He glanced at the other Masters and smiled slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019ve had a lot of practice in instructing little subs, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>After church, Gabi changed into jeans and a green peasant top and stayed in her room, trying to regain her equilibrium. Besides, it gave her a chance to play with her bored cats. Being shut up in the bedroom annoyed the hell out of them. \u201cSoon, guys. Tomorrow we leave.\u201d And I\u2019ll be back with my friends. Will have lots to do.</p><p>When she felt poised again, she walked out to the great room. Only ten o\u2019clock and the morning had already got off to a rocky start. Dressed appropriately in a demure dress, heels, and hose despite the heat, she\u2019d attended church service with her parents, hoping to please them. Major mistake.</p><p>When they\u2019d introduced her around afterward, their oh-so-polite friends couldn\u2019t look away from the ugly marks and yellowing bruises on her face. Since the news had reported only a shoot-out at the Clearwater Docks, Gabi couldn\u2019t explain her battered appearance, and everyone plainly assumed she had an abusive boyfriend. Her parents had grown more and more distant. Oh look, Gabi, you\u2019ve embarrassed them again.</p><p>One more day and then home.</p><p>Finding her parents in the room, discussing the sermon, Gabi stopped in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m going to make some coffee. Anyone want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a latte,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThank you, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Gabi had just finished making the coffee when the doorbell rang. Great. More stuffy, parental friends. Well, she\u2019d hand off the latte and retreat back to her room. She carried the two cups out of the kitchen as her mother entered the great room, followed by Marcus.</p><p>Marcus? Here? Not in the club? Here. Her brain shut down as if someone had flipped a switch.</p><p>He walked up to her. \u201cEasy, sugar.\u201d He carefully took the two cups from her before she spilled them on her mother\u2019s white carpet, then set them on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember Marcus Atherton, Gabrielle?\u201d her mother asked, giving his dark gray suit an approving look. When Gabi didn\u2019t answer, she added, \u201cHe says you met on a special assignment in Tampa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Yes, I remember him.\u201d What is he doing here? Her chest hurt as if her heart had shriveled and died. She glanced at the hallway that led to her bedroom and escape, but Mother would be horrified. No hope for it; she had to act politely.</p><p>She dropped down on the couch, ignoring her mother\u2019s wince at her lack of grace. \u201cWhat brings you to Orlando, Marcus?\u201d And how did you find out my location? Didn\u2019t you get my letter?</p><p>Walking right past an empty chair, he joined her on the couch, sitting close enough she could feel the warmth of his thigh against hers\u2014close enough to make it obvious they were more than just friends. Her mother\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cI came over to take you out for lunch, sugar.\u201d He took her hand, then smiled at her parents. \u201cI do apologize for the discourtesy of calling unannounced.\u201d</p><p>Gabi tried to pull her hand away without her parents noticing, and amusement lit his eyes. She glowered at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see Vance and Galen?\u201d</p><p>His grip flexed in a way that reminded her of how incongruously strong he was. \u201cI did. They gave me your note and told me how much you looked forward to seeing me again.\u201d</p><p>They did not. They wouldn\u2019t. Would they? She remembered Galen\u2019s expression when she\u2019d said she didn\u2019t want to talk to Marcus. \u201cHe deserves more than that,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>This isn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Marcus watched his little sub\u2019s face flush a vivid pink. The big brown eyes had lit with joy when she\u2019d seen him and now shot sparks at him. Smothering a laugh, he turned back to her parents. How had such a cold couple created someone as bright and warm as Gabi? He knew others like the Renards; his old law firm had been filled with their type. He hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d enjoyed being away from pompous assholes until now.</p><p>He studied Gabi for a moment, having to suppress his rage at the sight of the bruising on her forehead, her cheek, her jaw. Her mangled wrists\u2014he\u2019d have to avoid hurting them. Yet just the sight of her filled him with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMr. Renard.\u201d He stood to shake hands with her father. \u201cI believe someone said you work for Thompson and Dunn? In law?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s chest puffed slightly. \u201cI specialize in corporate law, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn intriguing field.\u201d Marcus smiled and added, \u201cI\u2019m an assistant district attorney in Tampa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy how nice,\u201d her mother said. The approving look Gabi got from her parents warmed Marcus\u2019s heart and probably shot his chances with her to hell. \u201cCan I get you something to drink, Mr. Atherton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But thank you.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb your morning.\u201d As he watched Gabi\u2019s parents, their body language and expressions, Marcus could clearly see their attitude toward their daughter, that of two snooty Siamese cats faced with a bouncy puppy. His heart broke for her. As warm and perceptive as Gabi was... Had they been as disapproving of her when she\u2019d been a child? No wonder she\u2019d run away. He\u2019d have joined her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After today, if she still considered him anything like her father, Marcus would paddle her ass.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be pleased to have you join us for lunch here,\u201d Mrs. Renard said.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t stay,\u201d Gabi announced, her voice deliberately rude. She frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m occupied today, Marcus. It\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t call before you wasted your time.\u201d</p><p>Her mother gasped, and her father\u2019s face turned flat.</p> <p>Marcus laughed. There she is, my little brat. Now to show her that her behavior wouldn\u2019t drive him away. \u201cYou can spit at me all you want, Darlin\u2019,\u201d he said, cupping her cheek and forcing her to meet his eyes. \u201cDo bear in mind I deal with drug dealers, murderers\u2014and worst of all, cops, every day. I doubt that you can shock me with your behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want.\u201d He took her hand, moved his grip to her undamaged forearm to remind her who was in charge, and pulled her to her feet. \u201cI appreciate you letting me interrupt your morning, ma'am, sir.\u201d Without releasing Gabi\u2014she\u2019d make a run for it, he knew\u2014he politely shook hands with her stunned father.</p><p>Then he simply dragged his insubordinate sub out of her parents\u2019 house.</p><p>She tried to rebel again when he opened the car door for her. \u201cListen, this is not\u2014I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabrielle.\u201d He cupped her cheek and looked down into her velvety brown eyes. \u201cGet. In. The. Car.\u201d</p><p>Gabi scrubbed her hands on her jeans and tried to show an impassive face as Marcus drove through the city. Didn\u2019t he understand this wouldn\u2019t work? Was he like some...some predator that gave chase if their prey ran from them?</p><p>\u201cIf you keep all those thoughts inside, your brain will explode,\u201d he said lazily. He steered the car to the curb and took her hand in his. \u201cWe can discuss this right now, or we can wait until after lunch and then have at it. Your only choice is when.\u201d</p><p>God, why did the determination in his deep voice turn her insides to liquid? She swallowed, wishing she saw a future for them. But look at him. In a suit, as always.</p><p>Then again, the way he\u2019d acted at her parents\u2019 house... He\u2019d been rude to them. That wasn\u2019t like him at all. I\u2019m so confused. \u201cLater. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Darlin\u2019.\u201d He brushed her lips with a soft kiss, leaving her longing for more. After pulling a cell phone from his suit, he punched a number and a second later said, \u201cWe should get there in about thirty minutes.\u201d The cell went back into his pocket.</p> <p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought since I\u2019ve met your family today, you should meet mine. My grandparents will join us.\u201d</p><p>What? She looked at her jeans and peasant top in horror, then stared at him. \u201cMarcus, I\u2019m not dressed for a nice restaurant.\u201d Dear God, is he insane?</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a compliment or insult. You didn\u2019t worry about your appearance when you thought it was only me for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. She hadn\u2019t, had she? \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou no longer think I\u2019ll judge you by what you wear. We\u2019re making progress, I do believe.\u201d He tugged at the puffy sleeve of her top, the elastic letting him pull it down to expose her shoulder. He kissed the bare skin and murmured, \u201cAs it happens, I rather like this top.\u201d</p><p>Great, her clothing was not only too casual, but the kind he\u2019d want to play with. She pulled her sleeve up.</p><p>He pulled it down.</p> <p>She was doomed.</p><p>He was still smiling ten minutes later when he turned his car into a drive. She frowned at the sign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Animal Kingdom?\u201d Mr. Suit and Disney?</p><p>\u201cAre you allowed to live in Florida if you don\u2019t like Disney?\u201d He chuckled at the amazed look she gave him. At a guard station, he slowed to give his name and was waved on.</p><p>Not long afterward, Gabi stared in wonder as they walked through the African-themed lobby of the Kidani Lodge and down a spiral staircase to the Sanaa Restaurant. Hanging baskets mingled with pottery-jar lamps. Colorful cloth hangings and beaded mosaics decorated the walls. Tree branches seemed to dissolve into the thatched ceiling. She stopped to stare. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWait until you see the view from the windows.\u201d After slinging his gym bag over his shoulder, Marcus set his hand low on her back, guiding her toward a table where an older couple sat. His grandparents. In tan slacks and a short-sleeved shirt, the silver-haired man had keen eyes with a sunburst of wrinkles at the corners, a Roman nose, and a stern jaw. He rose as they approached.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, this is my grandfather, Ben Atherton, and my grandmother, Abby.\u201d His grandmother had tousled white curls, softly wrinkled skin, and an infectious smile.</p><p>Marcus kissed Gabi\u2019s fingertips and finished, \u201cAnd here is my very reluctant girlfriend, Gabi Renard.\u201d</p><p>Reluctant. She would kill him...somehow...the minute they were alone. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGramps,\u201d Marcus said, \u201cher father is William Renard, a lawyer with Thompson and Dunn International. You might have met him.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s bushy brows drew together. \u201cI\u2019ve made his acquaintance, although I don\u2019t recall having him in front of my bench.\u201d</p><p>Marcus closed his hand around Gabi\u2019s and murmured, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t always sound like it, but Gramps was a judge before he retired.\u201d</p><p>I complain about lawyers, so I get to eat lunch with a judge? This so isn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cVery into rules and regulations. Pretty narrow-minded, I thought.\u201d Ben tilted his head at Gabi and gave a considering look. \u201cIf what my grandson says about you is true, I bet you had him fit to be tied, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped for a second before she recovered. \u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease sit, everyone,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Marcus seated Gabi and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, sugar. I want to change.\u201d</p><p>And the bastard abandoned her without looking back.</p><p>After a quick change of clothing in the restroom, Marcus strode into the restaurant. When he saw Gramps sitting alone, he froze, then spotted Gabi at one of the giant windows with his grandmother. The two appeared mesmerized by the giraffe striding past. He let out a sigh of relief, realizing he\u2019d been worried the little sub would flee.</p><p>When Marcus sat down, his grandfather glanced at the two women a few feet away. \u201cShe\u2019s polite, but she doesn\u2019t intimidate worth a damn. I do believe I like her.\u201d</p><p>Marcus snorted. \u201cYou would. Unfortunately, the problem is getting her to stay. She thinks I\u2019m the same type as her parents, and you\u2019re right about his personality. Her mother is worse.\u201d</p><p>Gramps\u2019s mouth flattened into a line. \u201cRenard is a pompous bastard and wound up tighter than an eight-day clock. You\u2019re nothing alike, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully I can keep her around long enough to realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ordered for you, by the way. Your young lady has an adventurous spirit, at least in foods.\u201d</p><p>The bread sampler had arrived before the two women returned to the table, laughing and chatting easily. Nana could put anyone at ease, and Marcus smiled. He kept realizing how much Gabi was like her.</p><p>His sub\u2019s eyes widened when she saw him. What? Oh, the clothes. After she sat down beside him, he leaned over to murmur into her ear, \u201cI spend most of my time in jeans, sugar. Sorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to destroy all my illusions, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She lowered her voice, \u201cBy the way, you have a fine ass. Sir.\u201d</p><p>He choked. And hardened instantly. He gave her a \u201cyou will pay\u201d stare, and she actually giggled.</p><p>When he looked up, Nana beamed at him in obvious approval. Well then. Now to win over his grandfather. If his grandparents approved, so would the rest of the Atherton clan. Marcus leaned back in his chair and smiled at Gabi. He\u2019d bet her previous Christmases had been formal, cold affairs. Dignified. When he took her to his parents\u2019 home in rural Georgia, she was in for a shock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been admiring your hair, Gabi,\u201d Nana said. \u201cAs it happens, I\u2019m thinking of putting a few pink or green streaks in mine just to shock the ladies in my bridge club.\u201d</p><p>Marcus\u2019s mouth dropped open, and Gramps sputtered like a badly tuned engine.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d shock more than just the ladies.\u201d Snickering at the men, Gabi fingered the blue strand in her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re braver than I am\u2014I never planned to do something quite so permanent.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought she\u2019d done it as a show of defiance\u2014although the blue was rather odd, considering how she liked coordinating colors. \u201cSo why did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job has unexpected...benefits.\u201d She gave him a rueful look. \u201cI went to see a teenager who\u2019d had a...bad experience, but she refused to talk with me. Wanted me to leave. But then she said she\u2019d planned to dye her hair.\u201d Gabi\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl thing, trying to change ourselves as if we can change our lives too.\u201d</p><p>Marcus took her hand. He\u2019d have to ask someday how she\u2019d changed herself as a teenager. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway, I volunteered to help, and halfway through, I got enthused. When I smeared blue on my hair, well, she started to laugh and...\u201d When Gabi\u2019s fingers tightened on his, he knew the girl had talked and shared undoubtedly horrific memories with his compassionate woman. \u201cWe had a nice chat, and I discovered I rather like the blue. I went back last month to have her put some more in.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he definitely loved this woman. He wanted to pull her into his arms; he settled for running a finger down her cheek.</p><p>She gave him a suspicious frown. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou please me more than I can say, Gabi,\u201d he said softly. A pretty pink colored in her cheeks. That first day he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d known it would be a delight to watch her flush.</p> <p>\u201cUm. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he handed her a piece of the traditional naan bread. She scooped up some hummus and took a bite. When she closed her eyes in pleasure, he remembered she\u2019d had the same expression when sucking his cock, when he kissed her, when he bent her over... He shifted in his chair, needing to drag her to the hotel room he\u2019d rented. Right now.</p><p>Across the table, his grandfather exchanged amused smiles with Nana. Totally obvious, was he? He found he didn\u2019t care in the least. But he had work to do here, and he might as well start off by killing two birds with one stone. \u201cGramps, do you remember the woman I introduced y\u2019all to at the beginning of the summer? Celine?\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Gabi stiffened, her face turning poker bland as she sipped her drink. Nana, in contrast, appeared appalled at his rudeness at talking about a previous girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cI remember her,\u201d Gramps answered. \u201cSugar wouldn\u2019t melt in her mouth. Spineless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood description.\u201d Marcus glanced at his little sub. Open shock. The first crack in her believing what Celine had said. Excellent. Now to confront it head-on. \u201cShe has a problem with honesty as well. Apparently she\u2019s telling people we\u2019re in a relationship and that I love her.\u201d</p><p>Gabi choked on her drink.</p><p>\u201cAh, a witness? What did she tell you, Darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not on the stand, so watch it, Mr. Lawyer.\u201d</p><p>A snort of appreciation from Gramps.</p><p>Marcus put a finger under her chin. \u201cTell me, Gabrielle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told me you love her because she never gives you any back talk. Whatever you want is what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fancy a biddable woman?\u201d his grandfather said in disbelief.</p><p>Nana tsk-tsked at him. \u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t, dear. Now hush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d enjoy someone I can walk all over?\u201d Marcus asked, running a finger down her cheek. \u201cDo you realize how boring that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d From her confused expression, that\u2019s exactly what she believed.</p><p>\u201cI see. We\u2019ll discuss that later then.\u201d He let his anger with her show. \u201cDo you think so little of me you believe I would\u201d\u2014the memory of his grandparent\u2019s presence made him revise his language\u2014\u201cah, take you home if I was involved with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her gaze dropped. \u201cNot at first. But she said, straight out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lied, Gabi.\u201d Marcus leaned an elbow on the table. \u201cA few dates doesn\u2019t make a relationship, and aside from occasional scenes, I\u2019d stopped seeing her well before you. She didn\u2019t take the hint, so I told her, rather bluntly, a couple of weeks ago that I had no intention of doing...anything...with her again.\u201d</p> <p>Brown eyes met his, and he saw her temper spark. \u201cShe lied to me? Out-and-out lied?\u201d</p><p>Marcus smothered his smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Her growl sounded like a higher version of Nolan\u2019s.</p><p>Gramps slapped his hand on the table. \u201cSo what are you going to do about this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have any suggestions, Gabi?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, and her lips curved. \u201cWhatever you want is what she wants...so what if you wanted her to spend an evening with Ma\u2014\u201d She cut the word off and flushed slightly. \u201cWith Sam?\u201d</p><p>Marcus stared at her, then roared with laughter. \u201cYou possess an evil mind, little brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Sam ugly or something?\u201d Nana asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually Sam\u2019s a very nice guy, but he has a rather well-known kinky side.\u201d Marcus winked at Gramps. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard-core sadist, Nana, and he has a fondness for whips.\u201d</p><p>Gramps barked a laugh.</p><p>Nana\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMy goodness, how do you meet such interesting people?\u201d She tapped a finger against her lips, then nodded, shocking him\u2014and Gabi\u2014completely. \u201cThat would be a fine predicament to put her in, bless her heart, and an appropriate consequence for her lying.\u201d</p><p>Marcus smiled at Gabi. \u201cMeans you\u2019ll need to come to Tampa for the show, Darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d She averted her eyes. \u201cYou know, we should eat while the food is still warm, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Well, he might have won a battle, but obviously the war was not yet won.</p><p>The time with Marcus\u2019s grandparents had been wonderful, Gabi thought, as Marcus opened the door to his hotel room. Damn, they were fun.</p><p>His grandmother volunteered at various Tampa wildlife rescue groups, had tried to draft Gabi into helping, and been disappointed to hear she lived in Miami.</p><p>In contrast, his opinionated, pushy grandfather had deliberately prodded Gabi with idiotic statements, rather like poking a stick at a caged monkey. Finally when he\u2019d complained about the money going to health insurance for children, she\u2019d lost her temper and ripped his logic to shreds. He had a roaring laugh almost as wonderful as Marcus\u2019s. After he caught his breath, he\u2019d told Marcus, \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>They liked me. Yes, most people did, but she\u2019d never expected approval from Marcus\u2019s family.</p><p>And Marcus hadn\u2019t acted stuffy at all. He\u2019d held his own with his grandfather, bantered with his grandmother, and every time he laughed, heat streaked down her spine.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon in, sugar,\u201d Marcus said, holding the door open for her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you took a room in a Disney resort.\u201d The African decor continued in the room, with warmly golden tones, wood carvings, and bright patterns on the bed\u2014the very big bed. She looked away.</p><p>\u201cSince you like the panthers at that cat rescue place so much, I thought you\u2019d enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d remembered. Warm fuzzies edged aside some of her nerves.</p><p>After pouring two glasses of wine, he walked onto the balcony. \u201cCome here, Darlin\u2019. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she felt as if someone had wrapped a big hand around her throat, cutting off her voice. Her feet wouldn\u2019t move until he curled his finger up in a \u201ccome here\u201d motion.</p><p>Fine. They really did need to get this over with. She joined him on the balcony, sipped the smooth pinot noir, and pretended to watch the animals on the grassland. Talk. How could she make him understand? Even if he thought he wanted her, he didn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t. She mustn\u2019t let him push her into something he\u2019d regret.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d she asked lightly. The low murmur of conversation came from other balconies, a little boy yelled in frustration, someone had their music turned to a loud rock station.</p><p>Marcus frowned and shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>Her hopes that should never have arisen drained away when he pushed her back into the room and closed the balcony door. \u201cOkay.\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t shake. Much. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would.\u201d She set her glass on the small table in the sitting area.</p><p>He tilted his head in puzzlement and then smiled, grabbing her hand as she headed for the door. \u201cNo, Darlin\u2019, I mean we can\u2019t talk on the balcony. There\u2019s too many people around. And you don\u2019t appear capable of rational discussion at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try irrational first.\u201d He grasped the bottom of her blouse and pulled it over her head. Before she got past \u201cMarcus!\u201d her bra followed the top onto the floor. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, ignoring her attempts to keep him from yanking down her jeans zipper. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis...this isn\u2019t talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is. Now just stand right there, sugar.\u201d</p><p>When she stepped back instead, his frown and the stern set of his jaw stopped her cold. She\u2019d learned to obey the trainer far too well. Before she collected her resolve, he\u2019d removed her jeans and thong.</p><p>\u201cMarcus...\u201d She forced the words out. How had she let this go so far? \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, touching her cheek lightly with his fingertips. \u201cI missed you, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>The open emotion in his low voice shook her, the pull toward him as hard to fight as a riptide. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are appallingly stubborn,\u201d he said under his breath. He tugged her hair and stepped back.</p><p>She hauled in a breath.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s have a look at you.\u201d His gaze ran down her body, leaving a wake of heat in its path; then his eyes darkened. He brushed a finger over the black bruise on her left breast. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her throat constricted, and she swallowed against the nausea accompanying the memory. \u201cJang got rough.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened, but he only nodded and examined the bruises on her back and hips and shoulders. \u201cHow did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalls.\u201d She found a smile for him. \u201cBeing dropped into a big box. Knocked onto a dock.\u201d She touched the abrasion on her forehead. \u201cThis was the dock too.\u201d</p><p>He traced around the ugly bruise on her right side, and she winced. He frowned. \u201cAre your ribs cracked or broken?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBruised.\u201d She sighed when he lifted his eyebrows. \u201cOnly a crack or two from when Jang kicked me. Then again, I did kick him in the balls.\u201d</p><p>A dimple appeared beside his mouth when he smiled. \u201cGood for you, Darlin\u2019.\u201d With firm hands, he sat her on the edge of the bed. Cupping her cheek, he examined the bruise there and the others along her jawline. \u201cFrom the dock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe Z a drink for taking care of him for me.\u201d His words were mild, but she saw the fury in his eyes and the tension in his muscles. Oddly enough, his anger on her behalf drained some pain from her own memories.</p><p>She rubbed her cheek against his palm. \u201cVance said Z did a thorough job. Jang\u2019s ribs were definitely broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnowing every breath he takes will hurt for a long time does help.\u201d He tipped her chin up and scrutinized her face. \u201cHe put his hands on you... How badly is that still bothering you? I would think it might bring back some ugly memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d She closed her eyes, unable to tolerate the piercing gaze. \u201cI was...scared.\u201d Trapped, hurt, no way out. She shivered.</p><p>He sat down beside her and enclosed her hands in his warm ones. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>She tried to shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few panic attacks. It\u2019s getting better, maybe because I managed to fight back a little this time. And I chose to play decoy, so everything didn\u2019t happen out of the blue, for no reason. I\u2019m more upset about...\u201d She swallowed against the lump in her throat. \u201cMy friend. K-Kim. There\u2019s not much hope now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Darlin\u2019, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cCome here now.\u201d His hard arms closed around her and pulled her against his chest. Her eyes pooled with tears because she had someone to lean on, even if for only a short time. The comfort... No one had held her since the hospital, and God, she\u2019d needed that. As if he could tell, he simply cuddled her for a while, rocking slightly. His chin rested on the top of her head, and she felt enclosed in warmth and safety.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you scared me spitless, Li\u2019ll subbie. First when I heard you\u2019d been kidnapped, and then...even worse, seeing your box tip toward the water.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled against his shirt. Other people besides her could be frightened. \u201cThank you for not letting me drown. Vance said you got hit by a pipe when you swung me back onto the dock.\u201d She pulled back and touched the bruised, abraded spot on the edge of his forehead, half covered by hair. He had a bruise on his jaw too. He\u2019d taken a fist in the face. \u201cThank you for rescuing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She unbuttoned his shirt. The white gauze bandage on his left shoulder seemed horribly wrong on his golden tan skin. A yellowing, round bruise bloomed over his left ribs, and she gave him the same inquisitive gaze he\u2019d used on her.</p><p>\u201cTook a punch.\u201d</p><p>God, look at him. Bandages, bruises, cuts. All from knowing her. She\u2019d almost gotten him killed. Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t you start watering up over a few marks, sugar.\u201d He pulled her back against his side. \u201cI get worse in karate classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost died,\u201d she said. She pushed her head against his arm, shaking inside so hard she might shatter. She\u2019d gotten past most of the aftereffects, but the nightmares of those few minutes hadn\u2019t lessened. Cesar yelling, ?Fucking cunt.? Her body no longer her own. Freezing. Marcus\u2019s yell, ?Gabi, down!? The crack of the pistol. \u201cIf I\u2019d dropped like you ordered, you...\u201d The sound he made, the blood, so horribly red. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marcus. You worked so hard on getting me past freezing up, and still I didn\u2019t move and you\u2014I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve felt guilty ever since.\u201d He actually chuckled, and she looked up to see the amusement on his face. \u201cDid you really think one evening would fix you all up? A problem like yours doesn\u2019t disappear so easily, Gabi, and if you were thinking straight, you\u2019d know it, Miz Counselor.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t blame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor something you have no control over? Hardly. And if you\u2019ll trouble yourself to remember, one minute before you froze, you kept me from getting shot. That bullet probably would have killed me. We\u2019re even, Darlin\u2019.\u201d He wiped the tears from her cheeks with his thumbs and smiled down at her. \u201cBesides, taking a bullet in a successful FBI operation has made my reputation in the DA\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d Men. Strange, strange creatures.</p><p>\u201cAnything else we need to discuss about the fight?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. So that\u2019s why he\u2019d wanted her naked\u2014to check her injuries. All her worries about having to tactfully refuse him were silly. Relieved...and disappointed, she reached down and picked up her jeans and thong.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He pulled them out of her grip and pointed to the center of the bed. \u201cPut yourself there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not finished yet, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue, caught his \u201cI\u2019ve spanked you once and I can do it again\u201d stare, and slid backward on the bed to the designated spot. Pulling her legs up, she wrapped her arms around her knees, feeling very exposed. When she noticed his leather toy bag sitting by the headboard, a quiver shook her. Sneaky. What was the sneaky lawyer planning? Her hands started to sweat, and her heart thudded hard enough to do damage to her rib cage.</p><p>He shrugged out of his shirt and tossed it over a chair. Joining her on the bed, he leaned against the headboard. \u201cNow we\u2019ll discuss you and me. Come here.\u201d</p><p>Why did he get to keep his jeans on? But it was...a little reassuring. Maybe he didn\u2019t plan to make love. Then why couldn\u2019t she put her clothes back on? I\u2019m so confused. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather stay here. Marcus, can\u2019t you understand this won\u2019t work? There is no you and me. We\u2019re totally incompatible.\u201d</p><p>He snorted in exasperation, snagged her arm, and pulled her gently onto his lap. At the feeling of his hard arms around her, she felt her eyes blur with tears. Again. Don\u2019t do this to me, Marcus.</p><p>\u201cWhat we have here is a failure to communicate,\u201d he said, his dark, rich drawl thicker than normal. \u201cYou best tell me why you ran away from me and sent Galen with a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run. I came here to stay with my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not even try to bullshit me, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the less than polite term halted her thoughts for a second. His darkened expression and the dangerous look in his eyes warned her his tolerance had reached a limit.</p><p>She pushed away her internal \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d voice and gave him the simple truth. \u201cI\u2019m not a sweet submissive, Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe I have grasped that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a brat. You don\u2019t want the problems or the troubles. I know that and...\u201d She stared at her hands. \u201cI thought about pretending to be a sweet, quiet submissive for you, but...after staying with my parents, I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it for long, and it\u2019d break my heart to put that look in your eyes again.\u201d</p><p>He put one hand on each side of her face, and his thumbs stroked over her cheekbones. \u201cWhat look, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappointment,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to disappoint me sometimes,\u201d Marcus said. Her gaze got caught in the blueness of his. \u201cIf I disappointed you, Gabi, would you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s different. I know who you are, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere we go. Gabrielle, I don\u2019t mean for you to change. I love who you are, little brat.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught, and joy spiraled up inside her like a whirlwind of glitter. Love? He loves me? Me? And then she shook her head. \u201cNo. No, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary little sub\u2014never accepting anything. Why am I not surprised?\u201d He smoothly reversed positions with her so her back rested against the headboard and he straddled her bare thighs. \u201cGabrielle, over the last month, you\u2019ve made every sweet, obedient submissive seem boring.\u201d</p><p>The spurt of hope faded quickly as logic returned. \u201cYou hate when I disobey you. I saw that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, when you were acting and I didn\u2019t know it, you drove me crazier than a june bug,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Absentmindedly he ran his hands over her breasts, distracting her. Damn him, she craved his touch like a drug, wanted to be in his arms, under him. She closed her hands on his wrists, needing him to hear her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pretending all the time. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do understand, Gabi.\u201d His lips curved. \u201cI\u2019d guess only about half of your bratty behavior was an act.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. He knew? \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discovered I like matching wits with you. I like your honesty. I like seeing you struggle to submit, and sometimes winning and sometimes losing.\u201d He tugged on her blue lock of hair.</p><p>Everything in her body started to turn to mush. But this couldn\u2019t be right. He had to be confused. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut I want you in Tampa. Or me in Miami. And you in my house.\u201d</p><p>She remembered how Vance had mentioned he could get her transferred to Tampa. No. Leaving now.</p><p>His lips curved. \u201cIf I wake up needing to beat on a little sub in the morning, I want her bottom available.\u201d</p><p>The glint in his eyes said he was joking\u2014mostly\u2014but not all. She swallowed hard, imagining his hand spanking her butt. The flash of heat bunched her nipples into jutting peaks.</p><p>He glanced at her breasts and raised his eyebrows. God, that smile of his. \u201cI reckon you like the idea of a morning beating,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Hope and fear fought, drowning her in churning emotions. I can\u2019t think. She clung to the one fact\u2014he needed to understand it couldn\u2019t work. \u201cI won\u2019t cooperate. Not always, and then you won\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve set your teeth into that notion, haven\u2019t you?\u201d He pulled a huge wrist cuff from his bag and a roll of gauze. \u201cBest we test it, then.\u201d</p><p>Wait. \u201cNo. We\u2019re not going to do this.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her struggles, he pinned her with his weight, captured one hand, and held it securely. She couldn\u2019t fight him and chance hurting his shoulder, but trying to yank her arm out of his grip got her nowhere. After he wrapped gauze over the abrasions on her left wrist, he buckled the cuff on. \u201cNolan happened to own an extra wide set of cuffs,\u201d he commented. He lifted her arm and snapped the cuff to a rope attached to the headboard.</p><p>How could she not have spotted the restraints? But nooooo, she\u2019d been too busy staring at him.</p><p>He did her other wrist and patted her hand. \u201cThese shouldn\u2019t rub on your arms where you\u2019re still sore.\u201d He snapped the right cuff to another rope and sat back.</p><p>He\u2019d restrained her wrists against the headboard on each side of her head. She tugged at them and winced when the movement pulled on her ribs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not done yet, sweetheart.\u201d The big corner post of the headboard had a rope wound around the wood...and a cuff attached.</p><p>\u201cYou set everything up. You planned this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, I wasn\u2019t just a Boy Scout, I was an Eagle Scout.\u201d He proceeded to attach the cuff to her ankle. He did the same on the other side. \u201cI do like how flexible you are, but you let me know if this hurts your ribs.\u201d He watched her closely as he tightened the ropes, forcing her legs upward toward the corner posts on the headboard.</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019re all healed up and we\u2019re home, I\u2019ll have your feet almost to your head,\u201d he said. At the thought of being tied up in his bed, desire edged beneath her frustration.</p><p>He tied off the restraints. \u201cI reckon this will do for today.\u201d She was slouched against the headboard, wrists on each side of her head. Her legs were pulled up and widely separated, and her feet high in the air halfway between her hips and her shoulders. She tugged on her legs, unable to even make the board wiggle\u2014solidly made bed\u2014and realized he was watching her with a faint smile on his face. His pleasure at seeing her bound showed clearly.</p><p>And knowing he was aroused by her helplessness heated her blood.</p><p>He ran his hands down the insides of her thighs, pausing on either side of her pussy. \u201cI do like seeing you so spread and exposed.\u201d He touched her clit, the merest brush of his fingers, sending a burn through her, a growing need for so, so much more. \u201cAnd havin' your feet waving in the air tilts that pink Li\u2019ll pussy up so I can play with it.\u201d His gaze on her seemed as warm as his fingers as he touched her, teasing between her folds. \u201cSeems you\u2019re a tad excited.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m n\u2014\u201d</p><p>A gentle swat right on her open pussy sent fire stinging down her nerve endings. She gasped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Gabrielle.\u201d His eyes were firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same as defying me. We will be honest with each other. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. I don\u2019t lie, unless sometimes... But I can\u2019t talk about...\u201c Her words tangled.</p><p>His smile showed his approval, warming her deep inside. \u201cI understand, Darlin\u2019. You haven\u2019t lied unless you\u2019re being a brat. And you have trouble sharing your thoughts. We\u2019ll work on that one.\u201d</p><p>He kept assuming they\u2019d be together...</p><p>\u201cHowever, I will not accept lying even when you\u2019re acting sassy. No lies. Anytime. Understood?\u201d His fingers stroked the crease between her hip and thigh. Then he shot her a hard look. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>She was beautiful, Marcus thought. Her big brown eyes were stormy with emotion, her breasts jiggled with her breathing, and her nipples had peaked tight from her excitement. I love this woman.</p><p>Too soon, Marcus would usually think, to be so certain, but he\u2019d been involved with enough women to know when one felt exactly right. Seeing her chatting with his grandparents\u2014and teasing Gramps\u2014confirmed his belief. Gabi fit with them and him like a missing piece of the puzzle, snapping into place in a way that other women, even his ex-wife, never had.</p><p>\u201cMarcus?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. Tied and quivering. So appealing. Her expression showed desire and trust...and worry, a mixture more stimulating to a dom than any aphrodisiac. Having him in control excited her, and although she trusted him not to hurt her, she knew he could and would push her out of her comfort zone. Especially today.</p><p>He did enjoy that smidgeon of worry in Gabi\u2019s wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo sass me now, little sub,\u201d he said.</p><p>She fired right up at his patronizing tone. \u201cI sass when I want to, not at your command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work,\u201d he murmured and pushed a finger into her. Hot, wet tissues enfolded him, and damn, his cock wanted to be in her sweet little pussy. She arched, giving a shocked squeak. Talking\u2019s over, little sub.</p><p>Lying down, shoulders between her legs, he started to rest on a forearm, winced at the stab of pain in his shoulder, and switched to the other arm. He inhaled. Oh yes. Her aroused female scent had overwhelmed the fragrance of soap. Still watching her face, he gently licked her clit.</p><p>The stifled gasp of shock and pleasure she gave made him smile. Did she have any idea of how cute she was?</p><p>Then she stiffened, starting to get a glimmer of his intent and how much he planned to take from her. \u201cMarcus,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo.\u201d She tugged frantically on the restraints and winced.</p><p>Her ribs. \u201cStop, Gabi.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t\u2014in fact\u2014pulled harder, her teeth gritted.</p><p>Stubborn woman. He slapped her round little butt hard enough to sting, and she froze. Her startled eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cStruggling will hurt your ribs. You will not continue.\u201d</p><p>At his hard command, her pupils dilated. The muscles in her thighs relaxed, then her arms. She sighed.</p><p>Such sweet surrender. As he\u2019d suspected, her brattiness was only superficial, her submissiveness went heart-deep. Unable to help himself, he nuzzled the line between her hip and thigh, fragile and soft. \u201cI love you, Gabi, and we are going to remove these doubts of yours. Today.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing increased when she realized she couldn\u2019t stop him. Couldn\u2019t even fight back.</p><p>And then he got right down to business, moving around to each of the hot spots he\u2019d noted in previous encounters\u2014the high sides of her clit, the firm area on top of the hood. He smiled as he felt the bundle of nerves harden. Pushing her right to the edge didn\u2019t take long at all, considering she\u2019d heated up the minute he\u2019d cuffed her wrist.</p><p>Quivers ran through her body as he kept her on the pinnacle with teasing, leisurely licks and measured in-out movements of his finger. Soon she was trying to pull her hips up toward his mouth, despite the restraints.</p><p>\u201cSay \u201eI love you, Master.\"\u201d His lips curved. She wasn\u2019t blind with need yet, and he knew what would happen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my master. You\u2019re an asshole is what you are. Stop teasing me,\u201d she said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201cAn asshole? Didn\u2019t you have an anatomy class in college?\u201d He reached into his toy bag and took out an anal plug, one larger than any he\u2019d used on her before. \u201cLet me show you what an asshole is. Considering I\u2019ll be using yours one of these days, we might as well start getting you ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, wait.\u201d</p><p>With a quick squirt of lube between her cheeks and another onto the plug, Marcus ignored her squirming and pressed it against her back hole.</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cYou bastard.\u201d Burning seared Gabi\u2019s anus as the plug stretched the ring of muscle at the opening. Wide...wider. She wiggled uncontrollably. With an unheard plop, it slipped in. The pain eased, leaving her nerves tingling. \u201cDamn you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell now, that looks nice,\u201d he said. He licked her clit again, his tongue hot and wet as it traced erratic patterns around her increasingly sensitive nub.</p><p>She was going to die; she knew it. Her hips canted upward as the plug in her backside sent odd nerves tap-dancing from her bottom all the way to her spine. Under his slow, determined stroking, her clit swelled until it felt like an overripe melon just waiting to split. She closed her eyes. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDammit, Marcus...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot there yet,\u201d he murmured, and his finger circled her entrance. The anal plug pressed against her vagina as he pushed his finger into the compressed space. Too tight. Her insides pulsed around the new intrusion, the feeling incredibly intense.</p><p>His finger pressed, rubbed against something inside her vagina, and she felt the pulsing start to expand. Ruthlessly he licked her clit and stroked inside her, pushing her higher and higher until all she could think about was the next touch of his tongue, the next slide of his finger.</p><p>He stopped. His finger slid out, leaving her empty and throbbing.</p><p>\u201cSay \u201eI love you, Master.\"\u201d he repeated, not lifting his head. His warm breath brushed over her excruciatingly sensitive tissues.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t feel anything except his lips barely brushing her clit. \u201cDamn you,\u201d she moaned. Bastard, jerk, putz. \u201cI love you,\u201d and she did. But still\u2014master?\u2014asshole, only he\u2019d gotten revenge for her calling him that, and now her anus throbbed in time with her pussy\u2014\u201cMaster. Oh, pleeeeease...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. She opened her eyes.</p><p>His face was still, his clear blue eyes intent. \u201cI believe master sounds just right...when you say it,\u201d he mused, almost to himself. Then he smiled at her. \u201cVery nice, Gabrielle.\u201d His lips closed over her clit even as he thrust two fingers into her\u2014two\u2014stretching her.</p><p>She gasped at the exquisite blast of sensation.</p><p>One tiny pause and then he sucked strongly on her clit, and his fingers pressed deeper.</p><p>Everything inside her burst. Fireworks of searing pleasure exploded in her core, rocketing upward, outward until it seemed even her hair and fingernails tingled.</p><p>He kept her going, gently but implacably, coaxing the last few shudders from her. Her heart hammered in her ears so loudly she couldn\u2019t hear herself gasping for breath.</p><p>When he sat back on his knees, satisfaction showed in his smile and eyes.</p><p>Dammit, she\u2019d begged. Called him \u201cMaster.\u201d Wasn\u2019t she planning to show him how much of a problem she\u2019d be? Not cave in, for heaven\u2019s sake. He was too good at this stuff. Sneaky lawyer. \u201cLet me go now. You got what you wanted,\u201d she grumped.</p><p>\u201cOh, not even close, little subbie. You\u2019re not even close to convinced yet,\u201d he said, and the feeling of his strong hands gripping her thighs made her jerk. His thumbs pulled her labia apart. He looked and smiled at her. \u201cNice and pink and wet, the way I like it. Now say \u201eI love you, Master\" again.\u201d</p><p>What was this? \u201cDream on. I\u2019m not into the master stuff.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t she think of something nasty to say? Where had her inner brat gone, dammit?</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He unhurriedly unzipped his jeans, and his shaft sprang out. Maybe a little over average thickness, but long\u2014long enough it had given her a few bad moments. With slow movements, he covered himself in a condom, his eyes pinning hers. \u201cI reckon you\u2019ll come to see it my way after we ...discuss...this further.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he pushed inside her, an infinitely wonderful slide of flesh against flesh, filling her...and filling her... She started to squirm against the overly full feeling as the anal plug and his cock fought for space.</p><p>When she whimpered, he slowed but kept advancing, his gaze on her eyes, her mouth, her shoulders. \u201cEasy, sugar. You can take me\u2014and you will.\u201d He stopped when he was embedded deep inside her.</p><p>So full. Tiny spasms sent sparks zipping over her nerves.</p><p>His fingertips grazed over her cheek. \u201cSo pink and flushed,\u201d he murmured, holding her gaze with the sheer power of his. The world shifted sideways, and she shook at the feeling of being possessed, inside and outside. She stared up at him helplessly.</p> <p>His gaze gentled, and he rubbed his cheek against hers. \u201cYes, little sub, today you will give me everything.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, his weight on one arm, and started thrusting in a hard, driving rhythm. He took her mouth, deeply, sweetly, never slackening.</p><p>To her surprise, her own arousal started to climb, and she moaned. How did he do this to her? Would she ever get enough of him?</p><p>As if he felt her response, he pulled back enough to smile down at her. \u201cI love you, Gabrielle,\u201d he murmured, and before she could react, he reached down between them and slid his fingers slickly over and around her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d She hadn\u2019t been ready, but she exploded anyway, her hips bucking against his. The waves this time were less intense but rolled through her over and over until the air itself thickened and she could only arch and ride the pleasure out.</p><p>Eventually her breathing slowed. A fine sweat coated her body, and she tasted salt on her lips. Each beat of her heart pulsed against the plug, against his hard cock.</p><p>He was hard?</p><p>Keeping his groin pressed against hers, he pushed to a kneeling position. \u201cSay \u2018I love you, Master\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>She gave a huff of disgust, feeling as if she\u2019d run a marathon. Her mind had hazed. \u201cI thought we had this discussion.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m yet in the mood to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, he hadn\u2019t gotten off. Her body seemed to be sinking down into the mattress, and he was still hard.</p><p>He pulled his toy bag closer and came out with...dammit, nipple clamps.</p><p>She jerked, pulling at the restraints uselessly, and only succeeded in shoving his cock against the anal plug inside her. Her vagina spasmed again, the surge of pleasure intense enough to make her gasp. Somehow her body didn\u2019t seem like her own anymore.</p><p>He stroked over her nipples and sighed. \u201cI fear you\u2019re all soft now that you\u2019ve come. I\u2019ll have to fix that first.\u201d With a wicked smile, he leaned forward and licked her left nipple, then took it in his mouth and sucked. Gently, and then more powerfully, until she actually felt blood surging into it. Each suck pulled at something in her groin. He let go. \u201cAren\u2019t you pretty now?\u201d He touched a finger to the dark red, firmly bunched peak.</p><p>He rubbed it dry and fastened on a clamp, watching her closely as he tightened it, then tightened it more until the slight bite of pain became a throbbing pressure.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she objected, making his cheek crease with a smile. He flicked her nipple. She yelped, and her insides spasmed around his cock.</p><p>From his chuckle, he\u2019d enjoyed the sensation. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s just right.\u201d He teased her other nipple into hardness and applied the second one. Then, to her dismay, he attached a pea-sized weight to the dangling chains. The weights bounced at her sides, a steady painful pulling against the clamps.</p><p>Her hands tried to reach her breasts, and she groaned with frustration. Her nipples hurt and burned...yet she was getting aroused again, maybe because with every movement the thing in her butt reminded her it was there, and his cock...</p><p>He dropped forward onto his uninjured arm and eased his cock out. In. She moaned at the long, slick slide of him, how he pressed against the anal plug with every thrust. Tingles danced in feather touches over her skin, and blood started pooling low in her belly.</p><p>She stared at the door, at escape\u2014and knew she didn\u2019t want to leave. Ever. She had the feeling of being over a cliff, hanging on with just her fingertips.</p><p>Calloused fingers on her cheek turned her face back to his. He studied her face slowly, making it clear that there was nothing she could hide from him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she whispered. \u201cIs this punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, I don\u2019t think getting a sub off punishes her.\u201d His eyes never lessened in their intensity. \u201cBut it can teach her something.\u201d</p><p>To her shock, he moved faster, and with each slamming thrust, the weights hanging from her nipples swung, pulling painfully. The twinges shot straight to her clit until she desperately needed to come again, and there was no way she possibly could.</p><p>Marcus saw the disbelief in her eyes as her body spiked from arousal into clawing need. With each swing of her nipple clamps, her vagina contracted around him, threatening his control. Before his own demand became critical, he reached between them to her tender little clit, already well on its way to hardness again. He found the firmness under the soft, slick tissue, and he rubbed until the nub stood up\u2014and damn, the feel of it almost sent him over. He stroked harder, faster, knowing she\u2019d need more stimulation this time, after she\u2019d already gotten off twice. Her muscles went taut. She panted, her head rolling back and forth as if she could deny her own body\u2019s response.</p><p>She probably did, he realized. She\u2019d ignore what she needed because the admission would make her feel she was less than perfect. Well, he\u2019d work on that also. For now, he twisted his hand sideways enough to catch her clit between his thumb and fingers and pinched it gently with each thrust. With the rhythm and pressure, her body tightened until she stopped breathing, holding rigidly still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pinnacle. He squeezed a tad harder, and she came with such a scream that he was glad he\u2019d shut the balcony door. She shuddered, and the convulsing of her pussy around his cock almost took him with her.</p><p>He could spend a lifetime fucking her and count himself happy.</p><p>She blinked at him with glazed eyes. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d pushed himself back on his knees to talk. Now he pinched her clit in response to the rudeness. She squeaked, and her vagina spasmed again, making him smile. \u201cDo you want clamps on your clit?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her eyes widened, and if she could have retreated through the wall, she would have. He chuckled and ordered again, \u201cSay \u201eI love you, Master.\"\u201d</p><p>She started to automatically sass, and he moved slightly. Still hard. Her mouth fell open. \u201cYou...\u201d She shut her mouth quickly, obviously realizing his hand rested on her clit. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>Because you need to know that I\u2019ll love you even when you fight me. But telling her wouldn\u2019t do anything. She needed to know it, down at gut level. \u201cSay \u2018I love you, Master.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her mouth shut, her chin in an adorable stubborn set.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re proving to be right difficult.\u201d Which was why he\u2019d saved this for last. He put his hand between her ass cheeks and flipped the control on the butt plug.</p><p>What was he...? The plug in her ass came to life. Gabi already felt stuffed full, and now that thing vibrated inside her, sending every nerve into spasms. \u201cOh no no no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, little brat,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI do enjoy the challenge, Darlin\u2019, and I can see we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun.\u201d His eyes danced with laughter and passion as he leaned forward and took her mouth, hard and possessively.</p><p>He started to move. Everything had already heated up inside her; the vibrations in her back hole shimmered to her vagina and now mixed with the unbelievably erotic slide of his cock. Her hands clenched around the ropes as he sped up, really, really hammering into her, and she realized how much he\u2019d held back before. Each thrust sent the weights on the breast clamps spinning. It felt as if someone was tugging on her nipples, each small jolt merging into the strange, disconcerting vibrations. Sensations rushed through her, tumbling her as if she\u2019d been caught in a raging surf.</p><p>Her vagina tightened. Her thighs tightened. Her whole body tightened.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make her wait. He simply angled his cock differently. With each short, hard stroke, he ground his pelvis against her clit. She soared higher. The edges of her vision blurred, leaving only his blue eyes staring into hers, not releasing her, keeping her with him. Against the rushing in her ears, she heard him drawl, \u201cI love you, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>With a low groan, he pushed in so far she felt him slam into her cervix. His cock jerked as he came and somehow merged with the vibrations in her ass and the pressing of his groin against her clit. Her climax blew over her like a hurricane, sweeping her up and destroying any defenses she had remaining. Pleasure battered her, her body completely at its mercy. At his mercy.</p><p>When he pulled out of her, he set off more spasms, and more again with the removal of the plug. The sharp pain of the clamps being released sent her into another orgasm.</p><p>He had removed the wrist and ankle cuffs before her breathing slowed. Her mind felt full of gauzy clouds, and if someone had asked her to get off the bed, she\u2019d have cursed them. If she could have found her tongue.</p><p>When Marcus lay beside her and took her in his arms, it was the most wonderful feeling she\u2019d ever known. Her body had tumbled away with the surf, but he found her, kept her afloat. \u201cYou look a tad lost, sweetheart,\u201d he said, his amusement so obvious, she wanted to hit him.</p><p>And hold him. And stay there forever.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, and if it sounded a little blurry, he still understood. His arm tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Master. You asshole.\u201d</p><p>With her head on his chest, she heard his laughter rumble upward and burst out, deep and rich, reminding her of the first hint she\u2019d had that he was much, much more than Mr. Perfection. He pressed a kiss to the top of her head, and she gave a sigh of sheer contentment.</p> <p>A second later, his fingers tilted her chin, forcing her to look into intense blue eyes as he said, \u201cI love you, Gabrielle, and you are mine. We will be together, sugar.\u201d His lips curved. \u201cIf your brattiness bothers me, I think you know now that I can\u2014and will\u2014simply fuck it right out of you.\u201d</p><p>His lesson. He\u2019d done all this to push her into defying him\u2014and to show her how much he enjoyed the challenge. The knowledge shook something deep inside her.</p><p>Eyes steady on hers, he waited.</p><p>Oh, she couldn\u2019t hide anything from him, and with the knowledge, she surrendered completely. Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>He caressed her cheek, murmuring, \u201cThere we go. My little brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really do love you.\u201d God, she really, really did. And she wanted everything he\u2019d said\u2014to live with him, to play with him. He loves me \u2013 he likes me. Heart overflowing, she kissed him as sweetly as any master might want.</p><p>With a low laugh, he rolled on top of her and took a kiss that left hers in the dust.</p><p>When he pulled back, he rubbed his cheek against hers. My big cat. \u201cI think there\u2019s a glass of wine calling. And perhaps a balcony with some animals to watch.\u201d The sun lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. \u201cIf you can behave yourself, of course. Otherwise we can stay in here.\u201d</p><p>She glared, then took a breath and said, \u201cI\u2019ll behave,\u201d so sweetly that his eyes narrowed.</p><p>And she would too because if she had another orgasm today, it might just kill her. But tomorrow...</p><p>Where did I put that list of insults? </p> </body></html>"]
